EDA_NEWS_0001	2020-07-01	NEWS	Chief Executive starts ‘tour des capitales’ with visit to France	" Jiří Šedivý, EDA’s Chief Executive, was in Paris today for talks with the French authorities. It was not only his first official visit since he took office in March but also the first of a ‘tour des capitales’ which will see him paying visits to all Member States in the coming months.  Mr Šedivý was received at the French Ministry of Defence where he had meetings with Alice Guitton (Director General for International Relations and Strategy), General François Lecointre (Chief of Defence Staff), Lieutenant General Eric Bellot des Minières (Deputy Chief of Defence Staff for Defence Planning), General Eric Charpentier (Capability Director at the Defence Staff) as well as Thierry Carlier (National Armaments Director and Director for International Relations at the Direction générale de l'armement, DGA). Mr Šedivý also had meetings at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with Philippe Setton (EU Director) and David Bertolotti (Director for Strategic Affairs, Security and Disarmament). “We are at a key moment in the implementation of EU defence initiatives: the PESCO strategic review is underway, the first CARD report will be published in November and important aspects related to the European Defence Fund will have to be decided upon later this year. The challenge is further exacerbated by the ongoing Covid-19 crisis and its potential repercussions on defence planning and spending in our Member States. These difficult circumstances call for more European defence cooperation, more joint planning and more pooling and sharing of resources and capabilities. During my ‘tour des capitales’ in the coming months, I will listen to all our Member States’ specific ideas and suggestions and exchange views on how we can further improve collaborative capability development in Europe and strengthen the Agency’s role in it. My first stop today in Paris was a very good and promising start”, said Mr Šedivý. Director General Alice Guitton stated ""The year 2020 will be a milestone in strengthening European defence. The COVID-19 crisis has shown the need for deeper European cooperation, decreasing our dependencies, and more efficiency in defence spending, and many critical projects must now be completed. EDA’s work will be critical to help the EU Member States identify, prioritize and develop the key capabilities needed to face future crises and to strengthen European strategic autonomy, in a deteriorating security context, including by ensuring the success of the most recent initiatives, such as the EDF programme and PESCO.” "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2020/07/01/chief-executive-starts-tour-des-capitales-with-visit-to-france
EDA_NEWS_0002	2020-07-17	NEWS	Chief Executive opinion editorial: Now, more than ever	 However disruptive the economic and financial impact of Covid-19 might be, it will not not obscure the need for Member States to strengthen Europe’s full spectrum of defence capabilities, and to do it through cooperation. On the contrary: this crisis makes collaborative capability development even more indispensable and urgent, argues Jiří Šedivý, the European Defence Agency’s (EDA) new Chief Executive, in the following opinion editorial. This pandemic is far from over and the full scale of its repercussions still unpredictable. Yet, there are lessons to be learned already now as Europe must adjust to a new post-Covid reality. Defence is no exception. The budgetary shockwave caused by the pandemic may heavily weigh on some Member States’ ability to sustain existing national defence programmes, let alone launch new ones. Which in turn threatens to further curtail Europe’s security and defence clout.  There could be a plus side to the crisis as well, though: some of its effects might help speed up the process towards genuine EU defence cooperation. Looked at from this angle, this emergency offers a unique and unexpected opportunity for making collaborative capability development the new norm in Europe. Rather than weakening national defence forces one by one, the new reality imposed by Covid-19 could advance advance the Europe of Defence as a whole.   Making a virtue of (budgetary) necessity The follow-up costs of the pandemic are likely to squeeze national public spending across the board and for years to come, including spending on defence. What’s more, the fiscal downturn hits at a time when Europe needs to invest more and better in its security and defence. The many good reasons that led the EU and its Member States to raise the Union’s level of ambition on security and defence in 2016 and to work towards European strategic autonomy as a long-term goal, are still valid. To drop or even lower this ambition is not an option, even under today’s exceptional circumstances, as this would seriously undermine Europe’s security role in the world.   How to square this circle? Defence cooperation is the answer. Europe needs more joint defence planning and capability development. The call for Pooling & Sharing of resources and capabilities is not new, but it has become more pressing today. When defence budgets come under pressure, the smartest way for Member States to safeguard or even increase their military resilience is to plan, develop, procure, maintain and operate their defence equipment together. Multinational capability development – be it under PESCO, EDA or any other format involving several EU countries – is more cost-efficient and impactful than national solo efforts done in isolation. Money saved through EU cooperation can compensate for expected cuts in defence spending, at least in the long run. Beyond the financial benefits, cooperation also pays off thanks to increased operational effectiveness and interoperability, for the benefit of EU, NATO or other multinational operations. Joining forces will allow those Member States under budgetary strain to do more, for their own defence and that of Europe.   Tools ready and fit for purpose The other good news is that we don’t have to start from scratch. All instruments and processes needed to enable and manage EU defence cooperation are already in place and ready to be used: updated European Capability Development Priorities, the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD), the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the European Defence Fund (EDF). If Member States don’t use the toolbox’ full potential now, then when will they? The same applies to EDA, the EU hub for collaborative research and capability development which currently hosts more than 110 research and capability programmes as well as some 200 other activities. Here too, Member States still have some leeway available if they want to use EDA’s expertise and potential to the full extent.   Stronger emphasis on CBRN  The Covid-19 pandemic has also brought to light, indirectly of course, the enormous disruptive potential of biological substances. Although Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) threats have been on our radar for some time – the European Capability Development Priorities reviewed in 2018 under EDA guidance explicitly refer to the need to strengthen European capabilities in the CBRN domain – this crisis has nevertheless highlighted the urgent need to do more in order to be better prepared and equipped to deal with these kind of threats in the future. This is another important lesson to be learned from this dramatic experience. Given the magnitude of the challenge, it can only be mastered together, i.e. through cooperation. Another example of why EU defence cooperation matters now more than ever. The same is true for other military assets which proved extremely helpful for our Member States during the most acute phase of the pandemic, such as medical and logistics support or cybersecurity. They, too, must stay high on our priority list for future cooperation.   A fresh look at strategic autonomy Finally, and this is a third lesson, Covid-19 has shown the importance of maintaining strategic local production capacities able to provide critical material of high quality and in sufficient quantities when crises hit – in this case relatively basic commodities such as masks or other protection utilities. This has served as a reminder to all of us, including the defence sector, that European strategic autonomy cannot only refer to high-tech, high-end capabilities but also to basic but indispensable industrial expertise and production capacities. Maintaining critical industrial production capacities in Europe is thus a crucial prerequisite for building a Europe of defence and moving towards strategic autonomy. Here too, cooperation is the way forward as Europe’s key strategic activities can only be sustained together.   Special Report in European Defence Matters.

EDA_NEWS_0004	2020-06-30	NEWS	First MRTT aircraft delivered to Eindhoven	 Preparations for the Multinational Multirole Tanker and Transport Fleet (MMF), aimed to increase Air-to-Air Refuelling capabilities in Europe, reached a significant milestone today when the first Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft was delivered to the fleet’s main operating base in Eindhoven.  In total, the fleet could count up to 11 Airbus A330 MRTT aircraft of which eight have already been procured. While the first of them (MMF1) has now been delivered, the consecutive aircraft (2 to 8) will be delivered in the coming years: a brand new MRTT will be delivered roughly every six months to either Eindhoven (The Netherlands) as the ‘Main Operating Base’ or to Cologne (Germany) as the ‘Forward Operating Base Plus’.   Six participating countries so far  The MMF, managed by the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) with strong support of the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR) under the ownership of NATO and operated by an international unit, will provide its six participating Member States (Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway and the Netherlands) with strategic tanker and transport capabilities.  Based on a pooling and sharing concept, the participating countries will have access to a total of 8 (and in the future perhaps to 11) Airbus A-330 MRTT aircraft which can provide strategic transport (pax and cargo), air-to-air refuelling and medical evacuation capabilities.    Example of excellent EU/NATO cooperation  The multinational fleet builds on the excellent cooperation between NATO and EU Member States and Agencies since the very beginning of the project. Back in 2011, the European Defence Agency started an initiative to address the long-standing European shortfall in the air-to-air refuelling capacity. Since then, this initiative has grown into a mature programme handed over to and managed by the NSPA on behalf of the participating countries and supported by OCCAR for the acquisition phase.  The MMF programme stands as an example on how European countries can cooperate, pooling and sharing resources to get access to state of the art capabilities that would be difficult or impossible to access individually. All the countries involved, independently of their size and the number of flying hours, have access to the MMF capabilities.  EDA’s Chief Executive Jiří Šedivý said: “The Multinational Multirole Tanker and Transport Fleet is a prime example of European defence cooperation done in close coordination with NATO, which shows that once a capability shortfall has been jointly identified, European nations can pull together, work on a common project aimed at filling the gap, and eventually deliver – as they do with today’s delivery of the first aircraft. It’s Pooling & Sharing at its best. The European Defence Agency stands ready to assist additional Member States which are in need of AAR capabilities to explore their potential participation in this important project”.  NATO Assistant Secretary General for Defence Investment, Camille Grand, said: “The MRTT fleet’s versatility in providing several critical capabilities simultaneously is nothing short of impressive. The aircraft can help respond to crises such as the COVID-19 emergency, by moving medical supplies and conducting medical evacuations. However, the fleet will probably have the most profound impact within the air-to-air refuelling mission, an area where historically many European Allies have lacked capacity. Therefore, the MRTT fleet will help contribute to a fairer transatlantic burden-sharing at NATO. It is also a successful pilot multilateral cooperation project, bringing together a number of Allies and multiple NATO and EU institutions and agencies in support of the delivery of a major capability”.    Background  The Netherlands and Luxembourg initially launched the programme in July 2016, with the first one as the lead nation of the project. Germany and Norway joined in 2017, Belgium followed in early 2018 and Czech Republic lastly joined the MMF programme in October 2019.  The MMF aircraft will be operated by the Multinational Multirole Tanker Transport Unit (MMU) comprising of military personnel of the participating countries. The unit is based in two permanent operating bases, the Main Operating Base in Eindhoven and the Forward Operating Base in Cologne-Wahn. Among the eight MMF aircraft, five will be based in Eindhoven, and three in Cologne.    More information:  Related NATO web story (30 June 2020) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2020/06/30/first-mrtt-aircraft-delivered-to-eindhoven
EDA_NEWS_0005	2020-07-29	NEWS	Multinational Helicopter Training Centre (MHTC) sets course for Sintra	" Having to let go of something close, doesn’t need to have a sense of loss. When the European Defence Agency (EDA) sees its home-grown Helicopter Exercise Programme, its Helicopter Tactics Course and its Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course move to the new permanent Multinational Helicopter Training Centre (MHTC) in Portugal by the end of 2022, after many successful years at EDA, it does so with a feeling of ‘mission accomplished’.   This article as well as the following interview with João Gomes Cravinho, the Defence Minister of Portugal, have first been published in EDA's 'European Defence Matters' magazine N° 19 published in June 2020.  It is a basic principle underlying all training activities run by EDA: as soon as a programme reaches a sustainable level of support, maturity and output, the aim becomes to transfer it to a permanent facility hosted and managed by one of Member States involved. For the Agency’s ambition is not to become a permanent training institute but to serve as a catalyst and facilitator for collaborative training activities which later on will be taken care of by a Member State or an organisation – allowing the Agency to free resources and engage in other training projects.   The move in June 2017 of EDA’s European Air Transport Fleet training programme to the new permanent European Tactical Airlift Centre (ETAC) in Zaragoza/Spain, after six years of busy activities at EDA – 87 aircrews trained, 50 tactical instructor pilots graduate, 94 European transport aircraft involved – stands out as a shining example of this policy.   It will be followed soon by the Agency’s three multinational rotary-wing training programmes: the Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP), the Helicopter Tactics Course (HTC) and the Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC). Launched in 2009 and supported by 15 countries (Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Finland, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Slovenia, Norway as well as the United Kingdom – up till Brexit), this trio has since become one of EDA’s most dynamic and successful training activities, highly appreciated in Europe’s rotary wing community.   By the end of 2022, their new home will be Sintra/Portugal: that’s what the Agency’s Steering Board decided in August 2019 when it green-lit the setting-up of a new Multinational Helicopter Training Centre (MHTC).    A new permanent home  The objective is to make this MHTC a permanent European centre of excellence for advanced helicopter training. It will deliver administrative and training functions to serve both as a central hub for the coordination of helicopter training across Europe, but also as the provider of the next iteration of the HEP, HTC and HTIC programmes currently run by the Agency.    The centre is expected to reach initial operational capability (IOC) by the end of 2022, although the Covid-19 crisis impact may alter this date, and it is estimated it will operate for a period of 15 years, which can be extended to 30 years following the agreement of its contributing Member States.  The next major milestone in the preparation is the harmonisation of the MHTC Technical Agreement, expected by the beginning of 2021, and the build-up of the infrastructures in Sintra which should be finished before the IOC MHTC.    Gradual hand-over starting this summer  The move to Sintra will be gradual, starting soon – this summer with the transfer of EDA’s helicopter training centre from its traditional location, RAF airbase Linton-on-Ouse in the United Kingdom (in the process of being dismantled), to Sintra Air Force airbase which will already be operational, on a provisional basis, between mid-2020 and the end of 2022 when it will fully take over its new MHTC role. The full set of training equipment will be moved from Linton-on-Ouse to Sintra, except the helicopter simulator which is being replaced with a new one.      ""An opportunity to strengthen European cooperation""  Portugal is actively preparing to host the MHTC which it considers a priority and “strategic investment”, says the country’s Minister of Defence, João Gomes Cravinho, in an exclusive interview with European Defence Matters.    How are preparations going for the transition of the current EDA helicopter programmes to Sintra in 2020 and for the creation of the MHTC in 2022?  Currently, and until 2023, EDA helicopter programmes will take place in Sintra as part of a transition process for MHTC while ensuring the continuity of all EDA helicopter training. Portugal has received the helicopter simulator formerly based in the UK and will provide support for academic and simulator courses in existing infrastructures, specially adapted for that purpose, while the MHTC project is under development. Since November, multiple site surveys have been made in Sintra to check the current infrastructures. The flight simulator hardware is already in Portugal, waiting for INZPIRE representatives to be able to travel to Portugal and start the required assembly as soon as possible. Of course, we and all the other countries involved in the Agency’s helicopter training have also been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic which has required partial and full lockdowns, including in Portugal. This resulted in the cancellation of two courses, planned for May and June 2020. Nevertheless, Portugal has been actively engaged with EDA and Member States to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 in the helicopter programmes. In close coordination with Member States a contingency plan has been agreed that should allow these courses to take place in the future.     What makes Sintra the perfect site for it?  Sintra is being turned into the rotary wing hub of the Portuguese Air Force that is expected to be fully operational by 2023. We hope this will provide relevant synergies, and this is in itself proof that we believe Sintra is indeed a great location for this type of infrastructure. There are large modular spaces adapted to the needs of a structure like this. The accommodation, the courses and the simulator area will, of course, be in accordance with EDA’s requirements and will all be within easy walking distance of catering and leisure spaces. Additionally, because there is more to life than work, the air base is very close to the historic town of Sintra, to Lisbon and to the beaches of Cascais, meaning there is no lack of opportunities for leisure or physical exercise in the vicinity.    How big an effort (infrastructure, staff, budget, etc.) is this for Portugal to become the host nation of this important training activity?  The Portuguese government is committed to a responsible management of the State budget, but we are also committed to strategic investments. We see the MHTC project as an opportunity to strengthen European cooperation in addressing a key operational capability that has often been found lacking and is vital to provide support to ongoing and future CSDP missions. Once Full Operational Capability is achieved, Portugal has committed, through the Portuguese Air Force, to support not only the infrastructure exclusively dedicated to the MHTC academic and simulator courses, but also all student logistical support (lodging, meals). Regarding staff, the MHTC will have ten permanent positions, plus temporary personnel responsible for the academic and simulator courses. In principle, the Portuguese Air Force will be responsible for about 50% of these permanent posts, with full time dedicated personnel. We are currently assessing the best options for hosting our foreign partners involved in permanent posts in the MHTC. In conclusion, this is a significant effort, but we see it as a priority, as a strategic investment.    How will this influence Portugal’s own involvement in EDA’s helicopter programme where it currently participates in the Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP) and the Helicopter Tactics Course (HTC). Any plan to join the Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC)?  The involvement of the Portuguese Air Force in EDA’s helicopter programmes (HEP and HTC) has been very successful in developing and consolidating rotary wing operational capabilities. Portugal is currently not involved in the HTIC, but this is an interesting programme and will be considered in future discussions regarding available investment in this area.     Portugal is a very regular host of the BLADE multinational helicopter exercises, at least during the 2012-2022 period. Will you remain central and host of this exercise even beyond 2022?  We are working on it. As you know, we are the organiser of the BLADE exercise in 2021. And Portugal in fact holds the record as the host country for BLADE exercises. I believe this is the result of Portugal’s ability to organise these exercises effectively, as well as the fact that it has, in relative terms, a very flexible airspace and ideal meteorological conditions. Portugal has made clear its availability for hosting the BLADE helicopter exercises in 2024, 2027 and 2030. Now it is up to EDA and the other Member States to decide, but Portugal is very committed to continuing to invest in cooperation with its European allies and partners in this vital operational capability.        "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2020/07/29/multinational-helicopter-training-centre-(mhtc)-sets-course-for-sintra
EDA_NEWS_0006	2020-06-16	NEWS	Defence Ministers focus on sustaining EU capability development	 The European Defence Agency’s (EDA) Steering Board in the composition of Defence Ministers discussed today how to sustain EU capability development in times of disruptive challenges. Defence Ministers pointed to the need for more collaborative projects, efficiency gains and economies of scale as the most effective way of navigating the current crisis while ensuring that Europe’s armed forced are ready for the future.  In addressing an ever more dynamic security environment, including the impact of COVID-19, Ministers underscored the need for even more multinational cooperation in capability planning and development to overcome an unprecedented and diverse set of challenges. Ministers agreed that the EU defence initiatives advanced since 2016 need to be implemented with more decisiveness than ever before. They stressed the importance of delivering on the binding commitments under PESCO, implementing the EU Capability Development priorities, based on a fully-fledged defence review (CARD), and making full use of the European Defence Fund (EDF) as a powerful incentive at the EU level. Ministers also discussed how to better ensure that Europe has highly resilient and responsive armed forces, which are able to prevent, detect and respond to multiple threats and scenarios. The meeting, held via videoconference, was chaired for the first time by Head of the Agency, Josep Borrell. It was also the first opportunity for recently appointed EDA Chief Executive, Jiří Šedivý, to address the EDA Steering Board comprising the Ministers of Defence of the Agency’s 26 Member States. Head of the European Defence Agency, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission, Josep Borrell said: “Whether we are prepared or not to respond to today’s security threats depends on our ability to pull together our resources and act. Today, more than ever, it is crucial to spend better together, rationalise, strengthen our capabilities and deploy effectively to address crises and promote stability. The EU defence initiatives are in place, but to realise their full potential they must be fully integrated into Member States national defence policies and planning processes.” EDA Chief Executive,Jiří Šedivý, said: “The key priority for European defence will be staying the course and maintaining the EU’s level of ambition on defence, especially now, facing up to unprecedented challenges, including COVID-19. Europe has spent the last few years developing a comprehensive toolbox with the new EU defence initiatives. These tools are now to be put to work to enable deeper cooperation. EDA, as the hub for EU defence cooperation, is there to serve as the preferred platform for Member States defence cooperation”.   Full use of EDA's potential Ministers also looked into how the Agency can speed up the process of project generation and implementation at European level, and how it can best support more Member States in cooperative projects and programmes so that these become operational in a timely manner. EDA will examine how to further improve its service to Member States especially in terms of enabling processes and procedures, capability development, training, joint procurement, as well as R&T and innovation.   Next steps: CARD Report The next EDA ministerial Steering Board will take place in November, when the first CARD (Coordinated Annual Review on Defence) Report will be presented. CARD provides an overview that will allow Member States to better coordinate their defence planning and spending and engage in collaborative projects, improving consistency in Member States defence spending and overall coherence of the European capability landscape. The report will act as a pathfinder to inform future investment decisions on the most promising, most needed and most pressing opportunities for multinational cooperation.     EDA press contacts: Elisabeth SCHOEFFMANN Head of Media & Communication elisabeth.schoeffmann@eda.europa.eu T+32 470 87 01 65 Paul QUINN Media & Communications Officer paul.quinn@eda.europa.eu T+32 2 504 28 24              	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2020/06/16/defence-ministers-focus-on-sustaining-eu-capability-development
EDA_NEWS_0007	2020-06-12	NEWS	EDA work on MALE-type RPAS Air Traffic Integration backed by French test flight	" EDA’s groundwork to help Member States move towards the integration of MALE-type Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) in civil air traffic in non-segregated airspace received a significant boost recently when a live MALE RPAS flight test carried out by the French Air Force (FAF) contributed to paving the way for the validation of the risk analysis previously done in an Agency study carried out in 2018/19 as well as the EDA and EASA guidelines.  To date, the conclusions of EDA’s study on the ‘Accommodation of MALE-type RPAS: scenarios and safety case’, delivered in February 2019, had only been tested through simulations but never under real flight conditions. On 19 May 2020, the French Air Force flew a REAPER RPAS, based in the military airbase of Cognac, in civil air traffic beyond segregated airspace. During this over three-hour flight, several hand-overs were carried out between civilian air traffic control centers in Bordeaux and Marseille. Portions of the cruise were carried out in upper airspace, up to FL 230. The RPAS had no specific onboard equipment such as a detect and avoid system.  The result was a genuine success, as General Reutter, the Director of the French Military Authority, confirmed afterwards in a press statement: ""With this operational exercise, we can confirm risk analysis under the auspice of the European Defence Agency. We are proud that these results can feed the Guidelines for Accommodations from the EDA and EASA. They will participate in the current working on the part 'Certified' of the ongoing civil drone European regulation and should facilitate the implementation of the European MALE program”. The full press release is available here.     Accomodation Study  EDA’s study was ordered in 2018 as part of the Agency’s effort to support Member States in the area of MALE-type RPAS air traffic integration. The study conclusions published in February 2019 provided tailored risk assessments and an enhanced aviation safety case assessment methodology for MALE-type RPAS flying in non-segregated European airspace, alongside manned aviation. Following the presentation of those simulations results, France offered the possibility to perform real flights with a MALE-type RPAS (the FAF Reapers), including a cross-border portion. The successful results of the French test flight will now feed the guidelines for accommodation developed by EDA and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and will be used for the ongoing work on the ‘Certified’ part of the European civil drone regulation.  This year, there will be additional cross-borders flights performed by FAF Reapers in the framework of the EDA Accommodation Validation study.  "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2020/06/12/eda-work-on-male-type-rpas-air-traffic-integration-backed-by-french-test-flight

EDA_NEWS_0009	2020-06-04	NEWS	EDA to assess impact of EU chemical/waste regulations on defence	 EDA has just launched a new study to evaluate the impact EU regulations on chemicals and waste might have on the wider defence sector. The results are expected to be available by the end of this year.  The study does not cover the REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) nor the CLP (Classification, Labelling and Packaging) regulations which have already been assessed in an EDA study in 2016 and whose effects on defence equipment have proven to be significant - from design and manufacturing to in-service use, maintenance and disposal.  In the new study, due to be delivered in December, the focus will be on other EU regulations related to chemicals which may also have an impact on European defence capabilities, such as: Biocidal Products (BPR) Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP) Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) Greenhouse Gases (F-GAS) Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS).  The study will also look into potential repercussions on defence of the recently revised EU Waste Framework Directive (WFD), and specifically its provision under Article 9 on providing information to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) database on Substances of Concern in articles as such or In complex Products (SCIP), as from 5 January 2021.  The study will be carried out by a consortium encompassing Milieu Consulting SPRL (consortium leader) and REACHLAW Oy.   Objectives  The aim of the study is to provide detailed information on the impact of those EU legislations on the defence sector and to propose recommendations on how defence stakeholders (Ministries of Defence, Armed Forces, defence industry) could deal with them in a more coherent way.  As part of the study, the contractor will be conducting consultations with a range of relevant stakeholders, such as the European Commission, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), Member States’ MoDs, Member States’ competent authorities as well as defence industry stakeholders, including the AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD) as well as National Defence Industry Associations (NDIAs).   More information: REACH (EDA project page)   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2020/06/04/eda-to-assess-impact-of-eu-chemical-waste-regulations-on-defence
EDA_NEWS_0010	2020-05-27	NEWS	EDA project aims for multifunctional smart textiles for defence	 Smart textiles are a new generation of innovative material offering very interesting multifunctional properties such as being integrable into uniforms and platforms. They therefore have drawn the attention of the defence sector.    Against this backdrop, EDA has incorporated smart textiles into the so-called Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) of its capability technology group (’CapTech’) devoted to Materials & Structures, and a specific Technology Building Block (TBB) was set up for them. Furthermore, other EDA CapTechs, such as those dealing with CBRN, Human Factors and Ground Systems, have taken initiatives related to smart textiles.     STILE project  In January 2019, EDA launched a project on “Smart TextILEs in defence: looking at the soldiers of the future” with two participating Member States, Spain and Portugal. The practical implementation of this project, called STILE, was assigned to a consortium led by the Spanish research institute AITEX, in collaboration with two Portuguese organisations, CITEVE and INEGI.  The objective of STILE is to lay the foundation for a future ‘European Multifunctional Smart Textile’ for defence able to respond to a certain number of requirements in terms of functionality, integration, comfort and weight. More precisely, it was aimed to define a roadmap for developing a system offering several functionalities in a textile substrate, and to come up with a proof of concept that integrates various functionalities with state-of-the-art technologies.   Preliminary results   The initial analysis undertaken under the project confirmed that Europe lacks multifunctional smart textile capabilities in defence. Hence the importance for the STILE project to produce a proof of concept of multifunctional smart textiles able to integrate in a single model all the afore-mentioned features and requirements.   Preliminary results of the project give already an overview of the current R&T development and technology needs as well as the challenges laying ahead to overcome those needs. The methodology used was based on the technical knowledge of the consortium members and the collection of data coming from multiple sources, including a technology foresight workshop on smart textile technologies organised at EDA, a survey done among the Agency’s ‘Materials’ CapTech experts as well as various meetings with experts.   Roadmap  A medium to long-term technology roadmap was established with a set of actions required to develop an innovative smart textile for future defence applications, including the incorporation of modern design and development methodology by the textile industry. For this purpose, two simulation models were developed to evaluate the main concepts regarding the thermal protection capacity of the garment and the thermal signature under different ambient conditions.     Proof of concept  As a first step of the roadmap, a multifunctional smart textile prototype - the first of this type and quality in Europe - was produced with the following functions (each of them tested):   signature management: the textile has multispectral camouflage in both static and moving positions  CBR threats monitoring: the smart textile detects the presence of hazardous agents (e.g. H2S, NO2, Cl2) and provides warning to the soldier  improved mobility, using various textile structures as well as seamless technology in body mapping concept  flame retardancy, water and dirt repellence and anti-mosquito solutions  physiological monitoring: the smart textile measures the heart rate and provide info to the soldier  temperature regulation (cooling and heating): the smart textile is able to control the body temperature through monitoring of the ambient temperature  communication: the smart textile provides all parameters, such as the heart rate, to the soldier via an app in the smartphone, embedded in the system. In addition, the data can be transferred to the operating centre, if needed.    Testing in the field  From June 2020 onwards, the STILE prototype will be further tested in the field to make sure that it fulfills the stringent military requirements. At the end of the project (expected in May 2021) an exhibition centre will be organized to reveal the fully tested STILE model to the European defence and dual use community, reaching out the potential users in the European Ministries of Defence.  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2020/05/27/eda-project-aims-for-multifunctional-smart-textiles-for-defence
EDA_NEWS_0011	2020-04-16	NEWS	EDA to support DIVEPACK PESCO project	 The European Defence Agency's Steering Board has approved the launch of a specific EDA ad hoc project which will contribute to  the implementation of a Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) project aimed at developing a Deployable Modular Underwater Intervention Capability Package (DIVEPACK). Bulgaria, which leads a group of three PESCO participating countries involved in DIVEPACK (together with France and Greece), had formally requested the Agency’s support for moving this ambitious project forward.   The DIVEPACK project, part of the second batch of PESCO projects approved in November 2018, aims at developing an interoperable specialised modular asset called “DIVEPACK Unit”. The Unit will provide a comprehensive capability package (both as materiel and expertise) enabling a tailored response to the full spectrum of defensive (non-Special Operations Forces, SOF) underwater divers’ interventions, in expeditionary setting, both at sea and in inland bodies of water, in support of EU missions. It will focus on human centric integration of a wide range of diving and Unmanned Underwater Vehicles materiel, operated by qualified personnel, in a comprehensive capability package.   The capability will be based on an open plug-and-play architecture which will facilitate the versatility of response in the framework of EU CSDP operations and will provide a quick reaction capability, applicable to a broad range of underwater scenarios, both at sea and in inland bodies of water, except for special forces missions.     Launch support   EDA’s specific Category B project will serve as a preparation phase for the DIVEPACK PESCO project and deal with harmonisation of requirements, in particular the development and endorsement of the Common Staff Targets (CST), Common Staff Requirements (CSR), the Business Case (BC) and other relevant documents necessary to allow for a smooth acquisition phase afterwards. EDA will thus act as a facilitator and manager of the launch phase of the project.   EDA’s Acting Chief Executive Olli Ruutu said: “EDA is delighted to take this ambitious and innovative PESCO project forward and to support its Member States. As the European hub for collaborative capability development, the Agency has the required expertise to help Member States in the implementation of their PESCO projects. The development of underwater control capabilities which contribute to resilience at sea and are based on new technologies such as unmanned systems, is one of the European Capability Development Priorities agreed in 2018. The DIVEPACK project will contribute to this priority”.   Bulgaria's Deputy Defence Minister Atanas Zapryanov said: “The DIVEPACK is the first joint project in the PESCO context coordinated by Bulgaria, which makes us proud and also ambitious. Its core purpose is to build up a range of specific defence capabilities, which will be fully aligned with the European Capability Development Priorities. The DIVEPACK units will be capable of executing versatility of underwater missions and tasks as part of EU CSDP and NATO operations. The first phase of DIVEPACK will be implemented within EDA’s  framework as a Cat B project and we believe that the Agency’s competences and experience in facilitating collaborative defence initiatives will provide indispensable support for the successful completion of the project. In pursuing coherence on EU level, we intend to submit a part of the DIVEPACK activities for funding under the Commission’s European Defence Industrial Development Programme (EDIDP).”   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2020/04/16/eda-to-support-divepack-pesco-project
EDA_NEWS_0012	2020-05-15	NEWS	New project (SPICE) to improve military sensor performance	 EDA’s Steering Board has given its green light for the launch of a new project designed to improve the receiver performance of electronic radio frequency (RF) sensors used in military platforms in adverse and heavily contested environments. Dubbed SPICE (‘Superior Performance in Contested Environments’), the project builds on the successful work already accomplished at the Agency in the same critical domain.  At this stage, the Netherlands and Sweden are participating in this new project which is however open to all Member States. It aims to further develop the excellent results of two previous EDA ad hoc projects on Switched Applications (SWAP) and Switched Applications-Complementary (SWAP-C), local RF power generation and amplification based on switched technology. These projects were focused on narrow band transceivers to improve the performance of radars for naval applications and on wideband transceivers for electronic warfare for combat aircraft. Both of them demonstrated the superior performance of gallium-Nitride (GaN) technology for the transmit path compared to other technologies previously used.   Improving the receivers Over the next 36 months, SPICE will take this work forward with the aim of improving the performance of the receive channel of the transceiver (dynamic range, linearity, efficiency etc.). This is done in an integral approach over the complete RF chain, while taking into account additional requirements such as cost and other system-imposed constraints (including cooling). The work will start with investigating, defining and specifying concepts with which the linearity and performance of receivers can be achieved. This also includes an assessment of all the technologies currently available.  As part of an exploration and experimentation phase, the consortium will work on wideband receivers, narrowband receivers and packaging and integration technologies. The consortium involved in the afore-mentioned projects remains the same, contributing to increase the expertise of the European defence industry and create a stable supply chain around key European players.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2020/05/15/new-project-(spice)-to-improve-military-sensor-performance
EDA_NEWS_0013	2020-04-23	NEWS	New R&T project to improve resilience of cold weather operations	 EDA’s Steering Board has green-lit the launch of a new research project aimed at studying ways and means of improving the operational outfit and equipment of Armed Forces operating in extreme cold and icy weather conditions.   Picture : Austrian Armed Forces Military missions and operations in cold climate are particularly challenging as they demand from the troops a great deal of physical, operational and mental resilience. Experience from exercises in extreme cold has shown that a considerable number of the soldiers suffer from cold weather injuries (e.g. frostbite, hypothermia, chilblains, immersion foot) and negative energy balance which can highly compromise their performances. An in-depth knowledge of the risk factors for developing cold-related injuries and their impact on the troops’ safety and effectiveness is thus critical to sustain operations in the north.   Against this backdrop, EDA has just launched a new R&T project to study this problem in greater detail to ascertain consequences and possible countermoves. Under the lead of the Netherlands, three more countries are participating: France, Sweden and Norway (the latter is no formal EDA Member State but has concluded an Administrative Agreement with the Agency). The overall objective is to contribute to improving the European capability of operating in arctic/cold environments by developing tools to reduce the risk of soldiers developing cold-weather-related injuries and enhance war fighter performance.   The project has a duration of three to four years.   New territory It is the first R&T project in EDA to study Cold Weather Operations on a European level. It will be important to identify the standards and procedures are currently being applied in the various Member States. The project will therefore identify national variations in the regulations and threshold values for body temperature, safe working duration and respective garment requirements and develop an interpretation guide to translate the generic advice of the main existing standard in this field, ISO-11079, and its extension to national clothing & equipment items. It will also review and measure individual variation in thermal stress response and nutritional demands in cold environments. Finally, the intention is also to identify the added value of wearable sensor technologies for improved personalised advice.   The Cold Weather Operations project is one of several R&T activities under the CapTech CBRN and Human Factors.    More information: EDA project page: CapTech CBRN and Human Factors 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2020/04/23/new-r-t-project-to-improve-resilience-of-cold-weather-operations

EDA_NEWS_0023	2020-02-27	NEWS	New project to improve biological detection, identification & monitoring equipment	 A new phase in EDA’s testing and evaluation project of biological detection, identification and monitoring (DIM) equipment was launched on 26 February at a kick-off meeting at the Agency. Dubbed ‘T&E Bio DIM Phase 2’ (2020-2023) the project aims to deliver improved testing and evaluation capabilities to ensure the performance of biological DIM systems at the development and procurement stage. It follows up to the project’s first phase which prepared the ground and set the framework for further action in this domain.    Five EDA Member States (Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands) as well as Norway (which has signed an Administrative Agreement with the Agency) are participating in T&E Bio DIM Phase 2. Detection, identification and monitoring of biological material are critical to enhancing situational awareness in a timely manner, supporting decisions, and enabling military commanders to take the most appropriate decisions in a recognized chemical and biological environment. Despite the importance of biological DIM, Europe still lacks coordination and harmonisation of the technical requirements for Member States’ test and evaluation (T&E) equipment. This makes it difficult to compare and exchange T&E results both within and between European countries as well as NATO members. It also causes duplication of effort and reduces the cost-effectiveness of both national and international military and civilian T&E efforts, e.g. by limiting the burden-sharing and cost-reduction potential that could have been realised.  In Phase 1 of the project, a general framework (in the form of a set of commonly defined requirements and criteria) was developed for T&E of biological DIM equipment. Based on this framework, Phase 2 is set to deliver improved testing and evaluation capabilities.   T&E Bio DIM Phase2 kick-off meeting at EDA on 26 February 2020   European Bio Defence Laboratory Network  Moreover, another related EDA project is under preparation, the European Bio Defence Laboratory Network (EBLN Phase II), which will aim to strengthen EU preparedness by establishing a fully characterised collection of biological agents and a closely collaborating laboratory network at EU level in order to rapidly identify biothreat agents. Participating Member States in EBLN II are Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden. The two projects are part of EDA’s long term research efforts to enhance Member States’ bio defence capabilities and thereby, improve Europe’s overall ability to respond to emerging biological threats.  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2020/02/27/new-project-to-improve-biological-detection-identification-monitoring-equipment

EDA_NEWS_0029	2020-02-19	NEWS	Second Staff Exchange between EU Cybersecurity Organisations	 Experts met in Brussels to intensify co-ordination against cyber threats and staff-to-staff relations. After a successful first edition at Europol in June 2019, the second iteration of the Staff Exchange initiative between the four Parties to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) – the European Defence Agency (EDA), CERT-EU, the EU Cybersecurity Agency (ENISA) and Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), took place from 17 to 20 February 2020.  As part of the MoU partners’ Roadmap 2020-2021, this programme seeks to promote a better mutual understanding of respective priorities, practices and to deepen the working relationships across the respective organisations. Hosted jointly by EDA and CERT-EU in Brussels, the experts focused on strategic developments in cyber defence, trained in threat hunting and met with industry representatives.  Olli Ruutu, EDA Chief Executive (ad interim), said: “The staff exchange is an excellent opportunity to share views and knowledge and further improve our common understanding of the work done by our respective entities. It is also a special moment for thinking outside the box with like-minded colleagues. There is a lot to be taken away from these Staff Exchanges which fully reflect the collaborative spirit of the Memorandum of Understanding we concluded in May 2018 to leverage synergies between our four organisations and promoting cooperation on cyber security and cyber defence.” Saâd Kadhi, the Head of CERT-EU, said: “This second Staff Exchange builds on the achievements of the one before. It will continue to improve the mutual understanding and cooperation between our organisations, ultimately leading to better collective cyber defence.” Juhan Lepassaar, ENISA’s Executive Director, said: “The EU Cybersecurity Agency welcomes the Staff Exchange initiative hosted by EDA and CERT-EU and sees this as a fruitful, knowledge-sharing exercise that fosters increased collaboration between the signatories.” Fernando Ruiz, Acting Head of Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre said: “The close cooperation and knowledge sharing between our entities contribute to building a robust European cyber defence. This Staff Exchange initiative, hosted by the European Defence Agency and CERT-EU, will strengthen the capabilities of our experts to effectively tackle the cyber threat and protect EU citizens, businesses and organisations.”   More information: Four EU cybersecurity organisations enhance cooperation (EDA webnews) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2020/02/19/second-staff-exchange-between-eu-cybersecurity-organisations
EDA_NEWS_0030	2020-02-21	NEWS	Maximising EU defence tools’ impact on national planning	 The EU’s defence tools - Capability Development Plan (CDP), Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD), Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), European Defence Fund (EDF) - will only have the desired effect on enhancing the coherence of Europe’s defence landscape and boosting European defence cooperation if they are fully embedded and used by Member States in their national defence planning.  This was the core message conveyed today in Brussels at a seminar co-organised by EDA and the Croatian EU Presidency.  The objective of the event, which took place in the Agency’s premises, was to exchange views among government representatives on how to practically embed the EU defence initiatives into national defence planning processes and thereby maximise their benefits in support of Member States’ efforts. It was the first time senior national defence planners met to discuss the conceptual and practical implications of the new EU defence initiatives on national defence planning processes and practices. In his opening statement, EDA’s acting Chief Executive Olli Ruutu said the implementation process of the initiatives was now at a key moment. “CARD is more than halfway through its first full cycle with a final report to be presented to Defence Ministers in November this year. PESCO is moving ahead with the third batch of projects approved and a strategic review also scheduled  towards the end of this year. Preparations for the EDF are entering a decisive phase. Hence, this is the right moment for a check-up of what has been achieved so far and to listen to Member States’ views in order to maximise the benefits for them. Member States’ ownership through embedding the EU defence tools into their national defence planning processes is crucial for their success”, stated Mr Ruutu. Representing the Croatian EU Presidency, Dunja Bujan, the acting Defence Policy Director at the Croatian Ministry of Defence, stressed the need to increase the coherence between the EU defence initiatives and national defence planning. “In the foreseeable future, we will continue to pull our strength and ability to act from national armed forces and budgets. No EU defence initiative will be able to compensate that. If we want the EU defence initiatives to succeed, we need to keep them in line with this reality” and thus embed them into national planning. “The sooner we start to do that, the greater will be the chance to avoid any potential future discrepancies”, she stated.   Panel discussions The keynote speeches were followed by two panel discussions. The first featured Major General Eric Charpentier (France’s National Capability Director), Rear Admiral Juha Vauhkonen (Finland’s military representative to EU/NATO), Lieutenant General Jaromir Zuna (Czech First Deputy Chief of General Staff) and Colonel Jorge Farre (Head of EU Department in Spain’s MoD). It mainly focused on the questions of whether the initiatives have already impacted national defence planning and to what extent the wider EU perspective is being taken into account in Member States’ decision-making. The second panel looked at practical steps towards improving the implementation and usage of the tools in national processes. This panel was composed by Major General Jorge Côrte-Real Andrade (National R&T Director and Deputy Director of the Directorate-general of National Defence Resources at the Portuguese MoD),  Brigadier General Ludy Schmidt (Deputy Capability Director at the Dutch Ministry of Defence) and Colonel Markus Kohlweg (Head of Unit, Multinational Defence Planning, at the Austrian MoD).  Seminar co-organised by EDA and the Croatian EU Presidency  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2020/02/21/maximising-eu-defence-tools-impact-on-national-planning
EDA_NEWS_0031	2019-12-10	NEWS	OCCAR Director at EDA to discuss cooperation and bilateral roadmap	 OCCAR Director Matteo Bisceglia today visited EDA to discuss with Chief Executive Jorge Domecq bilateral cooperation and programmes of relevance to both organisations.   EDA-OCCAR cooperation has deepened significantly since the signature of an Administrative Arrangement in 2012. As privileged partners in the field of defence capabilities development, EDA and OCCAR share information on projects and programmes of common interest throughout their lifecycle, helping to guarantee a seamless handover in each case, with both parties remaining involved and informed at every stage.   Today was the second meeting between Mr Bisceglia and Mr Domecq, their discussions mainly focused on the state of play of bilateral cooperation to support key programmes and activities, including the Multi-Role Tanker Transport Fleet (MMF), MALE RPAS and ESSOR. Mr Domecq outlined EDA’s latest developments in these projects, notably the recent high-level coordination mechanism for RPAS ATI held at EDA and updates from the European Secure Software Defined Radio (ESSOR) workshops.   “I believe that EDA and OCCAR cooperation avoids duplication in the European armament field. We have to take stock and make use of the available resources, and OCCAR has 20 years of proven record in the successful delivery of complex armament programmes.  I am also convinced that together EDA and OCCAR, in line with our own complementary responsibilities, represent a real strong tool to launch and execute all sorts of programmes for the benefit of the European Nations”, Mr Bisceglia said.    Mr Bisceglia and Mr Domecq also discussed EDA-OCCAR interaction in areas such as REACH and the Military Airworthiness Authorities Forum.      “EDA and OCCAR are two important actors in European defence cooperation, our close relationship has been extremely positive for our organisations, programmes and defence cooperation in general, which have all benefited from each other’s expertise”, Mr Domecq commented.  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/12/10/occar-director-at-eda-to-discuss-cooperation-and-bilateral-roadmap
EDA_NEWS_0032	2020-01-09	NEWS	ESA and EDA joint research: advancing into the unknown	 The European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Defence Agency (EDA) are embarking on new cooperative projects for exploring unknown and potentially hazardous environments: harnessing drones for the monitoring of disaster-stricken regions or toxic spill sites and making use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to navigate across the surface of asteroids or other terra incognita. These two new joint projects have been authorised by the ESA Council and Steering Board of EDA. They are the latest in a long history of cooperation enabled by the ESA-EDA Administrative Arrangement, originally signed in 2011 and recently extended for a second time.   Innovation in disaster response Space-based services have fast become essential to Europe’s safety and security. In 2017, a previous ESA-EDA Implementing Agreement demonstrated the use of space-based assets to respond to threats from toxic and hazardous materials. The project showed that space systems were beneficial to fast and accurate response to such threats in terms of situational awareness, early warning, detection and response planning. Based on this success, the two agencies decided to extend their cooperation in this area, and in December signed an implementing agreement to carry out a next-stage demonstration project called Autonomous Drone Services (AUDROS). By integrating space assets in sectors such as telecommunications, navigation and Earth observation, the partners will demonstrate the benefits of using autonomous and/or remotely piloted aerial vehicles to both detect toxic material and carry out rapid response to large-scale disasters. This activity will lead to the development of operational services that will deliver support to defence and security users on a permanent basis.   Flying into the unknown ESA and the EDA are also cooperating in the development of new AI-based capabilities in the field of guidance, navigation and control (GNC) – knowing where an asset is and steering where it is going. Advanced, autonomous GNC is set to become an indispensable element of ambitious future space missions such as rendezvousing with asteroids and comets or the active removal of hazardous space debris from orbit.  This joint project, dubbed ATENA, will develop AI-based systems with the capability of flying safely over unknown territory, such as an asteroid, to achieve enhanced navigation performance compared to current vision-based techniques based on feature tracking.   Deepening ESA-EDA cooperation Through the two partners’ deepening cooperation, Europe is better equipped to implement priority objectives across cyber and maritime security, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, remotely piloted aircraft systems, secure satellite communications, autonomous access to space and ongoing Earth observation. “The role of space-based services for security and defence actors is a recognised priority for Europe. The importance of space assets and applications for defence capabilities is reflected in the revised Capability Development Plan (CDP) approved by Member States at the EDA Steering Board in June 2018”, said EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq. “ESA is a natural and trusted partner for us. Over the years we have built a cooperation that has yielded numerous successful projects, through eight Implementing Agreements totalling over €5 million in shared investments, covering several priority areas.”  For ESA, its partnership with EDA is a key component of the Agency’s relationship with the EU and of Agency commitments to the safety and security of Europe. “Through our political and technical dialogue, we are able to identify joint priorities hand-in-hand with users of space systems and security communities”, comments Jan Wörner, ESA’s Director General. “This virtuous dynamic is a key driving force of ESA’s space safety initiatives, recently endorsed and funded at our Space19+ Council at Ministerial Level.”  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2020/01/09/esa-and-eda-joint-research-advancing-into-the-unknown
EDA_NEWS_0033	2019-12-16	NEWS	Defence expenditure up but spending in key areas falling short, finds EDA report	 The European Defence Agency has today published its annual Defence Data report for the year 2018, detailing spending by the 27 EDA Member States. Total defence expenditure stands at €223 billion, representing a 3% increase on 2017  and marks the fifth consecutive year of increased defence spending. EDA’s report also finds that Member States are not meeting spending commitments in key areas.      Total defence expenditure returns to pre-financial crisis levels   The year’s report finds that overall defence spending by the 27 EDA Member States has almost returned to pre-financial crisis levels, €225 billion in 2007 compared to €223.4 billion in 2018. This level of spending represents 1.4% of GDP and 3.1% of total government expenditure. Although overall spending fell by 11% between 2007 and 2013, since 2014 Member States defence expenditure is increasing in line with economic growth.   “It is extremely positive that defence budgets have almost fully returned to pre-financial crisis levels, with 2018 marking the fifth consecutive year of increased spending. Our report is evidence that Member States have put a renewed impetus into defence spending after suffering heavily in the years following the financial crisis. Nevertheless, EDA’s findings do paint a mixed picture in terms of European collaborative defence, with a worrying fall in both equipment procurement and R&T spending in a European context. While European collaborative defence R&T still remains significantly below 2008 levels, it is encouraging that the value and number of ad-hoc R&T projects under EDA is increasing”, Jorge Domecq, EDA’s Chief Executive, commented.    Shortfalls on collective spending commitments   Despite the rise in total defence expenditure, spending on fulfilling collective benchmarks has failed to keep pace. Spending on areas where collective benchmarks have been agreed namely: Defence Investment; Defence Research and Technology; European Collaborative Defence Equipment Procurement; and European Collaborative Defence R&T all still remain below 2008 levels. EDA’s report provides detailed analysis of how current spending relates to these four collective benchmarks agreed at the EDA Steering Board in 2007, as follows: €44.5 billion on Defence Investment (procurement of new equipment and R&D), representing 19.9% of Total Defence Expenditure against a collective benchmark of 20%;  €6.4 billion on European Collaborative Defence Equipment Procurement, representing  17.8% of Total Defence Equipment Procurement against a collective benchmark of 35%;  €2.1 billion on Defence Research and Technology, totalling 0.9% of Total Defence Expenditure against a collective benchmark of 2%; and,  €153 million on European Collaborative Defence R&T, totalling 7.3% of Total Defence R&T against a collective benchmark of 20%.       Key findings   However, among the 27 EDA Member States some disparities in achieving these benchmarks can be observed:   14 Member States spent 20% or more of their defence budget on investment in 2018, up from 7 states in 2014;      21 Member States now dedicate more than 10% of defence budget on investments;   8 Member States combined account for 96% of total defence research and technology spending, with the largest four accounting for 85%.      Background  EDA collects defence data on an annual basis, and has done so since 2006, in line with the Agency’s ministerial Steering Board decision of November 2005. The Ministries of Defence of the Agency’s 27 Member States (all EU Member States except Denmark) provide the data. EDA acts as the custodian of the data and publishes the aggregated figures in its booklets.  All data is collated (“Total incorporates 27 EDA Member States”), and it has been rounded. Defence expenditure figures are provided in constant 2018 prices in order to take inflation into account and allow for a comparison across years.     More information   EDA Report: Defence Data 2017-2018 Key Findings and Analysis   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/12/16/defence-expenditure-up-but-spending-in-key-areas-falling-short-finds-eda-report
EDA_NEWS_0034	2020-01-08	NEWS	EDA deploys first civilian, fixed-wing aeromedical evacuation services	 On 1 January 2020, EDA commenced its first deployment of civilian, fixed-wing Aeromedical Evacuation (AIRMEDEVAC) services to support Belgian Armed Forces operations in Niger in Africa. Belgian forces are active in several areas throughout Africa, including: Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger.  In Niger, they are delivering training and operational advice to the Forces Armée Nigériennes (FANER) and operate in austere conditions with only limited medical support facilities. To provide appropriate medical oversight, the deployment provides an aircraft based, primary life support capability, available 24/7 throughout the designated operational theatre, to move injured personnel from the main Damage Control Surgery Unit in the city of Maradi to definitive care facilities in neighbouring Gao, Chad or, in extremis, for repatriation to Europe. EDA is no stranger to providing direct support to operations and maintains an entire unit dedicated to operational support, training and exercises. The niche services provided by the Agency, such as those within the EU SatCom Market, offer an attractive and easily accessible turn-key capability to many Member States’ planners. In national and CSDP operations and missions, the provision of certain key capabilities can be challenging. Typically operations or missions are deployed on short notice, in remote areas. In many cases, capabilities are not available and outsourcing is necessary to provide services from private companies. Experience has shown that contracting on the spot under time pressure is not a cost-effective solution. Having in place ready-to-use arrangements is very beneficial in order to reduce the administrative burden and achieve economies of scale.   Framework contracts In 2019, EDA concluded several framework contracts with international aeromedical providers to cover fixed and rotary wing AIRMEDEVAC services in Africa and Europe. The project’s objective was the provision of in-theatre AIRMEDEVAC services to evacuate patients from the point of injury to an initial Medical Treatment Facility (Forward AIRMEDEVAC normally conducted by rotary wing platforms) or fixed-wing transfer between in-theatre Medical Treatment Facilities (Tactical AIRMEDEVAC) to be used in frame of national and/or international defence and/or security operations. The project is designed around military technical requirements developed by EU Military Staff and Member States experts and endorsed by the EU Military Committee. The EDA AIRMEDEVAC contracts will run until January 2023 for a maximum value of 120 million Euro. The project currently involves four participating Member States (AT, BE, DE and NL)  but is also attracting interest from other EU agencies and bodies and look set to grow with further work in hand to examine the provision rotary wing Forward AIRMEDEVAC services later in the year. The Belgian Defence Staff offered their own comment on the new capability: “This type of contractual vector offers ‘ready-to-use’ solutions allowing quick response to operational needs. EDA is advantageously taking care of procurement process, contracting, invoicing, etc. whilst the customer still keeps the right to take part in the evaluation of tenders by each reopening of competition and also remains responsible for controlling the performance of the contract once signed. The process with EDA is highly professional and quick, offering time and budget savings”. Aside from direct support to operations, the unit also supports fixed, rotary and unmanned training and exercise activities.  Since 2009, it has developed a wide portfolio of advanced tactics courses for  European helicopter crews, employing simulator based and live training events covering hot and cold weather operations, both day and night, including weapon drops and support to special forces. Similarly, the Agency continues to support fixed-wing air transport operations under the banner of the European Air Transport Force (EATF) Programme, including capacity building activities for specific fleets (C-295, C-130) and initial training of Medium Altitude, Long Endurance (MALE) drone pilots and operators.    More information: Contracts signed for the provision of aero medical evacuation services in Europe and Africa (EDA webnew, February 2019) EDA factsheet on AIRMEDEVAC  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2020/01/08/eda-deploys-first-civilian-fixed-wing-aeromedical-evacuation-services
EDA_NEWS_0035	2020-01-22	NEWS	EDA bids farewell to Chief Executive Jorge Domecq	 On 17 January, EDA staff together with senior representatives from Member States, EU institutions/bodies/agencies, NATO, industry as well as the wider European defence community bid farewell to Chief Executive Jorge Domecq. Mr Domecq will depart from the Agency at the end of this month when his term comes to an end after five years.  Deputy Chief Executive Olli Ruutu thanked Mr Domecq for his relentless, hard work and commitment at the helm of the Agency over the last five years. During this period, especially after the presentation of the EU Global Strategy in 2016, “the EU defence cooperation environment changed fundamentally” with the setting up of unprecedented cooperation tools such as the Coordinated Annual Review of Defence (CARD), the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the European Defence Fund (EDF). “In this cooperation with our colleagues in Member States and in European institutions, you have put your mark on developing EU defence initiatives for a structure whose purpose is to make Europe more capable (…) Europe’s ability to provide added value to our security, and to tangibly support our defence capabilities, is more important than ever. For putting this commitment and conviction into action, your work must be truly commended”.  Under Mr Domecq’s leadership, the Agency expanded its activities considerably across the areas of capability development, research and critical enablers. Mr Domecq leaves behind him an Agency that is “solid, administratively sound and accountable” and therefore fit for purpose to play its role in the development of a Europe of Defence, Mr Ruutu concluded.       Five defining years for the Agency Mr Domecq, a senior Spanish diplomat with previous experiences in NATO, OSCE and UN, joined the European Defence Agency on 1 February 2015 for a first mandate of three years which, following a proposal by then Head of the Agency Federica Mogherini, was extended for an additional two years, until 1 February 2020.  With the Global Strategy triggering the launch by Member States of the EU defence initiatives (CARD, PESCO, EDF) and calling on Member States to make “full use” of the Agency’s potential, Mr Domecq led the Agency’s work to provide a fundamental contribution to advancing and implementing defence cooperation in line with a new level of ambition.  Within this context, the Agency’s Long Term Review (LTR) in 2017 led to a significant reinforcement of EDA’s tasks: as the main intergovernmental prioritisation instrument at EU level in support of capability development; as the preferred cooperation forum and management support structure at EU level to engage in technology and capability development activities; and with regard to EU funded defence-related activities and military voice in wider EU polices. The LTR adjustments subsequently allowed EDA to adapt quickly and smoothly to the fast-changing European defence landscape and the new requirements stemming from CARD, PESCO and the EDF.    Mr Domecq also successfully oversaw adaptations in the Agency’s activity portfolio to reflect changing threats (hybrid warfare) and new emerging technologies, such as 3-D printing, cyber and artificial intelligence. Within his mandate, EDA’s cooperation with industry and its relations with EU institutions and agencies, other organisations such as OCCAR, ESA and NATO have considerably developed.   As of 1 February 2020 and until the new Chief Executive takes office, EDA's Deputy Chief Executive, Olli Ruutu, will exercise ad interim the duties of the Chief Executive.  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2020/01/22/eda-bids-farewell-to-chief-executive-jorge-domecq
EDA_NEWS_0036	2019-12-02	NEWS	Focus on EU defence initiatives: the new EDA magazine is out!	 The latest European Defence Matters magazine (N°18) is now available, with a special focus on the state of implementation of the new EU defence initiatives (CARD, PESCO, EDF). The magazine also features exclusive articles by the new Head of EDA, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy of the Union and Vice-President of the European Commission, Josep Borrell, as well as the new Chair of the European Parliament’s subcommittee on Security and Defence (SEDE), Nathalie Loiseau.  You can read the magazine in PDF here or in digital format here.   In the magazine’s cover story, we review and analyse the impressive work done so far on the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD), the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the European Defence Fund (EDF), and assesse the main first lessons learned for each of them during their initial implementation phase.  We also sat down with representatives from three EDA Member States – Austria’s Defence Political Director General Major Johann Frank, France’s National Capability Director Major General Eric Charpentier, and Greece’s National Armament Director Vice Admiral Kyriakos Kyriakidis - to hear what impact the EU defence initiatives have already had on their national defence planning. Finally, Dr Gustav Lindstrom, the Director of the EU Institute for Security Studies (EUISS), shares with us his analysis on what is needed to make the best out the new EU defence tools in the future. The ongoing debate about the EU’s ambition of moving towards ‘strategic autonomy’ in the security and defence domain, stated in the 2016 Global Strategy, is analysed in an article by EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq who argues that the topic is too important to be flogged to death in endless theoretical talk on its end-goal. What counts, he says, are practical steps allowing the EU to move closer towards this goal. The magazine also puts a spotlight on several collaborative projects run by EDA on such diversified topics as the Cooperative Financial Mechanism (CFM), Cyber Defence and military diving standards.  Have a look immediately – and enjoy!   More information: EDM Magazine N°18 (PDF) Digital version of EDM Magazine   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/12/02/focus-on-eu-defence-initiatives-the-new-eda-magazine-is-out!
EDA_NEWS_0037	2019-12-09	NEWS	EIB signs Cooperative Financial Mechanism (CFM) arrangement	 An important step towards incentivising and facilitating the launch of collaborative defence capability and research programmes in Europe was made today when Alexander Stubb, the Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed the programme arrangement setting up a Cooperative Financial Mechanism (CFM). The signing took place during a meeting with EDA Chief Jorge Domecq at the Agency’s premises. Initiated by EDA, the CFM was negotiated over the past three years. It is designed to overcome the recurrent problem of unsynchronised defence budgets in participating Member States which can hinder or impede the launch of collaborative defence projects.  So far, 10 participating Member States (Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain) have already signed the Programme Arrangement or declared their intention to join the programme. More countries signalled their willingness to join the programme in the coming weeks. Developed as a so-called ‘Category A’ programme of the Agency, the CFM is entirely voluntary. Member States can freely decide if they wish to participate, contribute and support projects.  Today, the launch of collaborative defence capability and research projects is sometimes delayed or hampered by the fact that defence budgetary availabilities might differ among partners, for instance for an unexpected budgetary restriction or a shift in national priorities. As a result, it happens that countries interested in a collaborative project cannot join or have to postpone their participation because the required funding is not approved or available at a particular moment. The CFM, acting as trusted platform offering mutual inter-state help, or alternatively outside support from the EIB, was established to mitigate this problem. It will enter into force at the date of the signature of the last country having declared its intention to join. EDA Chief Jorge Domecq stated: “The Agency’s role is to promote and incentivise collaborative defence projects in Europe and to help create the right conditions for that. The CFM adds a very powerful instrument to our toolbox in the context of an enhanced momentum for defence cooperation fostered by the EU defence initiatives. In future, mismatching budgetary cycles or provisional gaps in funding should no longer exclude member states from participating in multinational programmes”.  EIB Vice-President Alexander Stubb commented: “Europe has to be at the forefront of the development of key strategic defence technologies, including AI and digitalisation. With cooperation we can improve EU efficiency and innovation ability and strengthen EU capacity to prevent and respond to hybrid threats. A lack of access to suitable financing solutions allowing to better synchronize joint resources is seen as one of the major impediments to the launch or implementation of defence related cooperative projects. This is where the EU bank comes into play. Via the CFM, the EIB can strengthen its lending in support of public sector projects, with, inter alia, potential investments in the fields of dual-use RDI of defence or cybersecurity technologies, including projects envisaged under the EU’s Permanent Structured Cooperation PESCO.”   Two pillar structure The CFM will be structured in two pillars: the first pillar foresees the European Investment Bank (EIB) as the sole lender through the conclusion of bilateral framework loan agreements between EIB and the interested Member State having joined the CFM arrangement (CFM Member). To obtain the EIB’s financial support, projects submitted must respect the eligibility requirements set by the Bank’s lending policy, while the volume of the lending facility and the interest rate applied are negotiated on a case-by-case basis by the EIB and the interested CFM Member. The EIB involvement is supported and facilitated by the EDA which will act as the ‘Facility Agent’ on behalf of EIB under its instructions and responsibility, serving as a primary point of contact between the EIB and the beneficiary CFM Member in the technical assessment of the feasibility of each project; the second pillar provides for a State-to-State support facility, through a system of reimbursable advances and deferred payments. It can be used to support any defence related project. The facility is structured as a set of individual bank accounts which are opened and managed by the EDA under the control of the CFM Members. Within that pillar, any CFM Member can submit a request for financial support to other CFM Members being part of a same collaborative project. While the Programme Arrangement provides the overarching legal framework setting the general requirements and conditions for State-to-State support, the specific conditions of each advance will be set out in separate agreements to be concluded between the supporting CFM Member, the beneficiary CFM Member and the EDA, as facilitator. The administrative and operational costs of the CFM will be covered by existing EDA resources meaning CFM Members will not have to bear additional costs for the management of the mechanism. Notwithstanding any financial support granted under the CFM, projects or programmes subject to such financial support will remain at all times governed and managed according to their own rules.   More information: European Defence Agency and European Investment Bank sign cooperation agreement (Feb 2018)  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/12/09/eib-signs-cooperative-financial-mechanism-(cfm)-arrangement
EDA_NEWS_0038	2019-11-29	NEWS	Cyber agencies assess future cooperation opportunities	" EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq today hosted a meeting of the principals of the cyber organisations signatories of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) concluded in May 2018: the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) and the Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU Institutions, Bodies and Agencies (CERT-EU).   The purpose of the meeting was to assess the progress achieved since the 2018 MoU and to plan the future cooperation activities for 2020-2021. The MoU provides a comprehensive cooperative framework through which civil-military synergies can be promoted, ultimately aiming to improve cybersecurity of all stakeholders and support Member States’ cyber defence programmes.   In 2019, quadrilateral cooperation was further enhanced with various activities, regular exchanges on topical cybersecurity aspects and participation in respective events of interest.  Looking ahead, the collaboration roadmap prepared by the MoU working group envisages concrete activities on cyber training & education, technology development. The updated roadmap sets ambitious objectives for the coming year, effectively taking the level of cooperation to a new level. As part of the cooperation, the four partners are planning to organise a major event in the second part of 2020, improve their cooperation along the lines of major cybersecurity policy implementation (notably, the Cybersecurity Act) and the update Cyber Defence Policy Framework. They also commit to pay additional attention to improving incident response mechanisms and processes as well as increased joint contributions to high visibility events on Cybersecurity and Cyber Defence. EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq said: “The efforts required by the implementation of the Cyber Defence Policy Framework and, in general, by our contributing Member States in the cyber defence domain are consistently increasing, and require specialised and committed resources. The collaboration enabled by the MoU is a key factor of our efforts to harmonize these efforts, avoid duplication and support Member States in their capability development programmes”. ENISA Chief Executive Director Juhan Lepassar said: “I trust this new roadmap will enable the four partners to a closer, more effective collaboration and provide a valuable platform to help the European Union achieve the aims of the EU cyber crisis cooperation Blueprint”.  The Head of Europol's European Cybercrime Centre, Steven Wilson said: ""This agreement has paved the road for a number of significant developments in the fight against cybercrime. At Europol's European Cybercrime Centre, we welcome the challenges and opportunities that are to come and continue to believe that we are stronger together in our efforts of securing Europe in the digital age.""  The Head of CERT-EU, Saâd Kadhi, stated: “As an entity with a mission to act as the cybersecurity information exchange and incident response coordination hub for its constituents, cooperation runs through CERT-EU’s veins. This MoU, and the ambitious deliverables we have set ourselves, is truly key to strengthening our collective capabilities and reinforcing the ties between the cyber defence, security and law enforcement communities"".   More information:  Four EU cybersecurity organisations enhance cooperation (webnews May 2018) EDA factsheet Cyber Defence European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA)  Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)  Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU Institutions, Agencies and Bodies (CERT-EU)   "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/11/29/cyber-agencies-assess-future-cooperation-opportunities
EDA_NEWS_0039	2019-11-28	NEWS	Annual Conference closes with call for coherent implementation of EU defence tools	" EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq this afternoon closed the Agency’s 2019 Annual Conference which was devoted to debating the current state of implementation and the future prospects of the new EU defence initiatives. Before that, NATO's Assistant Secretary General for Defence Investment, Camille Grand, had underlined in his speech the strong relationship, cooperation and complementarity between NATO and the EU, two organisations which are ""two sides of the same coin"".       Although it is premature to declare today that the new EU defence cooperation tools (CARD, PESCO, EDF) will deliver on all their promises, they definitely have the potential to be very successful and lead, over time, to a more structured joint European defence planning framework that will enable systematic cooperation, from investment and capability development to the joint operational use of those capabilities, Mr Domecq said in his concluding remarks. However, everything will depend on how efficiently and coherently they are implemented, and to what extent Member States will actually use and embed these tools into their national defence thinking and planning, the EDA Chief Executive stressed, reflecting a general assessment expressed throughout the conference.     Main takeaways Mr Domecq singled out a number of commonalities expressed during the conference which could serve as the main takeaways of today's event, such as: the sense of urgency to use the current window of opportunity to push ahead with the Europe of Defence; the need to deliver quick results by ensuring an efficient, coherent and output-oriented implementation of the tools; the importance of following an integrated approach which includes all the actors on EU level (EDA, EEAS, EUMC, EUMS, Commission, Council) as well as national Ministries of Defence; the priority of the operational military needs and requirements which have to guide the industrial needs, not the other way around the need to safeguard and invest in Key Strategic Activities to make the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base more sustainable, as a key aspect of strategic autonomy.       Lively and interactive panel discussions  Throughout the day, between the various keynote speeches (see other related webnews on the opening speeches and the ministerial debate), conference attendees also enjoyed two lively, interactive and highly interesting panel debates, each of them focusing on a specific aspect of European defence. Moderated by EUISS Director Dr Gustav Lindstrom, the first panel entitled 'CARD, PESCO, EDF: taking stock and looking ahead' featured Admiral Rob Bauer (Dutch Chief of Defence), Dirk Hoke (CEO of Airbus Defence & Space), Herald Ruijters (Director at the European Commission's DG MOVE), Esa Pulkkinen (Director General of the EU Military Staff) as well as Benedikt Zimmer (German State Secretary for Defence Procurement). The panelist focused on the need to ensure a smooth and hands-on implementation of the new EU defence cooperation tools, and to always keep in mind the armed forces' real capability needs and priorities. The key driver of all cooperation must be the capability requirements and needs of our forces, and nothing else, said Mr Zimmer. He also called for ""proper and fair partnerships"" between the European defence industries and countries to unleash the full potential of defence cooperation. In this respect, Dirk Hoke (Airbus) raised the importance of solving the sensitive issue of intellectual property rights. ""As long this question is not solved, we will see duplication"" in the development of capabilities, he said. The current fragmentation of Europe' capability landscape is not sustainable, stressed Admiral Bauer. Capabilities, such as for example military helicopters, can be produced by different industries in different countries ""but please build just one type of them, not 28"", he said.        The second panel, moderated by EDA's Industry, Synergies & Enablers Director, Emilio Fajardo, discussed the 'Technological and industrial dimension of the EU's new level of ambition on defence'. It featured Thierry Carlier (Director International Development, Direction Générale de l'Armement), Éric Béranger (CEO of MBDA),  Steven Blockmans (Head of the EU Foreign Policy Unit at the Centre for European Policy Studies CEPS), Micael Johansson (President/CEO of SAAB Group) Paula Queipo Rodriguez (Director of Business Operations, IDONIAL Centro Tecnológico),  Dr Margriet Drent (Senior Research Fellow at Clingendael). A strong focus was put on Europe's so-called Key Strategic Activities (skills, technologies, manufacturing capabilities) which should be safeguarded to maintain and increase Member States armed forces' freedom of action and allow the EU to move towards strategic autonomy.   More information: Welcome speech by EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq Speech by Michel Barnier (European Commission Chief Negotiator) Speech by General Claudio Graziano, Chairman of EU Military Committee Speech by NATO ASG Camille Grand "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/11/28/annual-conference-closes-with-call-for-coherent-implementation-of-eu-defence-tools
EDA_NEWS_0040	2019-11-28	NEWS	AI-driven decision aid project wins EDA Defence Innovation Prize	" EDA today announced the winner of the 2019 EDA Defence Innovation Prize which, this year, rewards the most innovative idea or application for the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in defence. The trophy goes to epic.blue, a young Belgian company specialised in Location Intelligence Systems, for their idea to use AI-driven tactical decision aids to provide commanders of military operations with accurate and seamless positioning data of teams in GNSS-denied environments. The Prize was handed over by EDA Deputy Chief Executive Olli Ruutu at a ceremony in the margins of the Agency’s Annual Conference today in Brussels. The availability, in all circumstances, of precise, reliable and constantly updated data on the current operational status and environment of an operation is crucial and helps military commanders to speed up and improve their decision-making. The benefits for military operations using new AI-based location intelligence tools are increased situational awareness, safety and operational effectiveness.  The starting point for the winning idea was the fact that commanders are more and more overwhelmed by a deluge of information, driven by the continuous rise of available sensor data and the increased inter-connectivity of deployed systems. By contrast, a long-standing information gap still exists: accurate positioning of teams in GNSS-denied environments. The solution proposed in the winning project is thus to create a range of AI tactical decision aids (TDA) which, together with humans in the loop, can considerably augment commanders’ thought processes and speed of decision-making, thanks to accurate and seamless positioning of their troops, even in GNSS-denied environments.  The proposed AI decision aids would use 4D data generated and collected during trainings and operations: movement of forces, time and location of hostile encounters, theoretical planning and movement, etc.. All that 4D data captured by the system is stored with timestamp and location to create a storyboard for post-mission analysis. Using this data, AI can then be made to learn which are normal movement and timing patterns of safe operations. This creates an understanding of the normal situation, without needing a lot of human intervention. If the AI detects deviations of the norm, alerts are raised and alternate courses of action can be proposed. Prediction capacities could also be included in the future. The resulting capability would be an AI-driven tool which can observe current operations and propose alternatives as required by the operational circumstances.  ""We are very pleased to receive EDA’s Defence Innovation Prize. epic.blue’s mission is to ensure the safety, security and effectiveness of field teams. This recognition enables us to further carry our mission into the security domain and create strong partnerships"", stated the company’s CEO, Michael Ilsbroux.   About epic.blue epic.blue is a leading technology company providing COTS software for high-performance and highly accurate location intelligence in business critical systems. it is specialised in combining and visualizing so-called 4D data (3D location and Time) and IoT sensor data. The Artificial Intelligence engine the company has developed manages a dynamic digital representation of field operations. It enables to understand, predict and optimise the performance of operations in real-time. This engine also powers ‘Shyn’, the company’s personal location and safety device for seamless positioning in GNSS-denied environments. epic.blue currently serves the First Responder community and the Pharmaceutical and Industry 4.0 markets.  "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/11/28/ai-driven-decision-aid-project-wins-eda-defence-innovation-prize
EDA_NEWS_0041	2019-11-25	NEWS	EDA launches B2B Platform for industry	 EDA today launched its new ‘B2B Platform’, an online tool which aims to facilitate cross-border partnerships between European defence industry stakeholders by allowing them to quickly and easily search for potential partners for defence-related projects and programmes. The platform responds to a demand by industry for improved networking possibilities as a result of the new EU defence initiatives which also impact and benefit the wider European defence-related industry.  The platform is in line with one of EDA’s core missions, namely to help strengthening the European defence industry and increase industry engagement in defence. It enables all registered stakeholders to post their specific and customised demands for partners, and also to reply to such requests. As the public search for partners can be commercially sensitive, the platform also offers the possibility to publish anonymous requests.  All information submitted throughout the application process will be notified only to the project owner who published the related request for partners as well as to EDA’s administrator. From there, interested parties can get in touch directly and discuss the way ahead. EDA’s service is limited to offering access to the platform without implication in the subsequent discussions and setting up  of the partnerships.   How to get active Interested entities can quickly and easily register HERE (via Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox). The user-friendly platform is also accessible under the Industry Info portal on the EDA’s website. The whole process of registration, publishing requests for partners or replies to these requests takes only a few minutes.  More practical information on how to use the platform can be found on this new EDA factsheet explaining the B2B Platform.  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/11/25/eda-launches-b2b-platform-for-industry
EDA_NEWS_0042	2019-11-28	NEWS	Annual Conference: Ministers join high-level debate on future of EU defence	" After the opening by the Head of Agency and keynote speeches by European Commission Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier and the Chairman of the EU Military Committee, General Claudio Graziano, attendees of EDA’s 2019 Annual Conference witnessed a lively and inspiring high-level strategic debate on the future of European defence featuring three Defence Ministers: François Bausch of Luxembourg, João Gomes Cravinho of Portugal, and Thomas Starlinger of Austria. Moderated by EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq, the debate showed a common understanding on the fact that all EU Member States' armed forces have a lot to gain from enhanced defence cooperation and a more coherent and integrated capability planning and development framework in Europe, both in terms of efficiency (cost savings) and interoperability. ""We lack efficiency and could be much more effective and save money if we worked closer together"", said Minister Bausch. All the required tools for moving into that direction are now in place with the revised Capability Development Plan (CDP), the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD), the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the European Defence Fund (EDF), ""but the crucial task laying ahead of us now is to create a smooth and efficient workflow among them"", including with the European Commission's new DG on Defence Industry & Space, ""and to implement and use them in the right way"", said Minister Starlinger. Three aspects are particularly important in this respect, the Austrian Defence Minister added: first, that Member States remain in the driving seat when it comes to prioritisation of the defence capabilities needed; second, that we don't reinvent the wheel and, instead, use the tools, processes and assets we have already in place; and third, that we ensure there is coherence among the various EU defence initiatives and the actors driving them. Portuguese Minister Gomes Cravinho thought that the successful setting up of CARD, PESCO and the EDF showed that the EU was ""on the right track"" at a technical level.On the political level, however, more needs to be done to move towards a more common defence policy in Europe, he stressed. The need for progress on the political level, especially with a view to shaping a common defence policy, was highlighted by all participants. Things are moving into the right direction with the new EU tools which show that, in the capability domain, ""we are going from a national, industrial driven process to a multilateral, European approach"", said Minister Starlinger. The three Ministers also agreed that EU defence cooperation was in no way directed against NATO,""which will remain the cornerstone of our collective defence"" as Minister Bausch put it, but that, on the contrary, a stronger European defence will also strengthen NATO. ""NATO's efficiency will also rely on how successfully EU countries can strengthen their respective defences"", said the Luxembourg Minister. Asked what the most urgent next steps would be in order to move the Europe of Defence forward, the three Ministers agreed once more: it is the need to develop a common defence policy in Europe which goes beyond purely national interests, ""because no country alone can face the new challenges ahead of us"".    More information: Welcome speech by EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq Speech by Michel Barnier (European Commission Chief Negotiator) Speech by General Claudio Graziano, Chairman of EU Military Committee "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/11/28/annual-conference-ministers-join-high-level-debate-on-future-of-eu-defence
EDA_NEWS_0043	2019-11-19	NEWS	Helicopter Tactics Symposium drew lessons from past operations	 Around 50 helicopter tactics specialists from 11 EDA participating Member States as well as representatives of the Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC), the Joint Air Power Competence Centre (JAPCC), and European Helicopter industry met recently in the Air Manoeuvre, Training and Exercise Centre (AMTEC) situated in Celle, Germany, for the 10th Helicopter Tactics Symposium, organised under the EDA’s Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP).    Participants of the Helicopter Tactics Symposium   This annual event proved once more to be a unique occasion for European helicopter crews to discuss and share expertise and best practices related to helicopter tactics and to learn about  training opportunities under the Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP). A central part of the symposium was devoted to drawing the tactical lessons from recent EDA helicopter exercises, such as ‘Dark Blade 19’ held at Namest 22nd Helicopter Air Base, Czech Republic, in May 2019 (see EDA webnews here). Other sessions addressed the lessons learned from operation MINUSMA in Mali as well as the experiences made by helicopter pilots in Iraq and Libya. Furthermore, a Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) shared his experience and feedback on working with helicopters in operations as well as EDA exercises. Symposium attendees also received detailed information on helicopter tactics such as aerial gunnery, personnel recovery, air assault/airmobile operations and its planning cycle, NVG training and Attack Helicopter Tactics. A representative from Sweden briefed on the country’s new Helicopter Tactics Training Concept which will include courses given under the umbrella of EDA such as HTC and HTIC.   Electronic Warfare A new topic on the annual EDA Helicopter Tactics Symposium was Electronic Warfare (EW). In that context, participating Member States' experts also provided briefings on evasive training and EW threats. Another new topic raised at the symposium was ‘Non-Technical Skills in Weapon Instructor Training” which was presented by a senior Dutch aviation psychologist and instructor pilot. Industry was also present during the symposium with a speaker on ‘Rotary Wing developments to meet future operational needs’. Looking ahead, symposium participants were briefed on upcoming HEP exercises, including Swift Blade 2020 (to be held in The Netherlands and Belgium) which will focus on helicopter Composite Air Operations (COMAO) and national training required by the participating member states. In 2021, the annual HEP exercise will take place in Portugal under the label ‘Hot Blade’.   More information: Helicopter initiatives (EDA project page)   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/11/19/helicopter-tactics-symposium-drew-lessons-from-past-operations
EDA_NEWS_0044	2019-11-28	NEWS	Annual Conference takes stock of EU defence initiatives and looks ahead	" The European Defence Agency’s Annual Conference 2019 entitled 'Taking European Defence Cooperation to the Next Level - Prospects for the decade ahead’ was opened this morning in Brussels with a message from the outgoing Head of the Agency, Federica Mogherini. Addressing a 400-strong audience representing the whole European defence spectrum - governments, armed forces, industry, EU institutions, NATO, think tanks and media - Ms Mogherini said she had been honored to lead EDA over the past five years. She recalled the first steps and the ""shared goal""  set at the time, namely to make European cooperation the norm – not the exception – on defence matters. ""And we took the commitment to stubbornly work on this path"", she said in her message to the audience.    Federica Mogherini: ""European defence cooperation has expanded like never before"" Devoting this year's Annual Conference to taking stock of what has been achieved since then, especially with the new EU defence initiatives - revised Capability Development Plan (CDP), Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD), Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), European Defence Fund (EDF) - proved a good choice because during that short timeframe, ""European defence cooperation has expanded like never before”, Ms Mogherini said.  ""Five years ago, no one imagined how far we would have come. But we made it (...) And the Agency has been at the core of our work and of all the progress we have achieved together"". Importantly, all this impressive work has been done while strengthening cooperation with NATO, ""because a stronger European Union makes NATO stronger"", Ms Mogherini said. EDA made ""essential contributions to crafting these initiatives all along the way, and now plays a central role in their implementation"", the Head of the Agency stressed. ""The Agency is the secretariat for both CARD and PESCO, together with the European External Action Service and the EU Military Staff. It is also a central operator for EU-funded defence activities. The Agency is today in a unique position to contribute to coherence among the various initiatives, efficiency and a steady focus on our capability priorities"". She also insisted on the importance of ensuring a good and efficient cooperation between the EU institutions and bodies involved (EDA, EEAS, Commission, Council) but also with the Member Stares. ""This will be even more crucial in the years ahead, to make the most of all the tools we have set up together"", Ms Mogherini concluded.   Michel Barnier: ""We want the UK to be our closest an most strategic partner in security and defence"" Ms Mogherini’s intervention was followed by a keynote speech delivered by Michel Barnier, the European Commission’s Chief Negotiator, Head of the Task Force for Relations with the United Kingdom and former chair of the 2002 European Convention’s Working Group on Defence which laid the foundation for the creation of EDA. Brexit is an immense challenge and will have consequences, sometimes underestimated ones, on our citizens and businesses, including our defence industries, Mr Barnier said. This has to be dealt with in an ""international context which is more challenging than ever with instability becoming the new norm"", he stated. Against that backdrop, ""Europe must be the shaper of a better global order"", and in order to do that, ""Europe must upgrade its cooperation if it wants to uphold its values"". The UK must be integral part of this endeavor because even if it leaves the European Union, it will not leave Europe, Mr Barnier said.Therefore, the EU wants the ""closest possible partnership"" with the United Kingdom, also in foreign and security policy, including to build cutting-edge defence capabilities and interoperability among our Armed Forces. ""Cooperation is Europe's DNA. Therefore, we want the UK to be our closest and most strategic partner"", as a member of NATO and as a member of our ""European family of Security and Defence"" , stated Mr Barnier.   Jorge Domecq: “We need a complete change of mindset”  Previously, in his welcome speech, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq had recalled the huge progress EU defence cooperation has made over the past three years, as well as the role EDA plays in the implementation of all new EU defence tools. “Even though much has been achieved over the last years, even more needs to be done. If we want EU defence initiatives to lead towards a more coherent and integrated European defence landscape with a more capable, deployable, interoperable and sustainable set of military capabilities and forces that are able to deliver on these strategic priorities, we need sustained efforts and unfaltering political commitment”, he said.  A key factor for success of the new EU defence initiatives’ success will be the extent to which Member States will actually use and embed the new cooperation tools into their national defence planning processes, Mr Domecq stressed. “This is certainly not an easy task. In my discussions in capitals I have seen that embedding the EU defence initiatives into national processes not only puts a burden on financial and human resources but it also requires a complete change of mindset, sometimes even a change of culture”.   More information: Welcome speech by EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq Speech by Michel Barnier (European Commission Chief Negotiator) Speech by General Claudio Graziano, Chairman of EU Military Committee Speech by NATO ASG Camille Grand "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/11/28/annual-conference-takes-stock-of-eu-defence-initiatives-and-looks-ahead
EDA_NEWS_0045	2019-11-21	NEWS	Largest EU funded defence research project tested in the Mediterranean Sea	 Today, the OCEAN2020 project, managed by a 42 partner consortium from 15 EU countries, has successfully launched its first sea demonstration in the Gulf of Taranto, Italy. The OCEAN2020 Live Sea Demonstration involves a total of 9 unmanned assets and six naval units from Italy, Spain, Greece and France. The deployment of manned and unmanned systems, when integrated with satellite and communication networks, aims to enhance overall maritime situational awareness and build a comprehensive picture of developing situations for military decision-makers.   Pierre Delsaux, Deputy Director General, DG GROW - European Commission, said, “Today Ocean 2020 is demonstrating its technical achievements, but also that joint research and development at the EU level works. With the preparatory action on defence research we started small. But it helped us to gain valuable experience for the fully-fledged European Defence Fund in place in 2021 to further strengthen the competitiveness of our defence industries.”  Led by Leonardo, the OCEAN2020 (Open Cooperation for European mAritime awareNess) maritime initiative brings together technical specialists in the maritime domain covering the observing, orienting, deciding and acting operational tasks. In the Mediterranean Sea Demonstration, OCEAN2020 brings together data and information from a variety of sources; 9 unmanned assets – four aircraft, three surface and two underwater, six naval units, five satellites for communication and surveillance, four National Maritime Operations Centres (MOC), two ground communication networks and a prototype of a European Maritime Operations Centre (EU MOC) to build a comprehensive maritime picture. The two-day live demonstration is the latest phase in the ambitious project which aims to demonstrate enhanced situational awareness in a maritime environment through the integration of legacy and new technologies for unmanned systems.  OCEAN2020 aims to achieve operational and technical objectives, these range from enhanced situational awareness, autonomy, cost effectiveness and increased interoperability for joint missions also using protocols compatible with NATO standards. The variety of assets involved in OCEAN2020 highlights how collaborative autonomy between multi-domain unmanned vehicles can provide a force multiplier. Giovanni Soccodato, Chief Strategic Equity Officer at Leonardo, speaking on behalf of OCEAN2020 Consortium, said: “OCEAN2020 is an incredibly ambitious project. To deliver it, we are bringing together a pan-European team of experts, each of which is contributing its own area of world-class capabilities. Operationally, this project is important demonstrating the possibility to enhance maritime surveillance – of vital interest to European defence – integrating unmanned platforms with traditional systems. More broadly, OCEAN2020 demonstrates the potential and the true spirit of  European collaboration in the defence sector, having enabled a real partnership of large and small industry, academia and defence ministries from across the continent.”   Jorge Domecq (EDA Chief Executive), Pierre Delsaux (Deputy Director General, DG GROW), Giovanni Soccodato (Chief Strategic Equity Officer at Leonardo)   From sea to EDA: EU MOC prototype in Brussels To highlight the capability of OCEAN2020 to a wider audience, a prototype of an EU MOC was installed at EDA in Brussels. Today, a demonstration took place offering an opportunity for OCEAN2020 consortium members, project stakeholders and members of the press to discuss the impact of the project and follow the exercise taking place in Italy live via the EU MOC. Jorge Domecq, EDA Chief Executive, said, “Today’s demonstration is proof of the added-value of EU supported defence research. In deploying 9 unmanned assets, naval assets and integrating them with an extensive satellite and communication networks, OCEAN2020 takes the aims of PADR and puts them into the operational domain where the benefits of European defence cooperation are confirmed.”   First sea demonstration 20-21 November 2019 Today’s Mediterranean Sea Demonstration, led by the Italian Navy, tests how the fusion of data and information collected from the assets deployed in the area of operations can be integrated to create a Recognised Maritime Picture (RMP). OCEAN2020 aims to show how multiple information sources can be integrated with Combat Management Systems (CMSs) to create a RMP, while equally highlighting how collaborative autonomy between multi-domain unmanned vehicles can provide a force multiplier. The demonstration runs two scenarios; a threatening vessel interdiction and interception of a mine laying vessel before an amphibious operation.   Baltic Sea 2020 A second Live Sea Demonstration will take place in Summer 2020 in the Baltic Sea and will be led by the Swedish Navy.   Background Funded from the European Union’s Preparatory Action on Defence Research under grant agreement No 801697, OCEAN2020 received funding of €35.48 Million. Since its launch in April 2018 the project has undertaken extensive research and technology work to reach the point of undertaking a live sea demonstration. The consortium have been involved in a significant amount of solution analysis, system design, technical development and system integration of individual assets and trials.

EDA_NEWS_0047	2019-11-15	NEWS	EDA holds talks with European aviation organisations on the future of Single European Sky and on RPAS Air Traffic Integration	 On 7 November, European Defence Agency (EDA) hosted two high level meetings on RPAS Air Traffic Integration and the future of Single European Sky (SES). EDA welcomed senior representatives from European aviation organisations including, EASA, SESAR Joint Undertaking, European Commission (DG MOVE) and Eurocontrol.    High Level Group on the implementation of Single European Sky  The European Defence Agency was delighted to host the meeting of the High Level Group on SES. The aims of this event were to take stock the outcomes of the High Level Conference on the Future of SES (11-12 September) and to discuss the way ahead regarding the concepts promoted by the Airspace Architecture Study and the Wise Persons Group Report, in view of the Transport Council on 2 December 2019.  During the discussions, EDA Chief Executive, Jorge Domecq,  recalled that the military community recognises the need to collaboratively address the modernisation of the European Air Traffic Management (ATM) system for the benefit of all users, ensuring that some key military principles, in particular linked to ATM Data Service Provision (ADSP) and Airspace Management, which is a national prerogative, are duly considered.    4th High Level Coordination Mechanism Meeting EDA also  hosted the 4th high level meeting on the Coordination Mechanism between the European Commission, EASA, SJU and EDA for the development and implementation of a joint civil-military Roadmap towards drone Air Traffic Integration. Eurocontrol was also  invited to this important EU coordination mechanism which aims to align  workstreams in the regulatory, technical and standardisation domains with the overall objective of supporting the Accommodation of a European MALE-type RPAS in the 2020-2025 timeframe, with full integration as of 2025. The coordination efforts are of particular importance given the limitations to use military RPAS in a non-segregated airspace as this harms the effectiveness of the systems.   Guidelines for the  accommodation of military IFR MALE type RPAS under GAT airspace classes A-C Finally, EDA Chief Executive, Jorge Domecq and EASA Executive Director, Patrick Ky, presented the “Guidelines for the accommodation of military IFR MALE type RPAS under GAT airspace classes A-C”. This document is the result of a task force jointly launched and chaired by EASA and EDA, with valuable contributions from several representatives of military and civil organisations. These guidelines propose a basis for Member States and their ANSPs to conduct their own safety assessment and to develop their operational procedures and processes in compliance with European ATM/ANS Regulation.  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/11/15/eda-holds-talks-with-european-aviation-organisations-on-the-future-of-single-european-sky-and-on-rpas-air-traffic-integration
EDA_NEWS_0048	2019-11-12	NEWS	Cyber defence R&T working group boosts innovation	 End of October, EDA’s Cyber Defence Research and Technology (R&T) Ad Hoc Working Group (AHWG) organised its 10th meeting in Madrid, combined with a research workshop on cyber defence technologies innovation management. The aim of the Cyber R&T AHWG was to analyse emerging new cyber defence technologies with a twofold objective: firstly to get feedback from participants as regards the development of future technology roadmaps; and secondly to review the updated Cyber Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) and ensure it is complete. The EDA Cyber R&T AHWG is composed of cyber defence research experts and cyber specialists coming from participating Member States, industry and academia. Their task is to develop and update the cyber defence SRA within EDA’s Overarching Strategic Research Agenda (OSRA) framework. Since its establishment in 2016, the Cyber R&T AHWG has promoted EU collaborative research projects on cyber defence including work on emerging technologies with cyber implications. During its mandate, the working group has provided expertise for two ongoing EDA Cat B projects notably on “Cyber Situation Awareness Packages” and on “Enhanced Malware detection”. The Cyber Technology Landscaping Study - commissioned by EDA in 2018 and awarded to ISDEFE, AIT and CEIS – analyses the implementation aspects of the SRA and provides additional inputs which complement the findings on the state-of-the-art technology and related cyber threats. At the second workshop devoted to innovation, which is part of the OSRA value chain and toolbox, participants discussed cross-cutting cyber defence aspects related to land, maritime, air and space domains as well as modelling and simulation in order to develop new ideas that have the potential to increase cyber defence effectiveness and efficiency. One of the objectives here was to identify potential new projects to be launched in a longer capability perspective, up to 2028.  Both events took place in Madrid at INDRA and ISDEFE premises respectively.      Background In November 2018, the European Council adopted an updated version of the EU cyber defence policy framework (CDPF) which calls for considering cyber defence issues in the calls of the Preparatory Action on Defence Research and in the topics called for in the European Defence Fund. Cyber R&T’s primary focus is to reduce risks when addressing future military capabilities. Researchers in this field are encouraged to explore new avenues because of its novelty and the likelihood of getting quick applications. The military is taking steps towards a better understanding of the implication of recognising cyberspace as an operational domain. Therefore, mature solutions shall always count on well-structured research, development and testing  prior to fielding. Cyber R&T is one important work strand of the Capability Development Priority “Enabling capabilities for cyber responsive operations”. The OSRA - which provides a necessary link between R&T efforts and the military tasks and long-term capability needs of the Capability Development Plan (CDP) -  identified a number of Research and Technology areas, the so-called Technology Building Blocks (TBBs), in which a cooperative approach at the European level would bring an added-value to support the development of defence capabilities. The Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) on Cyber Defence developed within the relevant EDA Ad Hoc Working Group in compliance with OSRA requirements provides informed prioritisation on cyber-related technologies necessary for the military, while at the same time identifying opportunities for dual-use efforts and investments - be it in national, multinational or EU-funded contexts.    More information: Cyber defence (EDA factsheet) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/11/12/cyber-defence-r-t-working-group-boosts-innovation
EDA_NEWS_0049	2019-11-12	NEWS	EDA to take forward PESCO project on CBRN surveillance	 Today, the European Defence Agency (EDA) has for the first time been chosen to support the development of a PESCO project as an Agency initiative, in line with the PESCO commitment to use EDA as the European forum for project capability development. The Austrian-lead project, CBRN Surveillance as a Service (CBRN SaaS), will provide a rapidly deployable 24/7 chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) surveillance capability. The project aims to maximise the use of unmanned ground systems and aerial drones which will be equipped with a variety of sensors to deliver a real time CBRN surveillance, detection and incident management capability for both civilian and military purposes.  CBRN SaaS involves four contributing Member States (cMS), Austria (lead), Croatia, Hungary and Slovenia. Following a request from the project lead, on behalf of the cMS, CBRN SaaS will be taken forward as an EDA project. The transfer was formalised today during a signing ceremony in the margins of the EDA Steering Board. Speaking at the event, Thomas Starlinger, Minister of Defence of Austria said, “CBRN SaaS will be designed for use in the military and civilian domain. For the Austrian Armed Forces it constitutes another means to increase force protection for operations in Austria as well as abroad. National project partners may also benefit since the project will most probably be eligible for funding from the European Defence Industrial Development Programme. Through this, Small and Medium Sized Enterprises and Research Institutes will profit through a financial return from the EU.” The high strategic value of assets that provide 24/7 CBRN surveillance is proven by their ability to survey critical infrastructure and borders, augment situational awareness and support not only  military commanders but also national disaster management in dealing with CBRN incidents. CBRN SaaS will establish an unmanned sensor network consisting of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and Unmanned Ground Systems (UGS) that will be interoperable with legacy systems. When combined with communications and data networks it will deliver a Recognised CBRN Picture that enhances knowledge-based decision making by leaders and supports the mission of saving lives. In focusing on the deployment of unmanned systems, operational flexibility will be increased and reduces the risk to the operators.   “EDA is delighted to take this project forward and support our Member States. CBRN SaaS will benefit from EDA’s extensive experience of delivering defence cooperation projects, especially the insights gained from the EDA CBRN Joint Investment Programme. CBRN agents and weapons are a source of great concern, effective surveillance is therefore a crucial capability. As endorsed by the EU’s Capability Development Plan, developing enhanced CBRN capabilities based on newly available technologies such as unmanned systems is a priority that will enhance Europe’s resilience and preparedness to deal with CBRN threats.” EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq commented. The CBRN SaaS main deliverable will be an operational plugin module for widely varying civilian missions and CSDP or NATO military operations. As a capability and technology development project, CBRN SaaS aims to provide suitable mobility (e.g. aerial, ground, unmanned) to mount CBRN sensors that will collect and send data to be processed through a secure network to the decision maker. In addition, the generated Recognised CBRN Picture can be offered as a power by the hour service to others in need of CBRN surveillance. The project will run until 2022, and will mainly deliver a demonstrator that provides a proof of concept; a Cooperation Roadmap which identifies what future modules could be developed in what format and with whom; a concept of operations and a service availability concept.    Background CBRN SaaS was approved and initially launched as a PESCO project within the second batch on 19 November 2018. Following a decision of the cMS, EDA was requested to support establishing the CBRN SaaS Cat. B project (developed and launched by a number of cMS with the opportunity for other participating Member States to join later) that will help implement the CBRN SaaS PESCO project.       EDA press contacts: Elisabeth SCHOEFFMANN Head of Media & Communication elisabeth.schoeffmann@eda.europa.eu T+32 470 87 01 65 Paul QUINN Media & Communications Officer paul.quinn@eda.europa.eu T+32 2 504 28 10              	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/11/12/eda-to-take-forward-pesco-project-on-cbrn-surveillance

EDA_NEWS_0053	2019-10-24	NEWS	EDA supports work on interconnected & secured European military software defined radio landscape	 This week (22/23 October), EDA hosted the third PESCO workshop related to the European Secure Software Defined Radio (ESSOR) project which aims to develop common technologies for European military radios.  The adoption of these technologies as a standard will guarantee the interoperability of EU forces in the framework of joint operations, regardless which radio platforms are used. The ESSOR project will provide a secure military communications system, improving voice and data communication between Member States’ Armed Forces on a variety of platforms. In addition, it will deliver guidelines related to the validation and verification of waveform portability and platform re-configurability, setting up a common security basis to increase interoperability between the forces. By ensuring that military radios are fully accessible, shared and used by all Member States, the effectiveness of joint operations can be increased substantially.  To that end, the Member States participating in the ESSOR project - Belgium, Germany, Spain, Finland, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Portugal (with Estonia and Ireland as observers) - have moved forward to implement a common architecture analysis of software radios in Europe.  The ESSOR project activities are currently performed by the consortium A4ESSOR through a contract managed by OCCAr.  A4ESSOR is a joint-venture of the following companies: Thales (FR), Leonardo (IT), Indra (SP), Radmor (PL), Bittium (FI) and soon Rohde & Schwarz (DE).  The ESSOR PESCO project presents exceptional technological characteristics: it is based on the state-of-the-art technology in the radio field, and it aims at developing the most advanced concepts and solutions for communications applicable to several waveform layers. It builds a complete set of capabilities which will satisfy the most demanding, modern and future communication requirements.    EDA supports development of ESSOR CONOPS  Earlier this month (11 October), the 2nd ESSOR workshop on the development of a “concept of operations” (CONOPS) had already taken place at the Agency. It allowed the project Members States to gain insight into the process and methodology which are compliant with NATO Architecture Framework version 4. The CONOPS aims at describing the operational needs, visions and expectations of the operational users (from tactical level to component command) on the new waveforms to be developed in the context of the PESCO ESSOR project. It analyses operational scenarios using vignettes and identifies categories of architectural information which are further developed into operational requirements and technical requirements. A questionnaire is being distributed to operational staff of the Army, Navy and Air Force to gather inputs on the role of software defined radio to ensure interoperability among military communication and information systems in a future pervasive interconnected battlefield.    Background PESCO, the Permanent Structured Cooperation set up in December 2017, allows the 25 participating Member States to jointly plan, develop and invest in shared capability projects, and enhance the operational readiness and contribution of their armed forces. The aim is to jointly develop a coherent full spectrum force package and make the capabilities available to Member States for national and multinational (EU CSDP, NATO, UN, etc.) missions and operations.  For more information on PESCO visit the website https://pesco.europa.eu/.   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/10/24/eda-supports-work-on-interconnected-secured-european-military-software-defined-radio-landscape
EDA_NEWS_0054	2019-11-07	NEWS	EDA Cyber Ranges Federation project showcased at demo exercise in Finland	 The European Defence Agency’s (EDA) Cyber Ranges Federation project, in which 11 Member States federate their national cyber ranges and thereby improve their respective cyber defence training capabilities, reached an important milestone with the successful multinational demonstration exercise held in Helsinki. The event, co-organised by the Finnish MoD and EDA, was attended and supported by experts from several contributing countries (Finland, Estonia, Sweden, Latvia) as well as the European Space Agency (ESA).  Two and a half years after the launch of the Cyber Ranges Federation project (the first ever cyber defence pooling & sharing project initiated by the Agency), the objective of the live demonstration was to showcase the practical implications and benefits of connecting and jointly using Member States’ cyber ranges in order to improve and expand each one’s cyber training capabilities. The event allowed participants to witness first-hand what the project aims to achieve and how it has already enhanced the cyber expertise and skills of each of the contributing Member States.  Practically speaking, the event consisted of a live fire exercise, based on a fictive but realistic training scenario, in which one team had to respond to and defend itself against cyber attacks from another. The exercise used SD-WAN technology as the backbone network technology. The participating national cyber ranges as well as the European Space Agency’s were all interconnected and interacting in real time, with and each of them having its own particular role to play in the exercise. The demonstration event was part of the ‘European Union’s combined Cyber and Hybrid Week’ which is currently being held in Helsinki under the auspices of the Finnish EU Presidency. The aim of the week is to create synergies by combining three independent events: EDA’s Project Team Cyber Meeting (5-6 November), EDA’s Cyber Ranges Demo Event (6 November) and the Cyber Power in Hybrid Warfare-symposium organised by the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats (7-8 November). “Finland, as an active player in Cyber domain, has been honoured to be in the lead of this project since Sept 2018. Finalizing challenging project is always a result of good and fruitful cooperation – in this case between 11 contributing member states. It´s very significant to continue developing just established Cyber Ranges Federation platform in the future”, said Jukka Juusti, Permanent Secretary of Finnish Ministry of Defence. “There isn’t probably a domain from which more new security threats are emerging than from cyber. Therefore, stepping up our common cyber defence is a matter of priority and urgency, as it is also reflected in the revised European Capability Development Priorities approved last year. By pooling and sharing their national cyber ranges, participating Member States will be able to improve their joint training conditions and, as a result, strengthen their cyber resilience. This successful exercise has shown that we are on the right path”, said Jorge Domecq, EDA’s Chief Executive.  “It is now well ascertained that space systems play a crucial role in the security, wellbeing and economic success of Europe. Protecting space assets from cyber threats is therefore a key priority and technological challenge. ESA has a duty to protect its Member States’ investments in space. Today we witnessed a successful demonstration of the ESA-EDA partnership. A partnership that will continue to be instrumental in increasing Europe’s cyber resilience, namely through strengthening cyber response skills and capabilities in ESA. Todays` significant exercise illustrates our existing cyber resilience capabilities located in the European Space Security and Education Centre in Belgium. Cyber threats are constantly evolving. We must therefore maintain and strengthen our capabilities and have made the necessary funding proposals to the Council at Ministerial level to be held in late November. The vitality of our cooperation with EDA and its Member States will continue to play an important role in the future. This is therefore but a beginning, as we are currently considering the creation of a Joint ESA-EDA Cyber Resilience Task Force to further explore cooperation avenues, including with other European partners,” added Jan Woerner, ESA’s Director General.   Background The aim of EDA’s Cyber Ranges Federation project is to develop a more sophisticated and powerful platform for cyber training purposes connecting Member States´ national Cyber Ranges to one another and enabling other countries, which don’t have their cyber ranges, to train and improve their cyber defence skills nevertheless. A European federation of cyber ranges, i.e. the availability of mutually accessible cyber defence training and exercise ranges, may in the future leverage other benefits, such as cyber research ranges and cyber simulation & test ranges.   Contacts: Finnish MoD spokesperson: harri.reini@defmin.fi EDA spokesperson: elisabeth.schoeffmann@eda.europa.eu ESA spokesperson: florent.mazurelle@esa.int 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/11/07/eda-cyber-ranges-federation-project-showcased-at-demo-exercise-in-finland

A special focus was put on ways and means to enhance euro-atlantic AAR interoperability. Throughout the day,  the topic was presented, discussed and analysed in various sessions dealing with different aspects, from the optimisation of existing capabilities and the development of new capabilities to the operational and industrial implications of it. In his opening speech, Jorge Domecq praised the good cooperation between EDA, NATO and ARSAG in such crucial a domain than air-to-air refuelling. “This is yet another testimony of pragmatic cooperation, to ensure complementarity of efforts and avoid unnecessary duplications, as called for by the EU-NATO Joint Declaration”, Mr Domecq said.   Over recent years, important progress has been made in order to mitigate the important capability gap Europe still has in the field of AAR (establishment of a Multinational MRTT Fleet, AAR exercises organised by the European Air Transport Command, gradual entrance into service of the A440M, successful clearance campaigns between A400M tankers and various receivers, etc.), “but it is not sufficient”, the EDA Chief Executive stressed: “What we really need is to ensure that the AAR shortfall, like capability gaps in other areas, is addressed in a more systematic way”. Therefore, the fact that AAR was reconfirmed as one of the EU Capability Development Priorities (it is embedded in the wider Air Superiority priority) which were approved by EU Member States in 2018, in full complementarity with NATO’s NDPP, will enable the continuation of this effort.  Work is now underway to implement the priorities, including the AAR related one, through Strategic Context Cases (SCCs).    Challenges in the short, medium and long term “In the short-term, the main challenge is to optimise the use of the existing AAR assets available in Europe, and we can do that through, for example, increased participation in annual European AAR Training (EART). But we can also increase interoperability by increasing AAR clearances - because a tanker without a clearance is not a tanker”, said Mr Domecq who also stressed that the certification of AAR is clearly an airworthiness aspect. In this respect, he welcomed that airworthiness authorities in the AAR field now realise and agree on the fact that “the technical assessment of an AAR clearance is their responsibility”. In the medium-term, the challenge is to cover the peak demand in AAR during the initial phase of an operation or conflict when air superiority is not yet assured, for instance by expanding the MMF fleet. “EDA stands ready to assist interested Member States in the process to explore their potential participation in this important project”, Mr Domecq said.  And finally, in the longer term, the challenge is to close the remaining capability gap, both in strategic and tactical AAR, including by developing automated/autonomous air to air refuelling systems (A3R) as a useful complement to manned AAR capabilities. “It is evident that the future of AAR will be automated”.  EDA will organise a workshop on 28 January 2020 to bring together Member States and industry to discuss the way ahead on this topic.   More information:  AAR Conference paper Speech by EDA Chief executive Jorge Domecq Video message by Dutch Minister of Defence Ank Bijleveld Speech by NATO Assistant SG for Defence Investment, Camille Grand  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/10/17/joint-eda-nato-aar-conference-focused-on-interoperability
EDA_NEWS_0056	2019-10-10	NEWS	First Defence Energy Managers’ Course completed	 After a test run in 2018, EDA has now completed the first fully-fletched Defence Energy Managers’ Course (DEMC)  in which participated a total of 17 students from eight EDA Member States. The course, one of the Agency’s most recent training and education activities, aims at increasing Armed Forces’ energy efficiency and reducing the military’s overall energy consumption through the introduction of defence-specific energy management systems based on the ISO 50001 standard.   The DEMC provided both theoretical and practical training to energy managers from Member States’ ground forces and air forces as well as navies. The course was launched in November 2018 and attended by personnel from the Armed Forces and/or Ministries of Defence from Belgium, Estonia, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Sweden and the United Kingdom.   The course was split into five distinct modules: three classroom-type sessions and two more practical modules which, in total, lasted some 11 months. Participants increased their knowledge of the complexities of managing energy within a defence organisation (energy management systems were applied to different military installations, from air and naval bases to governmental facilities) and learned how to structure and implement efficient energy management systems. Throughout the course, students were supported by mentors and members of the European Defence Energy Network (EDEN) which also allowed them to have permanent access to the networks’ on-line resources. The successful completion of the first DEMC marks an important milestone in EDA’s efforts aimed to increase energy sustainability in defence sector and reduce the military’s environmental footprint, also building on the work done in the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector (CFSEDSS) sponsored by the European Commission and the Agency’s own Energy and Environmental Working Group. Two additional courses are currently underway; they will be completed by May 2020. The whole DEMC project is run by EDA’s Industry, Synergies & Enablers Directorate (ISE) and delivered by GEN Europe and the Centre for Renewable Energy Sources & Savings (CRES).  More information Third Defence Management course launched 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/10/10/first-defence-energy-managers-course-completed
EDA_NEWS_0057	2019-10-01	NEWS	ENTER project delivers network of electromagnetic test centres	 Picture: Bundeswehr Technical Center for Information Technology and Electronics in Greding (Germany) With its final working group meeting held at the Agency premises on 26 September, EDA’s European Network on Electro Magnetic Effects Test & Evaluation capabilities Rationalisation (ENTER) project has been officially concluded.  Launched in 2014 as a so-called Category B project within the EDA’s Defence Test and Evaluation Base (DTEB) initiative, it was supported by eight Member States: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and The Netherlands. The main objective of ENTER has been achieved: the creation of a coordinated network of EME (Electro-Magnetic Effects) test centres in the participating countries, which will facilitate the future cooperation among them based on a shared technical understanding and background. The various centres attached to the network are:  Armament and Defence Technology Agency, Electrical Engineering Division (Vienna, Austria) Royal Military Academy, Department of Communication Information Systems & Sensors (Brussels, Belgium) Military Technical Institute (Prague, Czech Republic) WTD 81 - Bundeswehr Technical Center for Information Technology and Electronics (Greding, Germany) CISAM - Centro Interforze Studi Applicazioni Militari (Pisa, Italy) INTA - Instituto Nacional de Técnica Aerospacial (Torrejon de Ardoz - Madrid, Spain) FMV - Swedish Defence Materiel Administration – T&E Division (Ostersund, Sweden) RNLM/DMI/MT Sensors and Weapon Systems (Den Helder, The Netherland). The network of EME test centres and related national experts will now continue to cooperate in the specific EME sector within the DTEB framework. The damaging effects of electromagnetic interference pose unacceptable risks in military technologies. Against this backdrop, the ENTER network will jointly develop ways and means in order to mitigate the risks of fatal electromagnetic interference during EU missions, among other things by examining the hazardous impact of civil equipment on military operations and vice versa. Besides working on the network, the ENTER project also allowed participating Member States to conduct joint tests, to promote the use of harmonised test procedures, maintain and develop T&E capabilities and expertise and share knowledge, expertise and equipment. ENTER’s results and final recommendations will be further exploited to improve the EME section of the DTEB database.   More information: Defence Test and Evaluation Base (DTEB) – EDA project page 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/10/01/enter-project-delivers-network-of-electromagnetic-test-centres
EDA_NEWS_0058	2019-10-09	NEWS	2019 Military Airworthiness Conference kicks off in Vilnius	 EDA’s 2019 Military Airworthiness Conference, a two-days event organised with the support of the Lithuanian Ministry of Defence, was opened today in Vilnius by EDA’s Deputy Chief Executive Olli Ruutu.  The conference brings together key stakeholders from national authorities, industry, European agencies and international organisations, to exchange views and best practices related to the harmonisation of European military airworthiness rules and standards. Common airworthiness approaches and standards are viewed as critical enablers for enhanced European defence cooperation.   Over the two days, four main topics are being addressed through specific sessions: i) the impact of European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) on military aviation; ii) opportunities and challenges related to that; iii) lessons learned from EMARs implementation so far; iv) and the experiences made by third-party stakeholders.   Good progress made over past 10 years In his opening speech, EDA Deputy Chief Olli Ruutu thanked the Lithuanian Armed Forces for hosting the event and for their strong interest in the work of the Military Airworthiness Authorities (MAWA) Forum and the harmonisation of airworthiness approaches.   Since work started ten years ago on the harmonisation of airworthiness approaches in Europe, much has been achieved, Mr Ruutu said.  “The majority of EDA participating Member States have already implemented or are in the process of implementing European Military Airworthiness Requirements in their national regulations. But as you all are aware, the implementation of EMARs is not only about translating them in regulations but also about turning them into practice. And that makes EMAR implementation the most important phase in the harmonisation process and crucial for gaining the full benefits”, he stressed. Implementing the EMARs often means a different approach to military airworthiness that requires a change in safety culture, the Deputy Chief Executive stated.  Further progress is also required as regards the cooperation between the national military airworthiness authorities in Europe, a topic which is already in the focus of the MAWA Forum.  “Since last year when the MAWA Forum adopted a new airworthiness roadmap, the forum has started several activities to develop harmonised practices and procedures with the objective to increase the level of standardisation and cooperation in the area of initial approvals of and oversight over organisations that provide services in the military airworthiness domain”, Mr Ruutu recalled. In parallel, Member States are engaged in mutual recognitions. “At this stage, 35 active recognitions are already in place between EDA pMS and several recognitions have been concluded with Military Airworthiness Authorities from other countries worldwide. These recognitions familiarise nations with each other’s airworthiness systems. It facilitates the exchange of lessons learned and the development of best practices and helps to build mutual trust and confidence, which are the cornerstones for cooperation”, Mr Ruutu welcomed.    Towards aligning the national airworthiness systems Based on this, Member States should now consider which additional cooperation steps they could take in the area of military airworthiness in line with their PESCO commitments, he said. “I believe it is now good to reflect on the best cooperative working structures for military airworthiness authorities; keeping in mind that we need to ensure that we are as effective as possible in aligning the national airworthiness systems towards a single reference without affecting national sovereignty as regards airworthiness risk acceptance. We need to facilitate an increased efficiency in certification, approval and oversight activities but also provide industry with a single framework to meet the requirements of all participating Member States”, Mr Ruutu said.   Background The Military Airworthiness Authorities (MAWA) Forum oversees the development and maintenance of the European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) and promotes ways and means to harmonise the military airworthiness oversight across Europe.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/10/09/2019-military-airworthiness-conference-kicks-off-in-vilnius
EDA_NEWS_0059	2019-09-26	NEWS	Cooperative Financial Mechanism (CFM) ready for signing	 The Cooperative Financial Mechanism (CFM), an innovative programme initiated by EDA with a view to facilitating the financing of collaborative defence capability and research projects – for instance if unsynchronised defence budgets in participating Member States hinder or impede the launch of such projects – is now in the starting blocks. The final version of the CFM’s Programme Arrangement (PA), negotiated over the past two years, has been sent out this week to Member States for signing. Eleven Member States (Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain) have already declared their firm willingness to sign and to join the CFM in the near future. More countries might join the programme in the coming weeks. The CFM will enter into force when the last country having declared its intention to join will have signed the PA.  Developed as a so-called ‘Category A’ programme of the Agency, the CFM is entirely voluntary. Member States can freely decide if they wish to participate, contribute and support projects. The CFM will be structured in two pillars: the first pillar foresees the European Investment Bank (EIB) as the sole lender through the conclusion of bilateral framework loan agreements between EIB and the interested Member State. To obtain the EIB’s financial support, projects submitted must respect the eligibility requirements set by the Bank lending policy, while the volume of the lending facility and the interest rate applied are negotiated on a case-by-case basis by the EIB and the interested MS and set out under each individual Framework Loan Agreement. The EIB involvement is supported and facilitated by the EDA which will act as the ‘Facility Agent’ on behalf of EIB under its instructions and responsibility, serving as a primary point of contact between the EIB and the beneficiary country in the technical assessment of the feasibility of each project; the second pillar provides for a State-to-State support facility, structured as a system of reimbursable advances and deferred payments. It can be used to support any defence related project, in full compliance with national and European law. The facility is structured as a set of individual bank accounts which are opened and managed by the EDA under the control of the CFM participating Member States. Within that pillar, any CFM Member can submit a request for financial support to the CFM programme. While the Programme Arrangement provides the overarching legal framework setting the general requirements and conditions for State-to-State support, the specific conditions of each advance will be set out in separate agreements to be concluded between the supporting CFM Member State, the beneficiary country and the EDA, as facilitator. The administrative and operational costs of the CFM will be covered by existing EDA resources meaning CFM members will not have to bear additional costs for the management of the mechanism. Notwithstanding any financial support granted under the CFM, projects or programmes subject to such financial support will remain at all times governed and managed according to their own rules.  More information: European Defence Agency and European Investment Bank sign cooperation agreement (EDA webnews February 2018)  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/09/26/cooperative-financial-mechanism-(cfm)-ready-for-signing
EDA_NEWS_0060	2019-09-27	NEWS	EDA expands work on autonomous underwater vehicles	 EDA’s Steering Board has just approved the launch of a 4-year CAT B project aimed at developing a swarm of biomimetic underwater vehicles for underwater intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (SABUVIS II). It builds upon previous collaboration carried out under the SABUVIS I project which was completed in 2019. So far, two Member States (Poland, Germany) are contributing to this new project for which a project arrangement is expected to be signed later next year. The new project is important for defence as Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) are being increasingly utilised for a variety of differing tasks in the maritime environment. They represent a viable alternative to the operation of manned platforms and are particularly well suited to the rigours of an inhospitable domain that places a premium on technical advancements.  Taking the natural world as its template, this collaborative project seeks to replicate some of the key features of marine life, principally those of propulsion and behaviour, so as to ensure the successful completion of underwater operations. A key feature of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance missions (ISR) for example, is the necessity to undertake these missions covertly, and those systems that are difficult to detect, both visually and audibly, provide the optimum solution.    Building on the findings of SABUVIS I This project is a continuation of the successful collaboration enjoyed between Poland, Germany and Portugal in the first SABUVIS project. In this first iteration, three different Biomimetic Underwater Vehicles (BUVs) were constructed with the resulting conclusion that BUVs can be designed with varying degrees of similarity with living organisms. Some of the identified benefits are that undulating propulsion consumes less electrical energy than conventional propulsion systems utilising screw based propellers, and different hydroacoustic signatures are produced with a corresponding lower noise level.  This second phase will now expand upon, and investigate further, the swarm aspects with more tightly cooperating vehicles, moving in formations and consisting of vehicles having specific functions or tasks to perform. The project in particular will focus on the lead vehicles, who are responsible for the navigation function.  The expected advantages of utilising vehicles in a swarm are reliability and efficiency. Firstly, the swarm system can incorporate redundant elements, essentially extra vehicles, which increases reliability in performing a task – the loss of one element does not result in the mission being abandoned. Secondly, the distribution of sensors and devices necessary to perform the mission across a number of vehicles makes it possible to reduce the size and complexity of vehicles and thus ensures simpler construction. Technological areas that the project will also focus on are in the area of navigation and principally in GPS denied areas, optical surface coastal navigation systems and new biomimetic drives.   The principle organisations planned to undertake this project are the Polish Naval Academy and also the Wehrtechnische Dienststelle für Schiffe und Marinewaffen der Bundeswehr, Maritime Technologie und Forschung (WTD 71) in Germany. The project is as a result of the successful cooperation in EDA’s Maritime Capability Technology Group. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/09/27/eda-expands-work-on-autonomous-underwater-vehicles
EDA_NEWS_0061	2019-09-06	NEWS	Development of Multinational Helicopter Training Centre moves ahead	 The EDA Steering Board approved end of August the way ahead for the new Multinational Helicopter Training Centre (MHTC) to be established in Sintra, Portugal. The European Defence (EDA) together with 18 of its Member States will now develop the technical arrangement (TA) for the opening of this new advanced tactical helicopter training facility by the end of 2022.  Approval for the centre marks the latest milestone in a long line of important helicopter projects managed by the Agency since 2009.  EDA currently hosts three collaborative helicopter programmes, which fill a helicopter training capability gap in Europe and are a key component of operational capacity building. The three programmes are aimed at improving European interoperability and increasing standardisation of helicopter aircrews through the adoption of common training activities and the use of common Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs). All tactics are developed refined and tested before being included in the Helicopter Exercise Programme Standard Operating Procedures (HEP SOP).   Tactics Courses The Agency’s helicopter work includes a Helicopter Tactics Course (HTC) and a Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC).  The first project focusses on improving the tactical ability of crews through an integrated training course of classroom and simulator instruction that is currently conducted at RAF Linton-on-Ouse in the United Kingdom. The HTC provides a solid foundation for whole crew training and was later developed into the Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course, which takes experienced aircrew and further develops their skills in a “Train the Trainer” course, delivering advanced helicopter tactics and the Helicopter Tactics Instructor (HTI) qualification. The HTIC includes a ground phase delivered in the UK, and a live flying element conducted in Sweden.   Helicopter Exercise Programme The third element of EDA’s helicopter activities is the Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP) which brings together multinational helicopter crews and an array of assets (fixed wing, Electronic Warfare, ground troops, Special Forces, etc) in an annual multinational training exercise covering the performance of complex missions in demanding environmental areas. The exercises are conducted under the BLADE banner. The next exercise will be SWIFT BLADE, to be delivered in Belgium and the Netherlands in April 2020. However, EDA does not have the vocation to be a long-term training provider, but rather a catalyst for cooperative training. The Agency launches initiatives that can provide added value to Member States and when these are consolidated and have reached a sufficient level of maturity, the Agency encourages Member States or multinational organisations to take over the administrative and organisational responsibility of the activities, allowing the EDA to free-up resources and focus on developing new initiatives.   Multinational Helicopter Training Centre EDA has been successfully managing the three helicopter programmes for over a decade, and during the next five year period, they will progressively be transferred outside EDA to the future Multinational Helicopter Training Centre (MHTC). The MHTC will consist of office space for the technical, administrative and training delivery  staff, simulator facilities and a dedicated accommodation block. In addition, it will also develop a more coordinated approach to European helicopter training and will try to harmonise national approaches and drive synergies with NATO doctrine. The concept development phase of the project was concluded in January 2019 and has now gained ministerial approval to develop the legally binding Technical Arrangement (TA), which will define the objectives, benefits, roles and capabilities of the centre together with agreement on budget and manpower allocation.  The first MHTC project team meeting will be held at EDA in September with the signature of the Technical Arrangement targeted for the end of 2020.   More information Helicopter Initiatives  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/09/06/development-of-multinational-helicopter-training-centre-moves-ahead

EDA_NEWS_0064	2019-09-19	NEWS	Continuous commitment towards sustainable energy for the defence and security sector	 Defence is a central public sector which consumes a significant amount of energy. Increasing energy efficiency and boosting renewable energy can bring significant advantages to the sector and help with the protection of critical energy infrastructure. In addition, these efforts can contribute to the EU’s climate-neutrality objective for 2050. The importance of these policies for the defence sector was highlighted by the launch in Brussels on 19 September of the third phase of the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector (CF SEDSS III). Miguel Arias Cañete, European Commissioner for Energy and Climate Action, and Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency (EDA), gave the green light for the Phase III of the Forum to start as of 1st October 2019.  EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq welcomed the welcomed the launch of phase III, stressing that “the Consultation Forum enabled several Ministries of Defence to develop national defence energy strategies, implement Energy Management Systems and launch projects related to energy performance. Particularly, the forum facilitated the elaboration of 18 defence-energy project proposals, in addition to numerous project ideas. EDA expects that the realisation of these projects can act as an enabler of military operational capabilities and support the Ministries to address common energy challenges at multi-national level.”  Phase III of the Forum, which will last for four years, will continue to address the implementation of the EU legal framework on energy efficiency, renewable energy and energy security in the defence and security sector in. It will also aim at preparing the defence sector for new technologies such as digitalisation, artificial intelligence, e-mobility and other innovative energy systems.   Phase III will also see the organisation of a series of important events, from high-level conferences to thematic workshops and table-top exercises. Another focus will be put on bringing closer the energy and defence communities and facilitate the dialogue between experts from the Ministries of Defence, Energy and Interior to create synergies and effective solutions. To this end, the EDA and the European Commission’s Directorate for Energy intend to organise a Joint Defence Energy Conference.   More information: Website: Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector  Factsheet: CF SEDSS (Phase II) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/09/19/continuous-commitment-towards-sustainable-energy-for-the-defence-and-security-sector
EDA_NEWS_0065	2019-09-18	NEWS	EDA Chief Executive in Slovenia for talks on EU defence cooperation	 EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq travelled to Ljubljana today for talks with Slovenian Minister of Defence Karl Erjavec, State Secretary Miloš Bizjak, as well as other high-level military and industry representatives. The main topics discussed during the bilateral meetings included the state of play and way forward of the various EU defence initiatives (CARD, PESCO, European Defence Fund) and the implementation of the 2018 EU Capability Development Priorities (CDP). Particular emphasis was put on the need to ensure coherence among the EU defence initiatives and a steady focus on the agreed CDP priorities. The meetings also focused on Slovenia’s participation in EDA projects and programmes. Minister Erjavec and Mr Domecq for example exchanged views on the next steps regarding the RES-HUB (Defence RESilience Hub Network in Europe) project, an innovative Slovenian project proposal on building a renewable energy harvesting and hydrogen (H2) energy storage capability within the EU. The project was elaborated in the context of the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector (CF SEDSS) with the support of EDA. “Slovenia offers our continuous support to the Agency’s role as the forum for prioritisation, project support and interface towards wider EU policies. Of special importance, we see the Agency’s interactions with the European Commission in regard to its role in establishing the European Defence Industrial Development Programme (EDIDP) and European Defence Fund. We also believe that EDA as a part of the PESCO secretariat has been crucial in the development of projects, establishing dialogue between Member States and providing coherence between different defence and security initiatives on the EU level. A project which we will try to facilitate through the EDA format is the project RES-HUB. Further development of this project is essential for us in view of decreasing the carbon footprint in the defence sector. We see this project as a possibility to highlight our efforts during our Presidency in the second half of 2021”, Minister Erjavec said during the meeting. “It is very important for the European Defence Agency to have a clear idea of what the Slovenian authorities expect from the Agency in this crucial moment of EU defence cooperation. After the successful launch of the different EU defence initiatives, the emphasis is now on the implementation of PESCO and CARD as well as the European Defence Fund. At the same time I welcome Slovenia’s RES-HUB initiative as the project has the potential to contribute to more energy resilient European armed forces, said Mr Domecq. During his visit, the EDA Chief Executive also welcomed the possibility to exchange with the Slovenian defence industry on matters of EU defence cooperation. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/09/18/eda-chief-executive-in-slovenia-for-talks-on-eu-defence-cooperation

EDA_NEWS_0067	2019-08-01	NEWS	Towards European military diving training standards	 Joint diving operations involving different EU Member States’ Navies remain almost impossible because up till now, there are no common European diving standards which would allow such cooperation. This lack of interoperability has led to a severe shortage in ships and rescue divers which are indispensable assets in every national or international naval operation. To enable cooperation and enhance interoperability among Member States' military diving squads, EDA’s Project Team Naval Training launched a ‘Naval Training Support Study’ (NTSS) in 2012, focused on three aspects: navigation training, naval mine warfare, and diving training. The aim of this study, the results of which were presented in 2014, was to provide a landscape of existing capabilities, propose possible common requirements, derive shortfalls based on a gap analysis, and propose recommendations to solve them. As regards Diving Training, the study made several recommendations, including to establish a doctrine concerning military diving (starting with air/ship diver), to establish a shared diving regulation to meet the operational needs, to standardise training & operational qualification criteria and to have a common certification process for diving centres. A follow-up to the NTSS study (phase 2) was commissioned in 2017 and completed in December 2017. It delivered, among others, a comprehensive set of data and analyses of Member States’ national diving standards, a common requirements list for ship divers and minimum qualification standards for military divers. The results were presented to EDA’s Project Team Naval Training in January 2018. Based on the extended NTSS study and the conclusions of a diving workshop held in La Spezia (Italy) in September 2017, EDA launched a new project in spring 2018 in order to design and conduct a course module to harmonise European ship diving and ship-based rescue diving standards and practices. The overall objective is the identification, recognition and mutual certification of common EU military diving standards.   Showcase event held in Toulon As part of that ongoing project, and in order to test and confirm the practical implications involved in joint diving training and operation, an EDA ‘showcase event’ was held on 3 April 2019 in the harbour of St.Mandrier, near Toulon (France). Four diving teams from Germany, Spain, Poland and Romania participated in this exercise, as well as high ranking naval officers from Bulgaria, France, Germany, Spain, Ireland, Poland and Romania. The aim was to conduct joint interventions under real conditions based on realistic naval incident scenarios and to demonstrate how the proposed common standards would successfully work in practice. As an example: Romanian and Polish divers worked hand in hand to recover an anchor while Spanish and a German diving team jointly inspected a Frigate’s hull and performed repair work on a pier using heavy underwater welding equipment. The practical part of the event was complemented by a static display of different equipment and procedures ashore. The event was hailed as a great success by all participants.  EDA’s Project Team Naval Training was encouraged to continue promoting the identified standards and seek their swift endorsement by EU Member States as a next step.  Commodore Michael Malone, Flag Officer Commanding the Irish Naval Service, who attended the event commented that “EU common diving standards will facilitate greater pooling and sharing of diving training across Member States, while enhancing interoperability”.  (picture: Défense Conseil International, DCI)	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/08/01/towards-european-military-diving-training-standards

EDA_NEWS_0071	2019-07-02	NEWS	ESMAB meeting focussed on civil & military collaboration in Single European Sky	 The EDA SES Military Aviation Board (ESMAB) today held its 7th meeting at policy level. The meeting, which took place at the EUROCONTROL premises, was chaired by EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq. The meeting was attended by the European Commission’s Director General for Mobility and Transport, Henrik Hololei, the Chairman of the EU Military Committee (EUMC), General Claudio Graziano, the Director General of Eurocontrol, Eamonn Brennon, the Commission Director for Aviation, Filip Cornelis, as well as representatives from a wide range of key aviation stakeholders, notably the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the SESAR Joint Undertaking (SJU), the SESAR Deployment Manager (SDM), NATO, the European Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment (EUROCAE), the Performance Review Body (PRB) and the AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD). Also present were representatives from the four countries EDA has concluded Administrative Agreements with (Norway, Switzerland, Serbia, Ukraine). The ESMAB policy level is comprising Member States’ military aviation authorities or equivalent. The meeting allowed participants to have an informal high-level exchange of views between the main civil and military actors involved in this domain, with a particular focus on the challenges and opportunities for civil and military collaboration in on Single European Sky.  One of the operational conclusions of the meeting was that the ESMAB agreed to support the document “U-Space, Drones and Military Low-Level Flights” including its annex “Operations for traffic below 500ft AGL: a Military view” and to use this document at national and EU level, as a basis to increase awareness of and support for the interests of military aviation in the framework of U-Space developments. This document will be updated as a living document on a regular basis considering other aspects enlarging the scope of the analysis. The Board also welcomed the EDA-EASA guidelines for the accommodation of military instruments flight rules (IFR) for MALE RPAS under GAT (airspace classes A-C) outside segregated airspace and agreed to use the guidelines as a reference for the accommodation of MALE-type RPAS within the European airspace.. Regarding Higher Airspace Operations, the ESMAB agreed to Support the European Defence Agency activities to monitor the work led by EASA as regard the regulatory framework and the work led by SESAR Joint Undertaking and EUROCONTROL as regards the concept of operations for Higher Airspace. The ESMAB management was also tasked, with the support of EDA, to further investigate the need to establish of a working group involving Member States representatives, as well as representatives of relevant civil and military organisations (NATO, ECTL, EASA, ICAO, etc.) with the objective to together address the cyber security challenges for the air domain, and to revert to the ESMAB (policy level) with a proposal. The next policy level meeting of the ESMAB is scheduled for end of January 2020.   Background An EDA SES Military Aviation Board (ESMAB) was created by the European Defence Agency Steering Board on 30 September 2015. Ever since, ESMAB meets at two level : - management/expert level and executive/policy level. Rules and regulations of the civilian world can have an important impact on the military. Consequently, EDA is now recognised as the interface between Member States, EU institutions and agencies. A prominent example is the impact the Single European Sky and its related regulations have on the military. EDA, in its role of interface and facilitator of the coordination of military views is making the military voices heard in this important modernisation process through its successful cooperation with the European Commission, Eurocontrol, and other key EU bodies and agencies involved in SES. This is also achieved thanks to EDA participating Member States’ commitment to the ESMAB which held its first meeting in May 2016.   More information:  EDA in Single European Sky (project page) The Military In SES / SESAR    	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/07/02/esmab-meeting-focussed-on-civil-military-collaboration-in-single-european-sky
EDA_NEWS_0072	2019-07-08	NEWS	Cyber defence organisations met at EDA	 Senior officials of the four organisations signatories of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), the European Defence Agency (EDA), the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) and the Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU Institutions, Bodies and Agencies (CERT-EU) met today at the EDA premises. The purpose of the meeting was to update each other on relevant developments and to assess the progress made so far in the implementation of the MoU. The Memorandum, signed in May 2018, provides a framework for cooperation through which the four organisations can leverage synergies  in order to achieve a safe and open cyberspace and to promote civil & military synergies.  Significant progress has been achieved since the MoU entered into effect in June 2018, notably a continuous exchange of views on top cybersecurity aspects (including policy, technical, operational items), reciprocal participation to events and a better understanding by respective staff of how the four organisations can work together.. The collaboration roadmap prepared by the MoU working group, which contains concrete activities and deliverables scheduled throughout 2019, has been reflected in the signatories' respective work programmes, ensuring improved coherence. The main focus of the roadmap is on training and cyber exercises, building on the cooperation capacity and the improved exchange of information on respective projects and events. The aim is to complement the respective work of the four partners and avoid duplication of efforts, also taking into account broader EU initiatives in the cyber domain.    As part of the cooperation, the four partners are planning to organise another major event in the second part of 2020. They also want to pay additional attention to improving incident response mechanisms and processes as well as increased joint participations at high visibility events in the Cybersecurity and Cyber Defence area.   More information: Four EU cybersecurity organisations enhance cooperation  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/07/08/cyberdefence-agencies-met-at-eda
EDA_NEWS_0073	2019-07-05	NEWS	New ‘Round Robin Test’ launched to enhance ammunition safety standards	 Picture: vibration test on a munitions lot Last June, EDA’s 2019 ‘Round Robin Test’ was launched with the participation of nine laboratories from seven EDA Member States (Poland, the Netherlands, Finland, France, Germany, Lithuania, Cyprus) as well as from Norway (which has signed an Administrative Agreement with the Agency). The initiative is designed to compare test results obtained in different Member States laboratories working on ammunition safety. These multinational tests, organised on a yearly basis under the auspices of EDA, are a central tool established by the European Network of National Safety authorities on Ammunition (ENNSA) whose objective is to enhance cooperation and interoperability between national authorities in charge of ammunition safety.  In a Round Robin Test (RTT), the results of different laboratories are all considered to be at the same level of quality: the intent is thus not to verify the accuracy of the results obtained from each and every laboratory by comparing them with the reference exact result, but rather to verify the dispersion of the data and the possibility of using a certain standard to obtain reliable results (within a certain range of errors considered tolerable), under different conditions. Therefore, what is evaluated in an RRT is the standard itself, not the performance of the laboratories. A successful RRT provides the assurance that the standard used is suitable to generate ‘reproducible’ results. A failed test, on the other hand, can help to highlight the need to amend and/or supplement the standard. Focus on Energetic Materials This year’s RRT is focused on the characterization of Energetic Materials, which are key components of any kind of ammunition, and more specifically on propellants (single-base nitrocellulose) and high explosives (HMX). All nine participating laboratories will soon receive samples from the same explosive batch and will be required to perform identical tests, all referring to explosive sensitivity and thermal stability, in particular: impact sensitivity, friction sensitivity, Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Heat Flow Calorimetry (HFC), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). The test is led by one of the most experienced European laboratories in this field, the Polish Laboratory of Combat Assets Testing of the Military Institute of Armament Technology (MIAT), located in Zielonka, near Warsaw. Coordinator of this test is Agata Kamieńska-Duda, Head of MIAT’S Ammunition Test Laboratory.   Room for improvement Bogdan Krysiński, the current chairman of ENNSA, is responsible in MIAT for testing ammunition after long-term storage. He insists on the substantial added value provided by the annual Round Robin Tests initiative but also believes it could be further improved.  “The RRT initiative is very valuable in many aspects. First of all, it allows everybody to compare research capabilities among the institutes and exchange experience among the researchers. However, it would be wrong to claim this is enough. Science never stops. Better methods of ammunition performance should be continuously sought for in order to provide a more precise assessment of its safety and operational reliability”, he commented.  “For many types of ammunition and their components it will be probably necessary to introduce a broader scope of testing than that used within the current RRT. Another issue is the need to develop unambiguous templates of documents for the preparation of the tests, as well as for the recording and reporting of the test results. Recent experiences confirm the importance of this. Continuous improvement of the Round Robin Test programme is thus something we should keep in mind for the benefit of all”, he stated.   Background In 2010 the EDA Steering Board approved the establishment of the European Network of National Safety authorities on Ammunition (ENNSA) with the primary task to facilitate communication among the national bodies which are in charge of ammunition safety. The focus of ENNSA, as agreed by its members, was to explore the harmonisation of ammunition qualification to improve interoperability and increase cooperation among Member States, in parallel with achieving savings across the ammunition production/procurement cycle. One of the basic tools designed for this purpose is the Round Robin Test (RRT) programme.  It serves to compare and validate test results obtained in different laboratories of the Member States working within the area of ammunition safety.    	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/07/05/new-round-robin-test-launched-to-enhance-ammunition-safety-standards
EDA_NEWS_0074	2019-06-27	NEWS	Strategic Context Cases approved for implementation of EU Capability Development Priorities	 EDA’s Steering Board in Capability Directors composition today endorsed the first edition of the Strategic Context Cases (SCC) which will guide the practical implementation of the 11 EU Capability Development Priorities approved by EDA Member States in June 2018. The SCC should ensure the priorities are implemented in a way that improves the coherence of the European capability landscape and leads to cooperative projects which contribute to close identified capability shortfalls. The 11 SCC – one for every priority agreed last year (*) – describe in concrete terms what the current capability situation is, including the activities planned or already ongoing at national and/or multinational level in order to address the shortfalls. The outcomes of the NATO Defence Planning Process and the activities undertaken in the context of the Framework Nations Concept (FNC) are also taken into account in order to ensure coherence of output and avoid unnecessary duplication. The SCC highlight in particular the major challenges to the coherence of the European capability landscape in each of these areas in the short, medium and long term. “We all know that there are pressing capability challenges across the whole spectrum. For example, there is a growing threat from the use of mini-drones to our military forces”, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq commented. “The SCC will provide concrete and tangible gains across the Member States in addressing this issue in the short, medium and long term”. They also provide guidance to address these challenges by offering ‘avenues of approach’ for potential cooperation between participating Member States that could help achieve the priorities and improve the coherence of the European capability landscape. The SCC are integrating documents: each of them also reflects the R&T priorities identified in the Overarching Strategic Research Agenda (OSRA) and related R&T activities linked to each capability priority. Cross references of the SCC to the Key Strategic Activities (KSA) which are considered important for the implementation of the priority such as technologies, skills and industrial manufacturing capacities will be added once the KSA reports are approved by the Steering Board. To prepare the SCC, EDA worked closely with Member States, the EU Military Committee (EUMC), the EU Military Staff (EUMS) and European industry which was consulted to collect their views on technological solutions to close identified capability gaps and face the new security challenges. The Agency also ran staff to staff meetings with NATO to ensure activities developed by participating Member States within NATO are correctly reflected. The next step in the elaboration of the first edition of the SCC will happen in February 2020 when EDA will present to the Steering Board part two of the SCC containing roadmaps of ongoing capability development activities and possible new ones which, subject to the necessary ad-hoc decisions by Member States, could be taken forward in the Agency framework. The SCC are living documents and will be updated by EDA over time, also on the basis of Member States’ feedback, to make sure they always reflect the latest developments in the implementation of each and every priority.   Background In June 2018, the EDA Steering Board in Capability Directors formation endorsed the 2018 Capability Development Plan (CDP) and approved the 2018 EU Capability Development Priorities. In their Council conclusions adopted on 25 June 2018, Member States agreed that “these priorities, as a key reference for Member States' and EU's capability development, will inform CARD, PESCO and the European Defence Fund, which bring a step-change in defence cooperation, thus contributing to coherence among these three distinct but mutually reinforcing initiatives”. The June 2018 Steering Board also tasked the Agency to start the preparatory work for the implementation of the 2018 EU Capability Development Priorities, including with a view to the elaboration of SCC. In November 2018, the Steering Board tasked the Agency to proceed with the development of the SCC and to come up with a first edition by June 2019. Endorsed by the Steering Board, the SCC will now be forwarded to the Council as agreed by the Member States in the Council conclusions of 17 June 2019.   More information:  2018 EU Capability Development Priorities (EDA brochure) CDP factsheet   (*) The 11 EU Capability Development Priorities approved by Member States in 2018 relate to the following domains: Ground Combat Capabilities Enhanced Logistic and Medical Supporting Capabilities Naval Manoeuvrability Underwater Control contributing to resilience at Sea Air Superiority Air Mobility Integration of Military Air Capabilities in a changing Aviation Sector Enabling capabilities for cyber responsive operation Space-based information and communication services Information Superiority Cross-Domain Capabilities contributing to achieve EU’s Level of Ambition.     	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/06/27/strategic-context-cases-approved-for-implementation-of-eu-capability-development-priorities

EDA_NEWS_0076	2019-06-12	NEWS	Launch of the Consultation Forum Third Phase	 Jorge Domecq, EDA Chief Executive and Dominique Ristori, European Commission Director-General for Energy announced today in the presence of Mr Gabriel-Beniamin Leș, Minister of National Defence of Romania the initiation of the Third Phase of the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector (CF SEDSS III). The announcement was made in the margins of the 4th CF SEDSS II Conference which is held under the Romanian Presidency of the Council of the European Union and hosted by the Romanian Ministry of National Defence.  The EDA Chief Executive emphasised that “the Agency’s interest in energy has been increasing in the last years, primarily because the Ministries of Defence have identified the importance of this topic, and because of how energy affects and will change our life in the future”. As he pointed out, “disruptive technologies and new business models are reshaping the energy ecosystem and the defence sector needs to be part of this”. New trends such as digitalisation, electrification, innovative energy technologies in battery storage, smart buildings, electric vehicles, artificial intelligence, integrated energy management systems as well as unknown malicious and hybrid threats require the defence sector not only to adapt to the fast-paced changing security environment but also to be able to recover when compromised. Mr Ristori remarked that “all strands of the EU’s energy policy -energy efficiency, renewables, security of supply, interconnections- have an impact on our common European defence. That is why I believe the start of Phase III is an important step forward which reaffirms the Commission’s strong commitment to address our common energy challenges in close cooperation with the European Defence Agency”. He also said that “by improving the way the defence and security sector uses energy, new real economic opportunities can arise, creating jobs and growth for all Europeans”. Phase III will continue pursuing the implementation of the EU legal framework on energy and will reaffirm the Consultation Forum as the appropriate vehicle to share best practice, information and experiences among the EU Ministries of Defence. With the support of the European Commission the Forum will bring closer the defence and energy communities with a view to improving energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy sources, and the protection of defence energy-related critical infrastructures. Building on the know-how of the previous Phases and with the aim of adapting to future energy dynamics, Phase III will foresee the creation of a new ad-hoc transversal working group, which will cover the thematic activities on energy management and finance as well as a novel category on state-of-the-art technologies affecting the energy-defence dimension. Phase III is expected to enable economic, operational and strategic results within the context of project ideas, guidelines, and action plans that can assist Ministries of Defence to apply more affordable, resilient, and sustainable energy models at the national level. To address such objectives, the Agency will implement several multi-dimensional activities ranging from high-level conferences and thematic workshops to table-top exercises. Phase III will also be underpinned by the organisation of Energy Technology Solutions events engaging the civil sector, the industry and academia to ensure that the Forum keeps pace with the leading-edge developments in energy. With the support of the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Energy and the collaboration of the members of the Forum, the Agency will focus its work on how to better support Ministries of Defence to enhance strategic autonomy and resilience through a diversity of options within the nexus of the European Energy eco-system including the European defence dimension.   More information: About CF SEDSS II  Defence Energy Data 2016 & 2017 (EDA factsheet) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/06/12/launch-of-the-consultation-forum-third-phase
EDA_NEWS_0077	2019-06-12	NEWS	Successful completion of the Second Phase of the Energy Defence Consultation Forum	 Over 130 experts from 27 European countries and more than 20 different institutions and organisations participate in the 4th Conference of the Second Phase of the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector (CF SEDSS II) in Bucharest. The Conference, which is held under the Romanian Presidency of the Council of the European Union and hosted by the Romanian Ministry of National Defence, marks the successful completion of the Second Phase of the CF SEDSS II initiated in October 2017. Today’s conference was officially opened by Mr Gabriel-Beniamin Leș, Minister of National Defence of Romania, Mr Dominique Ristori, European Commission Director-General for Energy and Mr Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency (EDA). Mr Jorge Domecq, EDA Chief Executive, emphasised in his speech that the “Bucharest conference marks the successful completion of a project which proved that sustainable energy matters for defence and that greener defence energy matters for the European Union”. The Chief Executive expressed his satisfaction “as the Consultation Forum has enabled directly or indirectly several Ministries of Defence to develop national defence energy strategies, implement Energy Management Systems, launch projects related to energy performance and consider initiating joint collaborative projects to address common energy challenges”.  European Commission’s Directorate General for Energy (DG ENER) and the Executive Agency for SMEs (EASME) contributed to the work of the Forum by providing an EU long-term perspective on EU energy legislation, policy and action plans. With the support of the European Commission, the defence sector has come closer to the wider energy community and joined the Union’s efforts to transit to an Energy Union. Mr Dominique Ristori, European Commission Director-General for Energy acknowledged in his introductory speech, “the substantial work of the Ministries of Defence to apply sustainable energy in the defence sector and to pursue the implementation of the EU legal framework on energy”.  The second Phase of the Forum developed a more practical defence-centric approach and focused on a range of activities such as improving energy management and energy efficiency of military building stock and fixed infrastructure, the integration of energy sources in defence infrastructure and the protection of defence-related critical energy infrastructure against hybrid threats. During Phase II the working groups collected more than 30 project ideas, of which 18 were elaborated to comprehensive project proposals. To support their realisation, the Agency applied an internal methodology called “IdentiFunding for Energy”, which matched these ideas with more than 30 eligible funding opportunities, enhancing the probability of their implementation. As a first step, the Agency is currently supporting Ministries of Defence to prepare three (3) applications for funding. Mr Domecq announced that “EDA is ready to allocate additional budget to support at least five (5) other applications demonstrating the commitment of the Agency to meet the expectation of the Ministries of Defence in producing tangible results”.   Next Conference The Bucharest Conference marked the finalisation of the Second Phase of the Consultation Forum. Currently, EDA and DG ENER are preparing Phase III. It is expected that the first Conference of Phase III will take place during the first quarter of 2020. In the meantime, EDA and DG ENER are also organising a Joint Defence Energy Conference to be held at the end of 2019 in Brussels in preparation of phase III. More information will be uploaded on the EDA’s dedicated website “European Defence Energy Network (EDEN)”   About the CF SEDSS II The Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector (CF SEDSS) is a European Commission initiative managed by EDA. It aims at bringing together experts from the defence and energy sectors to share information and best practices on improving energy management, energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy as well increasing the protection and resilience of defence energy-related critical infrastructures. On 20 October 2017, the second phase of the Consultation Forum (CF SEDSS II) was launched.

EDA_NEWS_0078	2019-06-21	NEWS	EDA projects involved in major international logistics exercise	 Two EDA projects - one related to the sharing of spare parts and the other to additive manufacturing (3D-printing) - were involved in the CAPABLE LOGISTICIAN 2019 (CL19) exercise, Europe’s largest international logistics exercise, which took place at the Drawsko Pomorskie training area in the Northwest of Poland from 3-14 June. The event was organised by the Multinational Logistic Coordination Center (MLCC), a multinational sponsored centre for all issues related to multinational logistic cooperation. Some 3,400 troops from 31 countries (including 21 EU Member States) as well as representatives from 11 international organisations participated in this event. The exercise provided participants with a rare opportunity to test and train logistic procedures within a realistic multinational operational context under real life conditions. EDA was present at the exercise with two projects: the Sharing of Spare Parts project (SoSP) launched in 2015 by 12 EDA Member States. In a nutshell, it provides a simplified request-and-response mechanism for the exchange of military services and spare parts between the participating MoDs, based on agreed standards. It offers different ways to compensate for the loan of equipment, including through a barter mechanism. Using the SoSP process is cost-free for contributing Member States. A dedicated SoSP handbook has been developed, setting common standards and processes. The reason why SoSP was brought to the CAPABLE LOGISTICIAN 2019 exercise in Poland was to test and validate its accuracy and applicability, which was done with success.  Now that it has been validated, the SoSP process handbook is considered ‘mission proven’ and ready to be used by the contributing Member States’ MoDs. the Additive Manufacturing (AM) project. AM is widely considered as a potential game-changer as it could, inter alia, help reduce the logistic footprint of military missions. In 2018, EDA commissioned a feasibility study on AM with regard to EDA R&T activities. As a follow-up step to move onward from R&T to capability development, EDA proposed to Member States to test AM during a military exercise under real-life conditions. Together with France and Spain, EDA prepared the AM test which took place during the CAPABLE LOGISTICIAN 2019 exercise. Concretely, EDA deployed an AM Demonstrator in the form of a 20 ft standard container equipped with PolyJet and Fused Deposition Modelling technologies, 3-D scanner and appropriate software. Prior to the exercise, specific spare parts for military assets used at the exercise were identified by France and Spain. All of them could be printed during the exercise. Furthermore, the exercise showed that using a 20 ft container for the printing ensures logistical flexibility in the operational support and reduces the logistic footprint of a military operation. AM is thus a useful alternative to classical warehousing in military logistic supply chains, ensuring increased availability of spare parts, considerable time and cost savings as well as operational flexibility. During the CAPABLE LOGISTICIAN 2019 Visitors Days, EDA had the opportunity to present AM as a potential technology for military purposes and has received a lot of positive feedback. The discussions during the Visitors Days underlined the necessity of establishing a forum within EDA for subject matter experts to exchange experiences and discuss logistic processes, technology developments and legislative issues to further promote AM and support Member States in their efforts to better use the AM potential to develop a military capability, as also highlighted in the 2018 Capability Development Plan (CDP) and the subsequent Strategic Context Cases (SCCs).   More information: EDA factsheet - Additive Manufacturing (3D-Printing) Feasibility Study & Technology Demonstration 3D-printing community explores applications for defence EDA’s 3D-Printing project for Energetic Materials launched 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/06/21/eda-projects-involved-in-major-international-logistics-exercise
EDA_NEWS_0079	2019-06-25	NEWS	A special edition for a special occasion: the new EDA magazine is out!	 The latest European Defence Matters magazine (N°17) is now available. This special edition is entirely focused on the European Defence Agency’s 15th Anniversary which is being celebrated this summer. Together with previous and current stakeholders, decision-makers and partners, we look back at how the Agency has evolved over the past 15 years, what it has achieved so far and what its future prospects are.  This special 15th Anniversary edition is already available in PDF and will soon also be accessible via online version. After a foreword by Federica Mogherini, the Head of the Agency, the magazine reviews the events and developments in 2002/2003 (European Convention, Thessaloniki European Council, etc.) which led to the creation of the Agency in 2004. Javier Solana, the first EU High Representative for the Common and Security Policy (1999-2009) and first Head of EDA (2004-2009), also shares his recollections and analyses in an interesting and exclusive article for European Defence Matters. We also sat down with those who, as Chief Executives, have steered the Agency through 15 exciting yet challenging years: Nick Witney (2004-2007), Claude-France Arnould (2011-2015) and Jorge Domecq who is currently (since 2015) in charge. Alexander Weis, who served as Chief Executive from 2007-2011, could unfortunately not attend this joint interview. Member States’ views on EDA’s role and achievements in EU Defence are represented in this magazine by Finnish Defence Minister Antii Kaikkonen who explains in his contribution why the Agency is “the right intergovernmental platform for joint capability prioritisation, planning and development”. In a series of six articles, we then describe and assess what can probably be considered as EDA’s main achievements over the past 15 years during which the Agency has established itself as: - the main architect of EU defence capability priorities; - the manager of European defence research; - the European hub for multinational capability development; - the military voice and interface for EU policies; - Europe’s training pitch for enhanced interoperability; - the guardian of coherence among the newly set-up EU defence cooperation tools. In the ‘Industry Talk’ section, MBDA’s new CEO Eric Béranger shares his views on how European defence cooperation in Europe (and EDA’s role in it) have evolved over the past 15 years and what the industrial prospects and challenges are for the future. He also touches upon the implementation of the recent EU defence initiatives (CARD, PESCO, EDF). The NATO view on European defence, EDA and EU/NATO cooperation is provided for this magazine by former NATO Assistant Secretary General for Defence Policy & Planning, Heinrich Brauss, who is now a Senior Associate Fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP). Thoughts and reflections by representatives of some of EDA’s main partner organisations as well as a very interesting and inspiring outlook analysis (‘Quo Vadis EDA?’) by Dick Zandee, Head of the Security Unit of the research department of the Clingendael Institute in The Hague) round off this very special European Defence Matters magazine.      Have a look immediately – and enjoy!   More information: Special 15th Anniversary edition - European Defence Matters N°17 (PDF)  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/06/25/a-special-edition-for-a-special-occasion-the-new-eda-magazine-is-out!
EDA_NEWS_0080	2019-06-25	NEWS	Stakeholders and partners gather for EDA’s 15th Anniversary	" EDA today celebrated its 15th Anniversary with a ceremony in its premises attended by the Head of the Agency, Federica Mogherini, high representatives (Ministers, Deputy Ministers, State Secretaries, Chiefs of Defence, Ambassadors) from its 27 Member States and the four associated countries, the Chairman of the EU Military Committee, Deputy Secretary-Generals of the EEAS, the Director General of the EU Military Staff, several European Commissioners and Commission Director-Generals, Executive Directors and senior officials of all EU institutions and agencies, NATO senior representatives as well representatives from the European defence industry and the media.   In her commemoration speech, Federica Mogherini, the Head of the Agency, recalled the tremendous progress made in European defence cooperation over recent years - especially since the publication of the EU Global Strategy in 2016 - and stressed the role played by EDA in this endeavour. “Five years ago, no-one imagined how far we would come. European defence cooperation has expanded like never before. We have created the instruments to make European defence cooperation become the norm. And the Agency has been at the core of all our work and of all the progress that we have achieved together”, she stated. “All this work wasn't just long overdue. It was urgent and necessary. All of our Member States, today, need European cooperation to guarantee the security of our citizens. European defence is first and foremost about the security of European citizens”. With CARD, PESCO and the European Defence Fund (EDF), the EU has put in place the tools it needs to enhance defence cooperation and make it work for the benefit of a stronger and more efficient, coherent and interoperable European defence. “The European Defence Agency has made essential contributions to crafting these initiatives all along the way, and it is now central in their implementation. The Agency is the secretariat for both the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence and on PESCO, together with the European External Action Service and the EU Military Staff. And you are working with Member States so that their defence budgets incorporate our common Capability Development Plan"", Ms Mogherini said. ""In these years, I have seen this Agency grow and adapt to new tasks and challenges – and let me thank everyone who works here for your professionalism and flexibility. Your role is now more important than ever, and it will be essential to ensure that EDA always has the means to fulfil its new tasks"", she added.  The Head of the Agency concluded by saying: ""It was a privilege for me to be Head of the Defence Agency in this extraordinary moment for European defence. It has been an honour to lead the Agency in these five years, and up until its fifteenth birthday. And whatever will happen next, I know that there are some great professionals here, working every day to make our cooperation more effective, our industry stronger, and our continent more secure.So let me thank you for these years together, and happy birthday to everyone at EDA"".     “EDA is and will remain a central institution of European defence” Previously, in his opening address as the representative of the rotating Presidency of the Council of the EU, Romanian Defence Minister Gabriel-Beniamin Leș commended the Agency “for its substantial contribution and support to European Defence efforts” throughout the past 15 years. EDA is nowadays recognised as a “key player” in advancing the EU’s role in security and defence, he said. The Agency’s Long-Term Review was “natural” and necessary to keep it fit for purpose. The enhancement of the Agency proved relevant, especially when looking at the crucial role EDA plays nowadays as part of the CARD and PESCO secretariats and in the implementation of the EU defence initiatives in general, the Minister stated.  “We encourage the Agency to continue to support the development of a common understanding regarding the new EU defence initiatives, including the possibilities of simplifying the processes and rules, to continue pursuing coherence of these initiatives and to further contribute to the coherence of output and timelines between relevant EU and NATO processes”, Mr Leș stated. Member States, too, have to change and adapt the way they do defence planning, he said. “PESCO, CARD, EDF are not just political initiative, but they need to become national defence planning instruments. We count on EDA support in this regard”. The Minister, who thanked for the “excellent cooperation” during the Romanian EU Presidency, concluded by saying: “EDA is and will remain a central institution of European defence. As an intergovernmental organisation, it will continue to be closely attached to the needs of the Member States, and this is the main feature that we need to preserve. Romania will remain a strong supporter of EDA as it has always been. You can count on us”.    Working for more coherent European capability landscape In his welcome words to the 200 external guests and EDA staff, Chief Executive Jorge Domecq stressed that since its creation in July 2004, the Agency and the 700 colleagues who worked for it over the past 15 years were always (and still are) driven by one central commitment: to help Member States improve their defence capabilities through cooperation, by working together. “Our mission is very clear: to support Member States in the development of their defence capabilities. All our work is geared towards making this mission a reality”, he said. The Agency can be proud of what it has achieved so far in circumstances that were difficult at times, he said. Not only has it established itself as the “main architect of EU defence capability priorities” thanks to the roles it plays in steering the Capability Development Plan process, the Overarching Strategic Research Agenda and the identification of Europe’s Key Strategic Activities, but it is also recognised as Europe’s central hub for multinational capability development and manager of collaborative defence research, as Europe’s common training ground for common enhanced interoperability as well as the military’s voice and interface in other EU policies. Most importantly, EDA is increasingly seen as the guardian of coherence among the new EU defence initiatives (CARD, PESCO, EDF). “I am proud of the impact this house makes, in the interest of a more coherent European capability landscape owned and used by our Member States”, Mr Domecq said, calling Member States to make “full use of EDA’s potential”.   More information Special 15th anniversary edition of ‘European Defence Matters’ magazine Speech by Federica Mogherini, Head of EDA (video) Speech by Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive 15th anniversary photo gallery  "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/06/25/stakeholders-and-partners-gather-for-eda-s-15th-anniversary

EDA_NEWS_0082	2019-06-07	NEWS	‘Dark Blade 2019’ successfully completed	 Dark Blade 2019, already the 13th multinational training organised under EDA’s Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP), was successfully completed last week at Náměšť airbase in the Czech Republic. A total of 29 air assets from Belgium (3 A-109 and 3 NH-90), Czech Republic (5 Mi-24, 6 Mi-171 and 4 L-159 “Alca”), Germany (3 CH-53), Hungary (3 Mi-24 and 2 Mi-27), Slovenia (1 AS-532) and Poland (1 W-3A) were involved in the exercise, as well as around 1,200 military staff. Observers from Serbia, the Netherlands, Sweden and the Joint Air Power Competence Centre (JAPCC) also attended. Furthermore, a multinational Joint Tactical Air Controller (JTAC) team and an Electronic Warfare (EW) emulator system were also involved. A mentor team encompassing helicopter tactics instructors from Austria, Sweden, the Netherlands and the UK supported the academic part of the exercise and provided mentoring and standardisation during the planning and execution phases of all Composite Air Operations (COMAO) missions. The main objective of DB19 was the performance of 8 day/night COMAO missions in a realistic, harsh and complex environment, as well as to carry out specific training as evasion training, live firing, formation flights, paratrooper and scuba jumps, rappelling and fast roping. In total, some 290 flights were performed amounting to around 500 flight hours.  A Distinguished Visitors Day was organized on 28 May, attended by Czech Defence Minister Lubomir Metnar, the President of the Czech Senate, Jaroslav Kubera, as well as other military and civilian authorities. During the closing ceremony on 30 May, EDA’s Project Officer Rotary Wing, José Pablo Romera, thanked the Czech Air Force, and in particular 22nd HAB Náměšť Airbase Commander, Col Miroslav Svoboda and all his team, for the outstanding organisation and execution of the exercise. A special thanks also went to all the participants for their proactive involvement and cooperative mindset which resulted in the achievement of the expected training objectives. The next EDA helicopter exercise, ‘Swift Blade 2020’, will take place in April 2020 and will be jointly hosted by The Netherlands and Belgium, with Gilze-Rijen Air Base as the main location.   Background A decade ago, the multinational helicopter training cooperation started in EDA with the aim of improving the European helicopter operational capability for crisis management operations and prepare helicopter crews for deployments by providing them advanced helicopter tactics training. Over time, requirements related to interoperability and training standardisation have been added to ensure that training does not only improve national readiness, but also supports multinational cooperation. Since 2009, 13 Blade exercises held in eight different European countries (France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Finland, Hungary and Czech Republic), 9 helicopter tactics symposiums, 63 Helicopter Tactics Courses, 6 Helicopter Tactics Instructors Courses and several other training activities, as COMAO planning courses and the EW courses have been carried out under EDA management and involving 15 EDA Member States. The outcome of all those trainings is a high level of operational interoperability and helicopter cooperation among a large number of EDA member states. The next important step will be the transfer of all those activities and programmes (HEP, HTC and HTIC) to a future Multinational Helicopter Training Centre (MHTC) by end of 2021.   More information DARK BLADE factsheet DARK BLADE kicks off in the Czech Republic (EDA webnews) Helicopter Initiatives (EDA project page) HOT BLADE 2018 improved joint and combined helicopter training (EDA news)  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/06/07/dark-blade-2019-successfully-completed

EDA_NEWS_0084	2019-05-14	NEWS	Outcome of EDA Ministerial Steering Board	 The European Defence Agency’s (EDA) ministerial Steering Board met this Tuesday afternoon under the chairmanship of the Head of the Agency, Federica Mogherini. Defence ministers discussed the Head of Agency’s report on the implementation of EDA’s long-term review and of the statute of the Agency agreed in 2015. They also tasked EDA to pursue its work in key research and capability development domains. In the margins of the meeting, a new military mobility programme on cross-border movement permissions was signed.    Implementation of EDA’s long-term review and the 2015 Council decision   Ministers welcomed the presentation by the Head of Agency of the report on the implementation of the conclusions and recommendations of EDA’s long term review (LTR, endorsed in May 2017) which reinforced EDA’s mission on three aspects: as the main intergovernmental prioritisation instrument at EU level in support of capability development; as the preferred cooperation forum and management support structure at EU level to engage in technology and capability development activities; and as a central operator with regard to EU funded defence-related activities and military voice in wider EU polices. In parallel to the implementation of the Council decision of 2015, the LTR adjustments allowed EDA to adapt to the fast-changing European defence landscape and the new requirements stemming from the EU defence initiatives that followed the 2016 EU Global Strategy: CARD, PESCO, European Defence Fund.    Reflecting the Head of Agency’s report, Ministers acknowledged the important support role EDA plays in the implementation of these initiatives as well as in ensuring coherence among them. They tasked the Agency to continue its coordination with the European External Action Services (EEAS including EU Military Staff), the EU Military Committee and the European Commission in their respective areas of responsibility, and to pursue coherence of output and avoidance of unnecessary duplication with NATO.  The Steering Board agreed to revert to the review of the 2015 Council decision on EDA’s statute, seat and operational rules in 2020.   Implementation of EDA’s key taskings and next steps Ministers were also provided with a comprehensive update on the progress made in the numerous technology and capability development activities currently underway in the Agency. It shows that EDA manages a constantly growing number of projects and programmes which is set to even further increase in the future, also as a result of Member States’ request for support on PESCO projects.  Among the many research and technology domains in which EDA is active, a particular emphasis was put on Artificial intelligence (AI). In order to better understand the potential future military applications of AI, Ministers agreed on a two-step approach. The first phase will see the creation of a specific EDA cross-Directorate ad-hoc team which will develop a “AI Definition, Taxonomy and Glossary Document”, as well as increased collaboration with EU stakeholders (especially the Commission) and the launch of an Innovation Prize in the area of AI. The second step, later this year, will consist of in-depth analyses of concrete AI defence applications in areas where capability gaps exist. Ministers also welcomed the Agency’s contribution to the identification of initial lessons related to the 2018 revision of the Capability Development Plan (CDP), the CARD Trial Run, the first PESCO projects and the Preparatory Action on Defence Research. These lessons identified should be reflected and taken into account, as appropriate, in the further development of the defence initiatives, it was stressed.  The Steering Board also asked the Agency to pursue the implementation of the 2018 EU Capability Development Priorities through robust and output-driven Strategic Context Cases (SCCs). EDA was asked to present to Capability Directors in June 2019 for endorsement the landscaping part of the SCCs, including their avenues of approach to tackle the capability shortfalls and lack of coherence in the European defence landscape, in order to inform the further implementation of the EU defence initiatives. The Agency was also invited to present to the Steering Board in February 2020 detailed roadmaps with objectives and milestones for those activities that, subject to the necessary ad-hoc decisions by Member States, could be taken forward in the Agency framework.    Military Mobility In the margins of the Steering Board, ministers also signed the new EDA programme on “Optimising cross border movement permission in Europe” (see related news here). The programme aims at decreasing the administrative burden for military movement in the framework of the Agency’s work on military mobility.   EDA press contacts: Elisabeth SCHOEFFMANN Head of Media & Communication elisabeth.schoeffmann@eda.europa.eu T+32 470 87 01 65 Helmut BRULS Media & Communications Officer helmut.bruls@eda.europa.eu T+32 2 504 28 10              	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/05/14/outcome-of-eda-ministerial-steering-board

EDA_NEWS_0086	2019-05-13	NEWS	European industry gathers at EDA for workshop on Leo2 MBT	 Last April, the OMBT-Leo 2 programme entered a new phase with the publication of a call to European industry to participate in a Preliminary Market Consultation (PMC). Industry is invited to respond to the PMC not later than 18 July 2019. On this matter, EDA encourages EU defence industry to establish European multinational cross-border industrial partnerships as the preferred mechanism to exploit this opportunity. Additionally, EDA considers the OMBT-Leo2 programme as a suitable vehicle for enhanced access for sid-caps/small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to the European cross-border supply chains. In order to support the PMC, EDA organised today (13 May) a business-to-business (B2B) workshop to encourage industry to consider the establishment of business relationships between potential future prime contractors and sub-contractors and / or the formation of related consortia (national or multinational) that will provide the basis for the delivery of a full capability for the OMBT-Leo2 Programme, covering MBT, derivatives, as well as the rest of the Programme aspects (e.g. Integrated Logistics Support, simulation, training, …). EDA’s B2B workshop attracted wide participation: a substantial number of industrial entities (31 in total) covering a wide size range, from major industries down to SMEs, and Leo2 MBT capacities at system and sub-system level, attended the workshop. The B2B workshop proceedings provided a solid opportunity for industries to meet, get known to each other, present their requirements/capabilities, identify potential business opportunities and find the right partners, in view of best preparing for the future implementation of the OMBT-Leo2 Programme. In conclusion, EDA’s B2B workshop successfully fulfilled its mission to promote industrial cross-border cooperation within the EU, especially in view of future enhanced Mid-caps/SMEs’ access to defence contracts and to supply chains of the industrial entities that may be awarded in the future contracts for the implementation of the OMBT-Leo2 Programme.   Background EDA seeks European defence industry’s input on Main Battle Tank optimization – 22 September 2017 Wanted: Industry solutions for optimisation of MBT capabilities – 2 April 2019 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/05/13/european-industry-gathers-at-eda-for-workshop-on-leo2-mbt
EDA_NEWS_0087	2019-05-13	NEWS	European Spartan 2019 C-27J exercise starts in Romania	 Five EDA Member States operating C-27J Spartan military aircraft (Bulgaria, Italy, Lithuania, Slovakia and Romania) participate in the 4th edition of the European Spartan exercise which started today (13 May) at Otopeni airbase in Romania. Observers from other C-27J user countries, such as Greece and even the United States and Australia, also attend the event which runs until 24 May. The aim of the exercise is to increase interoperability among European C27J Spartan operators. It is one of the outcomes of the European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) partnership signed in 2011 by 20 EDA Member States. Designed by EDA and hosted by the Romanian Air Force, the event aims at promoting aircraft user type approaches to harmonise tactics, techniques and procedures as well as to develop more cost-effective solutions to operate and sustain the C27J. The objective is to provide air crews with both academic and flight training as well as to have ground crews developing harmonised procedures to eventually allowing them to perform cross maintenance on each other’s aircraft.  The C-27J Spartan aircraft can perform tactical missions in peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, providing direct air transport to the theatre, day and night. This flying event was developed in the framework of the C27J cooperation concept launched in 2015 by EDA. This concept is looking at developing a far-reaching level of interoperability amongst European C27J operators through a variety of projects in the areas of operations & training, logistics, airworthiness, common procurement and SESAR. The main advantages of EDA’s user groups – that are working in full transparency and cooperate with all other existing user groups led by other organisations, industry and/or service providers – is to group medium and small national fleets to take advantage of economies of scale, to exchange best practices and to be more cost-efficient in operating and sustaining the aircraft.   Media & VIP Days On 22 May, a dedicated Media Day will take place offering journalists the possibility to attend a flying exercise at Boboc Airbase will include the landing of C-27J Spartan aircraft on soil and short-distance tracks, parachuting personnel and materials, cooperation with combat aircraft, airline coordination with land forces and medical evacuation.

EDA_NEWS_0088	2019-05-14	NEWS	23 Member States sign new military mobility programme	 In the margins of today’s EDA Steering Board, 23 Member States (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden) and EDA signed a new programme that will facilitate the granting of cross-border surface and air movement permissions. The programme is developed in the framework of EDA’s work on military mobility. It implements an important part of the ‘Action Plan on Military Mobility’ which was presented by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (HR) and the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council in March 2018. Military mobility is also highlighted in the EU-NATO Joint Declaration signed in Warsaw in 2016. The purpose of the programme signed today is to harmonise different national regulations of the participating Member States. It should allow Member States to reduce the administrative burden associated with different permission procedures and thus significantly shorten the timelines for granting surface and air cross border movement permissions. The programme provides the basis for important activities at technical and procedural level to develop the necessary arrangements for cross border movement per transport mode during crises, preparations for crises, training and day-to-day business. The arrangements cover surface (road, rail and inland waterways) and air movements (Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems, fighter aircraft or helicopters). They are expected to be finalised in 2020.  “Military mobility is about improving the movement of military personnel and assets across and beyond the EU. The high number of Member States participating in this new programme on cross-border movement permissions shows the need to alleviate the administrative burden while fully respecting the sovereignty of Member States”, said Jorge Domecq, EDA’s Chief Executive.   Military mobility Military mobility covers the movement of military personnel and assets from one place to another, including crossing borders by using different modes of transport. The latter is of utmost importance for multinational operations. The capacity to ensure a smooth, efficient and effective movement of military personnel and assets across and beyond the European Union (EU) will enhance the EU’s preparedness and response to crises. It will enable EU Member States to act faster, in line with their defence needs and responsibilities, both in the context of Common Security and Defence Policy missions and operations, and in the framework of national and multinational activities.     EDA’s role in the implementation of the Action Plan EDA is committed to supporting its Member States. The ‘Action Plan on Military Mobility’ builds upon the ‘Roadmap on Military Mobility’ developed by an EDA expert working group which was set up on request of the EDA Member States in September 2017. In addition to the programme on cross border movement permission, the Agency support to Member States comprises another programme on harmonising of military requirements in the customs domain as well as surveys on transportation of dangerous goods and other legal aspects.   Further information: Factsheet on Military Mobility   EDA press contacts:  Elisabeth SCHOEFFMANN Head of Media & Communication elisabeth.schoeffmann@eda.europa.eu T+32 470 87 01 65 Helmut BRULS Media & Communications Officer helmut.bruls@eda.europa.eu T+32 2 504 28 10            	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/05/14/22-member-states-sign-new-military-mobility-programme

A total of 29 air assets (25 helicopters + 4 fixed wing) and some 600 military personnel from six countries - Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia, - will participate in this exercise hosted by the Czech Air Force. DARK BLADE 2019 will allow crews to practice operations in various environment replicating the challenging conditions that participant forces are expected to encounter when deploying to a theatre of operation. The exercise’s main focus will be on enhancing interoperability at the tactical level between helicopter units by using the Composite Air Operations (COMAO) concept in a combined, joint, realistic and challenging environment. Its main objectives are to: enhance tactical interoperability between helicopter units from the participating countries by using the COMAO concept in a combined, joint, realistic and challenging environment and to operate using standard helicopter Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs). The focus will be on Composite Air Operations (COMAO) with live firing and trooping; train and practise TTPs with/against fighter jets and electronic warfare means on the ground; improve interoperability in training and operational tasks with Ground Forces involvement (NVG operations, low level flying, formation flights, FARP training, gunnery, etc.) in a full spectrum environment.   Programme Participating crews will fly diverse day and night COMAO missions and execute Air Assault (AA), Air Interdiction (AI), Air Transport (AT), Close Air Support (CAS), Personnel Recovery (PR) missions, night flights (with/without NVG) and other missions at tactical level. They will also train special procedures like marshalling, fast rope and abseiling techniques, Special Patrol Insertion/Extraction (SPIE), pick-up and drop off procedures, air-to-surface live firing (helicopter door gunnery and sniper training). In addition, DARK BLADE 2019 will provide multiple opportunities to practice multinational training with the Special Operation Forces (e.g. infiltration and exfiltration) and will enhance crews’ skills in using the HEP Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and COMAO planning procedures in the conduct of tactical missions. Six instructors from Austria, Sweden and the United Kingdom trained in EDA’s Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC) accompanied with some Instructors from the Netherlands trained on the Dutch Helicopter Weapon Instructor (HWI) course will jointly form the DARK BLADE 2019 Mentor Team, ready to support the multinational crews during the preparation and execution of the COMAO missions. The EDA’s Chief Instructor (CI) Team will manage and supervise the Mentor Team to ensure consistency and the best possible uptake of lessons learned coming from EDA helicopter activities (HTC, HTIC, COMAO planning and the EW Course) and operational experience.   Distinguished Visitors Day A Distinguished Visitors Day (DVD) is planned for 28 May 2019 when representatives from all EDA Member States and representatives of Switzerland, Norway and the Republic of Serbia will have the opportunity to attend and observe various live training sessions.   Background The annual Blade exercise is part of EDA’s wider Helicopter Portfolio aimed at providing Member States with a joint European framework to develop, consolidate and share best practices in order to meet the challenges of flying helicopters in a modern operational environment. Other components of this Portfolio are the annual HEP Symposium, the Helicopter Tactics Courses (HTC), the Helicopter Tactics Instructor Courses (HTIC), and the COMAO Planning and Electronic Warfare (EW) Courses.   More information: DARK BLADE factsheet Helicopter Initiatives (EDA project page) HOT BLADE 2018 improved joint and combined helicopter training (EDA news)    	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/05/13/dark-blade-2019-kicks-off-in-czech-republic

EDA_NEWS_0093	2019-05-06	NEWS	EU and NATO Member States briefed on CDP	 Representatives of all EU and NATO Member States as well as the NATO International Staff were invited to the EDA premises today for an informal briefing on the revised Capability Development Plan (CDP) approved in June 2018 and on its ongoing implementation process. The event was held at the initiative of the EDA Steering Board as part of the renewed EU-NATO cooperation under the Warsaw and Brussels Joint Declarations which call for more transparency and coherence of output between the EU and NATO defence planning processes. 22 EU Member States are also NATO Allies. Jorge Domecq, the EDA Chief Executive, and Martin Konertz, the Capability, Armament & Planning Director, provided participants with an detailed overview on the general CDP process, on last year’s revision and the 11 new EU Capability Development Priorities, as well as on their implementation through the development of individual Strategic Context Cases (SCCS) which will serve as launching pads for potential future collaborative projects. They also explained the crucial role the CDP plays as a key reference for Member States’ and EU's capability development, and how it guides and informs the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD), the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), and the European Defence Fund (EDF).  Participants were also briefed about how EDA ensures coherence with NATO, thus mitigating the risk of unnecessary duplication.  The Agency will continue to pursue coherence of output and timelines between the EU and NATO Defence Planning Processes in full transparency with the Member States. “The meeting aimed at further enhancing transparency and visibility on the overall process and main elements of the revised CDP priorities, and at elaborating on the ways EU and NATO pursue coherence of output as well as the associated benefits, considering that Member States/Allies have a single set of forces and capabilities”, Mr Domecq commented. “I am confident that the meeting was particularly beneficial to those Allies which are not involved in the CDP process”.    More information 2018 European Capability Development Priorities (EDA brochure)  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/05/06/eu-and-nato-member-states-briefed-on-cdp
EDA_NEWS_0094	2019-05-10	NEWS	Personnel Recovery Controller & Planner Course project successfully completed after 6 years	 The 19th edition of the Joint Personnel Recovery Staff Course, which ended today in Veszprem (Hungary), was also the last one of its kind: after six years, EDA’s Personnel Recovery Controller and Planner Course (PRCPC) project came to a successful conclusion. The last JPRSC was organized by the Hungarian Defence Forces’ Air Command and Control Centre with the support of the European Personnel Recovery Centre (EPRC), a close partner of EDA.  Launched in May 2013 as an EDA ‘Cat B’ project initially supported by Sweden (lead), Austria, Germany and The Netherlands, the PRCPC grew over time to count today eight participating Member States (Belgium, Cyprus, Hungary and Italy joined later). During the six years, the project allowed participating Member States to train more than 500 staff who are now able to perform specific Personnel Recovery Planning tasks during military operations.   Follow-up project underway Based on the project’s success, a follow-up collaborative initiative is already under preparation within the Agency, as a ‘Cat B’ project called ‘Joint Personnel Recovery Education and Training Courses’. Its objective will be to organise multinational Joint Personnel Recovery (JPR) training events under EDA’s umbrella.  Moreover, new courses will be developed and organised such as specific ‘JPR Leadership Courses’ and ‘JPR operational Planner Courses’.   Background In 2011, EDA’s Project Team Personnel Recovery identified the lack of well-trained PR staff in military operations as an important operational shortfall, as well as a training gap. Accordingly, it initiated a series of four pilot courses for PR controller and planners to assess the need for conducting multinational PR courses at EU level. The four pilots were hosted by Sweden (March 2011), the Netherlands (November 2011) and Germany (March & November 2012).  Based on their success, four PT PR participating Member States (AT, DE, NL, SE) decided to join their forces under EDA’s umbrella for organizing multinational PRCPC events. The Cat B project PRCPC was established, initially for just two years but later extended twice for two years respectively, until 30 May 2019. In the meantime, four additional Member States (BE, CY, HU, IT) had joined. In November 2018, the PRCPC contributing Member States decided to make the course documentation available to all EDA Member States, at no cost, in order to support them overcome the existent shortfall on well-trained PR staff. For this purpose, a dedicated workspace will be created under EDA’s Collaboration Platform.   More information For more details regarding PRCPC/JPRSC documentation and related PR training tools (SERE e-learning and PR FAS ATD) please contact EDA at CAP@eda.europa.eu.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/05/10/personnel-recovery-controller-planner-course-project-successfully-completed-after-6-years

Benjamin Les, Minister of National Defence of Romania, Ioan Mircea Pascu, Vice-President of the European Parliament and Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency opened the conference. More than 500 high-level representatives from Ministries of Defence, defence research institutes, industry, academia and the European institutions attended the conference organised under the auspices of the Romanian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, the Romanian Ministry of National Defence and the European Defence Agency (EDA).  The event showcased new prioritisation instruments for defence research, technology and innovation, highlighted potential synergies to be achieved on research priorities at national and European level and provided an update on the latest developments on the European Defence Fund. Moreover, the conference provided participants insights and lessons learned from some of the most successful R&T collaborative research projects which have been implemented under the framework of EDA. Benjamin Les, Minister of Defence of Romania inaugurated the conference. “Today's event represents an excellent opportunity for all participants to analyse the various existing defense research instruments, the EDF and its impact on capability-based defense research and innovation. Such collaborative initiatives are meant to fuel future projects between EU Member States in the field of defense research”, he stated.  EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq underlined, “A new era for European defence research is on the way. In this rapidly evolving technological context, a coherent approach among Member States will be more crucial than ever. Investment in research and especially in collaborative research is a must to be able to deliver the defence capabilities for the future.”  During the first part of the day, high-level guests including Andrei Ignat, State Secretary and Chief of the Department of Armaments from Romania and Gabriele Fioni, Director for International Cooperation and Deputy Director of CEA-Tech representing EARTO as well as Christian Munzinger, R&T Director from Airbus Defence and Space discussed with Denis Roger, EDA Director of Research Technology and Innovation prioritisation instruments for defence research, technology and innovation. They highlighted potential synergies to be achieved on research priorities at national and European level as well as the link with existing and new funding instruments.  The research dimension is an integral part of the process of building a coherent capability landscape based on longer-term technological development. OSRA, the Overarching Research Agenda, validated by the Member States in January, is the instrument to harmonise views of relevant European defence research priorities and identify potential funding instruments. OSRA is therefore a key prioritisation instrument and has been acknowledged by its inclusion in the draft regulation of the European Defence Fund. It is all the more important as the research priorities must serve to mature technologies required to develop capabilities which respond to Member States armed forces’ needs.  Sylvain Kainz-Huber, Head of Unit, European Commission Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, Ralf Schnurr, R&T Director, Federal Ministry of Defence of Germany, and Christian Bréant, Director Advanced Studies, THALES and Dirk Tielbuerger, EDA Deputy Director and Head of EU-funded Defence Research Unit exchanged views on the impact of the European Defence Fund on future defence capability, research and innovation prospects.

EDA_NEWS_0097	2019-04-02	NEWS	Wanted: Industry solutions for optimisation of MBT capabilities	 EDA’s ‘OMBT-Leo2’ project, launched in spring 2017 with the ambition to optimise existing Main Battle Tank (MBT) capabilities in Europe (with an initial focus on the Leopard 2A4), will enter a new phase in the coming days with the publication of a call to European industry to participate in a Preliminary Market Consultation (PMC) and offer possible market solutions.  The purpose of the PMC is to gather accurate information regarding possible commercial solutions for upgrading Leopard 2A4s up to the 2A7 or equivalent version, in-line with existing technical standards and requirements. Participants are asked to respond to the PMC with proposed solutions that are sufficiently detailed and include a realistic price range and possible timelines.  The objective is to reach out to the full European defence industry spectrum and ensure the collection of comprehensive and accurate cost data.  To this purpose, the PMC will be disseminated via the Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD) and EU National Defence Industry Associations (NDIAs). Industry will have to submit their responses to the PMC until 18 July 2019. Only responses covering full system-level solutions will be taken into further consideration. EDA encourages the establishment of European multinational cross-border industrial partnerships as the preferred mechanism to exploit this opportunity. The Agency also considers this programme as a suitable vehicle for enhanced access for Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) to the cross-border supply chain. The PMC follows EDA’s Request of Information (RFI) in 2017 through which a first contact was established with industry on this concrete programme   Business-to-business workshop In order to support the PMC, EDA will organise a business-to-business (B2B) workshop at its premises in Brussels around mid-May. Further details on this workshop, including participation criteria and related requirements, will be communicated by EDA to industry in due time. The aim of the B2B workshop is to promote cross-border cooperation within the EU and enhance mid-caps/small and medium enterprises’ access to defence contracts in general, and to the future OMBT-Leo2 programme (contractual) implementation in particular, by facilitating initial contacts between industrial stakeholders with relevant expertise (at full-system and / or subsystem level), in this field. Specific criteria for participation of interested industries will be part of the communication and each request will be assessed by contributing Member States experts and EDA, on a case-by-case basis.   Way ahead The information gathered through the PMC will be assessed by EDA and governmental subject matter experts. The results of the assessment will further support contributing Member States in their national decision, and EDA in the awarding process of possible future contracts.   Background In spring 2017, EDA launched the ‘OMBT-Leo2’ project, a new Pooling & Sharing initiative which aims at optimizing existing Main Battle Tank (MBT) capabilities in Europe with an initial focus on the Leopard 2A4. The concept foresees the offer of surplus Leopard platforms available in certain Member States (the ‘providers’) and transfer them (lease, rent or sell) together with an upgrading package to one or several other Member States (the ‘receivers’) interested in acquiring and introducing in-service this type of capability. The Pooling & Sharing of training, exercises and maintenance between providers and receivers, using already existing facilities, is also part of the concept. Upgrade of legacy MBTs to the latest technical standards would have a positive impact for European defence industry in the area of land systems. It would also contribute to the maintenance of technological excellence of the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB). Additionally, regarding economies of scale, Member States owning and operating for national purposes the same type of MBTs, can opt-in for upgrading their in-service fleet.   More information :  EDA seeks European defence industry’s input on Main Battle Tank optimization (EDA news, September 2017) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/04/02/wanted-industry-solutions-for-optimisation-of-mbt-capabilities

The industry consortium in charge of the project (INDRA Sistemas SA, Leonardo S.p.a and Fraunhofer) provided Member States with an overview of the project management plan describing tasks, milestones and project deliverables.  The project was conceived as the first step of a spiral development in order to set up a full Cyber Situation Awareness operational capability. The CySAP-RRP will be built upon previous work done by EDA to develop a Target Architecture and System Requirements for an enhanced Cyber Defence Situation Awareness Capability.  The core objectives of the project include essential research challenges to assist military decision-makers in cyberspace and to set the basis for a fully-fledged Command and Control (C2) system for cyber operations.  CySAP is at the forefront of technology development with the aim of obtaining a common and standardized cyber defence planning and management functional area service. The research challenges are to provide a comprehensive understanding of the cyber defence elements in the planning and conduct phase of military operations in which cyberspace is now recognised and treated as any other domain such as land, air or maritime.  Under the framework of EDA, the three Member States participating in CySAP agreed a common set of requirements and a Target Architecture for the capability. CySAP follows a modular approach allowing  to have a flexible set of functionalities by exercising a system engineering process. Current market available solutions for cyber situational awareness do not meet the entire spectrum of military requirements such as risk analysis, cyber related Courses of Action (CoA) development and assessment as well as support to decision-making. CySAP will provide situational analysis that can be integrated into the overall common operational picture of a mission, as a cyber information layer able to provide timely and accurate situational awareness. CySAP is set to obtain innovative solutions by joining efforts of leading defence industries and researchers in Europe. The architectural design comprises several spirals to be completed in the next years subject to future investments. The possibility to introduce CySAP follow-on activities into PESCO or the EDIDP are currently explored and assessed. The next progress review meeting is scheduled for September 2019 in Spain.  Background The updated EU Capability Development Plan (CDP) endorsed by the EDA Steering Board in June 2018 reconfirmed cyber defence as a priority for capability development in the EU. The CDP recognises the need for defensive cyber operations in any operational context, based on sophisticated current and predictive cyberspace situational awareness. This includes the ability to combine large amounts of data and intelligence from numerous sources in support of rapid decision making and increased automation of the data gathering, analysis and decision-support process.  In November 2018, the European Council adopted an updated version of the EU cyber defence policy framework (CDPF).  Supporting the development of Member States’ cyber defence capabilities is a priority area where the now established CySAP project serves as a core to guide future research and operational capabilities.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/04/05/eda-launches-work-on-research-prototype-for-cyber-defence-situation-awareness
EDA_NEWS_0099	2019-04-05	NEWS	EDA supports NATO CCD COE ‘Locked Shields’ cyber defence exercise	 ‘Locked Shields’, the world’s biggest and most advanced international cyber defence exercise involving life-fire attacks, is organized annually by NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE) in Tallinn. This year’s edition will take place from 9-12 April with some 1,000 experts from around 30 nations participating. EDA will support the strategic track part of the exercise.   The exercise will see a Red team (based in Tallinn) attacking Blue Teams made up by CCD COE member states (based at exercise locations in their capitals) who will act as national rapid reaction teams deployed to assist a fictional country in handling large-scale cyber incidents and all their multiple implications. The main task of the Blue Teams is to protect and maintain their services and networks against these life attacks. Besides countering the technical attacks, information sharing, teamwork and cooperation will also be key aspects to be tested in this exercise.  With its rich expertise and experience gained from several strategic decision-making exercises organised with Member States over recent years, EDA will support the ‘Locked Shields 2019 Strategic Track’, a parallel, table-top decision-making exercise track playing in the same fictitious, sovereign state under severe cyber-attacks from an aggressive neighbour. Participating Blue Teams will act as rapid reaction teams and advisors. High-level cyber/hybrid crisis management and legal decisions have to be made in accordance with national, EU, NATO and UN regulations by those Blue Teams. The roles of NATO, EU and UN will be played by a “White Team”, including EDA.   More information:  Cyber Defence (EDA project page) NATO CCD COE (Locked Shields page) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/04/05/eda-supports-nato-ccd-coe-locked-shields-cyber-defence-exercise
EDA_NEWS_0100	2019-04-01	NEWS	Phase 1 of Smart Blue Water Camps research project completed	 EDA held a workshop in Athens recently to conclude the first phase of the Smart Blue Water Camps (SBWC) research project.  Water infrastructure is facing pressures due to climatic changes and sometimes a lack of investment. At the same time, military installations can be insufficiently acknowledged in both distributed water management and pollution control despite their ubiquitous presence. Against this backdrop, EDA’s SBWC research project was launched in 2017 with the Hellenic MOD as lead nation to investigate how to improve water management in military camps from sustainability, hydro-informatics, and technological perspectives. During 2017 and 2018 at sites from each of the six participating Member States involved (Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain), the National Technical University of Athens collated water supply, distribution and consumption data, and made technical assessments. Bespoke recommendations were made for each of the military sites from across these different European geographic and climatic regions based on: detailed modelling of water and wastewater cycle of each camp using an Urban Water Cycle Optioneering Tool (UWOT)   assessments of alternative scenarios regarding interventions for each camp  consideration of social, economic, environmental and technological context factors such as population, monitoring and automation of water transmission and storage systems, budget availability, regional water quantity and quality, climate change, and the feasibility of using information and communications technology (ICT) development of Key Performance Indicator protocols, including economic, operational and social impacts  economic assessments of interventions for each camp based on modelling results. Recommended interventions varied in scale and complexity and ranged from those of a more straightforward nature, such as the installation of grey water recycling and water harvesting systems, to more technologically sophisticated measures, such as the application of ground penetrating radar to support leak detection and control  or the use of a grid of smart sensors to enable real-time monitoring and management of water supply systems. It was found that leakage was responsible for considerable water losses with mitigation measures costing around 40% of the annual cost of water lost to leakage in one case, thereby providing a significant return on investment. Rainwater harvesting in another case could provide nearly two thirds of the supply required for vehicle washing. Installation of smart water grid systems would integrate ICT into the management of the water distribution systems to optimize operation of the water supply network. The conclusions of the final report were presented and the way ahead, such as implementation of nationally based recommendations as well as potential further steps, were discussed at the workshop chaired by Richard Brewin, EDA Project Officer Energy and Environment Systems.  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/04/01/phase-1-of-smart-blue-water-camps-research-project-completed

EDA_NEWS_0107	2019-03-12	NEWS	Strong presence of European aviation organisations at World ATM Congress	" ‘Europe for Aviation’ is the theme around which civil and military European aviation organisations working to implement the Single European Sky (SES) gather for two days at this year’s World ATM Congress which opened today in Madrid. Speaking at the joint ‘Europe For Aviation Partners’ conference, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq stressed the need to accommodate civil and military requirements in the effort to develop a modern and innovative SES, as civil and military aviation share the same airspace and conduct mutually supportive activities.  ‘Working together will allow us to remain innovative. We need to act jointly in making the European airspace a digital European sky designed to accommodate the needs of both civil and military stakeholders, all types of platforms, manned and unmanned, and all types of missions, roles and applications, in a balanced and proportioned way, in peace time and in crisis situations"", Mr Domecq stated Over recent years, EDA has achieved tangible results when it comes to military integration into SES. The Military Aviation Strategy in the context of SES is in place and €93 million of EU co-funding have been awarded to military projects relating to SESAR deployment. With the support of EDA, the defence sector is involved in SES activities from the outset, providing inputs into the regulatory, technical and operational efforts aimed to enhance the security and defence dimension in SES. A common civil-military roadmap for Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) Air Traffic Insertion has been developed to enable seamless integration of certified RPAS alongside manned aviation from 2025. One of the eleven European Capability Development Priorities approved in the 2018 Capability Development Plan (CDP) is directly linked to SES: the integration of military air capabilities in the changing aviation sector. It will contribute to foster civil-military synergies notably through digital solutions benefiting from connectivity, automation, virtualisation and artificial intelligence in support of European industries. The ‘Europe for Aviation’ stand and theatre (#849 and #1151) at the 2019 World ATM Congress is hosting a wide range of debates, presentations and guided walking tours, illustrating the collaboration in action between European aviation organisations working to implement SES, namely the European Commission, EUROCONTROL, SESAR Joint Undertaking (SESAR JU), SESAR Deployment Manager (SESAR DM), European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA), European Organisation for Civil Aviation (EUROCAE) and the European Defence Agency (EDA).   Background The World ATM Congress is the world’s largest international air traffic management (ATM) exhibition and conference, bringing together the world’s leading product developers, experts, stakeholders, and air navigation service providers (ANSPs).

EDA_NEWS_0108	2019-03-05	NEWS	EDA’s 3D-Printing project for Energetic Materials launched	 The Additive Manufacturing Techniques for Energetic Materials (AMTEM) project, for which the programme arrangement was signed last December by six participating EDA Member States (Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Poland, Sweden) as well as Norway, was officially launched at a kick-off meeting on 12/13 February.  The event, which took place at the French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis (ISL), brought together 15 European organisations working in the field of Energetic Materials, namely: ISL, Ariane Group, EURENCO, NEXTER Group, Fraunhofer Institute for Chemical Technology (ICT), The Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI), NAMMO, Chemring Nobel, Polish Military Institute of Armament Technology (MIAT), Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI), Finish Defence Research Agency (FDRA), Oy Forcit AB, Raikka OY and Aalto University. Additive manufacturing (AM) - or 3D-Printing - technologies have been identified as a major enabling technology to improve Europe’s industrial competitiveness. The defence sector is also exploring the potential offered by AM technologies to further develop military capabilities. Within EDA’s CapTech Ammunition Technologies, a group of Member States agreed to join forces and develop a multinational research project on the use of Additive Manufacturing for the production of Energetic Materials to be used both as propellants as well as warheads. It was this initiative that led to the AMTEM project.  Over the next four years, the AMTEM project team will investigate and assess appropriate materials and related Additive Manufacturing production techniques, in particular with a view to producing new types of warheads and propellants with enhanced performance and ensuring faster and cheaper production processes for short series as well as rapid prototyping. The research project is also expected to help develop new munitions and missiles systems concepts with increased operational performance and further strengthen the European industrial competitiveness.   More information: R&T project launched on 3D printing of energetic materials (EDA webnews, 13 December 2018)  CapTech Ammunition Technologies (EDA project page)  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/03/05/eda-s-3d-printing-project-for-energetic-materials-launched
EDA_NEWS_0109	2019-03-05	NEWS	ESIF funding for space R&T project supported by EDA	 A €9.18 million space research project with both civilian and defence implications has been awarded co-funding under the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). EDA actively supported the funding application for this project run by an Italian consortium and designed to develop a RAM-EP propulsion system (use of atmosphere gases as a propellant) expected to extend the operational lifetime of spacecraft in Very Low Earth Orbit (VLEO) areas, i.e. below an altitude of 250 km.  The project, known as “CLOSE to Earth” (Constellation at very Low Earth Orbit based on RAM-EP Small SatellitEs), is to be implemented by a consortium which is led by the Italian Aerospace Technological Cluster (Distretto Tecnologico Aerospaziale - DTA) and also encompasses a number of other enterprises as well as universities and R&T organisations. Among the main challenges of this project are the development of an atmospheric gas collector and a Hall-effect engine capable of using the gases already present in the atmosphere as a propellant. The project also foresees the study of a new small space vehicle (under 500 kg) able to accommodate a RAM-EP propulsion system and operate at VLEO altitudes. Half of the project cost is covered by project holders, while ESIF will co-fund the remaining 50% (€ 4.59 million). This successful ESIF-funding application supported by EDA is yet another example of how the Agency, with its expertise, can help defence-related R&T projects to access EU funding, even (or especially) if they involve small and medium-sized enterprises. It also demonstrates once again that Member States’ investments made through EDA have multiplier effects in terms of practical output. So far, EDA has a track record of ten such ESIF success stories in defence involving projects worth a total of about €26 million.  ESIF is open to defence projects and is expected to continue supporting them during the next Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027.  To explore the wide range of European funding currently available to defence and dual-use projects and activities, see EDA’s European Funding Gateway for Defence.   More information:  EDA’s ESIF web-platform EDA’s work on Space  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/03/05/esif-funding-for-space-r-t-project-supported-by-eda

EDA_NEWS_0111	2019-02-21	NEWS	EDA workshop held on “Autonomous Cyber Responses”	 Member States representatives together with cyber research experts from the European Cyber Security Organisation (ECSO), industry, research organisations and academia recently met at an EDA workshop to discuss  ‘Autonomous Cyber Responses’. This research topic refers to the challenges brought about by the automation in cyber defence and includes among others self-configured networks, automated cyber resilience, decision support systems, visual analytics, autonomous mobile cyber defence agents, man-machine modules and machine learning models to address the cyber research challenges Member States’ Armed Forces are confronted with. The objective of the workshop was to provide EDA’s Cyber Research and Technology Ad Hoc Working Group with examples of European research efforts and solutions, to identify capability gaps that could be covered with this technology and to explore new collaboration initiatives in this challenging field. Participants acknowledged the urgency of meaningful collaborative research activities at EU level in view of building tomorrow’s defence capabilities, and supported the continuation of similar initiatives. A so-called ‘Interested Community of Experts’ (ICE) set up within the Ad Hoc Working Group will perform an evaluation of the proposals discussed at the workshop. Outline descriptions for future collaborative research projects in this field are expected to be presented to Member States in the upcoming meetings.   Background The potential benefits that European Armed Forces could draw from the use of cyber-resilient autonomous systems have also been recognised by EU Member States. One of the 11 EU Capability Development Priorities approved by Member States in June 2018 is called “Enabling capabilities for cyber responsive operations”. The Overarching Strategic Research Agenda (OSRA) - which provides a necessary link between R&T efforts and the military tasks and long-term capability needs of the Capability Development Plan (CDP) -  identified a number of Research and Technology areas, the so-called Technology Building Blocks (TBBs), in which a cooperative approach at the European level would bring an added-value to support the development of defence capabilities. The Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) on Cyber Defence developed within the relevant EDA Ad Hoc Working Group in compliance with OSRA requirements provides informed prioritisation on cyber-related technologies necessary for the military while identifying opportunities for dual-use efforts and investments, be it in national, multinational or EU-funded contexts. Autonomous Cyber Response is one of the TBBs developed under the Cyber SRA. In November 2018, the European Council adopted an updated version of the EU cyber defence policy framework (CDPF) which calls for considering cyber defence issues in the calls of the Preparatory Action on Defence Research and in the topics called for in the European Defence Fund.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/02/21/eda-workshop-held-on-autonomous-cyber-responses

EDA also supported operation EUFOR ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina for a cost-benefit analysis of camp management in the Sarajevo Camp Butmir from July to October 2015. In addition, the Agency supports CSDP military operations and missions with other projects as well as contracted support pre-mission solutions. On the project side this has so far included cyber awareness seminars, maritime surveillance, personnel management as well as management of geospatial information. Contracted support reaches from satellite communications to wider logistics support.  This has already been the case for CSDP military operations in the Central African Republic (EUFOR RCA and later EUTM RCA), the Mediterranean Sea (EUNAVFOR MED operation Sophia), Bosnia and Herzegovina (EUFOR Althea), Mali (EUTM Mali), Somalia (EUTM Somalia and EUNAVFOR Atalanta).  Most recently, EDA also started supporting the newly established Military Planning and Conduct Capability (MPCC) with contracted communication services, and it is supporting CSDP civilian missions as well.   The Athena Mechanism Athena is the mechanism established to administer the financing of the common costs of European Union operations having military or defence implications governed by Council Decision 2015/528/CFSP. The Council Decision allows for arrangements to be negotiated with Union bodies to facilitate procurement and/or financial aspects of mutual support in operations in the most cost-effective manner.   More information:  Cooperation Arrangement signed on 1 February 2019 (full text) Support to Operations (EDA brochure)  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/02/07/eda-renews-cooperation-arrangement-with-the-athena-mechanism
EDA_NEWS_0113	2019-02-06	NEWS	Contracts signed for the provision of aero medical evacuation services in Europe and Africa	 The European Defence Agency has just concluded multiple framework contracts with Global Helicopter Service GMBH, Elitaliana S.R.L. and Starlite Aviation Operations Ltd. for the provision of fixed and rotary wings medical evacuation services in the context of EDA’s Support of Operations. The contracts run until January 2023 for a maximum value of 120 million Euro.  In national and multinational operations, the provision of In-theatre aeromedical evacuation services is often a challenge. In many cases, capabilities are not available from Member States and outsourcing is necessary to provide air medical evacuation services through private companies. Experience shows that contracting on the spot under time pressure is mostly not a cost-effective solution. Having in place ready-to-use arrangements is very beneficial to ensure immediate availability of services, whilst equally reducing the administrative burden and achieving economies of scale. The overall purpose of the AIRMEDEVAC project is to efficiently and cost effectively provide contributing members with an option to order ‘ready-to-use’ commercially available In-theatre aeromedical evacuation services through EDA. The 4 contributing members (CM) today are: Austria, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. The project is open to all EDA participating Member States, EU entities as well as third states having an administrative arrangement with EDA. The contributing members have mandated EDA through a Project Arrangement (PA) to manage the project including the negotiation of Multiple Framework Contracts (FWCs) and service requests on their behalf. The contracts concluded today are the result of a close cooperation dating back to 2016 between EDA, the EU Military Staff and the contributing members to define the requirements and evaluate the services required. EDA has been in the lead of the process up to the conclusion of the contract and will continue to be fully responsible for its management throughout the implementation.  The contractors offer services to evacuate patients from the point of injury to the initial Medical Treatment Facility (Forward AIRMEDEVAC) or to transfer them between in-theatre Medical Treatment Facilities (Tactical AIRMEDEVAC) in the context of national and/or international defence and/or security operations. Services include access to a wide range of Rotary and Fixed-Wing aircraft in Europe and Africa to meet a variety of operational needs, both abroad and at home.  The project constitutes an efficient pay-per-use solution that does not impose any binding financial commitments beyond services requested. It is quick and flexible and will reduce the administrative burden for members who do not have to run their own bidding processes since they can rely on the EDA framework contracts.   More information:  AIRMEDEVAC factsheet EDA brochure support to operations 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/02/06/contracts-signed-for-the-provision-of-aero-medical-evacuation-services-in-europe-and-africa

EDA_NEWS_0116	2019-01-16	NEWS	EDA GOVSATCOM Demo project enters execution phase	" EDA’s Governmental Satellite Communications (GOVSATCOM) Pooling and Sharing demonstration project (GSC Demo) entered its execution phase this Tuesday 15 January with the first meeting of the Project Arrangement Management Group taking place in Madrid. This means that the project is now ready to provide GOVSATCOM services to meet the GOVSATCOM demands of Member States and European CSDP actors through pooled capabilities (bandwidth/power and/or services) provided by contributing Member States. This governmental pooled capability is set up to provide satellite communication (SATCOM) resources that cannot be obtained on the commercial market with sufficient level of guaranteed access and security.  The GSC Demo corresponds  responds to an existing need and is fully in line with the revised 2018 Capability Development Plan and its related EU Defence Capability Priorities. It has also to be seen in the light of the ongoing efforts within the European Union to establish an EU GOVSATCOM within the EU’s next space programme. Furthermore, the GSC Demo project also complements EDA’s EU Satcom Market project, already in place since 2012, which provides commercially available SATCOM and CIS services in an efficient and effective manner.  Today’s milestone was achieved after intensive work done since June 2017 to establish a Project Arrangement. Under the leadership of Spain, all 15 contributing EDA Member States of the project (Spain, Austria, Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, France, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom) accepted the Project Arrangement as baseline for mutual support and collaboration. Norway, which has signed an Administrative Arrangement with the Agency, is also contributing to the project. EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq, who attended today’s meeting in Madrid, stated: “The role of satellite communication in a European strategic autonomy perspective cannot be overstated. I am pleased to say that EDA has played its part in facilitating SATCOM solutions for the EU for some time and in an incremental fashion that has proved quite successful. This GSC Demo project together with the Agency’s EU SatCom Market project underlines the importance of SATCOM and confirms the priority that has been granted to this capability during the most recent revision of the Capability Development Plan"". Major General Salvador Alvarez Pascual, the Deputy Director of Programs in the Spanish Ministry of Defence, said:  ""Now it is time to start this project which is the result of significant work of experts from different nations. Spain will face the chairmanship of the Project Arrangement Management Group with confidence to have a good cooperation. The project will fulfill our common objectives and targets and provides the ideal opportunity to test its governance“.   Background Reliable, stable and secure communications are crucial in any CSDP mission and operation. Yet, terrestrial network infrastructures are not available everywhere, for instance in areas hit by natural disasters, at sea, in the air or in hostile zones. SATCOM can be the solution: rapidly deployable, flexible and distance insensitive, SATCOM can offer communication links where terrestrial networks are damaged, overloaded or non-existent. However, access to SATCOM cannot be taken for granted at any time, especially not when governmental users require them at short notice and without pre-arranged agreements. In situations of high demand, competition with other users of commercial SATCOM capacities creates a risk of non-availability and high costs. Against this backdrop, EU leaders decided in 2013 that there was a need for a new solution combining the advantages of commercial and military satellite systems in order to address both civil and military needs through European cooperation. The European Defence Agency, in collaboration with the European Commission and the European Space Agency, since then is preparing the next generation of GOVSATCOM.  GOVSATCOM is seen as a capability that is placed in between the commercial satellite communication market and the highly protected military satellite communication capability. The project originates from an EDA Steering Board decision of November 2013 which tasked EDA to pursue its work on GOVSATCOM coordination with Member States, the European Commission and the European Space Agency in order to propose a comprehensive programme for Member States who wish to participate. After a sound preparatory work, the aforementioned EDA Member States decided in June 2017 to establish the GSC Demo project and intensify their collaboration in GOVSATCOM.

EDA_NEWS_0119	2019-01-11	NEWS	Cyber Situation Awareness Package (CySAP) project launched by three Member States	 The Project Arrangement (PA) for the Cyber Defence Situation Awareness Package Rapid Research Prototype (CySAP-RRP) was recently signed by the three contributing Member States:  Spain (lead country), Germany and Italy. The project was conceived as the first step of a spiral development in order to set up a full Cyber Situation Awareness (CySA) operational capability. The CySAP-RRP will be built upon previous work done by EDA to develop a Target Architecture and System Requirements for an enhanced Cyber Defence Situation Awareness Capability. The core objectives of the project include essential research challenges to assist military decision-makers in cyberspace and to set the basis of a Command and Control (C2) system for cyber operations.  Under this PA, results will be delivered using a spiral approach over the next 18 months. EDA’s Project Team Cyber Defence (PT CD) identified the need for capabilities to enable military commanders at all operational levels to understand and manage the risk of cyber-attack. An important prerequisite is to provide situation awareness (SA) for the commander and his staff, based on a general and specific threat landscape from which the risk of cyber-attack can be observed, understood and evaluated. The objective is for military commanders to have a clear understanding of the cyber threat landscape including system vulnerabilities and attack vectors and to equip them with the tools required to make informed decisions in order to manage cyber risks during the planning and conduct phases of an operation. A dedicated CySAP Ad Hoc Working Group (AHWG) comprising the contributing Member States, EDA and additional subject matter experts and stakeholders started work on a Common Staff Target (CST), Common Staff Requirements (CSR) and a Business Case which describes which operational elements are needed to achieve a cyber situation awareness for the EU Armed Forces. CySAP follows a modular approach which means that the adopted SA capability architecture will influence additional cyber defence solutions to achieve interoperability. Other spirals, subject to future commitments and out of the scope of the first step, are planned to further develop CySAP towards a final CySA capability. CySA is a key aspect in all cyber defence efforts and initiatives currently pursued within the EU and other international organizations. As part ofthis endeavour, EDA hosted two capability awareness days with the support of industry and academia in order to allow the military to benefit from existing products and trends related toCyber Situation Awareness. Since its inception in 2016, EDA’s Cyber Research and Technology AHWG has supported CySAP. This working group promotes collaborative cyber defence research within a cyber Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) looking into research activities to address capability gaps. Following the Cyber Ranges Federation project launched by 11 EU Member States in 2017 CySAP is the second EDA collaborative Cyber Defence project and the first collaborative R&T project in the domain.   Background Cyberspace is the fifth domain of operations, alongside the domains of land, sea, air, and space: the successful implementation of EU missions and operations is increasingly dependent on uninterrupted access to a secure cyberspace, and thus requires robust and resilient cyber operational capabilities.  The updated EU Capability Development Plan (CDP) endorsed by the EDA Steering Board in June 2018 reconfirmed cyber defence as a priority for capability development in the EU. The CDP recognises the need for defensive cyber operations in any operational context, based on sophisticated current and predictive cyberspace situational awareness. This includes the ability to combine large amounts of data and intelligence from numerous sources in support of rapid decision making and increased automation of the data gathering, analysis and decision-support process. In November 2018, the European Council adopted an updated version of the EU cyber defence policy framework (CDPF).  Supporting the development of Member States’ cyber defence capabilities is a priority area where the now established CySAP project serves as a core to guide future research and operational capabilities.  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/01/11/cyber-situation-awareness-package-(cysap)-project-launched-by-three-member-states

EDA_NEWS_0121	2018-12-12	NEWS	GISMO’s GeohuB aims at full operational capability by mid-2019	 Situational awareness is a prerequisite for good decision-making in any CSDP mission or operation. In order to provide operation commanders with optimal capabilities in this domain, EDA Member States in 2014 launched GISMO, the ‘Geospatial Information to Support decision Making in Operations’ project. Since then and working in partnership with the EU Satellite Centre (EU SatCen), GISMO has produced a first operational output in the form of ‘GeohuB’, a software application which allows for the safe and reliable sharing of geospatial information (GI) within a mission’s operational headquarter.  After a successful field trial, GeohuB was successfully deployed in November 2017 to the Italian Operation Headquarters, Rome, in support of EU Naval Force Mediterranean (EUNAVFOR MED). In practical terms, this means that operation participants with access to the classified mission network of EUNAVFOR MED’s operational headquarters in Rome can upload, share and manage geospatial data related to the operation (GeohuB is accessible through a normal web browser with a user-friendly interface). Rear Admiral Enrico Credendino Commander EUNAVFOR Med Operation Sophia Last June, GISMO started the transition of the GeohuB application from the current status of Initial Operating Capability (IOC) to Full Operating Capability (FOC) by the summer. A move much welcomed by Rear Admiral Enrico Credendino, the Commander of EUNAVFOR Med Operation Sophia. “Within the operational activity, the GEOHUB system is an effective service to support geospatial information. We aim to increase the use of this tool more and more with the intention of reaching the full operational capability before summer 2019”, he said.  Last September, a new milestone was reached when the first training session was provided by EU SatCen staff to OHQ Sophia and training tutorials were handed over to GeohuB users on the ground in the framework of EDA project GISMO.    Interview: “A common geospatial solution is paramount” After the GeohuB training session, we spoke to Italian Lieutenant Colonel Claudio Panizzi who is GEO Officer at operation ‘Sophia’ (EUNAVFOR Med).   GISMO GeohuB is a Content Management System that facilitates the access to space-based information integrated with geospatial data in an Operational Headquarters environment. How important is space-based information and its integration into a common geospatial dataset for EUNAVFOR MED? Lt.Col. Claudio Panizzi:  Almost all of the information that is managed inside an operation has a geospatial component. Reports are linked to locations, ships are located somewhere, the patrolling routes cover a given area, etc. The need to integrate all this information into a common geospatial solution is paramount to ensure that we are all fighting off the same map in this operation. An integrated approach as provided by GeohuB allows us to combine intelligence from different sources including space assets. Space assets are an operational resource able to provide answers worldwide, reliably within strict time margins. Accessing such resources and combining it with other intelligence sources enhance our capacity for decision making.   In very practical terms, what are the main operational benefits of the GISMO GeohuB System, even though it is still only at an initial stage of operational capability, and what kind of impact it has on operation SOPHIA? Lt.Col. Claudio Panizzi: The highest benefit is to allow all branches of the operation to share a common view, empowering the staff to access data generated by other branches on their own, streamlining processes and easing dec ision making. In addition, having a common pool of information increases the safety and security of decision relying on geospatial data.   Would you recommend other CSDP Missions and Operations or even the European External Action Service (EEAS) to use the system?  Lt.Col. Claudio Panizzi: The use of a system able to operate inside the classified network allows to have an integrated vision. The use of open sources is important, but it is just another source of information. The real benefit for the operation comes from having all the sources in one tool that allows to mix the unclassified layer of geographical information with the classified information generated by the mission. This can only be achieved with operational tools inside the classified network.   One of the main objectives of the GISMO GeohuB is to support the decision-making process on the basis of updated situational awareness informed by space-based information. Based on the experience you’ve made so far with the system, would you say that there is room for new technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), to further improve the tool? Lt.Col. Claudio Panizzi: As said before, the GISMO GehuB is a decision-making process oriented software. It provides, if required, a wide geospatial vision of the Area of Operations related by specific thematic overlapped layers and information. In addition, to improve the aim of the product, we can suggest to develop remote sensing tools finalized to execute more autonomous analysis, such as change detection (to investigate day by day the development of specific situations) in order to provide more complete answers if specific and more localized crisis situations required it.   GISMO GeohuB  So far, the GISMO GeohuB has been deployed:  since November 2017 to the Italian Operation Headquarters, Rome, in support of EU Naval Force Mediterranean (EUNAVFOR MED) in support of the MultiLayer 2016 (ML16) exercise as a tool for GI sharing among the different actors in the exercise (Brussels, EU OHQ in Postdam, FHQ in Strasbourg and EU delegation in Kampala) in support of the EUMM Georgia where the GeohuB is becoming a fundamental piece of the daily work chain within the monitoring mission in support of the MILEX 2017 as a tool to access GI by the EU OHQ in Northwood in support of EU Parallel and Coordinated Exercise 2018 (EU PACE 18) On the initiative of the EUMS, the GISMO GeohuB is also being evaluated as the application to share Geospatial Information within the European External Action Service (EEAS) network users.   Background Commanders of CSDP missions and operations constantly need fast, reliable and updated geospatial information covering land, sea, airspace and cyber. Geospatial information is earth-related factual data referenced by geographic position and arranged in a coherent structure. Such data include topographic, aeronautical, hydrographic or planning information but also mapping, geo-referenced imagery, geophysical products, etc. available in either analogue or digital format. Most pieces of information have a location, and knowing and understanding these locations can be decisive in a mission commanders’ decision-making. Ever improving geospatial information has thus the potential to revolutionise the decision-making process within military missions and operations.    	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/12/12/gismo-s-geohub-aims-at-full-operational-capability-by-early-2019

OCCAR manages the ESSOR Programme for Finland, France, Italy, Poland and Spain, whilst Germany is currently an observer to this Programme. The ESSOR Programme launched its Operational Capability 1 phase in November 2017, with an Operational Budget of €50 million. In 2006, EDA established the Project Team Software Defined Radio (SDR) with the goal to define a common European concept and position on SDR architecture developments, promoting the working relations with the most important SDR stakeholders and coordinating the vision, policies and initiatives for emergence of SDR developments that serve European interest and autonomy. This is in line with EDA’s role as the European forum for joint capability development and the prioritised Capability Development Plan (CDP) scope of Tactical CIS in response to CSDP requirements to greatly enhance the interoperability of communication systems.  Considering that enhanced cooperation with OCCAR also features among the recommendations endorsed by the Defence Ministers after EDA’s recent Long Term Review (LTR), with this exchange of letters, EDA formally commits to facilitate the coherence between the ESSOR Programme and the activities of EDA in Software Defined Radio (SDR) area, and to promote the ESSOR products, in particular the waveform and architecture of the system.   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/12/11/occar-eda-exchange-of-letter-on-european-secure-software-defined-radio-(essor)-programme
EDA_NEWS_0123	2018-12-12	NEWS	The new EDA magazine is out!	 The latest European Defence Matters magazine (N°16) is now available with a special focus on unmanned and autonomous systems in defence.  They are omnipresent in our daily lives and their potential keeps growing: smart machines and applications able to autonomously carry out tasks hitherto reserved to humans - from cutting grass to cleaning floors and driving cars. Certain autonomous functionalities have already made their way into the military domain where their possibilities are immense.  The question is thus not IF unmanned and autonomous platforms will become key components of our defence toolboxes, but HOW Member States, armed forces and industry decide to prepare for what could be a technological, potentially disruptive step change for defence.  In this new edition of European Defence Matters, which also served as a basis for the debate at this year’s EDA Annual Conference (29 November 2018) on “From Unmanned to Autonomous Systems: trends, challenges and opportunities”, we look at the extent to which unmanned and autonomous applications are already used in the various military domains (land, air, maritime, space, cyber) and what their main challenges and opportunities are, now and in the future.  We also touch upon EDA’s work supporting Member States and industry in this new domain, from research to capability development.  The industrial, regulatory and military/operational viewpoints are also represented through a series of interviews, notably with Eric Trappier (Dassault Aviation CEO), Patrick Ky (EASA Executive Director) and General Graziano (EUMC Chair). CARD, Defence Innovation Prize, EMACC Besides the comprehensive cover story on unmanned and autonomous systems, the magazine also analyses the outcome of the 2017-2018 trial run of the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD), reveals the 2018 winners of the first EDA Defence Innovation Prize, presents the new edition of European Military Airworthiness Certification Criteria Handbook and looks back at last September’s First European Air-to-Air Refuelling Conference held in Brussels.  Enyoy your reading!

It followed the successful completion, end of September in Sweden, of the 6th EDA Helicopter Tactics Instructor Course (HTIC). This annual event proved once more to be a unique occasion for European helicopter crews to discuss and share expertise and best practices related to helicopter tactics and to learn about training opportunities under EDA’s Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP). One part of the symposium was devoted to drawing the lessons learned from recent EDA helicopter exercises, such as ‘Hot Blade 18’ (held at Beja Air Base No 11, Portugal, in May 2018), from the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), where German and Belgian NH90 helicopters were integrated in one detachment, as well as the Czech Republic’s experience in preparing for the EU battle group.  Symposium attendees also received detailed information on how military helicopter training and simulator training is done in the different Member States with briefings provided by Austria, Belgium, Greece and Germany.  A new topic on the annual EDA Helicopter Tactics Symposium were the training and use of attack helicopters by different European countries. Briefings were delivered by specialists from Germany (EC665 Tiger), Greece (AH-64 Apache), Hungary (Mi 24) and Italy (A-129 Mangusta). The debate resulted in a concrete proposal to add a completely new chapter on Attack Helicopter Tactics in the HEP Standard Operating Procedures (HEP SOP), the capstone tactics’ manual for multinational European helicopter operations.  Industry was also present during the symposium by means of a small exhibition including various  new technologies and briefings on spatial disorientation and night vision goggle (NVG) training, as well as mission planning tools.  Looking ahead, symposium participants were briefed on upcoming HEP exercises, including Dark Blade 2019 (to be held in the Czech Republic) and Swift Blade 2020 (to be held in the BENELUX), which will focus on national and multinational training, including the performance of Joint and Combined Composite Air Operations (COMAO) in demanding environmental conditions and high threat scenarios.   Successful 6th EDA Helicopter Tactics Instructor Course (HTIC)  In the meantime, EDA keeps working on improving European helicopter interoperability through its Helicopter Tactics Instructor Courses (HTIC) the 6th of which was completed on 30 September after eight weeks of intensive training performed in Linton on Ouse RAF base (UK) and in Arvidsjaur Airport in Northern Sweden. With trainees from Sweden, Austria, Norway and the UK (representing both the Support Helicopter and the Attack Helicopter communities), the course offered a unique opportunity to foster operational interoperability and cooperation, whilst conducting advanced tactical flying training.     Now in its 6th year, the HTIC continues to deliver high-end flying training in Electronic Warfare, Tactical Formation and Evasion Training and other advanced helicopter operations. During the first year, all the tactical skills are taught in the classroom, on the simulator and, eventually, during the live flying phase. During the second year,  Bronze trainees begin a two-year programme to reach Silver and Gold qualifications, confirming their suitability for taking on the role of instructors. The complexity of the courses increases gradually over time until the final week, when trainees are expected to carry out complex Composite Air Operation (COMAO) tasks against Electronic Warfare Ground-Based Air Defence Systems, Fast-Jet aggressors and a whole range of low-tech weapon systems.  Five Tactics Instructors graduated from this year’s course whereas seven trainees are now eligible to complete the Silver Level in the coming years. As usually, the HTIC was supported by a range of units including 100 Sqn Hawks from the UK, Gripens from the Swedish Air Force, EW systems from Polygone in Germany, as well as staff from 8 Sqn, 606 Sqn, 600 Sqn, Joint Helicopter Command and the Swedish Air Force,  and Tactics Instructors from Austria, Germany, Sweden and the UK. The 6th HTIC was particular as the Chief Instructor role is now being ensured by a team of 4 experienced instructors from Austria, Germany, Sweden and the UK, who will continue to support the entire EDA helicopter training programme..  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/12/11/helicopter-tactics-high-on-eda-agenda-with-symposium-held-in-austria-and-instructor-course-completed-in-sweden
EDA_NEWS_0125	2018-12-12	NEWS	R&T Steering Board meeting focused on OSRA	 EDA’s Steering Board in Research and Technology (R&T) Director’s composition met today at the Agency, for the first time under the chairmanship of Dr Luisa Riccardi. EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq thanked her predecessor, Dr Bryan Wells, for his outstanding chairmanship and contribution to the work of the Agency over the past three years. Directors discussed the updated version of the Overarching Strategic Research Agenda (OSRA) which provides a necessary link between R&T efforts and the military tasks and long-term capability needs of the Capability Development Plan (CDP).  Combining a top-down approach (from capability needs to technologies) and a bottom-up approach (from new emerging technologies to capabilities), OSRA aims at streamlining Europe’s defence research priorities and informing Member States’ decision-making process on defence research. Practically speaking, OSRA identified a number of R&T areas, the so-called Technology Building Blocks (TBBs), in which a cooperative approach at the European level would bring an added-value to support the development of defence capabilities. In a second step, OSRA will also identify appropriate funding instruments. This information is expected to help Ministries of Defence to decide whether to lead or contribute to cooperative ad-hoc R&T projects and will also inform funding decisions taken in the context of the European Defence Fund (EDF).   Updated OSRA validated At today’s meeting, R&T Directors validated the outcome of the OSRA review (OSRA v2), including the 139 developed TBBs and the results of the application of the approved OSRA prioritisation methodology. They also tasked EDA Captechs and Working Groups to develop TBB roadmaps for the highly prioritized TBBs by June 2019. In close cooperation with the participating Member States, EDA will continue to update the TBBs and to further investigate cooperation opportunities for each of them, including the appropriate funding instruments. EDA will also look into the Lessons Identified during the prioritisation and implementation phases of OSRA v2. These Lessons Identified will be presented for an initial discussion to the R&T Steering Board in 2020 in view of the next OSRA version, and in synchronisation with the next CDP revision. R&T Directors also approved the systematic engagement of industry in the EDA defence research prioritisation activities.   EDA’s increasing R&T portfolio Directors also had the opportunity to be updated on and discuss the status of EDA’s R&T AdHoc portfolio which has exponentially increased over recent years, confirming EDA’s role as an enabler of collaborative R&T opportunities.  Between 2016 and 2017, the financial volume of the Agency’s R&T AdHoc portfolio was multiplied by four, and it doubled again in 2018 compared to 2017. In addition, the budgetary value of the 2018 portfolio is almost the highest since 2011 and the predictions for 2019 indicate a further increase by 50% compared to 2018.   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/12/12/r-t-steering-board-meeting-focused-on-osra
EDA_NEWS_0126	2018-11-29	NEWS	Annual Conference closes with call for joint action	 EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq this afternoon closed the Agency’s 2018 Annual Conference on unmanned and autonomous systems in defence. Autonomous applications supported by Artificial Intelligence are already crucial capabilities whose importance for defence will further grow in the future but the challenges laying ahead are considerable, Mr Domecq said, reflecting a general assessment expressed throughout the conference.   Main takeaways Mr Domecq singled out five key words which, in his view, will matter for Europe's future in relation to unmanned and autonomous systems: Action: Europe must catch up with the main global players dominating in this field, especially the US and China which invest much more in Artificial Intelligence and autonomous systems which are “game changers”, also in warfare. What Europe needs is a “Sputnik moment”: “We cannot afford to only talk about it, we have to do it”. Together: Cooperation is the only way for Europe to catch up: “We can only succeed if we do it together, in cooperation with governments, industry, the research community, tech leaders and civil society”; Speed: “Speed is of the essence” especially given that Europe is lagging behind considerably; Control: “Europe must stick to its values and principles”, keep Humans always in control of the use of lethal force and avoid becoming dependent on machines or robots;     Education: last but not least, “we need to get the buy-in of our citizens because we cannot provide security with tools which are rejected by the population we intend to protect”.  The benefits, challenges and opportunities of autonomous systems need to be assessed, explained and discussed in full transparency. “They cannot be simplistically reduced to ‘good’ or ‘bad’ tools”, Mr Domecq concluded.   More information: Federica Mogherini opens Annual Conference devoted to unmanned and autonomous systems Speech by Head of Agency Federica Mogherini at the EDA 2018 Annual Conference Speech Commissioner Mariya Gabriel on EDA Annual Conference Speech EUMC Chairman General Graziano 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/11/29/annual-conference-closes-with-call-for-joined-action

EDA_NEWS_0128	2018-11-21	NEWS	Contract signed for the provision of human resources management software to Polish Operational Headquarter for EU Battlegroup	 European Defence Agency, Polish MoD and Rheni GmbH have signed a contract for the provision of the J1 Functional Area Service (J1FAS) software to the Polish Operational Headquarter (OHQ) in Krakow in the context of the EU Visegrad Battlegroup commitment. The contract runs until the end of 2019.  Rheni GmbH will host the J1 FAS software on a dedicated server to provide reliable J1 FAS services to operational users within Operational Headquarters. It includes preventive and corrective maintenance as well as training packages. The OHQ located within the Land Operations Centre-Land Component Command in Cracow, has been formed in order to fulfil the tasks related to the 6 months standby period of the EU Visegrad Battlegroup. The next period will begin in July 2019. The contract is the result of a close cooperation between the EDA, the Polish MoD and Rheni GmbH to define the requirements and evaluate the services required. EDA has been in the lead of the process up to the signing of the contract and will continue to be fully responsible for its management throughout the implementation.  J1 FAS is a software tool developed to help the J1 (human resources) branch of EU headquarters managing the in-processing and out-processing of personnel during all phases of an operation. From an operational point of view, J1 FAS allows much more accurate and faster in-processing of personnel coming from Member States all over the EU and enables important personnel management information to be synthesized from the database.  The software has been used previously by the Greek OHQ in support of Operation EUFOR RCA in 2014 and to support various EU military exercises (MILEX). It is in continuous use in EUNAVFOR MED Operation Sophia Operational Headquarters in Rome since 2015. As a result of the high satisfaction rate and demand from various users, a framework contract that can provide a catalogue of support arrangements for a rollout of the J1 FAS to HQs was put in place in June this year.   More information: EDA brochure support to operations  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/11/21/contract-signed-for-the-provision-of-human-resources-management-software-to-polish-operational-headquarter-for-eu-battlegroup
EDA_NEWS_0129	2018-11-29	NEWS	Federica Mogherini opens Annual Conference devoted to unmanned/autonomous systems	" The European Defence Agency’s Annual Conference 2018 entitled 'From Unmanned to Autonomous Systems: Trends, Challenges and Opportunities’ was opened this morning in Brussels by the Head of the Agency, Federica Mogherini. Addressing a 400-strong audience representing the whole European defence spectrum - governments, armed forces, industry, EU institutions, NATO, think tanks and media - Ms Mogherini welcomed that the Agency's annual conference ""once again, is a place to talk about innovation, and to look at the trends that are shaping our world and our security environment"". Devoting this year's conference to unmanned & autonomous systems and artificial intelligence proved to be a very timely choice as ""this is not a debate about some distant future, or about science-fiction"" but about technological developments which are already part of our lives, Ms Mogherini said. Artificial intelligence is everywhere and its applications are expanding at incredible speed, ""also contributing to our security – for instance, in building stronger defence systems against cyber-attacks"".   Humans must always remain in control of the use of lethal force Yet we also know that artificial intelligence poses new security challenges, and it is now starting to be weaponised, the Head of the Agency said. ""We are entering a world where drones could independently search for a target and kill without human intervention. Artificial intelligence could take decisions on life and death, with no direct control from a human being. The warning about the dangers ahead is coming from the very people who are working on artificial intelligence: researchers, pioneers, and business people as well, who don't want to see their own discoveries exploited for malicious goals"".  Against this background, the EU has a very special role to play – as a promoter of new global rules to protect our citizens' security, and at the same time, as a force for innovation and progress at the service of human beings, she stressed. ""So first of all, we are working to build consensus on what should and should not be allowed in the field of autonomous weapons. We would like scientists and researchers to be free to do their job knowing that their discoveries will not be used to harm innocent people. Together we can define the boundaries of artificial intelligence applications, so that within those limits, scientists are free to explore the immense positive potential of artificial intelligence"", said Ms Mogherini, adding: ""Our position on this has always been very clear: all weapon systems should comply with international law, and humans must always remain in control of the use of lethal force"".  Work is currently ongoing at the United Nations to define a first set of guiding principles on autonomous weapons, and this work needs close cooperation between governments, the industry and civil society.   ""No time to waste on Artificial Intelligence"" Supporting innovation and having a strong industry is essential for Europe's security, and this is also true with artificial intelligence, Ms Mogherini stated. ""Almost 50 per cent of global private investment in artificial intelligence start-ups is happening in China. We Europeans cannot afford to waste time, and to be less innovative than other world powers. It is a matter of economic growth, and it is a matter of security"".  Our European defence industries and research laboratories are among the best in the world. And yet, investment from European national governments in research and technology in the field of defence continue to decrease, she underlined. ""We, as the European Union, cannot tell national institutions how much to spend on defence or on research. What we can do – and what we are doing, is to incentivize our Member States to join forces, create new economies of scale, to the benefit of our industry and of our collective security. This is the logic behind all the work we have been doing on security and research, with the European Defence Agency, with the European Commission and with our Member States"".   EDA's essential contribution to recent EU defence initiatives The revised Capability Development Plan (CDP), the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD), the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the European Defence Fund (EDF) are all tools recently set up to allow and foster increased defence cooperation. The European Defence Agency, Ms Mogherini said, ""provided an essential contribution in crafting these initiatives, to ensure their coherence and to help turn them into concrete action"".  The Europe of defence is taking shape, and in the years ahead, the role of the European Defence Agency will be even more important, she stressed. ""This can be the hub where governments and the industry meet. A place for coordination among national defence policies, following the guiding light of innovation and of our collective security"".   More information Speech by Head of Agency Federica Mogherini at the EDA 2018 Annual Conference     "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/11/29/federica-mogherini-opens-annual-conference-focused-on-unmanned-and-autonomous-systems

EDA_NEWS_0133	2018-11-20	NEWS	Cyber education, training, exercise and evaluation (ETEE) platform launched	 EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq, today attended the inauguration of the Cyber education, training, exercise and evaluation (ETEE) platform at the European Security and Defence College (ESDC), where H.E. Savvas Angelides, Minister of Defence of Cyprus gave a keynote speech. Led by the ESDC, the platform builds on the support already provided by the European Defence Agency (EDA), the European External Action Service (EEAS) and the European Commission. The main task of the ETEE platform within the ESDC is the coordination of cyber security and defence training and education for EU Member States. The existing training will be harmonised and standardised and new courses will close the gaps between training needs and training activities. These efforts will be jointly undertaken by various stakeholders and partner organisations. ‘Looking at the future, the platform’s success is very much in the hands of the Member States.  There is much to be achieved and the Executive Academic Board on Cyber (EAB.Cyber) under the chair of the ESDC is an excellent forum to manage the future’, Mr Domecq said in his speech. In response to Member States’ requirement to fill the skills gap in cyber defence, EDA played an important role in developing the design proposal of this platform, following the results of a relevant feasibility study which were properly adapted to the actual Member States’ needs. The Global Strategy  already referred to cyber attack as a serious threat to be dealt with in order to protect the EU citizens and a threat to national security due to the disruptive potential of these attacks and their high impact on modern societies. Heads of State and Government identified cyber among the four key capability shortfalls in Europe and Member States in the frame of PESCO already established projects on cyber, where EDA with its role in the PESCO secretariat but also in the frame of its mission for cooperative capability development provides support.  Member States saw the need for coherence at EU level on cyber education, training and exercises already some 8 years ago, and voiced as such within the Capability Development Plan.  The EDA has worked on this priority with Member States, within the Project Team for Cyber Defence and with colleagues in the European External Action Service and Cyber was reconfirmed as a priority in the revised CDP. Based on the EDA Cyber Defence Training Needs Analysis and the experiences gained in cyber security training of the ESDC, work was initiated to establish CSDP Training and Education for different audiences, including EEAS, personnel from CSDP missions and operations and Member States' officials. The integration of ETEE into the existing structures of the ESDC was concluded and has been taken forward by EDA and ESDC throughout the course of this past year, resulting in a vehicle to enable sustained delivery of cyber defence education, training and exercise services and products, while seeking synergies with respective NATO initiatives, also in the frame of the implementation of the EU-NATO Joint Declaration.   More information: Cyber defence (EDA project page) ESDC statement on Cyber Platform EEAS communication on ETEE inauguration ceremony EEAS article on Handbook on Cybersecurity: 'Cybersecurity is a collective responsibility' EU publication: Handbook on cyber security       	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/11/20/cyber-education-training-exercise-and-evaluation-(etee)-platform-launched
EDA_NEWS_0134	2018-11-19	NEWS	Half way from the concept to joint technology demonstration	 60 experts approximately from 5 nations (Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway and Poland) jointly trialed technology demonstrators developed under the EDA IED Detection programme (IEDDET) in October 2018, Austria. The joint trials aimed at data collection for all technology demonstrators developed within the IEDDET three projects VMEWI3, MUSICODE and CONFIDENT under the same operation conditions.   Joint test area The Allentsteig test area for the EDA IEDDET programme joint trials was provided by Austria as contribution to the IEDDET programme. For these trials a special 500m test-lane, free of metal scrap was tailored and built for the MUSICODE field-test programme. For VMEWI3 two test lanes, each of 2000m length, were provided. On each these test lanes 15 georeferenced IEDs were buried. On the VMEWI3 test-lanes the full IED-vignettes were arranged.   Initial IEDDET projects observations The objective of the VMEWI3 technology demonstrator is to provide early warning of indirect IED indicators by using a suite of forward looking camera systems on an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). Real-time detection and decision fusion is applied to enhance the overall detection performance. The operator of the system is located in a moving manned vehicle following the unmanned detection platform at safe distance with the same speed, and will be able to confirm, reject and manually add detections. For the first joint EDA IEDDET trial a demonstrator was developed consisting of a multi-camera head with nine tailormade camera systems each focusing on a specific set of indicators, such as ground signs, man-made objects and markers. The multi-camera head was mounted on a panning unit allowing the head to follow the road curvatures and to be aimed at a suspect object when halted for inspection. The multi-camera head, together with a highly accurate positioning system was mounted on an unmanned ground vehicle to provide stand-off. Both the multi-sensor head and the unmanned ground vehicle could be remotely controlled from a control vehicle. Single sensor detection algorithms were developed and also software to allow the detections of each camera to be registered to the same reference image for fusion. The highly accurate position and pose of the camera system is required to map the detected indicators in world coordinates on a map and decision processing. During the trial synchronized data acquisition with all nine camera systems and the positioning system was achieved on four kilometers of test lane on which vignettes had been emplaced. Data was primarily collected with a manned UGV, up to speeds of 15km/h, to obtain maximum quality data for offline analysis, detection and fusion algorithm development in the coming year of the programme. Additionally, remote control of the UGV during data acquisition with the multi-sensor platform was demonstrated up to speeds of approximately 20km/h. The images of all nine cameras were remotely (wireless) displayed in the Control Vehicle. Real-time processing and depiction of multi-camera early warnings to an operator was achieved in simulation mode by replaying the recorded data as if in real-time and for live data on a static UGV. The trial results will be used to further develop detection and fusion algorithms and to achieve real-time early warning on a moving UGV. The detected indicators will be exchanged offline with the MUSICODE and CONFIDENT projects in EDA IEDDET Joint Detection Map (JDM). The aim of the MUSICODE project is to demonstrate an improved Technology Readiness Level 5 multi sensor detection approach compared to available systems. Data from several sources will be used to enhance the capability of IED detection.  Four different on-board sensor systems based on already known technologies, with the addition of existing detections from the VMEWI3 technology demonstrator as well as a priori available intelligence information. The goal is to combine this information to strengthen the confidence in (combined) alarms, and possibly reduce the false alarm rate. Running several sensor systems on the same platform, with the addition of remote control and data links and high precision GPS positioning is particularly challenging with respect to cross talk and interference between systems.  Preliminary interference anechoic chamber trials were already conducted at an earlier stage, and one of the main goals in Allentsteig was to repeat these trials under field conditions and with the inclusion of mitigation measures pointed out during the first lab experiments. A second goal was to obtain a realistic detection data set for each on-board sensor system. For this purpose, dedicated targets were produced and emplaced by the various teams. The third goal was to run the system with the tactical vignette targets also used by the other projects. This was performed partly on a completely clutter free test lane, and partly on the so-called tactical lane which was shared with the other teams.  The combined IEDDET Programme data set will be used to discuss and implement the EDA IEDDET JDM solution.  Finally, the Allentsteig trials resulted in the first shake-down of technical solutions in general terms, also with respect to mechanical design.   Participants to the 1rst joint IEDDET programme trials The project CONFIDENT has the objective to provide demonstrator platforms of an UGV and an UAV, equipped with suitable sets of sensors for close-in confirmation and identification of IEDs. In addition, CONFIDENT will add airborne early-warning capabilities. These platforms will take action on IEDs already detected by VMEWI3 and MUSICODE, either after excavation in route-clearance scenarios or, if placed above-ground, particularly in urban scenarios including CBRNE-threat. At the first joint EDA IEDDET trials the focus of the CONFIDENT test programme was on testing three newly developed sensors under field conditions. All sensors were operated mounted on the UGV. The scenario of an excavated IED was simulated by a dummy-IED. The UAV for close-in inspection was tested for the capability of airborne chemical detection. Two types of UAV have been tested with the different scenarios. Regarding airborne early warning capabilities, a software-tool is being developed to detect the defined IED indicators. The photographic material for this development has been collected by flights of the Schibel-Camcopter capturing scenarios provided by role-players. Additionally, airborne early warning capabilities have also been demonstrated with a swarm of drones.

Defence ministers notably discussed the CARD Trial Run Report, the implementation of the 11 new EU Capability Development Priorities and the Agency’s 2019 budget.   Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD) Ministers discussed the main findings, recommendations and lessons learned of the CARD Trial Run report and agreed to establish CARD as a standing activity with the first full cycle to be launched in autumn 2019. Some main findings indicate that Member States still carry defence planning and acquisition mostly from a national perspective. CARD will provide the overview that will allow Member States to better coordinate their defence planning and spending and engage in collaborative projects, improving consistency in Member States defence spending and overall coherence of the European capability landscape. The report also confirmed an upwards trend of defence spending over the 2015-2019 period, even if it also shows that investment in defence research and development has decreased over recent years. The CARD ‘lessons learned’ for the future will be further explored in a series of workshops organised by EDA in the coming weeks and months. “CARD is designed to be a ‘pathfinder’ helping Member States to get a better picture of the European capability landscape and identifying new opportunities for cooperation on capability development and procurement, while avoiding duplication of work with NATO”, Jorge Domecq, EDA’s Chief Executive, commented.   Implementation of the 2018 EU Capability Development Priorities Last June, Member States approved 11 new EU Capability Development Priorities, which are the baseline and key reference for CARD, PESCO and the European Defence Fund. Ministers were updated on their practical implementation which will be pursued through ‘Strategic Context Cases’ for each of the 11 priorities together with Member States, in close coordination with the EU Military Committee (EUMC) and the EU Military Staff (EUMS), also involving the EU defence industry. The first version of the 11 ‘Strategic Context Cases’ will be presented to the steering board in June 2019 for approval.   Cooperative Financial Mechanism (CFM) Ministers were updated on the state of play regarding the establishment of the Cooperative Financial Mechanism (CFM) and endorsed the proposed way ahead. In cooperation with the European Investment Bank (EIB), the objective is to make the CFM a tool to sup-port cooperative projects inter alia where unsynchronised defence budgets hinder or impede the launch or implementation of such projects. The European Council called since 2016 for an increased support from the EIB to the defence and security sector. EDA offered its expertise to the EIB for materializing this support and a Memorandum of Understanding has been signed in February 2018 between the two institutions. Negotiations of the CFM Programme Arrangement (PA) were recently finalized; the document is now under staffing in the capitals.   2019 General Budget & 3-Year Planning Framework 2019-2021 No unanimous agreement could be found at the Steering Board on a 2019 General Budget that would allow the Agency to carry forward its increasing number of tasks including in relation to CARD, PESCO, the European Defence Fund or new activities such as Military Mobility. Subsequently, on 22 November, the Head of Agency proposed to Member States to allow the Agency to activate ‘provisional twelfths’ during the first quarter of 2019 on the basis of the 2018 General Budget level set at €32.5 million. Member States approved this way forward on 11 December, by written procedure. At the appropriate moment and taking into account the wider context, the Head of Agency will resubmit an EDA 2019 General Budget proposal for discussion and consideration by Member States. As a result of the inconclusive 2019 General Budget discussion, Ministers were informed during the Steering Board that, at this stage, no agreement on the EDA 3-Year Planning Framework 2019-2021 could be reached and that the Agency would revert to Member States in due time to address the way ahead.           EDA press contacts Helmut BRULS Media & Communications Officer helmut.bruls@eda.europa.eu T+32 2 504 28 10 Catherine CIECZKO Media & Communications Officer catherine.cieczko@eda.europa.eu T+32 2 504 28 24        	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/11/20/outcome-of-eda-ministerial-steering-board
EDA_NEWS_0136	2018-10-30	NEWS	EDA Chief Executive visits Denmark	" On 30 October, upon invitation by the Danish authorities, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq paid a visit to Denmark where he met with the Minister of Defence, Claus Hjort Frederiksen, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry for Industry, Business and Financial Affairs, Thomas Ditmer, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ulrik Vestergaars Knudsen, as well as other government officials and industry representatives. The discussions centred on the interaction between Denmark and EDA.  “I really appreciate Danish involvement in the Agency’s activities in areas such as Energy and Single European Sky. Though Denmark is not a member of EDA and while fully respecting its opt-out from the defence aspects of the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy, I strongly believe that a certain level of interaction in the Agency’s work directly related to wider EU policies and regulations, as well as activities that benefit from EU funding, can provide for mutual benefits"", Mr Domecq commented.

EDA_NEWS_0137	2018-10-19	NEWS	Research & technology SMEs win 1st EDA Defence Innovation Prize	 The European Defence Agency (EDA) today announced the two winners of the first EDA Defence Innovation Prize: AITEX, a Spanish textile research institute, and Clover Technologies, a Spanish company providing advanced technology services for information systems and communications.  The award ceremony will take place in the margins of EDA’s 2018 Annual Conference on 29 November in Brussels.  The Prize, the first edition of which was launched early this year, rewards companies and research entities which come up with the most innovative ideas for new technologies, products, processes or services applicable in the defence domain.  A call for applications was issued in February (see related EDA news here) inviting all types of industries and research institutions in Europe (defence and civil/commercial producers, large companies and SMEs, defence-related and civil research communities) to come forward with ground-breaking ideas which, if implemented between now and 2035, would help improve and enhance Europe’s defence capabilities in two specific domains: Autonomous detection, identification and monitoring/sampling/analysis through sensor and platform networking in the area of CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear) protection technologies and techniques Integration of multi-robot swarming concepts in support of future defence capabilities in the area of Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC). A total of 24 companies and research institutes from across Europe participated in the contest. A jury thoroughly assessed each of the proposals and reached agreement on the two winners who are awarded €10,000 each.    The winning ideas AITEX won in the category ‘Autonomous detection, identification and monitoring through sensor and platform networking in the area of CBRN protection technologies and techniques’ with a smart textile idea: a ‘wearable computing’ system composed of many electronic devices (including sensors able to monitor environmental and personal parameters) fully integrated into textile solutions. For this purpose, it is proposed to develop Electronic Noses (ENs) integrated into textiles based on an array of sensors composed of Graphene Oxide (GO) capable of identifying and quantifying a wide range of chemical warfare agents. The complete system would be printed on a textile substrate obtaining a fully wearable system which has significant advantages compared to traditional rigid and semiportable ENs. Clover Technologies won the prize in the category ‘Integration of multi-robot swarming concepts in support of future defence capabilities in the area of GNC’ with an idea based on a blockchain-based solution to provide a common platform for swarm nodes with an extra security layer. Swarm robotics is an emerging technology facing many challenges such as computational and storage limitations, heterogeneous communication protocols, information security, etc. The idea put forward by the winner aims at a solution which would facilitates the communication of the swarm robotic nodes within a secure environment that offers integrity, confidentiality and authentication. The projected solution is composed of: - a blockchain platform which allows a secure coordination of a swarm robotic; - a Group Key Distribution Algorithm which allows to manage, in a secure way, the joining/leaving operations within a swarm robotic; - and Java Card technology, which offers a tamper resistant solution to storage and manage the sensitive information in a robot.   Background AITEX, based in Alcoy (Spain), is a leading Spanish centre of research, innovation and advanced technical services for the textile sector. AITEX is a private non-profit association set up in 1985 as an initiative of the Valencian Regional Government, through the Valencian Institute for Small and Medium Industry (IMPIVA), to make the textile sector more competitive. AITEX’ key activity domains include smart textiles, nanotechnology, materials and sustainability and biotechnology.  Clover Technologies, based in Leganès/Madrid, is an industrial company providing advanced technology services for information systems and communications. It is also active in other domains such as IT solutions and information security management, ITSEC and Common Criteria consulting and evaluation and Blockchain consulting and development, security assessment and conformance analysis of security standards and protocols, design and development of UAV security solutions, as well as professional promotion, certifications training and awareness activities.    	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/10/19/research-technology-smes-win-1st-eda-defence-innovation-prize

EDA_NEWS_0140	2018-10-16	NEWS	Further progress in sustainable energy for defence sector	 Over 140 experts from 27 European countries and more than 30 different institutions and organisations participate in the Conference on the second Phase of the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector (CF SEDSS II). The Forum brings together experts from the defence and energy sectors to share information and best practices on improving energy management, energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy as well as increasing the protection and resilience of defence energy-related critical infrastructures. Managed by EDA, the Consultation Forum is a European Commission initiative (DG ENER) receiving funding under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 R&I programme. The   conference of today was officially opened by Mr Tomasz Zdzikot, Polish Deputy Minister of Defence. Jorge Domecq, the EDA Chief Executive highlighted in his speech the “large number of participants which send the strong message that sustainable energy matters for defence, and a greener defence energy matters for the European Union”. Mr Hans Van Steen, Acting Director for Renewables, Research and Innovation, Energy Efficiency, DG ENER, European Commission, underlined the importance of having seen “a network develop, information being exchanged, best practices being shared, and capacity, trust and self-confidence grow”. The Consultation Forum provides a unique platform that can assist the Ministries of Defence of the EU Member States to generate ideas for defence energy policies, strategies, action plans and defence energy-related project ideas. This process will enable them to move towards a more sustainable energy model bringing down energy bills that can be allocated to other military priorities. In this respect, the second phase is more project-oriented, and as the Chief Executive underlined, it “presents a financial and strategic opportunity to improve energy efficiency and to diversify the energy supply and enhance resilience to security challenges”. Mr Hans Van Steen drew the participants’ attention to the fact that “At a time of tight defence budgets, the Defence and Security sector cannot afford to ignore the opportunities that a state-of-the-art approach to energy efficiency and renewable energy sources offer in terms of economic advantages, security of supply and environmental impact”. He then added that, in this context, “It is very important that the Defence community has a clear understanding of how the new EU legislation on energy could affect its work. The Energy Union Framework Strategy is not only about energy and climate: it is part of a wider policy aimed at accelerating the fundamental modernisation of Europe's entire economy, making it low-carbon and energy and resource efficient, by transforming the whole energy system in a socially fair manner.“ The Warsaw Conference focusses on a range of financing and funding options, coming either from the national public sector or the European Union instruments. To support this process, the Chief Executive has launched today the European Funding Gateway for Energy in Defence, a dedicated web-page on the EDA website. Through this instrument, he encourages the participants to explore what is “an overview of the financing and funding opportunities that the defence sector, and the Ministries of Defence and Armed Forces, industry, research and technology organisations or academia, can access at the European level for energy-related projects”. The Conference will last two days and address several topics ranging from energy data in defence, energy metering & data collection, energy performance contracts, RES projects including energy storage to critical energy infrastructure resilience and energy-related legislation.   Next Conference The third Conference of the Consultation Forum will be hosted by the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Cyprus and will take place in Nicosia on 26 and 27 February 2019.   About the CF SEDSS II The Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector (CF SEDSS) is a European Commission initiative managed by the EDA. It aims at bringing together experts from the defence and energy sectors to share information and best practices on improving energy management, energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy as well increasing the protection and resilience of defence energy-related critical infrastructures. On 20 October 2017, the second phase of the Consultation Forum (CF SEDSS II) was launched. This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, and the agreement is between the EASME executive agency and the EDA. The contract was signed on 16 October 2017 for 22 months, expiring on August 2019.  Based on the foundations laid during the first phase of the Consultation Forum (2015-2017), the second phase has been further expanded to cover the following interrelated subjects though three main working groups (including sub-working groups): WG 1: Energy Management including Energy Efficiency (Sub-WG1: Energy Management and Sub-WG2: Energy Efficiency; WG 2: Renewable Energy Sources and Technologies; WG 3: Protection of Critical Energy Infrastructure and one cross-cutting theme: Finance.

EDA_NEWS_0142	2018-09-26	NEWS	2018 Military Airworthiness Conference opens in Madrid	 EDA’s 2018 Military Airworthiness Conference, organised in Madrid with the support of the Dirección General de Armamento y Material (DGAM) of the Spanish Ministry of Defence, was opened on 26 September by EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq. The two-day event brings together key stakeholders from national authorities, industry, European agencies and international organisations, to exchange views and best practices related to the harmonisation of European military airworthiness rules and standards. Common airworthiness approaches and standards are viewed as critical enablers for enhanced European defence cooperation.  In his opening speech, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq thanked the Spanish authorities for hosting the event and for their strong support and involvement in the MAWA Forum. He recalled the creation of the Forum 10 years ago and stressed that since then, a comprehensive set of European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) was developed and implemented by Member States.  “Although the levels of EMAR-implementation vary from country to country, based on this harmonised approach a total of 40 recognitions between military airworthiness authorities have been signed in the last five years and are now viewed as cornerstones for the structural cooperation between authorities. I would call this a remarkable result”, Mr Domecq stated. In addition, the MAWA initiative is getting stronger attention outside Europe, on a global level. “Several non-EDA participating nations (e.g Norway, Denmark, Switzerland and Australia) have embraced the same approach, are in the process of implementing EMAR’s in their national systems and are engaged in mutual recognitions with National Military Airworthiness Authorities”, he said. Furthermore, Member States are now acknowledging that harmonised safety requirements are beneficial for everyone, even beyond the airworthiness domain. “As a result, Member States have tasked EDA to develop a proposal for the progressive introduction of a Total System Approach to Military Aviation on the basis of two pilot projects, notably RPAS and military transport aircraft. This proposal, that should give a new impetus to the harmonisation of safety requirements in military aviation, will be presented to Member States at the end of this year”, the EDA Chief Executive announced.  He also stressed the “outstanding cooperative relationship with NATO” in the area of military aviation.    Background The Military Airworthiness Authorities (MAWA) Forum oversees the development and maintenance of the European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) and promotes ways and means to harmonise the military airworthiness oversight across Europe.  A central theme of this year’s conference is the implementation of a new airworthiness roadmap as a next step in the progressive alignment of airworthiness approaches in Europe. In this context, participants exchange views on the impact the EMARs have had so far, both on the regulated community and the military airworthiness authorities. The conference also addresses the challenges of transitioning towards EMAR-based regulations in the coming years. Other topics on the agenda are the evolution of the cooperation framework between national military airworthiness authorities, as well as global developments. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/09/26/2018-military-airworthiness-conference-opens-in-madrid
EDA_NEWS_0143	2018-10-15	NEWS	EDA promotes civil-military collaboration in the 13th ICAO Air Navigation Conference	 The European Defence Agency (EDA) is actively participating in the 13th Air Navigation Conference of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), under the umbrella of the European Commission Directorate General for Mobility and Transport (DG MOVE). The agenda of the conference themed 'From Development to Implementation' includes a topic on civil-military cooperation. The EDA plays a key role in this domain and at EU level, to facilitate the coordination of military views and act as interface between the Military community and the EU institutions. As a result, EDA coordinated the development of the working paper proposed by the EU on this topic. ICAO Member States and aviation stakeholders attend the conference to exchange on global strategies for safety and air navigation planning, development and implementation. As part of the European Union delegation mandated by Violeta Bulc, European Commissioner for Mobility and Transport, Mr Christophe Vivier, Head of Unit SES/SEAR, and Mr Denis Bouvier, Project Officer SES Policy, will participate on behalf of the EDA. This year’s conference focuses on the implementation of operational improvements from the conceptual phase until deployment. It emphasizes the importance of concepts for global use, the development of regional implementation plans and the local implementation of performance improvements, based on specific operational requirements in a cost-effective approach. Participants will establish priorities for safety and air navigation planning for the coming years and develop a set of high-level recommendations in different key performance areas of the air navigation system, to be submitted to the ICAO Council for subsequent endorsement by the 40th Session of the ICAO Assembly in 2019. In close collaboration with the European Commission Directorate General for Mobility and Transport (DG MOVE) the Agency contributes to technical discussions on civil-military cooperation and coordinates the European Union’s military inputs towards it. Civil-military cooperation is necessary to enhance Air Traffic Management (ATM) as well as communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS), and to create a safe and more interoperable airspace. Its goal is to move from coordination to collaboration and from ATM research and development to implementation. This contribution from the EDA reflects the strong collaboration links forged with DG MOVE regarding the military side of the SES/SESAR operations. The overall objective is to ensure that a modernised aviation system will accommodate the needs of all stakeholders, including the military, for operations and training, all types of platforms (manned and unmanned) and all types of missions, roles and applications, in a balanced and proportioned way, in peace time and in crisis situations. In preparation for this important event, the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) set up an ad-hoc ECAC/EU coordination group for safety and ATM in which the EDA was represented. This group, co-chaired by the European Commission and by ECAC, has been tasked to steer the preparation of draft ‘European Working and Information Papers’ to be presented at AN-Conf/13. Regarding Civil-Military cooperation, the AN-Conf/13 will be invited to agree on four recommendations: Urge States to agree with the strategic approach moving from civil-military coordination to collaboration. Request ICAO to provide appropriate guidelines on the strategic approach. Encourage ICAO to develop together with States mechanisms to collaborate with the military community at global and regional levels. Request ICAO to reinforce the development of civil-military synergies thanks to an effective collaboration starting from research and development to deployment of interoperable systems. The final report will be available in two weeks.   More information: ICAO website Committee A - Agenda Item 3: Enhancing the global air navigation system (video)    	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/10/15/eda-takes-the-lead-in-coordinating-the-military-for-civil-military-discussions-at-icao-conference
EDA_NEWS_0144	2018-10-10	NEWS	EDA supported course relevant to defence receives ERASMUS+ funding	 The European Union’s ERASMUS+ programme, funded by the European Commission to support education and training, has awarded €3 million for a transnational advanced Master course relevant to defence called EMIMEO: 'Erasmus Mundus on Innovative Microwave Electronics and Optics'.   EDA contributed with data analysis to the application which was put forward by a consortium led by the Université de Limoges in France to access ERASMUS+ funding.  EDA’s support to EMIMEO is justified by the fact that it addresses analog RF Photonics and Microwaves which are in the critical defence technologies list and also part of the Capability Development Plan (CDP) where they are considered as enablers for advanced radars and electronic warfare systems. The European defence industry and research institutes are looking for engineers and researchers with skills and competences in this complex field. Under its activities related to Key Strategic Activities (KSA) in defence meant to identify key domains for European strategic autonomy, EDA has selected the area of RF Photonics as a relevant sample case. The EMIMEO Master course will contribute to support European skills and competencies in this domain, as well as the competitiveness and non-dependence of the European high-tech industry (including defence and space) in the development of Photonics and Microwave applications.   The international partnership (encompassing industry, universities and associations in 6 Member States) includes the following participants: Università di Brescia (Italy), Universidad Del Pais Vasco/ Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea (Spain), Aston University (United Kingdom), Universitatea Tehnica Cluj-Napoca (Romania); Altran Italia SpA and Hitachi Rail Italy SpA in Italy; GMV Aerospace and Defence SA, and TTI Norte SL in Spain; Oclaro Technology Ltd in United Kingdom; European Microwave Association in Belgium; Alcatel-Lucent International Sas, Amcad Engineering, Competitiveness cluster Alpha-RLH, Callisto France, III-V Lab, Inoveos, NOKIA, CNES, Thales Alenia Space France, Thales SA and United Monolithic Semiconductors SAS, Zodiac Aerospace  in France. This successful case is another example of the importance of ensuring consistency and coherence between European defence priorities and EU funding opportunities. Against this backdrop, EDA will continue to serve its Member States' Ministries of Defence, research centres, universities and industries in an integrated manner on all relevant dimensions: R&T, key skills and competencies, industrial supply-chain.   For more information: Capability Development Plan (CDP) Key Strategic Activities in Defence (KSA) CapTech Technologies for Components and Modules European Funding Gateway for Defence Erasmus+ for Defence. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/10/10/eda-supported-course-relevant-to-defence-receives-erasmus-funding
EDA_NEWS_0145	2018-10-02	NEWS	Vienna Conference highlights research potential of European Defence Fund	 Picture: Bundesheer/Daniel Trippolt A high-level EU conference on ‘The European Defence Fund (EDF) – Driving factor for defence research and innovation’ took place today in Vienna. The event, which gathered some 500 defence policy makers, industry representatives, researchers and other stakeholders, was organized by the Austrian Presidency of the Council of the European Union with the support of European Commission and the European Defence Agency (EDA).  The conference was opened by Austria’s Defence Minister Mario Kunasek, followed by video messages delivered by European Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen and Commissioner Elżbieta Bieńkowska (Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship & SMEs). Key note speeches were delivered by European Parliament Vice President and rapporteur on the European Defence Fund), Prof. Zdzisław Krasnodębski, EU Military Committee Chairman General Mikhail Kostarakos, as well as EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq.  Successive panels then analysed and debated the European Commission’s EDF proposal, the interaction and consistency between research and capability development, as well as the future design of financial instruments tailored for the needs and challenges of the European defence sector. EDA Deputy Chief Executive Olli Ruutu and EDA’s European Synergies & Innovation (ESI) Director, Denis Roger, were among the panelists participating in these debates.  In his opening speech, Minister Kunasek stressed the importance for Europe to have an “innovative and competitive European defence industry”. “We therefore require new ways of cooperation between Armed Forces, entreprises, industry and the research community in order to find scientific, technological and capability-based solutions, and to activate value chains that help us strengthen our security and defence competence”, he stated.   EDA Chief Executive Domecq, in his speech, insisted on the need to ensure coherence and consistency between the EDF and the other EU defence initiatives, especially the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD) and the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO). On top of that, the baseline for all three initiatives should be the 2018 Capability Development Plan (CDP). “Even if we ensure that all three initiatives – CARD, PESCO, EDF - are smoothly coordinated and harmonised, there is one element which is indispensable for coherent capability development at European level, and that is common priority setting, which must be the baseline for CARD, PESCO and EDF”, he said. In the research domain, common priority setting is ensured by the Overarching Strategic Research Agenda (OSRA) which links capability priorities and defence research activities. “What the CDP is for capability development, the OSRA is for research. Before the end of the year, we will, for the first time, have adopted agreed research priorities stemming from the CDP 2018, that can be used for not only ad-hoc research activities among Member States but also for the Research Window of the EDF projects and other funding instruments such as H2020, Horizon Europe, ESIF, COSME, and more”, Mr Domecq announced. It is important that the EDF takes into account the experiences from the EDIDP discussions, as well as the lessons learned from the implementation of the Preparatory Action on Defence Research and the previous Pilot Project, the EDA Chief Executive said.  If the Defence Fund is capability driven, focused on the agreed priorities and coherent with the other defence initiatives, “then it has a great potential added value in the development of European defence capabilities and incentivizing cooperation”, Mr Domecq concluded.   More information: Conference website    	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/10/02/vienna-conference-highlights-research-potential-of-european-defence-fund

With several EU Member States developing their own national cyber ranges, this project aims at developing a system to interconnect and federate them into a highly effective European network that benefits from the strengths of each participant.  The objective is to develop a more sophisticated and powerful platform enabling exercise and training planners to design more realistic scenarios relying on existing and interconnected capabilities. At the same time, it will allow users to improve their Cyber Defence skills by relying on an extremely effective environment. In addition to training and exercise support, the federated capability will also be beneficial for other activities such as research, modelling, simulation and testing. The sharing of knowledge and best practices is another objective of the project.  The Cyber Ranges Federation will be supported by a web-based Cyber Defence Training and Exercise Coordination Platform (CD TEXP), an EDA product currently in a test phase, whose capabilities will be extended to support the project. The EDA also provides expertise and support in Cyber Defence and other areas. The first phase of the project, led by The Netherlands, was focused on developing formal requirements and a draft high level technical architecture to interconnect national cyber ranges. The requirements were produced leveraging knowledge and experience from all participant Member States, including military and academia representatives. NATO was involved in the first phase as an observer. In light of the 2016 EU-NATO Joint Declaration, additional ways for cooperation and coordination with NATO’s own capabilities will also be investigated by the project team in the next phase.   Second phase launched on 5 September The second phase of the project (‘Spiral two’), led by Finland, kicked off on 5 September 2018 at a meeting in Helsinki (picture above). It will mainly focus on taking up the afore-mentioned requirements and implement them. The outcome will include the creation of a Community of Interest in which Cyber Defence training and exercise specialists will collaborate and improve the pooling & sharing of resources in this highly demanding domain.  Earlier this year, six Member States signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) confirming their intent to contribute with their respective cyber range assets to the project; other Member States are expected to join the MoU before end of 2018.   Background The success of military operations, including EU-led operations, is increasingly dependent on the availability of, and access to, cyberspace. The EU Cyber Security Strategy 2013 recognizes Cyber Defence as one of the strategic priorities of the EU and Heads of State and Governments decided in December 2013 that Cyber Defence should be one of four key areas for capability development.  An essential element of EU cyber defence capability is highly skilled and well-trained personnel. Enhancing awareness and education of technicians, operators and decision-makers is urgent. Cyber ranges to support training and exercises are both essential and scarce. In the 2014 Capability Development Plan, the scarceness of cyber range facilities in support of Training and Exercises was recognized as an important capability gap that urgently needs resolution. The now established project serves to close this capability gap. Pooling & Sharing projects are an integral means for closing capability gaps in the cyber domain.   More Information: Six Member States agree to pool & share cyber ranges capabilities (EDA news June 2018) Cyber Ranges: EDA’s First Ever Cyber Defence Pooling & Sharing Project Launched By 11 Member States (EDA news May 2017) EDA Cyber Defence project page EDA Cyber Defence factsheet    	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/09/13/cyber-ranges-federation-project-reaches-new-milestone

EDA_NEWS_0149	2018-09-20	NEWS	EDA Chief Executive attends OCCAR 20th Birthday ceremony	" Jorge Domecq, the Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency (EDA), today attended the 20th birthday ceremony of the Organisation Conjointe de Coopération en matière d'Armement (OCCAR) in its new premises in Bonn. At that occasion, he welcomed the close and productive working relationship established between the EDA and OCCAR on the basis of the Administrative Arrangement signed in July 2012 and called for an even stronger cooperation in the future to bring forward potential new collaborative defence equipment programmes, also in view of the opportunities that the recent EU defence initiatives provide.  “I am very glad to be here today on the occasion of the 20th Anniversary of OCCAR. Since 2012, EDA and OCCAR have established close relations which are continuously evolving, aiming to complement each other’s strengths in promoting effective defence cooperation while ensuring through-life capability development”, Mr Domecq stated. The close relationship between the two organisations started immediately after the creation of the EDA in 2004 but gathered additional momentum in November 2008 when the EU Council of Ministers invited the EDA to seek the “greatest synergy” with OCCAR and to conclude an Administrative Arrangement (AA), which was subsequently negotiated and signed in 2012. It foresees that both cooperate in a way that is “mutually reinforcing, non-duplicative, coherent and complementary” in order to enhance Europe’s defence capabilities, improve European armaments cooperation and strengthen the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB). The conclusions and recommendations of EDA’s Long Term Review (LTR), approved by Defence Ministers in May 2017, explicitly acknowledge “the potential of the EDA-OCCAR relations to further evolve into a more structured and reciprocal approach towards key European capability programmes, ensuring seamless coordination and coherence between both organisations”.    Division of labour While EDA main role is to initiate and facilitate European collaborative defence capability ad hoc projects and programmes, OCCAR’s provides for cooperative programme management expertise. Close cooperation between EDA and OCCAR ensures through-life managementon capability development. This division of labour proved successful, for example, in the development of the Multinational Multi-Role Tanker Transport Fleet (MMF) in which participate five countries (NL, LUX, DE, NOR, BE) and whose aim is to mitigate Europe’s shortfall in Air-to-Air refueling capabilities. Initiated by the EDA in 2012, it was later handed over to OCCAR who currently manages the acquisition of MRTT tankers on behalf of the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) which, following the acquisition phase, will be responsible for the complete life-cycle management of the fleet.  Other example: the Medium Altitude Long Endurance Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (MALE RPAS) programme. Launched in an EDA framework in 2013, it was taken up by four Member States (DE, FR, IT, ES) before being handed over to OCCAR in 2016 for further development (definition, configuration, etc.) while EDA continues to provide support to the programme upon its expertise. Indeed, in September 2016, EDA and OCCAR concluded an arrangement under which EDA will continue to provide support to the MALE RPAS programme in the field of air traffic integration building on the work already achieved and on the on-going activities related to the integration of military RPAS in the Single European Sky approach.    Background OCCAR was initially established by an Administrative Arrangement signed by the Defence Ministers of France, Germany, Italy and the UK on 12 November 1996. In 1998, the Defence Ministers of the four founding Member States signed the treaty-like ""OCCAR Convention"", which was subsequently ratified by the national Parliaments and came into force on 28th January 2001. The Convention gives OCCAR its legal status, allowing it to award contracts and to employ its own staff. Belgium and Spain joined OCCAR respectively in 2003 and 2005.   More information: EDA-OCCAR Administrative Agreement  OCCAR website  "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/09/20/eda-chief-executive-attends-occar-20th-birthday-ceremony
EDA_NEWS_0150	2018-09-12	NEWS	1st AAR Conference in Europe points at ways to fill capability gap	 Some 200 experts, stakeholders, industry representatives and political/military decision-makers from the European, transatlantic and international Air-to-Air Refueling (AAR) community gathered today in Brussels for the 1st AAR Conference in Europe organized by the European Defence Agency (EDA). The event was opened with speeches and presentations by the Belgian Minister of Defence, Steven Vandeput,  the Assistant Secretary General for NATO Defence investments, Camille Grand, the chairman of the Aerial Refueling Systems Advisory Group (ARSAG), General John Sams, as well as the EDA Chief Executive, Jorge Domecq. Subsequent high-level speakers included the Commander of the European Air Transport Command (EATC), Maj. Gen. Laurent Marboeuf, the Mobilization Assistant to the Commander US Air Forces in Europe, Maj. Gen. John B.Williams, the Director of the Dutch Military Aviation Authority, Cdre. Jean-Paul Apon, the Chairman of the Multinational Multi-Role Tanker Transport Fleet (MMF), Cdr. Dick Kreiter, NATO Director Armament & Aerospace Capabilities (Defence Investment Division), Dr Giorgio Cioni, General Vincenzo Camporini from the Instituto Affari Internazionali as well as EDA Capability, Armament and Technology (CAT) Director, Martin Konertz. The conference discussed the current state of play (notably Europe’s shortfall in this domain) as well as the future opportunities and challenges of Air-to-Air Refuelling from a European, transatlantic and international perspective. In successive sessions and panels, the political, operational and regulatory aspects and problems were analysed and possible solutions discussed.     In his speech, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq praised AAR as a domain in which Europe is catching up on its shortfall in full complementarity with NATO. Even though Europe is still heavily dependent on US AAR assets, “it is slowly but surely catching up thanks to national and multinational Air-to-Air Refuelling initiatives which aim to develop a future capability that meets our operational requirements”, Mr Domecq said. The aim is not to duplicate NATO efforts but for Europe to be able to act and to become credible partners, he stressed. “I very much welcome our NATO partners to this conference. The work we do together in AAR is exemplary for how we promote close EU-NATO cooperation. The joint political commitment complemented by the excellent staff-to-staff cooperation led to a synchronized and harmonized approach towards dealing with the AAR shortfall, both on the NATO and EU side”. The EDA’s AAR activities are fully synchronized with the NATO’s roadmap on AAR improvements. “This prevents unnecessary duplication but more important creates opportunities for more collaboration (…) By increasing the European AAR capability, the participating nations also strive to meet their NATO Defence Planning Process (NDPP) targets”, Mr Domecq stated. “The MMF is a perfect example on how to get from the shortfall to a capability”.   Way ahead Conference participants widely agreed that considerable work still lies ahead as Europe’s remaining 30% AAR shortfall, especially during operations, cannot be fixed overnight. Discussions pointed at a variety of complementary steps that should be taken to fill the gap in the comping years, in particular: promote and further expand the Multinational Multi-Role Tanker Transport Fleet (MMF) beyond the five current participating countries (Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, Norway, Belgium). To date, the fleet has ordered eight A330 MRTT aircraft the delivery of which is expected between 2020 and 2022. There are currently three options for additional aircraft in place (potential increase to 11 aircraft in total); encourage European countries with national AAR programmes in place to procure more assets, especially Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft; increase the procurement of A-400M wing pods to be pooled and shared; improve the standardization and streamlining of the international tanker clearance process. Background In December 2013, EU Heads of State and Government acknowledged AAR as a key capability shortfall and tasked the EDA to work on it. AAR subsequently became one of the Agency’s Key Capability Programmes and the subject of an EDA Pooling and Sharing initiative which eventually led to the creation of a Multinational Multi-Role Tanker Transport Fleet (MMF). OCCAR, Europe’s organization for the management of cooperative armament programmes, manages the MMF acquisition phase whereas the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) will be responsible for the complete life-cycle management of the fleet (A330 MRTT). The fleet is funded by the participating nations who will also have the exclusive right to use these NATO–owned aircraft which will operate in a pooling arrangement. The aircraft will be configured for inflight refuelling, the transport of passengers and cargo, and medical evacuation flights.   More information: Jorge Domecq speech at AAR Conference Speech Belgian Defence Minister Steven Vandeput Speech NATO ASG DI Camille Grand EDA AAR project page    	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/09/12/1st-aar-conference-in-europe-points-at-ways-to-fill-capability-gap

EDA_NEWS_0155	2018-07-12	NEWS	EDA 3D-printing report and final video now available	 The outcome of EDA’s project on Additive Manufacturing (AM, better known as 3D printing), launched in 2016, is now available:  a report on the impact of AM on the defence and a video covering the various project activities. The main objectives of EDA’s ’Additive Manufacturing Feasibility Study & Technology Demonstration’ project were to assess the areas where AM technologies can have a positive impact on defence capabilities and to demonstrate their feasibility. The project, initiated in the framework of the CapTech Materials & Structures within the EDA Research & Technology domain, was organized around three work-strands: (i) a desktop study to place AM and its potential in a defence context, (ii) a technology demonstration of the feasibility of deploying these technologies in support of a military operation, (iii) an exhibition to senior military staff which took place in Spain in September 2017. The ’Additive Manufacturing: State of the Art and Strategic Report’ describes the different additive manufacturing technologies and identifies existing capabilities in Europe. Issues related to a potential use of AM in defence, such as gaps in the value chain, IPRs (Intellectual/Industrial Property Rights), standardization and certification, test and evaluation, skills and education are also addressed, as well as an analysis of the future needs in these areas. Three value chains for implementation of AM in the most promising defence areas were developed, identifying the main limitations for AM implementation and providing solutions to overcome the existing barriers. EDA’s contractors for this project, the research centre Fundación Prodintec and defence company MBDA France, worked together to support the activities described and helped to strengthen the links between research activities, industrial development, and the armed forces. The EDA Additive Manufacturing in Defence final video, also published today, summarizes the three work-strands of this innovative project.     More information: EDA’s “Additive Manufacturing Feasibility Study & Technology Demonstration” project page 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/07/12/eda-3d-printing-report-and-final-video-now-available

EDA_NEWS_0157	2018-06-28	NEWS	Six Member States agree to pool & share cyber ranges capabilities	 Today, six Member States (Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Germany and Latvia) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the pooling and sharing of their respective cyber ranges capabilities.  The signing, which took place at the EDA premises, is a first important outcome of EDA’s Cyber Ranges Federation Project launched in May 2017 in which a total of 11 EDA Member States participate.  Cyber Ranges are key national facilities to develop and evaluate cyber defence capabilities and this MoU opens the way for the six MoU signatories to make their cyber ranges available for shared development activities and joint exercises by using the pooling and sharing arrangements developed through the EDA project. By doing so, the six countries not only bring into the Cyber Ranges Federation Project their cyber ranges assets but also their expertise and best practices in terms of cyber defence exercises and training. The MoU is therefore an important stepping stone on the path to enabling an effective sharing of cyber defence capabilities across the EU, and in line with the objectives of the EU’s Cyber Defence Policy Framework. The MoU was signed by the Capability Directors of the six countries concerned:  Lt Gen Johann Luif (Austria), Maj Gen Philippe Boucke (Belgium), Ms. Tiina Uudeberg (Estonia), Lt. General Kim Jäämeri (Finland), Maj. Gen. Gerald Funke (Germany) and   Mr. Airis Rikveilis (Latvia). The ceremony was also attended by EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq.   More information:  Cyber Ranges: EDA’s First Ever Cyber Defence Pooling & Sharing Project Launched By 11 Member States (EDA News, May 2017) Cyber Defence (EDA project page) Cyber Defence Factsheet  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/06/28/six-member-states-agree-to-pool-share-cyber-ranges-capabilities

EDA_NEWS_0160	2018-06-28	NEWS	New 2018 EU Capability Development Priorities approved	 The EDA Steering Board in Capability Directors formation today endorsed the 2018 Capability Development Plan and approved the associated EU Capability Development Priorities as a key reference for Member States’ and EU’s capability development initiatives. The Plan and its Priorities will be instrumental in identifying future cooperative activities irrespective of the chosen cooperation framework, including under PESCO and the European Defence Fund (EDF). “Since 2016, the European defence project has picked up speed. Based on the 2016 EU Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy, several initiatives have been launched to reinforce defence cooperation: the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD), the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), and the European Defence Fund (EDF). Today’s adopted EU Capability Development Priorities serve as their benchmark to ensure that their combined outcome will be a more coherent set of deployable, interoperable, sustainable capabilities and forces”, says Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency (EDA). The Capability Development Plan (CDP) provides a full capability picture that supports decision-making processes at EU and national level regarding military capability development, thus contributing to increased coherence between Member States’ defence planning. It addresses security and defence challenges from the perspective of European capability development, looks at the future operational environment and defines EU Capability Development Priorities agreed by Member States. The revised 2018 CDP has been developed in the framework of the European Defence Agency (EDA) in close cooperation with Member States and reflects key contributions from the EU Military Committee and the EU Military Staff. The CDP is a shared EU reference informing national capability planners on capability requirements over time. Member States’ defence planners are encouraged to use it to identify priorities for capability improvement and opportunities for cooperation.   A more output oriented CDP One of the novelties of the 2018 CDP is that it considers evolutions in the wider European security and defence environment taking into account the necessity to counter hybrid threats and the adaptation to the new EU Level of Ambition agreed by Member States. The 2018 Plan also looks at the entire spectrum of capability development and underpins the identification of cooperative activities that can be implemented by Member States in the cooperation framework of their choice. The 2018 CDP is output oriented and this will be further reinforced by the development of Strategic Context Cases as of the second half of 2018, with a view to support Member States in the implementation of the 2018 EU Capability Development Priorities. Subsequently the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD) will help operationalising the CDP by reviewing Member States’ implementation of the 2018 EU Capability Development Priorities and by identifying additional opportunities for cooperation. Finally, the coherence between capability, R&T and industrial domains will be reinforced by the interaction between the CDP, the Overarching Strategic Research Agenda, Key Strategic Activities and the engagement with industry.   The CDP Process The CDP includes a capability shortfalls analysis from the CSDP perspective, as well as lessons learned from recent operations provided by the EU Military Committee. The mid-term dimension assesses the potential for cooperation for each capability. The CDP finally offers an assessment of future trends (2035 and beyond) and needs for each capability by linking long-term technology trends to future capability requirements and related R&T needs as well as industrial perspectives.   EU Capability Development Priorities Based on the identified trends, information gathered from Member States, the EU Military Committee and the EU Military Staff, a set of EU Capability Development Priorities were proposed by EDA and agreed by Member States. On the one hand, they address main capability shortfalls for deployed operations (land, maritime and air capabilities as well as logistic and medical support) with a reinforced focus on high-end warfare. On the other hand, they also cover other national focus areas, such as the adaptation of military capabilities required for territorial defence and security or cyber defence. The 2018 EU Capability Development Priorities cover the following lines of action: Enabling capabilities for cyber responsive operations Space-based information and communication services Information superiority Ground combat capabilities Enhanced logistic and medical supporting capabilities Naval manoeuvrability Underwater control contributing to resilience at sea Air superiority Air mobility Integration of military air capabilities in a changing aviation sector Cross-domain capabilities contributing to achieve EU’s level of ambition After today’s approval, EDA will start the preparatory work for the implementation of the 2018 Priorities, including through the elaboration of Strategic Context Cases. The Agency will also conduct bilateral training sessions with Member States in support of national defence planners as well as with the EU Military Staff, the European External Action Service and other stakeholders upon their request.   More information: Capability Development Plan Factsheet CDP capability trends 2035+ 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/06/28/new-2018-eu-capability-development-priorities-approved

EDA_NEWS_0164	2018-06-13	NEWS	Industry and Member States debate Impact of REACH on Defence	 On 13th of June, during the 10th EDA REACH Plenary Meeting, experts from Member States’ Ministries of Defence exchanged views with the European Commission (DG GROW) and representatives of the European defence industry on current developments concerning the European Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and its interaction with defence.  The aim of the meeting was to jointly explore ways and means to meet REACH’s objectives and ensure a coherent application of the Regulation in the defence sector while, at the same time, minimise its possible impact on the operational capabilities of Member States’ Armed Forces and the EU defence industry’s competitiveness and innovation as an important stakeholder in support of European defence capabilities, including through the implementation of the EDA REACH Roadmap 2018-2020 activities. The defence industry was represented by the Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD) / REACH Working Group, National Defence Industry Associations (NDIAs) and individual EU defence industries. REACH experts from the European Space Agency also attended the meeting as observers.    Background EDA is addressing REACH and its defence implications since 2009, at the request of its participating Member States and in close coordination with the European Commission.  The Agency’s current work in this field is guided by the EDA REACH Roadmap 2018-2020 adopted by Member States in October 2017. The roadmap encapsulates a wide spectrum of activities and tasks aiming to support in a structured approach the main purpose of REACH, which is to protect human health and the environment, while taking into account the defence specificities.  EDA regularly invites the European Commission, the European Chemicals Agency and the EU defence industry to EDA REACH meetings, in order to facilitate a closer and more transparent interaction on REACH issues affecting defence, which is considered an important success factor for EDA’s work in this field.    More information: EDA REACH Activities  EDA REACH Roadmap 2018-2020  EDA REACH Portal   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/06/13/industry-and-member-states-debate-impact-of-reach-on-defence
EDA_NEWS_0165	2018-06-15	NEWS	HOT BLADE 2018 improved joint and combined helicopter training	 Helicopter training exercise HOT BLADE 2018, organised in May under the European Defence Agency’s Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP) and hosted by the Portuguese Air Force at Beja airbase, was officially closed on 23 May by the Director of the Portuguese Air Operations, Brigadier General Rui de Freitas and José Pablo Romera, EDA Project Officer Rotary Wing. With 29 air assets flying a total of more than 550 hours and around 1,200 military participants, the exercise (the 12th held under the HEP umbrella) demonstrated once again the immense added value of collaborative multinational training for participating States’ aircrews, maintenance staff, troops and support personnel under very demanding (hot, dusty, mountainous) conditions. Six Member States (Belgium, Germany, Hungary, The Netherlands, Slovenia and Portugal) deployed assets, including 21 helicopters of 7 different types (A-109, AS-532, EH-101, CH-47, MI-17, NH-90, SA-316). The first week included a complete day of briefings covering flight safety, expected battle rhythm, host nation support, and a helicopter academics session to refresh COMAO Mission Planning procedures. This theoretical element was followed by operational briefings designed to familiarise aircrews with Beja airbase, rehearse emergency procedures with firefighters and Special Operations Forces (SOF), get familiar with the different helicopter types and ensure high safety levels.  The first week was completed with individual trainings, helicopter operations flown by day and by night, fighter evasion missions carried out with Portuguese F-16 fighter jets and helicopter firing drills. All participating Member States were able to reach their national training objectives.  During the second week, flying crews performed complex missions in a demanding but realistic environment, making full use of the dusty and mountainous surroundings and shooting ranges. As the exercise advanced, the multinational crews conducted ever more complex coalition level trainings culminating in the planning and execution of several Composite Air Operation (COMAO) missions. These covered a spectrum of advanced helicopter manoeuvre tactics including a large formation of helicopters with embarked troops, integration of Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) teams and paratroopers jumping from a Mi-17 helicopter and a C-295 aircraft, all set against complex threats such as SA-8 SAM, missiles and F-16 fighter jets. Six instructors from Austria, Germany, Sweden and the UK, previously trained in EDA’s Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC), formed the HOT BLADE 2018 Mentor Team. It supported the multinational crews in the preparation and execution of the COMAO missions and identified valuable Lessons Learned to be applied in future exercises. Other lessons will be drawn from a more in-depth analysis of the exercise results which is currently underway. The experience of planning, preparing and flying together in combined and joint missions is a critical requirement for maintaining operational readiness at a realistic level. With most nations facing budgetary constraints, such level of advanced training is almost impossible to achieve on a national basis.  In addition to the cost benefits, the exercise also considerably improves interoperability which has become the trademark of the Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP) and which was also underlined by the Exercise Director in his closing remarks: “Together we are stronger”.  HOT BLADE 2018 proved to be another important milestone on the way to meeting the HEP’s objective, namely to continuously improve Europe’s operational helicopter capability.  The next ‘Blade’ exercise is scheduled to take place in the Czech Republic in May 2019.   More information:  Hot Blade 2018 kicks off with focus on interoperability EDA Helicopter Initiatives Project Page Factsheet Exercice HOT BLADE 2018  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/06/15/hot-blade-2018-improved-joint-and-combined-helicopter-training
EDA_NEWS_0166	2018-06-05	NEWS	EDA to develop military airworthiness database	 The European Defence Agency’s Steering Board has given its green light to the development of a European Military Airworthiness Platform for Safety Information Exchange (EMAP SIX). This central database will enable participating Member States operating the same aircraft types to exchange airworthiness related safety information with relevant stakeholders on a need to know basis and in a secure environment.  The database will make airworthiness related safety information in the military domain available on a single central platform at European level. As such, the database will facilitate cooperation between Member States, with relevant civil aviation safety stakeholders, and further increase trust in European Military Aviation.  In a pilot phase, the MRTT and A400M common aircraft systems will be used for the initial development of the database. Subject to an evaluation of the results in the context of the European Military Airworthiness Authorities (MAWA) Forum, a further extension of the database to other aircraft systems is envisaged.    Backgound Operating common aircraft types in various national fleets also entails the existence of common technical safety risks. To mitigate identified 'unsafe conditions' effectively and to prevent hazardous or catastrophic events, competent airworthiness authorities coordinate the necessary measures with certificate holders and manufacturers by releasing mandatory safety information through the so-called ‘Airworthiness Directives’.  Currently, the responsibility for processing this information is split between participating Member States' national authorities and other relevant aviation safety stakeholders. The establishment of a central database facilitating a uniform and consistent exchange of oversight information and obligations will provide for the further harmonisation of administrative processes used by participating Member States’ National Military Airworthiness Authorities, reduce the related administrative burden and contribute to maintaining a high safety level. Beyond that, it will support further cooperation among EU Member States when joining efforts in development, procurement and operation of military aircraft systems.  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/06/05/eda-to-develop-military-airworthiness-database

EDA_NEWS_0168	2018-06-07	NEWS	EDA and Bulgarian EU Presidency highlight importance of military mobility	 On 7 June 2018, the European Defence Agency (EDA) and the Bulgarian Presidency of the Council of the European Union (EU) co-organised the conference “Military Mobility – Key to European Security” in Brussels. Political and military decision-makers including Federica Mogherini, Head of the European Defence Agency, High-Representative and Vice-President of the European Commission, Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, Krasimir Karakachanov, NATO Deputy Secretary General Rose Gottemoeller and EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq as well as Ministers and high level officials of Member States and allied countries, EU bodies, NATO, and other relevant stakeholders assessed progress in and exchanged views on European military mobility. Military Mobility is key to European security. Today’s security environment demands the smooth, efficient and effective movement of military personnel and assets within and beyond the European Union. As a complex and multidimensional issue, military mobility requires a ‘whole-of-government’ approach whilst respecting national sovereignty. The EU’s Action Plan on Military Mobility, presented by HR/VP Federica Mogherini and the European Commission on 28 March 2018, outlines the steps the European Union is taking to improve Military Mobility. The Action Plan builds on the Roadmap on Cross-Border Military Transportation developed by the European Defence Agency and in close cooperation and coordination with all relevant actors, including NATO.   In his opening speech, Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, Krasimir Karakachanov, said: “The boundaries between internal and external security issues are getting less distinct, the hybrid nature of conflicts is already established as a rule. Improving military mobility is key to the EU's ability to effectively carry out its Common Security and Defense Policy’s operations. Assuring fast and efficient movement of military contingents and materiel, within and outside EU territory, will enable our Union to effectively react to the challenges of the contemporary highly dynamic strategic environment”. In his closing speech, Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency, emphasized that “Military mobility is not just about defence. A whole of government approach is necessary to achieve results. At EU level we already took our share of responsibility and all relevant EU institutions, agencies and bodies are already working hand in hand to better serve the Member States’ needs. Looking at the European Council at the end of June, it is important for Heads of States and Government to address the issue in order to mobilise a whole of government approach.” At the conference, high-level speakers from national governments and armed forces as well as NATO representatives and European defence actors discussed the way ahead in key note speeches and two panel discussions focussing on synergies and coordination as well as on military requirements for military mobility respectively.    More information: Full conference programme EDA Factsheet on Military Mobility EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq - closing speech Video: speech by Head of EDA - HR/VP Federica Mogherini  Speech by Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister Krassimir Karakachanov Speech Dutch Defence Minister Ank Bijleveld Speech NATO Dep.Sec.Gen.

EDA_NEWS_0170	2018-05-30	NEWS	Hybrid threats against harbours: workshop at EDA	" How can naval capabilities mitigate hybrid threats against European harbours? What steps could and should be taken to improve resilience of European harbours and which kind of cooperation is best suited to achieve this? These and many other questions were discussed at a joint workshop on ‘Harbour protection under hybrid threat conditions’ organized by the European Defence Agency (EDA) and the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats (Hybrid C0E) today at the EDA premises. Picture: Bundeswehr Presentations and discussions focused on the broad multifaceted nature of the harbour protection and the implications on capability development in support of force protection and mobility.  The workshop took place in the context of the implementation of the EU-NATO Joint Declaration, aiming to promote a coherence between the EU and NATO in bolstering resilience. The EDA and the Hybrid Centre of Excellence cooperate to promote the effective implementation of the Joint Declaration in areas of common interest and notably on bolstering hybrid resilience. In his opening speech, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq stressed the economic and strategic importance of harbours in Europe, including in the military domain. “We cannot omit their huge role in providing mobility and sustainability of military forces. It’s not a surprise that civilian harbours play a significant role in the security system of individual Member States, but also in the European system. None of the CSDP missions or operations could be conducted without free and safe access to the seaports. Hybrid attacks on seaports can have serious consequences, leading to disruptions to travel and supply chains”, Mr Domecq stated. He welcomed the timing of the workshop as the revision of the European Capability Development Plan (CDP), scheduled to be accomplished end of June, is now on the home straight. “The outcome of this workshop, which will be presented in the form of a report to the Capability Directors in June, will have a positive impact on maritime capability development in the nearest future”, he stressed. In his speech, the Director of the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats, Matti Saarelainen, put a particular emphasis on the need for international cooperation in this crucial domain. ""As international interdependency increases, it is necessary to assess and develop security more comprehensively than in the past. Hence, all stakeholders should be equally aware of the nature of the hybrid threats and share the level of awareness among them. What is essential is cooperation between and among individual countries, the EU and NATO, and sharing of experiences and best practices among them"", he stated.     "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/05/30/hybrid-threats-against-harbours-workshop-at-eda
EDA_NEWS_0171	2018-05-05	NEWS	Outcome of EDA Ministerial Steering Board	 The European Defence Agency’s (EDA) ministerial Steering Board met this Saturday morning in Sofia under the chairmanship of HR/VP Federica Mogherini in her capacity as Head of the Agency. Defence ministers among other things welcomed the Agency’s progress on taking forward the new European defence initiatives and encouraged EDA to further develop initiatives in areas such as military mobility and the Main Battle Tank capability. EDA plays a central role in many of the initiatives implementing the security and defence aspects of the EU Global Strategy presented by HR/VP Federica Mogherini in 2016. Federica Mogherini highlighted the Agency’s aim to support coherence between the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD), the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the European Defence Fund (EDF) – using the Capability Development Plan (CDP) as baseline for developing the European capability landscape. The currently ongoing revision of the CDP will be finalised by June 2018 and Defence Ministers highlighted the importance of ensuring coherence of output and timelines between EU and NATO defence planning processes. At the same time, an Overarching Strategic Research Agenda (OSRA) is being developed with a view to guiding future investments in collaborative European defence research. Ministers of Defence welcomed the progress achieved so far in the trial run of the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence implemented by EDA in its capacity as CARD Secretariat. The first CARD report will be presented in November 2018. EDA also supports Member States as part of the PESCO Secretariat. On 2 May, the PESCO Secretariat (EDA together with EEAS/EUMS) issued the second call for project proposals to PESCO participating Member States to be submitted by 31 July 2018.   Military Mobility Regarding Military Mobility, and in line with the scope and timelines mentioned in the European Union Action Plan, the Agency is currently preparing two ambitious programmes on the harmonisation of military requirements related to customs and on cross border movement permission. Both programmes aim at facilitating military mobility activities. The Agency together with the participating Member States will look at harmonising the military requirements related to customs. The programme on cross border movement permission builds on the successful Diplomatic Clearances arrangement which foresees annually issued clearance numbers for air transport aircraft. The arrangement has proven its value by reducing administrative burden and time. The new programme will build on this good practice by looking at surface movement to enhance military mobility for road, rail and inland waterways, also including air assets such as helicopters and air-to-air refuelling aircraft. The Agency’s work in this area is coordinated with the PESCO project on military mobility and conducted in close cooperation with the EEAS, EUMS, the Commission and other stakeholders. It is also coherent with respective NATO initiatives.   Main Battle Tank Defence Ministers invited the Agency to pursue the development of the Pooling and Sharing initiative on Main Battle Tanks (MBTs) based on identified MBT surplus capacities in a number of Member States (Providers) and a demand for the acquisition of such assets in others (Receivers). The Agency together with national experts and industry investigated to what extent Providers could pool & share their surplus assets with interested Receivers and upgrade the MBTs to the latest configuration available. In addition, some Member States have voiced interest in upgrading their national fleets and keep them under full national control (Upgraders). The project will provide economies of scale throughout the entire life cycle while enhancing interoperability among Member States.     Cooperative Financial Mechanism & other topics The Steering Board was informed about the progress achieved in the negotiation of the Programme Arrangement of the Cooperative Financial Mechanism. It is intended that the CFM will be structured around two pillars, one intergovernmental, and one involving the European Investment Bank as the sole lender for defence-related projects and programmes in line with its lending policy. Following calls from the European Council to support investments in defence research and development activities, the European Investment Bank and the European Defence Agency concluded a cooperation agreement on 28 February 2018. Ministers welcomed closer interaction between EDA and NATO. They were also presented with lessons learnt on the successful implementation of the Pilot Project and the first work programme of the Preparatory Action on Defence Research by the Agency under delegation of the European Commission. Finally, the Steering Board welcomed the progress made with regard to the implementation of the dual-use strategy on RPAS regulation, based on close coordination with the European Commission, the SESAR Joint Undertaking and EASA.    	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/05/05/outcome-of-eda-ministerial-steering-board

EDA_NEWS_0174	2018-05-23	NEWS	Four EU cybersecurity organisations enhance cooperation	 The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), the European Defence Agency (EDA), the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) and the Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU Institutions, Agencies and Bodies (CERT-EU) today signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to establish a cooperation framework between their organisations. The Memorandum of Understanding was signed by Udo Helmbrecht, ENISA's Executive Director, Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the EDA, Steven Wilson, Head of EC3 and Ken Ducatel, CERT-EU's Acting Head. The MoU aims at leveraging synergies between the four organisations, promoting cooperation on cyber security and cyber defence and is a testament to the trusted partnership that exists between these EU agencies.  More specifically, it focuses on five areas of cooperation, namely Exchange of information; Education & Training; Cyber exercises; Technical cooperation; and Strategic and administrative matters. It also allows for cooperation in other areas identified as mutually important by the four organisations. This collaboration will ensure the best possible use of existing resources by avoiding duplicative efforts and building on the complementarity of ENISA, EDA, EUROPOL and CERT-EU. This framework brings added value to the expertise, support and services that these parties provide to the European Union organisations, Member States and all stakeholders concerned. High Representative/Vice-President and Head of the European Defence Agency, Federica Mogherini said: “Cyberspace threats do not know of national borders. Cooperation among Member States but also at European level is therefore essential. Europe is stronger when it tackles threats together, in a common and coordinated approach. And this is exactly where this Memorandum of Understanding is key and where the added value of the European Union lies: working together, joining forces, putting the experiences and the knowledge of all at the service of our citizens' security. ” Vice-President for Digital Single Market Andrus Ansip said: “We can face cyber threats successfully if we have in place a functioning exchange of information, we have strong technical capabilities and we work on basic cyber hygiene. Better cooperation between these EU agencies will lead to this result. ” Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship Dimitris Avramopoulos said: “The threats against both our physical and virtual worlds are becoming increasingly connected. This is why increasing cyber security is one of the priorities of the European Union. But we can only do this effectively through stronger cooperation and joint actions, where our operational agencies, like Europol, can play a critical role with the expertise they bring to the table in support of our Member States. ” Commissioner for the Security Union Julian King said: “The cross-border nature of the cyber threat means that cooperation has never been more important. This improved collaboration between ENISA, EDA, EC3 and CERT-EU will help us to strengthen our cyber resilience, build effective deterrence and help deliver credible cyber defence and international cooperation. ” Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, Mariya Gabriel said: “Trust and security are key components of the digital economy and society. The EU agencies should lead by example. Only by working closely together will we have a chance to mitigate the cybersecurity risks.” Prof. Dr. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA said: “ENISA welcomes the opportunity to work closely with our partner organisations. Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility, and it is only by cooperating closely with all relevant stakeholders that the EU has a chance to address cybersecurity challenges.” Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the EDA: “EDA supports Member States in the development of their defence capabilities. As such, we also act as the military interface to EU policies. Today’s Memorandum of Understanding is an important step towards increased civil-military cooperation and synergies in the area of cyber security and cyber defence.” Steven Wilson, Head of Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3): “This MoU illustrates how a safe and open cyberspace can only be achieved through enhanced cooperation and commitment. Through their participation, all parties involved demonstrate that they are willing to join forces and recognise that together we can provide the necessary response to cyber related threats. From EC3, we welcome the opportunity to enter a new era of working together with our MoU partners and are delighted to share our expertise and experience.”   Ken Ducatel, Acting Head of CERT-EU, said: “The EU institutions, bodies and agencies rely on the specialised skills and tools in threat intelligence and incident response of CERT-EU. But, we don’t maintain these capacities by acting alone. That is why acting together with our peers and partners in the other signatories to this Memorandum is so important.” The 2014 Cyber Defence Policy Framework called for the promotion of civil-military cooperation and synergies with wider EU cyber policies, relevant EU institutions and agencies as well as with the private sector. ENISA, EDA, EUROPOL and CERT-EU began initial discussions in 2016 which eventually led to this milestone signature. The principles behind this Memorandum of Understanding are fully in line with the implementation of the Joint Communication on Cyber issued by the High Representative and the European Commission in September 2017.   More information: European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA)  European Defence Agency (EDA)  Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)  Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU Institutions, Agencies and Bodies (CERT-EU)   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/05/23/four-eu-cybersecurity-organisations-enhance-cooperation
EDA_NEWS_0175	2018-05-08	NEWS	Hot Blade 2018 kicks off with focus on interoperability	 HOT BLADE 2018, the 12th helicopter exercise organised under the umbrella of the European Defence Agency’s (EDA) Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP), kicked off yesterday 7th May at Beja airbase in Portugal. It will run until 24 May and involve a total of 29 air assets and crews from six countries: Portugal, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Slovenia and the Netherlands. Representatives from Austria, the Czech Republic and Italy will also take part as observers. A Distinguished Visitors Day (DVD) will take place on 22 May. HOT BLADE 2018 will allow crews from 21 helicopters and 8 fixed wing assets (including 6 Portuguese F-16 fighters), ground troops, EW simulator/emulators operators and Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACs) to practice operations in a hot, high and dusty environment replicating the challenging conditions that participants’ forces are expected to encounter when deploying to a theatre of operation.  The exercise’s main focus is on enhancing interoperability at the tactical level between helicopter units by using the Composite Air Operations (COMAO) concept in a combined, joint, realistic and challenging environment. It is the 4th time that the exercise is hosted by the Portuguese Air Force, under EDA’s Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP), following three earlier successful editions that took place between 2012 and 2014. This year, the Hot Blade 2018 exercise will be carried out in the area surrounding Beja Air Force Base, located in the Southern part of Portugal. The use of EDA HEP Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), the application of best practices gathered during the 11 previous helicopter exercises led by the EDA and the availability on location of a Mentor Team will support the standardisation of planning processes and helicopter tactical procedures amongst participating crews. This year’s training is focussed on missions in a dusty, hot and mountainous environment. To ensure the maximum levels of flight safety, scheduled activities will follow a progressive approach. Tactical training (e.g. formation flights, NVG, tactical formation) will be performed during the first days, while national training requirements enabling the performance of demanding day and night Composite Air Operation (COMAO) missions will be addressed during the last days of the exercise.   More information: EDA Helicopter Initiatives Project Page Factsheet Exercice HOT BLADE 2018 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/05/08/hot-blade-2018-kicks-off-with-focus-on-interoperability

EDA_NEWS_0177	2018-04-19	NEWS	First EDA Defence Energy Managers Course successfully concluded	 On 19th of April, 21 students from 8 Member States graduated from the first EDA Defence Energy Managers Course (DEMC). The DEMC aims at increasing energy efficiency and reducing energy consumption in the military domain through the application of defence-specific Energy Management Systems (EnMSs) based on the ISO 50001 standard.  The DEMC is the first of its kind to be run at multi-national level and to deliver both theoretical and practical EnMS training to energy managers from European navies, armies and air forces.   The implementation of EnMSs under DEMC resulted in saving around 2,5 GWh of energy consumed, reaching normalised reductions in energy consumptions of up to 25.2%. The course was split into 5 distinct modules (3 classroom-type and two practical of total duration of 12 months) with this first pilot run launched in April 2017. Participants improved their know-how on the complexities of managing energy within a defence organisation. They were also able to acquire the capacity to structure, implement and improve effective EnMSs and to enhance their skills thanks to on-going mentoring, alumni relations and membership in the European Defence Energy Network (EDEN) with permanent access to its established on-line resources. The DEMC marks another important milestone in EDA’s approach to sustainability in defence and fulfils the level of ambition of the EDA Member States for capacity building in energy management, already identified through the first round of the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector (sponsored by the European Commission) and the EDA’s own Energy and Environmental Working Group, developing  mainstream sustainability concepts within the defence sector as enablers for improved military capability and reduced environmental footprint of military activities.   Background The course began with a 5-day classroom-type session (module 1) to guide the participants with the framework and requirements of ISO 50001 EnMS standard and to familiarise them with energy data analysis techniques. Then followed a 6-month mentoring session (module 2) on the development of the core structure of the EnMSs to be applied, including visits at participating Member States’ sites, webinars and extensive one-on-one mentoring. It was followed by module 3 (3-day classroom type session) which, besides reviewing the progress made so far, further elaborated on the EnMS requirements especially related to training, design, procurement, operations (including deployments). The subsequent 5-month mentoring session (module 4), included site visits, during which energy internal audits were  conducted, coupled with further support though webinars and tailored guidance. The concluding 3-day classroom type module (module 5) focused on reviewing the developed EnMSs and providing further guidance on operational control issues related to energy. The pilot run of the Defence Energy Managers’ Course (DEMC – Pilot) was attended by MoD / Armed Forces’ personnel from Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Sweden and The  Netherlands. During this pilot course, the EnMS concept was developed and is currently applied at 10 military installations of diverse uses (from military academies to armoured vehicles’ camps and naval depos). With such a successful outcome of the DEMC - Pilot, up to 6 steady state DEMC could be envisaged over the next 3 years. The steady state courses will build upon the pilot course taking into account gained experience, recommendations and feedback from participating Member States.  The project is delivered by GEN Europe and the Centre for Renewable Energy Sources & Savings (CRES). It is run by the European Defence Agency’s Innovative Research Unit.   More information:  Defence Energy Managers' Course Holds First Session  New Defence Energy Managers Course Launched  [AN1]http://eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/latest-news/2017/04/24/defence-energy-managers'-course-holds-first-session  [AN2]http://eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/latest-news/2017/01/20/new-defence-energy-managers-course-launched      	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/04/19/first-eda-defence-energy-managers-course-successfully-concluded
EDA_NEWS_0178	2018-04-27	NEWS	Conclusion of European Tactical Airlift exercise 2018	 Bulgaria, who holds the Presidency of the Council of the EU during this semester, hosted the second European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Courses (ETAP-C) from April 15th to 27th. This two-week comprehensive airlift tactics training course aims to enhance interoperability between European Air Forces. The participating crews were trained within a simulated theatre-deployment setting, exposing them to a complex surface-to-air and air-to-air threat environment, within which they were tasked to conduct demanding airlift missions. At the end of the course, 3 graduating crews received a certificate reflecting the training objectives achieved. EDA initiated the European Tactical Airlift Programme (ETAP) to develop innovative, efficient and more effective approaches to overcome Advanced Airlift Tactical Training and Interoperability shortfalls, within the European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) programme. ETAP aims to enhance European transport airlift operational capability for crisis management operations through the pooling and sharing of experience, training opportunities and organisational costs, and the development of agreed common tactics, techniques and procedures, to better meet the challenges of flying transport aircraft in a joint and combined modern operational environment. The organisational and administrative responsibilities for the ETAP have recently been handed over to the European Tactical Airlift Centre (ETAC) in Zaragoza, Spain, which was opened in June 2017 in the presence of EU High Representative and Head of the EDA Federica Mogherini, the Spanish Minister of Defence María Dolores de Cospedal and EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq. This multinational centre, which was established with the support of 10 EDA Member States (Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Portugal and Spain) and one Third State (Norway), delivers European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Courses (ETAP-C), European Airlift Transport Training (ETAP-T), European Advanced Tactical Instructor Course (ETAP-I), Symposia (ETAP-S) and any other ETAP related activities for military air transport personnel. The 2018 activities began in January at the International Training Centre (ITC) in Pisa, Italy, with the first three ETAP-I. The first ETAP-C took place in Zaragoza from February 18th until March 3d, with nine crews and six aircraft (2 C-130, 1 C-160, 1 CASA 235 and 2 CASA 295) from Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, France and Spain. This course was divided in two parts, day and night, with some of the crews attending the night course using night-vision goggles. International interest in ETAC activities is tangible, with observers from Finland, Bulgaria and the Emirates participating in the January course. NATO AWACS observers from Geilenkirchen also attended to investigate the possibility of joining this type of training in the future.   More information EATT17 closes with advanced tactical airlift operations (EDA news, June 2017)  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/04/27/conclusion-of-european-tactical-airlift-exercise-2018

EDA_NEWS_0183	2018-04-09	NEWS	5th European Air-to-Air Refuelling Training takes off in the Netherlands	 The 5th European Air-to-Air Refuelling Training exercise (EART 2018) kicked off today 9 April at Eindhoven Air Base in the Netherlands. EART 2018 brings together tankers from Germany, the Netherlands, France and - for the first time - from a non-European country, the United States, for a two week training exercise ending on 20 April.  The European Air-to-Air Refuelling Training (EART) concept was introduced in 2014 under the European Defence Agency’s (EDA) air-to-air refuelling initiative, and is run by the European Air Transport Command (EATC) from Eindhoven airbase. The exercise is supported by the host nation (the Netherlands), the Eindhoven-based Movement Coordination Centre Europe (MCCE) and EDA.  EART is organised on a yearly basis in combination with the ‘Frisian Flag’ fighter training exercise, also organized by the Netherlands, that operates from Leeuwarden Airbase. The objective is to train air crews and engineers in planning and executing complex air-to-air refuelling (AAR) operations in a multinational and realistic COMAO (composite air operation) environment, with the overall aim of enhancing effectiveness and interoperability of forces. A particular focus is also put on facilitating the certification processes between tankers and receiver aircraft. The exercise director for EART 2018 is Colonel Andrea Massucci (Italian Air Force).   Eindhoven for two weeks “tanker town of Europe” AAR is a significant force enabler and multiplier as it enhances combat effectiveness by extending the range, payload and endurance of receiver aircraft. It allows air power to be projected at greater distances or concentrated where and when it is needed mostly. “Air-to-air refueling capacity is the backbone of modern day air power. Without it, we don’t do much. Air power continuously needs fuel”, said Lieutenant-Colonel Harry Oostema, Head of Operations at Eindhoven air base.  However, delivering a guaranteed, continuous coverage of air-to-air refueling capacity is challenging. “That’s why we need to train together. The European air-to-air refuelling Training (EART) at Eindhoven air base provides us with that unique opportunity”, Lieutenant-Colonel Oostema stressed. “For two weeks Eindhoven air base will be the tanker town of Europe”.   Background: EDA’s global approach on AAR EDA has developed a global approach on AAR with three objectives: optimizing the use of assets, increasing the overall AAR capacity and reducing fragmentation of the fleet. This work has led to three complementary work-strands, on some of which EDA is cooperating closely with other agencies and organizations like OCCAR, the Movement Coordination Center Europe (MCCE) and the European Air Transport Command (EATC). EART 2018 is part of the first work strand (optimization of existing capabilities), which is achieved by supporting training exercises. In this domain, EDA has also taken the lead to streamline the different certification processes leading to a clearance. By standardizing these processes the different aviation authorities can easily identify the differences between their own process and their counterpart. By working closely together, already fielded capabilities and future capabilities, can work more cost efficiently and increase their operational output.     More information: Air-to-Air Refueling EDA project page Air-to-Air Refueling factsheet EATC website  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/04/09/5th-european-air-to-air-refuelling-training-takes-off-in-the-netherlands

Among many other things, interested parties can find there valuable information about how to get involved in European defence research and capability development as well as guidance and practical advice on how to benefit from existing EDA cooperation opportunities or access EU funding. The SME Corner will be updated and refreshed continuously in order to keep pace with upcoming initiatives of interest to the SME community.   Background: EDA and SMEs In line with its new approach on industry engagement approved in May 2017, EDA continuously works on topics relevant to SMEs which are the backbone of Europe’s economy and therefore of strategic importance. SMEs count for about 99% of Europe’s businesses and of each euro of added value created in the EU, 58 cents can be attributed to SMEs. Since SMEs are equally important for all EDA Member States, all of them share a common interest in utilizing SME’s innovative and competitive potential for improving Europe’s defence capabilities. In operational terms, EDA seeks mainly to: tap into the innovation potential of SMEs and harvest it for the sake of developing, maintaining and using defence capabilities; facilitate cross-border cooperation among industry in defence research and capability development; create new opportunities for industry to build supply chains across Europe; strengthen the competitiveness of the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) in general, and of the SMEs in particular.  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/04/12/eda-s-new-sme-corner-now-online

Today the High Representative & Head of the European Defence Agency and the European Commission announced an Action Plan on military mobility, based on the European Defence Agency’s Roadmap, identifying a series of operational measures to tackle physical, procedural or regulatory barriers which hamper military mobility. Working closely with the EU Member States and all relevant actors will be key for the implementation of this Action Plan. “Successful EDA projects such as the EU Multimodal Transport Hub and the Diplomatic Clearances initiative for military air transport demonstrated the advantages of a coordinated European approach to military movement. What was missing was a consistent approach allowing military personnel and equipment to cross borders swiftly and smoothly. The EDA’s Roadmap formed the basis of the EU’s Action Plan, and the Agency looks forward to being one of the key actors of its implementation”, said Jorge Domecq, EDA Chief Executive. The Commission, the European External Action Service and the European Defence Agency will work in close coordination with the Member States for the effective implementation of these actions. They will be carried out in full respect of the sovereignty of Member States over their national territory and national decision-making processes. Coordination with efforts under the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the separate PESCO project on military mobility will equally be ensured. Cooperation and consultation with NATO on issues of military mobility will be further pursued in the framework of the implementation of the Joint Declaration to ensure coherence and synergies. The Action Plan is submitted to the EU Member States for consideration and endorsement. The first actions are expected to be carried out in the coming months. A first progress report on the implementation of this Action Plan will be presented to the Member States by summer 2019.    Further reading: European Commission press release “Action Plan on military mobility: EU takes steps towards a Defence Union” European Commission Factsheet on Military Mobility Joint Communication to the European Parliament and the Council on the Action Plan on Military Mobility EDA Project on Multimodal Transport Hubs EDA Project on Diplomatic Clearances Technical Arrangement  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/03/28/eu-announces-an-action-plan-on-military-mobility

EDA_NEWS_0188	2018-03-14	NEWS	EDA supports defence acquisition training	 The European Defence Agency supports the first Central and Eastern European (CEE) Armaments Cooperation Course which takes place in Prague from 13-16 March 2018, gathering some 30 delegates from 10 CEE Member States. Sponsored and led by the Czech Republic and delivered by Cranfield University’s Centre for Defence Acquisition, the course will strengthen the practical skills of staff from CEE Ministries of Defence (MoDs) and related agencies in defence procurement procedures, with an emphasis on multinational collaboration. The 2013 European Council stressed the need for a balanced access to defence industry in Europe, as a result of which EDA conducted an internal analysis of the specificities of the CEE countries’ defence industries and commissioned a study from RAND Europe to better understand  the barriers to defence cooperation across Europe. The study identified several areas of concern and noted that the CEE countries face a common challenge in accessing the skills needed to pursue defence collaboration opportunities, with identified shortfalls in areas such as project and programme management, marketing and networking, market intelligence and business planning. The course represents a tangible and tailor-made opportunity for CEE Member States to improve their capacity in all these areas . It comes at a time of transformational change across the European defence landscape with the advent of several new initiatives such as the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD), Permanent Structure Cooperation (PESCO) and the European Defence Fund (EDF). It will serve as a springboard for the CEE countries to participate more effectively in collaboration efforts and will underpin an alumni network that will provide on-going advice on best practice and longer term networking opportunities. The course is designed for military and civilian officials working on defence acquisition issues.   More information: EDA education and exercise programme (video) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/03/14/eda-supports-defence-acquisition-training

EDA_NEWS_0190	2018-03-22	NEWS	EU COSME funds transnational defence cluster partnerships	 For the first time ever, the EU COSME Programme is awarding grants to clusters partnering in the defence and security sector. Two transnational defence-related cluster partnerships, whose members have been working with EDA, informed the Agency that they have started negotiation of a grant agreement in view of being awarded COSME funding under a European Commission’s call for proposals, managed by the Executive Agency for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (EASME): the “ALLIANCE” (Alliance for International Business Development of Advanced Materials and CoNnectivity for DefenCe and SEcurity Market), whose strategic and technical director is the French defence-related cluster SAFE and is coordinated by the TECHTERA (French Cluster on advanced materials and composites). Other partners are OTIR 2020 (Italian Cluster on technical textiles), CITTA STUDI (Italian Cluster on technical textiles), NIDV (Netherlands Cluster on Defense and Security), SIIT (Italian Cluster on Defense and Security), SCS (French Cluster on ICT and Cyber Security); the “EU KETS4DUAL-USE” (EUropean Key Enabling Technologies for Dual-Use worldwide), led by OPTITEC, French photonics & imaging cluster active in the defence sector, partnering with the Estonian Defence Industry Association, CenSec (Denmark) and Minalogic (France). The European Defence Agency (EDA) has played a precursor and facilitating role: in 2016, an EDA preliminary study explored the potential of the EU COSME Programme for defence and was the first to make a clear case for defence-related clusters’ eligibility under this EU funding programme; since its start, this study has involved a number of clusters, included the two winning consortia, and showcased their participation on EDA’s “COSME platform”; the Commission’s call for proposals makes explicit reference to EDA in order to identify eligible defence clusters; EDA organised two matchmaking events addressing this funding opportunity in 2017; several members of the above-mentioned consortia have attended; EDA’s recently released “European Funding Gateway” lists COSME grants as opportunities for the defence sector.   For more information: European Funding Gateway for Defence COSME platform Industry portal  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/03/22/eu-cosme-funds-transnational-defence-cluster-partnerships
EDA_NEWS_0191	2018-02-28	NEWS	European Defence Agency and European Investment Bank sign cooperation agreement	 Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency (EDA) and Alexander Stubb, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) today signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to strengthen cooperation between the two institutions. The European Council of 19 October 2017 encouraged the EIB to examine further steps with a view to supporting investments in defence research and development activities. As a response, the EIB recently approved the European Security Initiative - Protect, Secure, Defend, strengthening its support for RDI for dual-use technologies, cybersecurity and civilian security infrastructure. Today the EIB and EDA teamed up to support EU policy objectives, in particular as regards the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). The cooperation between the two entities materialises as major European initiatives supporting the EU level of ambition in the area of security and defence are launched, including a European Defence Fund. As a first step, EDA and the EIB envisage cooperation in the Cooperative Financial Mechanism (CFM). The CFM is foreseen as a mechanism for EDA Member States to financially support the set up and conduct of the development of military technology. The EIB role in the CFM would focus on supporting the development of dual use technologies. Additionally, the two organisations agreed to exchange expertise, in particular with a view to identify possible financing opportunities for defence and security-related Research and Technology projects in support of EDA participating Member States. EDA stands ready to support the EIB in identifying projects, that are potentially eligible for its assistance; this could include both projects promoted by the Member States, such as those in the context of the recently launched Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), as well as projects promoted by companies including Small and Medium Sized Enterprises in the defence and security sector.  “European security and defence is high on the agenda of decision-makers and citizens alike. EDA and EIB have complementary expertise and are natural partners. The Agency will support the EIB in the identification and assessment of projects as well as by putting its defence expertise at the service of the Bank”, said Jorge Domecq.  “Under the European Security Initiative - Protect, Secure, Defend, the EIB is ready to step up its support to the security and defence sector. In line with our mission, we look forward to supporting in particular investment projects that target dual-use technologies, which can be commercialised also in civilian applications”, said EIB Vice-President Alexander Stubb. “Today’s cooperation agreement is welcome news for Europe’s security as it will help the European Defence Agency and the European Investment Bank to better contribute to EU policy goals”.  Cooperative Financial Mechanism The Cooperative Financial Mechanism (CFM) will play an important role in easing the launch phase of cooperative projects. Designed to support any type of collaborative efforts, in the R&T, R&D or acquisition phase, its support will include access to funding, a well-known shortfall hampering cooperative efforts, as well as the reduction of bureaucracy. It will result in an increased quality of public expenditures.  The Mechanism, developed as an EDA ad hoc Category A programme, is voluntary. Member States decide if they wish to participate, contribute and support projects.  Once negotiations on the Programme Arrangement are finalised, the CFM is likely to be based on two pillars. In the first, intergovernmental, Member States will have the opportunity to mutually support via a system of reimbursable advances and deferred payments. In the second, the European Investment Bank will act as the sole lender, supporting dual use projects in line with its policies. This will enable an increased support from EIB to the security and defence agenda, an objective underlined several times by the European Council.  More information: European Investment Bank 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/02/28/european-defence-agency-and-european-investment-bank-sign-cooperation-agreement

EDA_NEWS_0193	2018-02-28	NEWS	Green light for Cyber Defence Education, Training, Exercise & Evaluation Platform	 EU Member States last week agreed to commence work on a platform to provide Member States with education, training, exercise and evaluation (ETEE) services in the field of cyber security/defence.  The platform will be led by the European Security and Defence College (ESDC) and will build on the support already provided by the European Defence Agency (EDA), the European External Action Service (EEAS) and the European Commission. The main task of the ETEE platform within the ESDC is the coordination of cyber security and defence training and education for EU Member States. The existing training will be harmonised and standardised and new courses will close the gaps between training needs and training activities. These efforts will be jointly undertaken by various stakeholders and partner organisations. In response to Member States’ requirement to fill the skills gap in cyber defence, EDA played an important role in developing the design proposal of this platform, following the results of a relevant feasibility study which were properly adapted to the actual Member States’ needs. The ESDC will liaise closely with the EEAS, the Commission and EDA on the implementation. EDA will seek to migrate existant initiatives on education, training and exercises to the ETEE platform for sustained delivery into the future; a prime example is the increasingly well-established Cyber Strategic Decision Making Exercise. The ESDC will also seek synergies with respective NATO initiatives, also in the frame of the implementation of the EU-NATO Joint Declaration. The cyber platform is planned to reach initial operating capability by 1 September 2018.  Meanwhile, staff will be recruited and an initial training catalogue drafted.  The full operational capability of the platform is planned to be announced in April 2019.   More information:  Cyber defence (EDA project page) ESDC statement on Cyber Platform    	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/02/28/green-light-for-cyber-defence-education-training-exercise-evaluation-platform

EDA_NEWS_0196	2018-02-26	NEWS	EDA market survey on commercially available RPAS services	 Providing support to CSDP operations is a core task of the EDA which, since its creation in 2004, has developed tools to provide administrative, contracting and/or technical support to EU-led missions and operations whenever they face capability shortfalls in crucial domains.  Situational awareness, which presupposes the availability of appropriate information gathering and intelligence management capabilities, is one of such domains. As EU or Member States’ military operations or civilian missions are often deployed on very short notice, putting these capabilities in place often constitutes a challenge. Tactical or medium altitude long endurance (MALE) type Remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS), are critical assets in this respect with their ability to provide permanent and all weather coverage with high quality sensors.  Turn-key solutions In order to prepare for future decisions to be taken in that area, the EDA decided to launch a market survey to better understand the range of commercially available solutions which could fulfil possible future requirements for RPAS services in operations, as well as their potential associated risks or limitations. At this stage, the primary scope of the survey is the provision of RPAS services (tactical and/or MALE) covering the aircraft, ground segments (both ground control station and ground data terminal),navigation and communications. Personnel, training facilities as well as logistic support are also considered as being part of the ‘RPAS services’ addressed under the survey. It should be underlined that the objective of this survey is to identify service providers of turn-key solutions and not manufacturers or suppliers of assets.   Full details on the aim, scope and participating rules are available here.   Deadline for participation is 31 March 2018. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/02/26/eda-market-survey-on-commercially-available-rpas-services

EDA_NEWS_0198	2018-02-23	NEWS	Pilot Project EuroSWARM and SPIDER activities completed	 Two research activities of the Pilot Project on defence research, SPIDER and EuroSWARM, financed by EU budget, were brought to a successful closure at their respective final meetings on the 20 and 21 February 2018. The last activity, TRAWA, is due to be completed by May 2018. The Pilot Project aims at exploring how the European Union can support building defence capabilities relevant for the Common Security and Defence Policy and Member States. It was proposed by the European Parliament and launched by the European Commission in response to multiple political calls from EU institutions, Member States and NATO to improve Europe's defence capabilities. This objective is also enshrined in article 42 (3) of the Treaty on the European Union. The Pilot Project had been entrusted to the European Defence Agency (EDA) by the European Commission through a Delegation Agreement, which was signed on 16 November 2015. The EDA proposed to the European Commission a list of topics, for the preparation of the work plan of the Pilot Project. The call for proposals, the submission of proposals, the evaluation and the awarding of the grant agreement were organised and coordinated by EDA. After the signature of the grant agreements, three research activities were launched, executed by the awarded consortia and monitored by EDA. With a budget of 1.4 million euros from the European Union, the three research activities received a grant in the order of € 430.000 each. All projects were launched in November 2016, namely: EuroSWARM, SPIDER and TRAWA. The successful outcome of the Pilot Project, as a predecessor to the Preparatory Action for Defence Research, is to be seen in proving the feasibility of defence research funding through the EU budget. The initial rationale and objectives of the Pilot Project, which along with the on-going Preparatory Action on Defence Research was set-up to pave the way for a fully-fledged European Defence Research Programme (EDRP) in the next Multi-Annual Financial Framework after 2020, have already been met. It has supported the demonstration that EU funding can effectively support EU defence research needs, based on a structured cooperation and joint work between the European Commission and the EDA. The successful handling of the Pilot Project by the European Commission and the EDA has been an excellent preparation for the Preparatory Action on Defence Research and a future EDRP. Unmanned Heterogeneous Swarm of Sensor Platforms (EuroSWARM) EuroSWARM aimed to test and demonstrate that efficient and effective operation of unmanned swarm systems can bring a profound impact to the military arena. The key focus was the minimisation of uncertainties in situational awareness information for surveillance operations through a swarm system of systems composed by static and mobile heterogeneous sensors. The main objectives of the activity were to: develop key techniques for adaptive, informative and reconfigurable operations of unmanned heterogeneous swarm systems, namely: optimal task allocation and resource management, sensor fusion, cooperative guidance, robust sensor network; integrate the developed enabling techniques; validate the developed enabling techniques based on empirical simulation studies; demonstrate the proposed solutions based on a small scale of experiments. EuroSWARM was carried out by a consortium led by the University of Cranfield (UK) which also included the French aerospace research agency ONERA (Office National d'Etudes et de Recherches Aérospatiales), the Swedish Defence Research Agency FOI and the University of Patras (Greece). Inside Building Awareness and Navigation for Urban Warfare (SPIDER) SPIDER aimed to develop an innovative system to support Urban-Warfare operations by providing improved situational awareness to operational forces entering an unfriendly building. It focused on the use of radiofrequency (RF) stationary sensors and mobile ground robots. The main objectives of the activity were to: develop and analyse a framework comprising the use of multiple sensors to perform indoor mapping and human detection in an Urban Warfare context; consider the choice of a data fusion strategy to process and combine sensor data; explore the advantages and constraints of using each solution as well as solutions encompassing autonomous robots combined with static RF sensor networks. SPIDER was carried out by a consortium led by TEKEVER, a Portuguese technology company, and composed of IT Aveiro - Instituto de Telecomunicações (Portugal), Aralia (UK) and the Bulgarian Defence Institute (BDI). Standardisation of Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) Detect and Avoid (TRAWA) The TRAWA activity, which is still ongoing, aims to contribute to the development of standards for a performant and affordable detect and avoid (DAA) system usable on-board Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS). It is focused on the Remain Well Clear (RWC) function and contributes to the standardisation activities in cooperation with other international efforts in full alignment with EUROCAE WG 105 Terms of Reference. The main objectives of the activity are to: specify Remain Well Clear in quantitative terms and obtain validation via simulations; specify sensor types, detection ranges and position estimation accuracy; develop requirements for remote pilot HMI (Human Machin Interface) characteristics. TRAWA is carried out by a consortium led by the Netherlands Aerospace Center (NLR) with the following partners: the German Aerospace Center (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt, DLR), Deep Blue (Italy), Tony Henley Consulting (UK) and EuroUSC (Italy).   More information Project page on the Preparatory Action 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/02/23/pilot-project-euroswarm-and-spider-activities-completed
EDA_NEWS_0199	2018-02-20	NEWS	European Centre for Manual Neutralisation Capabilities starts its activities in Vienna	 Today, the European Centre for Manual Neutralisation Capabilities (ECMAN) was officially opened in Vienna.  The ceremony was attended by the Austrian Chief of Defence, General Othmar Commenda and high level representatives from the Ministries of Defence of the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Sweden, NATO accredited COEs (CIED, EOD, JCBRN Defence), German Federal and Local Criminal Police, the German CIED Information Centre, the Swedish CBRN Defence Centre, Swedish EOD and Demining Centre, the Italian CIED Centre, as well as military attaches in Austria and the European Defence Agency (EDA). ECMAN is a follow-on activity of the EDA Programme on Manual Neutralisation Techniques Courses and Exercises (MNT C&E). Manual neutralisation techniques are the most advanced improvised device disposal proficiencies, which enable experienced and specially trained operators to access, diagnose, and manually dispose of hazardous material. These tactics, techniques and procedures need to be applied where the use of regular explosive ordnance procedures or of energetic weapons are inappropriate, and manual improvised explosive devices’ neutralisation capabilities are the last resort. At the opening ceremony in Vienna a static demonstration of the equipment, including explanations of different scenarios, was provided. Additionally, during a live demonstration participants of the ceremony gained some insights into the skill sets of MNT operators.  The aim of the Centre is to provide participating Member States with expertise and experience in the field of Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) threats.

EDA_NEWS_0200	2018-02-14	NEWS	Belgium joins multinational tanker fleet	 Belgium today became the 5th country to join the Multinational Multi-Role Tanker Transport Fleet (MMF).  Belgium’s accession to the MMF was celebrated during a signing ceremony at NATO headquarters in Brussels also attended by EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq.  The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany and Norway are already members of this multinational defence cooperation project which aims to fill the serious capability gap European nations have in the field of Air-to-Air refuelling (AAR).  The MMF project was initiated by the European Defence Agency (EDA) in 2011. Europe’s organization for the management of cooperative armament programmes - OCCAR - manages the MMF acquisition phase. Following the acquisition phase, the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) will be responsible for the complete life-cycle management of the fleet (A330 MRTT). With Belgium joining, the number of MRTT aircraft ordered will increase from 7 to 8. Delivery of the first aircraft is planned for 2020.   The fleet is funded by the participating nations who will also have the exclusive right to use these NATO–owned aircraft which will operate in a pooling arrangement. The aircraft will be configured for inflight refuelling, the transport of passengers and cargo, and medical evacuation flights. EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq welcomed the further expansion of the fleet: “We are delighted to see that the MMF, which is a good example of European defence cooperation kick-started by the European Defence Agency, is further expanding. It shows that once a capability shortfall has been jointly identified, European nations can pull together, work on a common project aimed at filling the gap, and eventually deliver. It’s Pooling & Sharing at its best”.   More information:  Air-to-Air Refueling (EDA project page) Multi-Role Tanker Transport Fleet (MMF) expands significantly (EDA webnews, September 2017) Germany and Norway formally join Netherlands and Luxembourg to operate pooled fleet of NATO-owned Airbus A330 MRTT tankers (EDA webnews, June 2017)  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/02/14/belgium-joins-multinational-tanker-fleet

EDA_NEWS_0207	2018-01-18	NEWS	EU funding for defence stakeholders: EDA launches ‘ERASMUS+ platform’	 Strategic Research Agendas in defence and their Technology Building Blocks (OSRA-TBBs), as well as Key Strategic Activities (KSA) often build on specific defence-related Key Skills and Competencies (KSC). The cooperative development and enhancement of any KSC for defence can be concretely supported by EU funding programmes, among them, the “Erasmus+ 2014-2020”. To raise awareness, transfer know-how and build autonomous capacity about the Erasmus+ opportunities for defence, the European Defence Agency (EDA) published the “EDA’s ERASMUS+ platform”. This is a new user-friendly gateway providing potential defence-related stakeholders (such as Ministries of Defence, defence-related industry, research-and-technology organisations, academia, clusters) with: • a swift and simple introduction to funding opportunities for Defence under the Erasmus+ programme;  • an interactive analytical mapping on ‘sources’ of calls for proposals (and contact details of the relevant Agencies in charge of funding allocation). For the EU budgetary framework until 2020, the Erasmus+ delivers more than 14 billion euros and can co-fund defence-related projects in support of: the mobility of individuals (students / trainees / apprentices) acquiring competences, knowledge and skills; the development, testing, implementation and transfer of innovative educational/training practices, by encompassing transnational training as well as the planning of professional development (also for Defence staff, thereby increasing the capacity to work at international level and exchange experience / know-how); entrepreneurial skills in defence for graduates and employees.

EDA_NEWS_0208	2018-01-19	NEWS	New chip developed under EDA project gets award	 Picture copyright © Teledyne e2v (UK) Ltd 2018 A new chip developed under the European Defence Agency’s THIMS project (Technology for High speed Mixed Signal circuits) has received the 2017 Elektra award for ‘Semiconductor Of The Year - Analog’ by Electronics Weekly, a reputed and longstanding UK-based electronics magazine and website. The Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) EV12DS460 developed by the French entity of Teledyne e2v based in Grenoble (France) was one of the main outcomes of THIMS project which ran at the EDA till January 2016. The aim of this project, funded by France and Germany, was to address the key issue of establishing a secure access to high speed mixed analogue and digital circuits, and to strengthen Europe’s defence technological base in this critical domain through exploitation of high speed circuits. Another objective of THIMS was to increase the conversion bandwidth, reduce the size of circuit areas and cut power consumption. More specifically, the target was to design a DAC for radar applications with high spectral purity (low harmonic spurs) and ultra-wideband (here 7GHz). The outcome of THIMS is the world’s first K-band capable Digital-to-Analog Converter. This component is critical for applications in high purity direct digital frequency synthesis(1), especially for the new generation of radars and software defined radio. It also has great potential for civil, industrial and space-related applications. The THIMS consortium also included Airbus Defence & Space (defence electronics activities, now Hensoldt GmbH) as well as Thales Airborne Systems. The chip was developed using Infineon’s Bipolar technology, meaning the whole cycle, from design to production and application, is based on European know-how. Electronics Weekly runs the annual awards ceremony called ‘The Elektra Awards’ since 2002. The aim of the awards is to reward the achievements of individuals and firms across the European electronics industry.

EDA_NEWS_0209	2018-01-25	NEWS	EDA, EATC and OCCAR-EA enhance cooperation for A400M in-service phase	 On 25 January, Major General Pascal Chiffoleau, Commander of the European Air Transport Command (EATC), Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency and Arturo Alfonso-Meiriño, OCCAR-EA Director signed a letter of intent on common in-service support for the A400M capability within the remit of EATC. The cooperation in the in-service phase of the A400M mainly aims at enhancing synergies, avoiding the duplication of efforts, reducing the administrative burden and by facilitating – where possible – common action. It is thus expected to bring significant added-value, especially by increasing interoperability between the respective Member States. “Based on the already excellent cooperation with EATC for example on air-to-air refuelling and with OCCAR-EA on the development of a European RPAS capability, I am confident that today’s agreement will be of benefit to all our Member States. Working together means that each organisation will bring in its particular strengths and expertise. This is European defence in practice”, said Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency. Common support for the in-service phase of the A400M aircraft will further underline the capabilities’ multinational configuration. The agreed areas of cooperation are common operation manuals for air and ground operations as well as common training requirements and syllabi, among others. The EDA, EATC and OCCAR-EA will also cooperate on airworthiness and certification aspects, air-to-air refuelling and topics arising through the Single European Sky.    More information: Air-to-air refuelling project page European Air Transport Command website OCCAR-EA website 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/01/25/eda-eatc-and-occar-ea-enhance-cooperation-for-a400m-in-service-phase
EDA_NEWS_0210	2018-01-18	NEWS	EDA sets-up collaborative RPAS training	 On Thursday 18 January 2018, the European Defence Agency (EDA) achieved a significant milestone within its Education, Training and Education portfolio with the deployment and linking of Medium Altitude, Long Endurance, Remotely Piloted Air Systems (MALE RPAS) desktop simulators in France and Italy. The deployment to Italy completes the first tranche of up to nine systems, which will be distributed across European military RPAS Schools and Centres of Excellence that will allow networked collaborative training. The aim is to build over time a European MALE RPAS community of interest to improve procedures, tactics and to harmonise training approaches. The project was developed by the EDA under the mandate of the European MALE RPAS Community (DE, EL, ES, FR, IT, NL and PO) and is a joint effort with the European Air Group (which also includes BE and UK) in which the EDA is delivering the RPAS training technology demonstrator equipment and the EAG is producing training schedules to exploit the new system. This will enhance interoperability between Member States who currently field MALE RPAS platforms and those that aspire to the capability within a 5-10 year timeframe. The roll out of the systems will run in parallel with an increasingly ambitious virtual exercise programme that will provide opportunities for joint training and the cross-fertilisation of training approaches as instructors will teach lessons across the network to students at the dispersed sites.  The project will run for four years initially as a Training Technology Demonstrator and has already attracted additional interest from other Member States. The EDA has for some time supported Member States ambitions in several areas of Education, Training and Exercise activity. The Agency is not a long-term training provider as such, but  operates as a training consultancy, establishing business cases underpinning new initiatives for Member States to consider  and setting up contracts on their behalf as required. Once initiatives have reached a sufficient level of maturity and are consolidated, they are transferred to a Member State or multinational organisation willing to take over administrative responsibilities and to ensure their longer term development. The Agency has achieved notable success in advanced helicopter exercises and training, airlift, energy management, armaments cooperation and its latest venture into training for unmanned systems.   More information: EDA Training & Exercise programme - watch the short video here.  European Air Group  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/01/18/eda-sets-up-collaborative-rpas-training
EDA_NEWS_0211	2017-12-18	NEWS	EDA studies points towards Big Data potential for defence	 How do new and constantly evolving Big Data methodologies and techniques impact defence Modelling and Simulation and how may their increasing potential be best used? To shed light on these and other questions related to Big Data in defence, the European Defence Agency (EDA) launched the ‘Big Data in Defence Modelling and Simulation’  (BIDADEMS) study whose findings are now available and has led to a new project researching new methodologies (MODSIMMET).   While Big Data is already extensively used in the civil domain, for instance helping companies to improve decision-making based on customer spending (big) data, its potential benefits for the defence sector still needs to be explored and investigated.  Against this backdrop in September 2016, the EDA initiated the BIDADEMS study aimed at better understanding Big Data methodologies, techniques and their potential applications in the defence domain, in particular for modelling and simulation (M&S) purposes. In the M&S domain, Big Data could potentially help to provide simplified military simulation designs, generate more realistic simulation scenarios and environments, improve the exploitation of simulation results or provide new opportunities for M&S support to military test and evaluation (T&E) activities.   Recommendations The study identified some emerging Big Data technologies with high potential for defence M&S (such as cloud computing, non-relational databases, data analytics or visual analytics) and formulated recommendations for the EDA and Member States’ future work in this domain, notably: 1. Future M&S applications should be designed with Cloud Computing in mind, setting up cloud based environments to provide “sandbox” test areas to analyse new data sets. 2. Further investigation into the application of Data and Visual Analytics techniques and to data analytics to M&S models focussing on:  a) Models and data available through predictive analytics as inputs for M&S models;  b) Current data mining techniques and their applicability to M&S output data. 3. Given the high innovation rate of these techniques it seems to be necessary to both inform and educate analysts on new data analytics techniques and to provide M&S developers with Big Data considerations when developing future models.    Outcome The outcome of the BIDADEMS project supported EDA’s contribution to the 2nd Annual European GeoInformation Symposium & Exhibition on Big Data and the Global Big Data Defence 2017 Summit, both held in Berlin during June 2017. Also the project has motivated the EDA’s ‘Simulation’ Capability Technology Group (CapTech) to initiate a new study, MODSIMMET, which will analyse how to approach very complex scenarios like hybrid warfare with different methodologies like Data farming and War gaming supported by Big Data and Artificial Intelligence.  The collection, storage, analysis and management of a huge amount of real and simulated data is inevitable and will increase in the future. It will be used to take advantage of existing and future related technologies. The use of Big Data tools and methodologies is likely to be a recurrent issue in the Agency where growing attention is being devoted to these innovative technologies.     More information: EDA Cap Tech Simulation EDA Cap Tech Information  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/12/18/eda-studies-points-towards-big-data-potential-for-defence

EDA_NEWS_0215	2017-12-20	NEWS	Electronic warfare: a new chapter in EDA’s helicopter programme	 Some 20 military helicopter pilots and intelligence officers from Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom participated in the first ever helicopter electronic warfare course organised by the European Defence Agency (EDA), from November 20th to December 1st at RAF airbase Linton-on-Ouse (UK). The course was initiated under the Agency’s Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP) to boost helicopter crews’ skills and abilities in electronic warfare systems and tactics, a fast evolving domain which so far barely featured in rotary missions typically deployed to ‘low-tech’ battlefields.   Against this backdrop, the first course was largely devoted to introducing the basics of electronic warfare including the impact and functioning of radar, infra-red (IR) and ultra-violet (UV) systems. Specialists from various defence industries were invited to brief the trainees who also spent some time at the UK electronic warfare range at RAF Spadeadam where they had the opportunity to learn about various surface-to-air missile systems and exchange views with experts operating and maintaining them. The course ended with a visit to the airbase’s simulator where a bespoke electronic warfare sortie was carried out, allowing trainees to apply and visualise some of the theoretical topics previously discussed in the classroom.  All in all a successful first course likely to be followed-up by other electronic warfare courses (basic and advanced level) in 2018 and beyond.   More information:  Helicopter Initiatives (EDA project page) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/12/20/electronic-warfare-a-new-chapter-in-eda-s-helicopter-programme
EDA_NEWS_0216	2017-12-11	NEWS	EDA study to assess graphene potential for defence	 The European Defence Agency (EDA) today hosted the kick-off meeting for a new study to be carried out over the next 12 months on possible future applications of graphene in the military domain and its expected impact on the European defence industry.  Among the materials with the highest potential for revolutionizing defence capabilities in the next decade, graphene comes high up on the list. Light and flexible and yet 200 times stronger than steel, its electrical conductivity is extraordinary (better than silicon) as is its thermal conductivity. Graphene also has remarkable properties in the so-called ‘signature management’ field, meaning it can be used to produce radar absorbent coatings making military vehicles, planes, submarines or vessels almost undetectable.  All this makes of graphene an extremely attractive material not only for civil industries but also for military applications in the land, air and maritime domains.  To explore the latter, the EDA launched the graphene study which, following a Europe-wide call for tenders, was assigned to Fundacion Tecnalia Research and Innovation (Spain) who will collaborate with two partners, the Technical University of Cartagena (Spain) and Cambridge Nanomaterial Technology Ltd (United Kingdom). All consortium members have proven experience in graphene research and also in the defence sector.   Main objectives The study has three main objectives: to analyse and evaluate to what extent graphene is already used in dual-use or military areas and what the prospects of future defence applications are; to develop an ambitious yet realistic roadmap for the development of graphene in the defence domains, backed and supported by the EDA’s ‘Materials’ CapTech; to demonstrate graphene’s defence-related potential through a series of practical experiments the results of which will be published in a scientific journal  Denis Roger, the EDA’s European Synergies & Innovation (ESI) Director, commented: “The European defence research landscape certainly stands to benefit substantially from graphene and its potential future applications in the military domain. The EDA’s study launched today could open the way towards new exciting research and capability development opportunities. We are very much looking forward to its results”.  The study findings are expected to be published in December 2018/January 2019.   More information:  CapTech Materials & Structures (EDA project page)  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/12/11/eda-study-to-assess-graphene-potential-for-defence
EDA_NEWS_0217	2017-12-13	NEWS	GISMO puts geospatial support to CSDP missions on the map	 Situational awareness is a prerequisite for good decision-making in any CSDP mission or operation. In order to provide operation commanders with optimal capabilities in this domain, EDA Member States in 2014 launched GISMO, the ‘Geospatial Information to Support decision Making in Operations’ project.  Since then and working in partnership with the EU Satellite Centre (EU SatCen), GISMO has produced a first operational output in the form of ‘GeohuB’, a software application which allows for the safe and reliable sharing of geospatial information (GI) within a mission’s operational headquarter. After a successful field trial last February, GeohuB was successfully deployed to the Italian Operation Headquarters, Rome, in support of EU Naval Force Mediterranean (EUNAVFOR MED).  In practical terms, this means that mission/operation participants with access to the classified mission network of EUNAVFOR MED’s operational headquarters in Rome can now upload, share and manage geospatial data related to the operation. GeohuB is accessible through a normal web browser (Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, etc.) with a user-friendly interface which makes it intuitive for non-specialists.  “If we imagine the full amount of geospatial information available to a CSDP operation as a vast image library, the GeohuB App can be compared to Instagram: an easy and user-friendly way to accessing specific, selected information clips. As with Instagram, GeohuB allows user-generated content to be uploaded and shared at anytime”,  Alessandro Cignoni, Project Officer at the EDA’s Information Superiority Unit, explained.  GeohuB will be further improved in the coming months with the aim of bringing the App to ‘full operating capability’ by the first quarter 2019. Close cooperation between the EDA, the EU SatCen and the EU Military Staff (EUMS), as well as with the operational users in the EUNAVFOR MED headquarters in Rome will be crucial to make it a success.  In the meantime, the application’s reputation is already growing: GeohuB is now also used in the EU Monitoring Mission in Georgia (EUMM Georgia) while the Portuguese Armed Forces introduced it on a national level. Furthermore, the EUMS initiated a specific project to explore the potential usage of the GeohuB within the European External Action Service (EEAS). Background Commanders of CSDP missions and operations constantly need fast, reliable and updated geospatial information covering land, sea, airspace and cyber. Geospatial information is earth-related factual data referenced by geographic position and arranged in a coherent structure. Such data include topographic, aeronautical, hydrographic or planning information but also mapping, geo-referenced imagery, geophysical products, etc. available in either analogue or digital format. Most pieces of information have a location, and knowing and understanding these locations can be decisive in a mission commanders’ decision-making. Ever improving geospatial information has thus the potential to revolutionise the decision-making process within military missions and operations.     More information:  GeohuB: Successful Training and Operational Field Trial concluded at EUNAVFOR MED Operation SOPHIA HQ EDA and EU Satellite Centre (SATCEN) formalize cooperation with exchange of letters 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/12/13/gismo-puts-geospatial-support-to-csdp-missions-on-the-map

The EDA actively contributes to the implementation of the June 2016 Joint Declaration in areas such as capability development, cyber defence, hybrid, defence industry/research and exercises, and is expected to play a central role on the implementation of the new proposals, including on military mobility, on the basis of the agreed principles on the implementation of the 2016 Joint Declaration.   More information: Remarks by HR/VP and Head of the EDA, Federica Mogherini, at the joint press conference with Jens Stoltenberg, Secretary General of NATO Read the Council Conclusions 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/12/06/new-proposals-for-eu-nato-cooperation
EDA_NEWS_0219	2017-12-08	NEWS	EDA, ENISA, EC3 and CERT-EU discuss enhanced cooperation	 The Executive Directors of four key European agencies dealing with cyber security and defence - the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), the EU institutions’ permanent Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-EU) and the European Defence Agency (EDA) - met today 8 December in Athens at the ENISA premises to discuss future cooperative opportunities in the field of cyber security and defence.  The aim is to enhance synergies and avoid duplication between the four agencies as well as to discuss ways of establishing an enhanced and structured cooperation built around identified areas of cooperation. They include, among others: cyber security & defence education, training and exercises; building synergies in the area of technology development including research with dual use characteristics as well as testing of demonstrators/prototypes; common standardisation and certification; incident cooperation; or strategic and administrative matters.    “Cyber threats are transnational by nature, and so has to be our response to them. EU institutions, agencies and bodies need to think cross-sectoral and join forces where appropriate in order to anticipate the security challenges and adapt to Member States’ expectations. And nowhere does this better apply than in the cyber domain”, Jorge Domecq, the EDA’s Chief Executive, stated at the meeting.

EDA_NEWS_0220	2017-12-05	NEWS	Conference highlights importance of Personnel Recovery in military operations	 A two-day conference co-organised by the European Defence Agency (EDA) and the Italian Air Force devoted to “Personnel Recovery: Risks & Mitigations” was opened this Monday 4 December at the Istituto di Scienze Militari Aeronautiche (ISMA) in Florence, Italy, with the aim of increasing awareness about the importance of having appropriate Personnel Recovery (PR) planning and implementation capabilities in military operations or missions. The conference brings together more than 70 participants from EU Member States, the European Union Military Staff (EUMS), the European Personnel Recovery Centre (EPRC), NATO, the Integrated Coalition Personnel Recovery Capability (ICPRC) project as well as representatives from the US and New Zealand. Opened by the Commander of the Italian Air Operations Command, General Antonio Conserva, the conference will examine all aspects of Personnel Recovery with a particular focus on the challenges and risks involved in the planning and implementation of this crucial task. Participants will also discuss best practices and ways to improve PR in the future. In his keynote speech, Rini Goos, the EDA’s Deputy Chief Executive, expressed his confidence that “this conference will help to raise awareness on the importance of Personnel Recovery planning and implementation for saving lives”. The aim of the Agency’s efforts in this domain is to “reassure both our deployed personnel and their relatives back home that safety is our prime concern and that we will do everything we can to ensure that during a mission, no one will be left behind”, Mr Goos recalled that “the EDA is engaged in this effort since 2007 when it established the Project Team Personnel Recovery”.   Background The isolation, capture and exploitation of personnel during Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) operations and missions can have a significant adverse impact on operational security, the morale of personnel and public support. The EU therefore attaches a lot of importance to the release, recovery and reintegration of personnel by employing all possible diplomatic, military and civilian tools. Since the establishment of EDA’s Project Team Personnel Recovery (PT PR) in 2007, the Agency has been working with participating Member States and partners to address identified shortfalls over the full spectrum of PR, from the cultural and conceptual context to training aspects, and to the development of advanced technologies and tools.   More information: Speech by EDA Deputy Chief Executive Rini Goos EDA Personnel Recovery team celebrates 10th anniversary Personnel Recovery: A strong safety net for deployed personnel EDA’s Joint Personnel Recovery Staff Course hosted for the first time by ItalyPRCPC hosted in Italy Factsheet: PR FAS ATD - a Command and Control Tool for Personnel Recovery Factsheet: SERE e-learning tool for Personnel Recovery 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/12/05/conference-highlights-importance-of-personnel-recovery-in-military-operations
EDA_NEWS_0221	2017-11-29	NEWS	Key defence and security space project supported by ESIF	 The “SPACE NOSTRUM - High Performance Dual Satellite Constellation for Maritime Surveillance” study was awarded European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), accessing the highest co-funding rate (50%) available in that region. This funding supports a broad space system R&T project, with up to 20 satellites aimed at fighting terrorism and smuggling among others. Its economic impact could include the development of entire new technical sector and hundreds of high-value jobs. This ESIF-funded half-million euro study was initially identified by the French DGA and selected by the EDA to receive tailored technical assistance to access ESIF. Thales Alenia Space France leads the project consortium with 4 other companies and 2 defence-related clusters. The award demonstrates that significant defence and security projects initiated by large companies in LOI countries are also eligible for ESIF. It clearly underlines the importance of the EDA’s role, explicitly featured in the project application. Previous successful EDA-supported R&T projects had already demonstrated eligibility for SMEs in several EU countries. It is now clear that ESIF can fund the entire spectrum of defence stakeholders. SPACE NOSTRUM delivers on the EU Global Strategy and its Implementation Plan for Defence as well as the EU Maritime Security Strategy. It will be relevant for the defence naval environment and for defence-related radars. By building on successful pilot projects, the EDA is in the process of developing a specific methodology identifying a spectrum of EU funding sources for both the European Defence Overarching Strategic Research Agenda (OSRA) and Key Strategic Activities (KSA).

EDA_NEWS_0222	2017-11-29	NEWS	New helicopter tactics discussed at EDA Helicopter Tactics Symposium 2017	 50 helicopter tactics specialists from twelve EDA participating Member States, as well as representatives of the Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC), the Joint Air Power Competence Centre (JAPCC), the Multinational Aviation Training Centre (MATC) and the Netherlands Aerospace Centre (NLR) met recently in Rijen, the Netherlands, for the 8th Helicopter Tactics Symposium, organised under the EDA’s Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP). This annual event proved once more to be a unique occasion for European helicopter crews to discuss and share expertise and best practices related to helicopter tactics and to learn about new training opportunities under the HEP programme.A central part of the symposium was devoted to drawing the tactical lessons from recent EDA helicopter exercises, such as ‘Black Blade 16’ (held at Florennes Air Base, Belgium, in November 2016) and ‘Fire Blade 17’ at Papa Airbase in Hungary (May 2017). Other lessons learnt sessions covered examples of counter surface-to-air fire tactics, urban operations, a recent Slovenian MEDEVAC operation, a Czech helicopter door gunner pre-deployment training and the introduction of special operation forces’ helicopters in Germany. Symposium attendees also received a detailed presentation on the Dutch helicopter aviation training system and discussed various topics related to helicopter techniques, tactics and procedures, including combined tactical operations in which transport helicopters are escorted by attack helicopters during missions abroad. The debate resulted in new concrete proposals for updating the HEP Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), the capstone tactics manual for multinational helicopter operations. Looking ahead, symposium participants were briefed on upcoming HEP exercises, including Hot Blade 2018 (to be held in Portugal) which will focus on helicopter Composite Air Operations (COMAO) missions in hot, high-altitude and dusty conditions with trooping, live firing and MEDEVAC flights. In 2019, the annual HEP exercise will take place in the Czech Republic under the label ‘Dark Blade’.  More information:Helicopter Initiatives (EDA project page) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/11/29/new-helicopter-tactics-discussed-at-eda-helicopter-tactics-symposium-2017
EDA_NEWS_0223	2017-11-29	NEWS	EDA moves forward with personnel recovery training	 Providing a security net for deployed troops, personnel recovery (PR) capabilities are nowadays integral part of any military or crisis management operation under the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). The European Defence Agency (EDA) is engaged in this field since 2013 when it launched the Personnel Recovery Controller and Planner Course (PRCPC) project. Within this overarching framework the Agency has organised another Personnel Recovery Staff Course (JPRSC), already the 13th since 2013, from 15-24 November at the European Personnel Recovery Centre (EPRC) at Poggio Renatico Air Base, Italy. Some 20 students from seven countries (Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Norway) attended the course led by instructors from Germany, Italy, Sweden and the EPRC. The main focus was on training officers who will have to support their commanders on personnel recovery related issues. The courses are designed for staff in tactical operation centres (TOCs), personnel recovery coordination cells (PRCCs) and joint personnel recovery cells (JPRCs). The next Personnel Recovery Controller and Planner Course will take place in Karlsborg, Sweden, from 12-22 March 2018 and will be organised in cooperation with the Swedish Armed Forces.  Background The EDA PRCPC project was established on 30 May 2013 as an EDA Category B project under the lead of Sweden. As of today, it includes eight contributing Member States (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Hungary, Italy, The Netherlands and Sweden). The course cycle has been extended three times and will be finalised on 30 May 2019. The European Personnel Recovery Centre (EPRC) based at Poggio Renatico Air Base, Italy, closely cooperates with the EDA. It was created on 8 July 2015 by seven nations (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom) with the aim of improving the four phases of personnel recovery (preparation, planning, execution, adaptation) by developing and harmonising common PR policies and standards and providing support for education, training, exercises and operations.  More information:Personnel Recovery - EDA project page   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/11/29/eda-moves-forward-with-personnel-recovery-training

EDA_NEWS_0226	2017-11-23	NEWS	2017 Annual Conference closes with call to step up cyber defence cooperation	 EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq  on November 23rd closed the Agency’s Annual Conference 2017 with a call to use the EU’s new defence tools and the EDA’s full potential to enhance cyber cooperation and help Member States’ armed forces to plan, develop, acquire and use the required cyber defence capabilities. In his final remarks wrapping up the conference, Mr Domecq thanked all the speakers for their contributions: Federica Mogherini, Head of the Agency; Julian King, EU Commissioner in charge of the Security Union; Kersti Kaljulaid, President of Estonia; Mikko Hypponen, Chief Research Officer of F-Secure. He also expressed gratitude to the members of the two panels who shared their expertise and assessments and sparked lively discussions with the audience. Main takeaways Mr Domceq singled out several key takeaways from this year’s conference, in particular: Cyber threats affect all military capabilities. It’s therefore essential to strengthen the cyber resilience elements in the development of all future platforms & systems, across land, air, maritime or space domains;Armed forces need to learn their lessons from previous incidents more rapidly and efficiently so as to be able to better prevent, detect and respond to future attacks; Europe is stronger if it tackles cyber threats together, in a common and coordinated approach encompassing the full military dimension of cyber defence; Member States need to better coordinate their cyber strategies to avoid fragmentation, to ensure and improve interoperability, and to protect special requirements of the military;Strategies and policies are essential but what really matters at the end of the day are the capabilities in place to counter cyberattacks. The most effective way for Member States’ armed forces to identify, plan, develop, procure and eventually use these capabilities is by doing it together;New EU defence cooperation tools such as the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD), the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the European Defence Fund (EDF) are now in place. They need to be used in the best possible way; PESCO, in particular, could be a game changer for defence and offer a welcome cooperation framework for Member States to take forward priority projects, including on cyber;The European Defence Fund, for its part, will offer new funding opportunities for cooperative projects. Specifically, at the upstream R&T level, it could support the development of cyber defence technologies identified in the future Overarching Strategic Research Agenda (OSRA) and of related Technology Building Blocks; The European Commission’s new Cyber Package, if properly implemented, can contribute to increased security in the Fifth Domain provided that duplication is avoided and that the specificities of the military dimension are fully taken on board;Continuous engagement with other parties such as NATO is paramount to ensure continued coherence of output;Dialogue with industry is equally important to secure the required future capabilities and the appropriate degree of strategic autonomy.  EDA prepared to play its part As far as the EDA’s cyber work is concerned, “2018 will see the topic stay centre stage in the Agency’s work plan”, with a particular focus on three main activities. Firstly, the Capability Development Plan (CDP) revision in spring is expected to include new cyber defence needs and priorities some of which were already flagged during the 2016 EDA Table Top Exercise on hybrid threats. Secondly, the Agency looks forward to seeing the Initial Operational Capability of the CSDP Cyber Training & Exercise Platform next year in close cooperation with the European Security & Defence College. The project on pooling demand for cyber defence training and exercise support by the private sector should also reach its conclusion. And thirdly, on facilitating the interface with wider EU policies, the EDA will continue its work on the implementation of the Cyber Defence Policy Framework. The Agency is also considering setting up a dedicated Capability Technology Group (or Cap Tech) on cyber defence. In all of these activities, “engagement with industry will be of central importance to enable our Member States to develop the capabilities they need to stay ahead in tomorrow’s cyberspace”, Mr Domecq stressed. “Our work to improve Europe’s cybersecurity and cyber defence is still in its initial phases. We must lose no time in embracing this golden opportunity to both plan and implement the next steps together. Only in doing so will we ensure that the advent of the digital era remains an opportunity for European citizens in the 21st century”, the EDA Chief Executive concluded.  More information: Jorge Domecq closing speech EDA Annual Conference 2017Federica Mogherini opens Annual Conference at “most important moment for EU defence in décades”Remarks by High-Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the 2017 Annual Conference of the European Defence AgencyEstonian President Kaljulaid: EU needs shared cyber expertise and joint exercise at strategic level Annual conference delivers insights on future of cyber defence  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/11/23/2017-annual-conference-closes-with-call-to-step-up-cyber-defence-cooperation
EDA_NEWS_0227	2017-11-23	NEWS	Federica Mogherini opens Annual Conference at “most important moment for EU defence in decades”	" The European Defence Agency (EDA) Annual Conference 2017 entitled 'Security in the digital age: the added value of European cooperation’ was opened Thursday morning (23 November) in Brussels by the Head of the Agency, Federica Mogherini. Addressing a 400-strong audience representing the whole European defence spectrum - governments, armed forces, industry, EU institutions, NATO, think tanks and media - Mrs Mogherini said the conference was taking place “at the most important moment for European defence in decades” with bold new initiatives such as the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD), the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the European Defence Fund (EDF) creating an unprecedented momentum for enhanced cooperation. “Today, we are building a European Union of security and defence. It' not a plan, not a dream anymore, but a reality (...) All the building blocks of a security and defence union are finally there”, she stated. This means that Member States can now project and develop their defence capabilities together: “We can buy together, to ensure that we have all the capabilities we need while also spending efficiently. And we can act together, much better than before, to manage or prevent crises, to strengthen our partners, to make our citizens more secure”. Acting together is a necessity “because today’s security challenges are too big for any of our Member States alone. Everyone understands this today. Our citizens are asking for more security and more efficient budgets, and the two are only possible if we join forces”, Mrs Mogherini stressed.  The EDA, a leading force “The Council, the Commission and the European Defence Agency have all played their part in shaping the path towards a European Union of security and defence”, she went on. The EDA was a “leading force” in defining the recent ‘defence package’ and, as far as PESCO is concerned, is already helping Member States assess the value of their projects for cooperation. “This will be central to the success of PESCO”, the Head of the Agency stressed. The ambition is to move towards a European security and defence union, not re-open the debate on a European army. “But in a way, we are doing something that is much more ambitious. We already have European missions and operations - 15 of them so far - and we have created a single command centre for our training and advisory missions. We are now working to build a truly European defence industry, a truly European defence market, and a truly European defence research which are the basis for a truly European defence. European military trainings are a concrete option. And the possibilities of PESCO are immense”, she stated. The CARD and the European Defence Fund (EDF) are also key instruments in which the EDA has ""great expertise, a huge potential - which also means huge responsibilities - to support Member States and the Commission in their decisions"". Cyber defence: clear need for closer cooperation Turning to the conference topic, Mrs Mogherini said cyber was a defence domain where close cooperation was more indispensable than ever. “Cyber threats require a response that is both civilian and military. To protect our cyberspace, we will need more research, better capabilities, more training and exercises, in constant coordination with our partners”. Promising new cyber initiatives recently saw the light - such as the setting up of a Hybrid Fusion Cell within the External Action Service, the inauguration of the European Centre for Countering Hybrid Threats in Helsinki, the first ever European strategic cybersecurity table-top exercise ‘CYBRID’ co-organised last September by the Estonian Presidency of the EU Council and the EDA, and last year's EU-NATO Joint Declaration which also covers cybersecurity - but more needs to be done: “We have to explore the full range of possibilities that we have built over the last couple of years with the Commission, Member States, the External Action Service and the European Defence Agency”.  Exciting journey With the new tools (CARD, PESCO, EDF) in place, EU defence cooperation has reached a level that was unimaginable not only 60 years ago but even just six months ago, Mrs Mogherini said. “A new exciting journey has just started. Everyone will have to play it role, starting of course from us, from the European Defence Agency and the External Action Service. We will have to find new ways of working together across the institutions – knowing that this is for the entire Union, for each of our citizens, and for a more peaceful and secure world”. More information:  Remarks by High-Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the 2017 Annual Conference of the European Defence AgencyEstonian President Kaljulaid: EU needs shared cyber expertise and joint exercise at strategic level Annual conference delivers insights on future of cyber defence 2017 Annual Conference closes with call to step up cyber defence cooperationJorge Domecq closing speech EDA Annual Conference 2017 "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/11/23/federica-mogherini-opens-annual-conference-at-most-important-moment-for-eu-defence-in-decades
EDA_NEWS_0228	2017-11-23	NEWS	Annual conference delivers insights on future of cyber defence	 In addition to the four keynote speeches delivered by Federica Mogherini (Head of the EDA), Julian King (EU Commissioner for the Security Union), Kersti Kaljulaid (President of Estonia) and Mikko Hypponen (Chief Research Officer, F-Secure), participants at this year’s EDA Annual Conference witnessed two lively and interactive panel debates on cyber as a ‘persistent strategic challenge’ and enhanced cooperation in Europe and beyond, and on how to tackle growing cyber threats.Panel 1: Cyber - A persistent strategic challenge High-level panellists in the first roundtable were General Riho Terras (Commander of Estonia’s Defence Forces), Dirk Hoke (Airbus Defence and Space CEO), Lieutenant General Ludwig Leinhos (Commander of the German Cyber and Information Space Command), Kevin Scheid (NATO NCIA General Manager), Neil Cassidy (Rolls Royce VP Director Cyber Security, Risk & Compliance) and Fabrice Clement (Proximus Director Security Governance & Investigations). The panel discussed a number of key questions such as ‘How far do EU Member States share cyber-threat assessments?’, ‘How are national governments tailoring their responses and increasing their preparedness levels?’, or ‘How should European institutions support Member States in their efforts to navigate the myriad initiatives linked to cybersecurity and cyber defence?’. Better information sharing and enhanced cyber defence cooperation are indispensable, not only between EU member States but also between the EU and NAT. Speakers also pointed to the need to avoid duplication of efforts and to increase cooperation with industry for delivery of the required technological solutions to counter growing cyber threats. The importance of cyber education and training was highlighted, as was the serious problem of finding and recruiting skilled cyber experts in Europe today, set to worsen in the future.  Panel 2: European solutions to global problems The afternoon panel discussion saw high-profile speakers discuss potential technological solutions, how industry is adapting to provide such technologies, and what the EU and NATO can do to support this process. Questions raised ranged from ‘How should Member States’ defence procurement models adapt to the fact that most of the available cyber defence technology today is dual-use?’, ‘How far are civilians and the military cooperating and exchanging best practises to avoid duplication and promote excellence?’ or ‘Where should the EDA focus its efforts to support EU Member States when it comes to cyber?’. The four high-level panellists were: Annegret Bendiek (Senior Associate Europe Research at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, SWP), Jakub Boratynski, (Head of Unit for Cybersecurity and Digital Privacy, DG Connect, European Commission), Rogier Holla (Deputy Head of the EU Computer Emergency Response Team, CERT-EU), Merle Maigre (NATO CCD COE Director) and George Sharkov (the National Cybersecurity Coordinator & Adviser to the Prime Minister of Bulgaria). The speakers touched on the importance of research and innovation in the civilian and military sides of cyber, on international norms in cyber warfare, the Tallinn Manual, and failed UN attempts to regulate and on the protection of critical infrastructure. All agreed on the urgent need to update existing SCADA systems to adapt to the current threat landscape.  More information:  Federica Mogherini opens Annual Conference at “most important moment for EU defence in décades”Remarks by High-Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the 2017 Annual Conference of the European Defence AgencyEstonian President Kaljulaid: EU needs shared cyber expertise and joint exercise at strategic level2017 Annual Conference closes with call to step up cyber defence cooperationJorge Domecq closing speech EDA Annual Conference 2017   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/11/23/annual-conference-delivers-insights-on-future-of-cyber-defence
EDA_NEWS_0229	2017-11-23	NEWS	Estonian President Kaljulaid: EU needs shared cyber expertises and joint exercise at strategic level	" In her keynote speech delivered at the EDA's Annual Conference 2017, Kersti Kaljulaid, the President of Estonia, urged EU Member States to step up cybersecurity awareness building, including in the military domain, “by learning from each other and sharing best practices”. The Estonian EU Presidency led by example last September when, in cooperation with the European Defence Agency, it organised ‘EU CYBRID 2017’, a strategic table-top cyber defence exercise which for the first time ever involved EU defence ministers, the European External Action Service (EEAS), the European Commission, cyber-related EU agencies as well as NATO’s Secretary General. “Among many other valuable lessons, EU CYBRID 2017 showed that although political decision makers would in case of a cyberattack be the first to react and make decisions, their understanding, knowledge and awareness of the nature of cyber incidents still leaves much to be desired”, the President said. “This shows that exercises like EU CYBRID 2017 have to be conducted regularly both on the Member State and EU level”, Mrs Kaljulaid added. Since the cyber domain evolves constantly, joint cyber exercises need to involve the higher political (ministerial) level because some aspects of cyber defence are “politically sensitive”, such as the attribution of attacks. “A technical point at first glance, but a political decision at the end of the day” which also impacts the choice between offensive and defensive responses. While there is no doubt that these questions are for Member States to decide, “they need not only to be discussed but also exercised at strategic level”, she said. “EDA has to continue with its successful projects” The Estonian President welcomed last Monday’s EU Council conclusions on cyber which, along with the European Commission’s cyber package, should give “new impetus to cyber security issues for the years to come”. In this context the EDA, too, has an important role to play: “I do believe strongly that in this situation the European Defence Agency should continue with the successful projects it has conducted so far and which complement the projects of the Commission without unnecessary duplication. For example, I believe that EDA should concentrate its efforts on education, training and strategic level exercises, because those are the fields – whether we like it or not – where the Member States have probably the biggest shortfalls and at the same time willingness to do more cooperation at the European level”. ""We must also think about how the EDA’s cyber activities would contribute to the European Defence Industrial Development Programme and the Permanent Structured Cooperation, and vice versa”, Mrs Kaljulaid added.

EDA_NEWS_0230	2017-11-20	NEWS	EDA helps improve joint helicopter mission planning	 The European Defence Agency’s second Helicopter Composite Air Operations (COMAO) planning course was successfully completed last week at RAF airbase Linton-on-Ouse, United Kingdom. The course is part of the EDA’s multifaceted helicopter training activities which aim to provide Member States with a framework to develop, consolidate and share best practices in order to meet the challenges of flying helicopters in a modern operational environment. Sixteen trainees from Belgium, Sweden, Germany, Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and the UK took part in the second COMAO course, the objective of which was to increase interoperability and the common understanding of complex mission planning in a multinational environment. The course involved support and attack helicopters but also fast-jet, intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR) as well as air transport and ground force units.The course started with a theoretical part, including detailed briefs on COMAO, 4Ts (Task, Target, Threat and Tactics) mission planning as well as standard rotary tactics employed to counter a range of different threats. Participants also examined the Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) of the attack helicopters and fast-jet capabilities in both the Blue and Red Air role delivered by 100 Sqn RAF. The second part of the course was devoted to the practical mission planning for a multinational joint helicopter force (and its support assets) which had to operate in a given and constantly evolving political and military scenario. As the course went by and the complexity of the missions increased, trainees became increasingly familiar with the planning processes and the crews’ performances improved considerably, even under worsening mission conditions and mounting time pressure. The course level was gradually elevated to a point where the individual trainees had to prepare their missions on their own. The findings of the lessons learnt session which concluded the course will be used for preparing the next EDA COMAO planning course scheduled for 2018.  More information: Helicopter Initiatives (EDA project page) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/11/20/eda-helps-improve-joint-helicopter-mission-planning

EDA_NEWS_0232	2017-11-10	NEWS	EDA provides expert input for action plan on military mobility	 Military movement and transport received an important boost today through the Joint Communication of the European Commission and the High Representative on Improving Military Mobility in the European Union. The Joint Communication identifies areas in which the EU will work to facilitate and help expedite military mobility. The European Defence Agency (EDA) set up a dedicated Ad Hoc Working Group in September to support the elaboration of a follow-on Action Plan on Military Mobility by spring 2018.The Joint Communication adopted today outlines steps to be taken to address the obstacles that hamper movement of military equipment and personnel across the EU with the aim of facilitating and expediting their mobility.“Defence forces depend on the ability to move quickly. Physical, legal and regulatory barriers can lead to delays, disruptions, higher costs and vulnerability. Successful EDA projects such as the EU Multimodal Transport Hub and the Diplomatic Clearances initiative for military air transport demonstrate the advantages of a coordinated European approach to military movement. However, these are patchwork solutions. What is missing is a consistent approach allowing military personnel and equipment to cross borders swiftly and smoothly. The EDA’s existing expertise in this domain provides the best platform for the EU and the Member States to build a comprehensive action plan promoting civil/military synergies”, said Jorge Domecq, EDA Chief Executive. Tasked by the Member States, the European Defence Agency recently put in place an expert-level Ad Hoc Working Group to address the persistent shortfalls and promote better coordination and enhanced synergies among all stakeholders. The objectives of the working group are to identify obstacles and barriers to cross-border movement and surface transit of military personnel and assets, to map existing initiatives and shortfalls, identify relevant actors at EU and national level and to develop an action plan with dedicated tasks and responsibilities including a roadmap with timelines. Among the principles to be followed are avoidance of duplication and inclusiveness in order to address all relevant stakeholders. The expert group will deliver its report in spring 2018, based on which the High Representative and the European Commission will build an Action Plan on Military Mobility. Existing projectsThe EDA currently runs two projects which are dedicated to removing regulatory, legal or procedural obstacles to military movement of troops and airlift capabilities:In 2014 fourteen Member States decided to launch a dedicated project within the European Defence Agency dedicated to an EU Multimodal Transport Hub. Those Member States have identified the need to better coordinate military movement. A Multimodal Hub Transport (M2TH) network is being developed in order to facilitate the fast movement of troops, through harmonised regulations, procedures and process as well as pooling and sharing of assets and infrastructure in Europe.  Core to this project is the central coordination of movement, identifying a physical network of locations and identifying services to be provided. Execution uses simplified and harmonised procedures within the boundaries of EU legislation and national laws. Other Member States have shown interest in joining this project. The aim of EDA’s Diplomatic Clearances Technical Arrangement is to harmonise procedures for overflights and landings of EU nations’ military registered or operated transport aircraft. The arrangement enables the 16 signatory Member States to operate without the need to submit diplomatic requests for each flight, with an annual diplomatic clearance number issued. This common mechanism increases efficiency and effectiveness of European airlift, giving more flexibility during mission preparation and mission execution. Furthermore it saves Member States’ human and financial resources with a significantly reduced number of required requests and notifications. A dedicated online portal provides basic transparency on national policies and procedures for granting diplomatic clearances for military transport aircraft.  More informationJoint Communication to the European Parliament and the Council on military mobility in the European Union EDA project on Multimodal Transport HubsEDA project on Diplomatic Clearances Technical Arrangement	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/11/10/eda-provides-expert-input-for-action-plan-on-military-mobility
EDA_NEWS_0233	2017-11-13	NEWS	Outcome of EDA Ministerial Steering Board	 The European Defence Agency’s (EDA) ministerial Steering Board met this Monday afternoon under the chairmanship of the Head of the Agency, Federica Mogherini. Defence ministers adopted the Agency’s 2018 budget, approved its 2018-2020 work programme and endorsed the EDA’s role and next steps in the field of cyber defence and in support of Military Mobility in Europe. 2018 budget Ministers approved the EDA’s general budget for 2018 set at €32.5 million (a 5% increase on the 2017 general budget), reflecting the increasing demands on the Agency, including as part of the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD), its activities as the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) secretariat and in preparation for the European Defence Fund (EDF). Jorge Domecq, the EDA’s Chief Executive, stated: “Today’s budget increase is a clear and unanimous recognition of the growing tasks and responsibilities given to the Agency by the Member States after the recent Long Term Review (LTR). Our work on CARD, PESCO, and the EDF will further focus our work on tackling capability gaps and we will make sure the additional funding serves our Member States’ attainment of their Level of Ambition”. With the expected increase of EDA’s activities, the Agency has been tasked to assess the long-term resource implications by spring 2018, including if and to what extent the EU budget should cover the Agency’s administrative and operational expenditure. 2018-2020 work programme Minister approved the EDA’s Three-Year Planning Framework (2018-2020), whose priorities for the year ahead include: identification and prioritisation of cooperation opportunities: revision of the Capability Development Plan (CDP) by spring, conduct of the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD) trial run and presentation of first CARD report to Ministers in autumn, finalisation of the first fully-fledged Overarching Strategic Research Agenda in June; support to implementation of PESCO: project identification, preparation, consolidation and management support, and annual assessment of participating Member States' capability commitments; preparations for the Capability Window of the European Defence Fund: the EDA is expected to play a key upstream and downstream role in supporting Member States including in the uptake of technologies; conclusion of the Pilot Project and pursuit of the Preparatory Action on Defence Research (PADR), as well as the preparation for the future European Defence Research Programme (EDRP). Military Mobility in Europe The Steering Board welcomed the EDA’s role in support of Military Mobility within the EU, to facilitate and expedite military mobility across its territory. Ministers called on the Agency to present a detailed action plan by spring 2018, in close cooperation with the EUMC, EEAS, the Commission and all relevant stakeholders. These efforts should be coherent with the respective NATO initiatives in this area. In September, the EDA set up a dedicated ad hoc working group on military mobility to address the persistent shortfalls and promote better coordination and enhanced synergies among all stakeholders. The expert group will deliver its report in spring 2018, based on which the High Representative and the Commission will build an Action Plan on Military Mobility, as foreseen in the Joint Communication of 10 November. Cyber defence Ministers welcomed the EDA’s achievements on cyber defence capability development and invited it to develop and submit proposals to Member States on the establishment of a Cyber Defence Training and Education platform, in coordination with EEAS and the European Security and Defence College (ESDC) and with the support of the Commission. Engagement with Third Parties Ministers also endorsed the principles guiding EDA’s future engagement with Third Parties, notably that it must support the objectives of the CSDP (as its stands today and develops in the future) and that the arrangement has to support participating Member States’ interest as regards capability development across the full lifecycle. EDA press contacts: Head of Media & Communications Pauline Massart T+32 2 504 28 23 Media & Communications Officer Elisabeth Schoeffmann T+32 2 504 28 42   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/11/13/outcome-of-eda-ministerial-steering-board

EDA_NEWS_0235	2017-10-24	NEWS	50th EDA Helicopter Tactics Course (HTC) completed	 The 50th EDA Helicopter Tactics Course (HTC), which ran over three weeks at UK Royal Air Force base Linton-on-Ouse, was successfully completed on 13 October 2017.The HTC programme started in 2009 as an ‘Interim Synthetic Helicopters Tactics Course’ and ran until 2012 when it was transformed into an EDA ‘Category B ad hoc project’. Since 2009, a total of 641 crewmembers from 16 different European countries have graduated from the HTC course. This is a considerable accomplishment for a programme that was initially set up to enhance the preparation and operational capability of crews to be deployed to Afghanistan, but which then evolved into a much broader multinational helicopter tactics training course. It delivers advanced helicopter tactics training under EDA’s Pooling & Sharing initiative with the aim to enhance the European helicopter operational capability for crisis management and to improve the interoperability of Member States’ helicopter crews. HTC courses cover the entire crew spectrum (pilots, loadmasters, door gunners etc.) and deal with typical ground and air threats as well as the tactics that can be employed to mitigate them. An HTC course is typically divided into two phases: the first week being devoted to theoretical training, and two additional weeks focusing on simulator-based training. Standardisation and interoperability are improved by the use of EDA Helicopter Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). In addition, participation in HTC courses provides helicopter crews with the opportunity to develop an international helicopter network which can prove quite valuable in envisaging future cooperation opportunities. Best practices and lessons learned are regularly integrated into the course syllabus to ensure it remains up to date and of highest quality. Seven EDA Member States are currently participating in the HTC programme: Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Finland, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Other nations are contemplating a future adhesion to the programme.  More information:EDA helicopter initiatives	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/10/24/50th-eda-helicopter-tactics-course-(htc)-completed

Organized under the European Defence Agency’s (EDA) Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP), it will allow European helicopter crews to discuss and share experience in helicopter techniques, tactics and procedures. Helicopter tactics instructors and experts from several European countries, as well as representatives of the Helicopter Tactics Course (HTC), the Helicopter Tactics Instructor Course (HTIC) and the Joint Air Power Competence Centre (JAPCC) will gather at this annual HEP event to exchange views, update best practices and learn about the new training possibilities available in the different HEP countries.The first day, focused on ‘training’, will start with an explanation of the EDA helicopter programmes and a review of the Belgian Black Blade 16 and the Hungarian Fire Blade 17 exercises. Also on the agenda are a presentation of the Dutch helicopter aviation training system and a tour through the Gate 2 simulation facilities. On the second day, focused on ‘operations’, briefings and discussions will cover the latest tactical lessons learned from the helicopter operations in Libya, UK Urban Operations, Slovenian MEDEVAC operations, Czech helicopter door gunner pre deployment training, German introduction of Special Operation Forces helicopters and the procurement of heavy transport helicopters by Germany. On the third day, panel discussions, divided between attack and support helicopter operators, will be organised on the latest developments in training, techniques, tactics and procedures. This will also give the opportunity to European helicopters crewmembers to exchange views and discuss about simulation versus live flying. Based on the panel discussions’ outcome, new proposals to update the HEP Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), the capstone tactics manual for multinational helicopter operations, will be submitted. Furthermore, briefings on the updates of the HEP SOP, the HEP, the HTC, the HTIC programmes and the ATP-49 will be given. The objectives of the upcoming HEP exercises will also be presented in detail, including Hot Blade 2018 (in Portugal), with the focus on helicopter COMAO missions in Hot, High and Dusty conditions with trooping, live firing and MEDEVAC flights. This Symposium will be opened by Commodore Polet (Commander Defence Helicopter Command at Gilze-Rijen airbase) at the Gate 2 location in Rijen, where the participants will enjoy the atmosphere of a beautiful and effective simulation and symposium location. At the end of each day, the Netherlands, as hosting nation, will organise a visit to Gilze-Rijen airbase (Traditions Room and an operational helicopter squadron), a traditional Dutch diner and a guided tour of the Royal Military Academy.The multinational dimension of the HEP is key to enhancing European helicopter capabilities and the Helicopter Tactics Symposium contributes to that by offering a platform for in-depth discussions and exchanges of tactical experience.

EDA_NEWS_0238	2017-10-20	NEWS	New opportunities in sustainable energy for defence sector	 The European Defence Agency (EDA) and the European Commission today launched the second phase of the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector. The Consultation Forum aims to examine how energy efficiency measures, renewable energy sources and technologies, and protection of critical energy infrastructure considerations apply to the European defence sector. This second phase will see the initiative move towards the identification of bottlenecks preventing the sector from fully benefiting from sustainable energy. This will help the work move towards more concrete implementation, in view of seizing the economic benefits presented by the transition to clean energy. “The second phase of the Consultation Forum presents the defence sector with a fresh opportunity to collaborate with the European Commission on energy efficiency, renewable energy, and the protection of critical energy infrastructure. Energy security is a key priority for European armed forces, and by acting together, we can improve the resilience of military activities at home and on missions, as well as reduce cost and operational risks, while contributing to the broader objectives of the Energy Union. We must now capitalize on this initiative and deliver real benefits through the initiation of defence energy projects”, said EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq. “All strands of our energy policy, whether it is energy efficiency or renewables, security of supply or interconnections, have an impact on European defence. While energy efficiency and renewable energy policies were almost not known in the defence and security sector, the Consultation Forum has been key in changing the approach and revealing the significant potential. I am therefore very pleased that the Consultation Forum is entering its second phase which will enable us to explore further how this initiative could be both turned into concrete improvements in the ways which the defence and security sector uses energy and transformed into a real economic opportunity”, Dominique Ristori, Director-General Energy, said. The first phase of the work brought together a majority of Member States’ Ministries of Defence alongside NATO, the NATO Energy Security Centre of Excellence, industry and academia, and led to the creation of a European Defence Energy Network (EDEN) with over 100 members. Plenary meetings of the Consultation Forum were held in Brussels (January 2016), Dublin (June 2016), Rome (November 2016), Lisbon (May 2017), and Thessaloniki (September 2017), looking at the challenges and opportunities of moving to a sustainable energy future in the defence sector, including the implications of relevant EU energy legislation for defence.   The second phase of the Consultation Forum will focus on the identification of bottlenecks preventing the sector from fully reaping the benefits of sustainable energy. The aim is to work towards more concrete implementation, and to identify the tools and opportunities that will transform the knowledge developed to date into tangible defence sector energy projects. Work will be conducted by three parallel working groups covering: (1) Energy Efficiency including Energy Management (2), Renewable Energy Sources, and (3) Protection of Critical Energy Infrastructure (PCEI), with finance as a cross-cutting theme. This initiative is a Coordination and Support Action which received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant Agreement No 789231.Further information can be found on EDA's European Defence Energy Network (EDEN) webpage. Background  The Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector is a European Commission initiative managed by the EDA, the first initiative of its kind for these institutions. It brings together experts from the defence and energy sectors to share information and best practices on improving energy management, energy efficiency, and the use of renewable energy. The first phase of the Consultation Forum was announced on 20 October 2015 for a period of 24 months. The work was carried out in three parallel working groups: (1) Energy Management, (2) Energy Efficiency, and (3) Renewable Energy Sources. An Experts Group on Protection of Critical Energy Infrastructure (PCEI) developed a PCEI Conceptual Paper.   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/10/20/new-opportunities-in-sustainable-energy-for-defence-sector
EDA_NEWS_0239	2017-10-19	NEWS	3D-printing community explores applications for defence	 The EDA conference and exhibition “Exploring Additive Manufacturing Impact in Defence Capabilities” successfully demonstrated the many possible applications additive manufacturing technologies (also known as 3D-printing) can bring to the defence sector. Around 200 representatives from government institutions, industry, academia as well as research and technology centres participated in this unique forum which was held in Gijón (Spain) on 12 September 2017. The event was structured in three different activities (conference sessions, exhibition and technical visit) with the aim of raising military awareness of additive manufacturing (AM) technologies and their potential to improve military operations, logistic support or maintenance of platforms. The conference session was opened by Mr. Rini Goos, Deputy Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency, who highlighted “3D-printing can become a game changer for defence. It allows for easy customisation of small series and opens the possibility to manufacture even very complex parts - on site and on demand. This is especially important for military operations and their logistic support”. The talks were focused on three central themes: additive manufacturing expectations from EDA and the European Commission, current 3D-printing experiences of the European Ministries of Defence and industry developments in the AM field from companies specialised in the defence sector. The results of the EDA AM project were also presented, highlighting the Agency’s capacity to supporting a capability from R&T to development. A main conclusion of the conference is that in spite of the fact that some organisations have already earned significant experience on AM, non-technical factors (IPR, training, standardisation and certification, health and safety, etc.) currently still impose limitations for AM implementation in defence. As reinforced during the exhibition, only with the inputs provided by all the attendees and via the EDA consultation to identify impact of 3D-printing technologies in defence all these factors will be identified, and the way ahead towards the full implementation of AM in defence could be depicted. Attendees also had access to an exhibition area where 3D-printed prototypes and real parts were on display. The EDA’s deployable AM facility was on display as well. Industry, academia and research centres from eight different European countries participated as exhibitors. Finally, a visit to PRODINTEC advance manufacturing centre’s facilities (contractor at the EDA AM project) was performed. There, attendees had the opportunity to see AM equipment in operation and its possible applications in several sectors from defence to health, aerospace or construction. Background The conference and exhibition were part of EDA’s “Additive Manufacturing Feasibility Study & Technology Demonstration” project which is expected to be finalised in December 2017. The project, initiated in the framework of the CapTech Materials & Structures within the EDA Research & Technology domain, is composed of three work strands: (i) a desktop study to place additive manufacturing and its potential in a defence context, (ii) a technology demonstration of the feasibility of deploying these technologies in support of a military operation, (iii) an exhibition to senior military staff concluded in the event celebrated at Gijón last 12th September.  Further information on 3D-printing at EDASee the videos of the EDA AM Exhibition and EDA AM Facility deploymentAlbum of the Exhibition and of the AM Facility deploymentEvent web - Exploring Additive Manufacturing impact in Defence capabilitiesSuccessful test flight for EDA 3D-printing lab during deployment at EAATTC 17-3 Defence experts meet to discuss implications of Additive Manufacturing 16.ESI.OP.144 — Additive manufacturing feasibility study and technology demonstration 3D printing: EDA launches new project to test feasibility in the defence field Latest EAATTC 2017-1 EDA AM Project Fact sheet and EDA AM Facility Deployment Leaflet 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/10/19/3d-printing-community-explores-applications-for-defence
EDA_NEWS_0240	2017-10-18	NEWS	First fully fledged defence project gets ESIF funding	 For the first time, a fully fledged defence research project - initiated by the Croatian Ministry of Defence and supported by the European Defence Agency (EDA) - has been awarded EU co-funding under the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). So far only ‘dual-use’ projects with both civilian and military applications had been able to secure ESIF funding. The granting of ESIF funding to this Croatian project, which aims at developing a cyber conflict simulator, represents a landmark in EDA’s year-long efforts to open up EU funding opportunities for pure defence research projects, in addition to dual-use projects. The news was welcomed by EDA’s Chief Executive, Jorge Domecq: “The fact that ESIF funding is now also accessible to genuine defence projects is an important signal that should help strengthen the European defence industrial base. The Agency will continue to exploit the benefits of wider EU policies for defence stakeholders and facilitate their access to EU funding possibilities”. The cyber conflict simulator set to be developed under the Croatian project is meant to be fit-for-purpose and usable by MoDs straightaway, including in European and international military exercises. It will allow for multiple groups in different roles to collaborate or compete within a defined cyber space, in order to address potential cybernetic attacks. It will also enable the definition of a cyber terrain consisting of different objects, connections, threats, controls, which will be defined by a set of properties and functions connected in a variety of ways. The project implementation is led by a Croatian small and medium enterprise. ESIF will fund 80% of the total project eligible costs. The EDA is now looking forward to its Member States’ defence stakeholders applying further defence projects to ESIF. To facilitate interested stakeholders and provide them with best possible information, the Agency has set up an ‘ESIF web-platform’ as well as an ‘ESIF Success Stories’ webpage.

EDA_NEWS_0242	2017-10-12	NEWS	EDA workshop helps defence clusters access EU funding	 On 10 October, the European Defence Agency (EDA) held a workshop and networking event aimed at facilitating transnational cluster partnerships among European defence stakeholders (industry, research organisations, academia, etc.). The aim was to help interested parties benefit from EU funding opportunities and participate in relevant calls for proposals, in particular the ongoing COSME-funded call for proposals for defence-related clusters.This the second time that the EDA organized such a workshop this year. The events were attended by 20 defence-related clusters from 13 EU Member States, representing over 1,000 defence stakeholders (SMEs and larger enterprises, academia, research and technology organisations, etc.). During both workshops, European Commission representatives presented their activities in defence-related domains while EDA’s experts brought forward Agency’s recent work on R&T+I prioritisation, the Preparatory Action on Defence Research (PADR), industry engagement and the wide spectrum of EU programmes able to fund Key Strategic Activities (KSA) and EDA’s Overarching Strategic Research Agenda priorities. Some 30 cluster-to-cluster (C2C) meetings took place during the two EDA workshops, either building new partnerships or enhancing existing ones, a practical example of the EDA’s role as an interface between Member States’ Defence ministries and industry, on the one hand, and the European Commission and other EU institutions, on the other.  Testimonials from participants:  Eduards Filippovs (Coordinator for International Relations of Cluster of Security and Defence of Latvia): “EDA is fulfilling a very important mission: bringing together public officials, industry and professional by encouraging to make new partnerships and cooperation, as well use of new instruments we have never had before in the defence sector”. Eugenio Fontán (General Manager of Madrid Aerospace Cluster): “EDA is developing a set of concrete actions to implement the political strategy of Innovation in Defence”. Klaus Bolving (CEO, Center for Defence, Space & Security, DK): ”The workshop provided participants with high-value information on new business and investment opportunities within the dual-use and defence areas in a very comprehensive and clear way. Moreover, the much appreciated C2C session led to new opportunities, which look promising with regard to closer collaboration between the European defence-related clusters. I look forward to following EDA and the European Commission’s continued work on facilitating European growth, jobs and capabilities for the benefit of a greater and more secure Europe”. Tomas Žalandauskas (Director of the Baltic Institute of Advanced Technology and Vice-president of NGPA, clustering national defence industry in Lithuania): “It is hard to overestimate the value of direct contacts in such a conservative field like defense industry. We are grateful for EDA for excellent opportunity to find future partners and relevant information on funding possibilities for Europe wide initiatives”. Ziga Valic (Head of European & International Affairs at the French Cluster Optitec): “EDA workshop for defence-related clusters is a welcome initiative offering a thorough overview of funding opportunities on European level and an excellent transnational networking opportunity benefiting clusters from all over the Europe. We hope this event will be organised on annual basis as it is a real value-added”.  More information and useful links:  Access to EU funding (EDA project page)COSME web-PlatformESIF web-platformEDA’s ESIF success storiesEDA’s industry info 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/10/12/eda-workshop-helps-defence-clusters-access-eu-funding
EDA_NEWS_0243	2017-10-09	NEWS	24 proposals received, some 190 entities bid for 2017 Preparatory Action calls	 The European Defence Agency (EDA) has received 24 submissions with consortia including around 190 entities (with some applying to various calls in different consortia) in response to the three Calls for Proposals for the Preparatory Action on Defence Research (PADR). The objective of this year’s calls is to award grant agreements for a value of some €22 million from the Preparatory Action’s 2017 budget and to exercise options of up to an additional €20 million next year, to be funded under the 2018 budget, once available. “The high interest in the Preparatory Action on Defence Research was obvious from the Information Day and Brokerage Event, conducted by the EDA and the European Commission in June 2017, with over 400 participants. What is noteworthy, besides the number of submissions itself, is the incredible amount of entities - research institutes, small and mediums size enterprises and prime companies - which have bid for the various calls. This reflects the urgent need for more defence research funding, cross-border collaboration and harmonisation in Europe. With the  PADR, we are on the right path to a more comprehensive European Defence Research Programme after 2020”, commented Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency.Research in defence-related technologies is critical for the development of the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base and to strengthen EU Member States’ strategic autonomy. The European Commission launched the Preparatory Action on Defence Research (PADR) on 11 April 2017. The foreseen budget is €90 million over three years. The aim of the PA is to test and lay the groundwork for a possible European Defence Research Programme in the next Multiannual Financial Framework after 2020. The EDA and the European Commission signed a Delegation Agreement on 31 May 2017, by which EDA became the PADR’s implementing agency. The EDA published the first three Calls for Proposals on 7 June 2017. The deadlines to respond were 28 September 2017 for the 'research in technology and products in the context of Force Protection and Soldier Systems' and 'strategic technology foresight' topics, and 5 October 2017 for the 'technological demonstrator for enhanced situational awareness in a naval environment' topic.The EDA will now conduct evaluations with the support of independent subject matter experts. The evaluation and scrutiny process will last until December 2017. The EDA expects to sign the various grants with the beneficiaries towards the end of 2017 and early 2018.Based on the budgets for 2018 and 2019, additional Calls for Proposals and Information Days are in preparation.Before the PADR, a Pilot Project (PP) was introduced in the EU budget in 2015 and 2016, adopted by the European Council and the European Parliament, on the basis of an initiative by the latter, and with the EDA as implementing agency. With a budget of €1.4 million, the three projects of the PP are well under way. More information:2017 calls for proposals published for PA on Defence Research (June 2017)Preparatory Action - EDA Project Page PA factsheetResearch and Innovation Participant Portal (Pilot Projects & Preparatory Actions) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/10/09/24-proposals-received-some-190-entities-bid-for-2017-preparatory-action-calls
EDA_NEWS_0244	2017-10-11	NEWS	Annual Military Airworthiness Conference opens in Athens	 Hosted by the Hellenic Air Force, the Annual Military Airworthiness Conference was opened in Athens this Wednesday by Roland van Reybroeck, EDA Director Cooperation Planning & Support, followed by a keynote speech from Lieutenant General Christoforos Smyrlis, Inspector General of the Hellenic Air Force.The two-day event (11th and 12th October) brings together key stakeholders from national aviation and airworthiness authorities, European agencies, international organisations and industry, for presentations and discussions on a variety of topics related to the harmonization of military airworthiness requirements, their  implementation and further evolution as a critical enabler for deeper defence cooperation.In his speech, Mr Van Reybroeck recalled that the excellent work performed in the context of the Military Airworthiness Authorities (MAWA) Forum delivered “a full and mature set of European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) that is now available to Member States”. Their progressive implementation and the mutual recognition of National Military Airworthiness Authorities “is key in paving the way for more and deeper cooperation”, he said.  He emphasized that “The next harmonisation phase should now focus on further evolution of the regulatory and oversight framework”. Referring to the longer term perspective, he stated: “Once a harmonised European Military Airworthiness System will have been fully developed and sufficient confidence is gained from its implementation, steps could be taken towards the formation of a European Military Joint Airworthiness Authorities Organisation (EMJAAO)” as envisaged by Ministers of Defence in 2008, emphasising that this would in no way whatsoever  be a supranational authority. Mr Van Reybroeck reiterated that the European Defence Agency remains committed to facilitate the ongoing work and cooperation, and to coordinate the military views of the participating Member States including through the organisation of supporting events such as this Military Airworthiness Conference. Further EvolutionThe MAWA community will continue to harmonise views and approaches to overcome fragmentation. Thus, further development and maintenance of harmonized military airworthiness requirements and supporting documents will remain a key objective of the MAWA community. At the same time, harmonization of processes and procedures to support recognition and increase efficiency in oversight will unlock further benefits for industry and national authorities alike. Emerging topics such as RPAS airworthiness requirements and safety management will set the scene for future activities and must be appropriately addressed in a joint and coordinated manner, in close coordination with relevant civil and military stakeholders. More information:EDA project page on European Military Airworthiness Authorities Forum (MAWA)	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/10/11/annual-military-airworthiness-conference-opens-in-athens

EDA_NEWS_0246	2017-10-05	NEWS	EDA ensures EU funding for circular economy in defence	 EDA’s efforts to support Member States gaining access to European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) for defence-related research projects continue to bear fruit: a project put forward by the Hellenic Ministry of Defence and aimed at developing a transferable Autonomous Composting Unit (ACU) for organic wastes to be used in military missions has just been granted ESIF funding. For the first time, an EDA-supported project funded by ESIF is directly related to introducing the ‘circular economy’ concept into the military - a new endeavor actively supported by the EDA. Deployed troops (missions, operations) traditionally generate high volumes of waste which can cause significant ecological and even health-related issues. The ACU project in question intends to alleviate this problem by developing a self-sustained waste treatment capability, which uses innovative energy and environmental technologies while still meeting military requirements. The project is led by a Greek SME. Its budget is € 1 282 000 of which about 50% will be financed through ESIF co-funding.  Successful EDA supportSo far, already six EDA-supported R&T projects have been granted ESIF co-funding for a total amount of € 8.5 million (average co-funding rate: 66% of total project costs). All those projects are listed on our new special ‘ESIF success stories’ page where defence stakeholders willing to apply for ESIF funding can find best practices and useful information.  More information Contact EDAESIF success stories in defenceEDA’s summary table on EU funding opportunities for defence-related stakeholdersEDA’s “ESIF web-platform”EDA’s work supporting access to EU funding EDA’s work on “circular economy” in defence EDA’s work on energy for defence	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/10/05/eda-ensures-eu-funding-for-circular-economy-in-defence
EDA_NEWS_0247	2017-10-05	NEWS	Critical energy infrastructure in defence: Successful Completion of Phase 1 Experts Group work	 On 5/6 October, the Protection of Critical Energy Infrastructure (PCEI) expert group - set up under the European Commission’s Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector (CF SEDSS) - met at the European Defence Agency (EDA) to deliver the “PCEI Conceptual Paper: Focus on European Union Defence”. This step concludes the first phase of the expert group’s work. It should assist Member States to build consensus on how to enhance best the protection and resilience of defence related Critical Energy Infrastructures. To address the risks, vulnerabilities, capability and research shortfalls of defence related Critical Energy Infrastructures (CEI), the PCEI expert group was set up in May 2016. It’s primary task was to assess how the defence sector can apply existing EU CEI legislation to enhance the protection of defence-related CEI and improve its resilience throughout Europe. For that purpose, the group developed an EU-wide defence focused ‘PCEI Conceptual Paper’. The chairman of the group, Colonel Georgios Drosos from the Hellenic MOD, explains that “this Paper is intended to lead to a collaborative civilian-military approach which supports EU Member States in the identification of best practices and tools which will strengthen further the resilience of defence related CEI from any failures, risks or threats, including terrorism, cyber-attacks, migration flow stress, climate change, and natural hazards”. Martin Konertz, EDA’s Capability Armaments and Technology (CAT) Director, considers that “this PCEI Conceptual Paper will provide an important building block for increased CEI resilience in the EU as it should inform a related EU policy or guidelines and assist Member States to initiate projects of common interest with the support of the EU”. Deliverables Besides the Conceptual Paper, the PCEI expert group also produced a factsheet designed to increase collaboration, awareness and visibility. Both documents will be submitted in mid-October to the European Commission’s DG Energy for final approval. Denis Roger, EDA’s European Synergies and Innovation (ESI) Director, stated: “In order to move beyond the conceptual phase and towards a broader consensus, we will need to foster a common PCEI culture within the EU defence sector and even beyond that, in wider society. In this way, we can contribute to securing a sustainable energy supply chain for both fixed infrastructures and for CSDP operations”. Background The work of the PCEI expert group is led by the Ministries of Defence of Cyprus and Greece, supported by their respective national academia and research centres (Centre for Research & Technology Hellas – CERTH, Cyprus University of Technology, European University Cyprus, KIOS Research and Innovation Center of Excellence - University of Cyprus, National Technical University of Athens - NTUA). The Commission’s DG Energy and Joint Research Centre as well as the NATO Energy Security Centre of Excellence (ENSEC COE) also support the work of the PCEI expert group. At this stage, six EDA Member States (Bulgaria, Estonia, France, Ireland, Greece and Cyprus) are participating in the group. It is supported within the Agency at an inter-directorate level (CAT and ESI) by CAT Project Officer Protect, Dr Constantinos Hadjisavvas, and ESI Project Officer Energy and Environment Systems, Richard Brewin. More information : Experts group looks into protection of critical energy infrastructures for defence (webnews, October 2016)Phase 1 of Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in Defence completed (webnews, September 2017)	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/10/05/critical-energy-infrastructure-in-defence-successful-completion-of-phase-1-experts-group-work

EDA_NEWS_0249	2017-10-02	NEWS	EDA Member States adopt Common Position on Ammunition Classification under REACH	 To build a common understanding of the REACH regulatory provisions and facilitate the exchange of best practices in the field of Ammunition Classification, EDA Member States adopted on 22 September a Common Position on Ammunition Classification under REACH. The Common Position is based on the outcome of the Agency’s work conducted in this field since 2014, with the support of Member States’ REACH and ammunition experts at technical level, and on the basis of a continuous exchange with the European Commission, the European Chemicals Agency and EU defence industry. The adoption of the Common Position constitutes an important milestone as it will significantly contribute to: reducing the risk of misinterpretation of, and enhancing compliance to, the REACH Regulation´s provisions on substances/mixtures or articles;supporting the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) in its efforts to raise awareness on issues pertaining to ammunition classification under REACH; and minimising the possibility of potential incorrect classification of ammunition along the REACH Regulation´s provisions on substances/mixtures or articles, and related potential negative impact on the operational effectiveness of Member States’ Armed Forces.The Common Position reflects EDA participating Member States’ (pMS) position/views on the classification of ammunition categories and types under REACH. It also states that ”Views reflected are for reference only and are not in any way legally binding for those obligated by REACH, the Member States, or other REACH stakeholders. Usage of the information contained in the document remains under the sole responsibility of the users, including ensuring that any conclusions drawn on the basis of the information are compliant with REACH or any other applicable national and EU legislation. The EDA and its pMS adopting this document, will not be held liable or bear any responsibility in this regard.”  The EDA has disseminated the Common Position as widely as possible to relevant stakeholders, including the Commission, ECHA and EU defence industry, and intends to assess potential feedback/comments, as basis for future improvement of the document.  More information: EDA Member States Common Position on Ammunition Classification under REACH - full text as adopted EDA REACH ActivitiesCapTech Ammunition Technologies (EDA project page)	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/10/02/eda-member-states-adopt-common-position-on-ammunition-classification-under-reach
EDA_NEWS_0250	2017-09-29	NEWS	Guided Ammunition Abort System demonstrator successfully completed	 The European Defence Agency’s ‘Mission Abort System for Guided Ammunition’ (MAS) project, launched late 2013, has successfully demonstrated a generic system to cancel the flight of gun launched precision ammunition, when the projectile exits the pre-defined safety corridor. The project, sponsored by both the German and Italian MoDs in the frame of EDA’s Capability Technology (CapTech) Ammunition Technologies group, addresses the challenge that affects most European shooting ranges: they are too narrow and too short to adhere to the necessary safety areas for shooting tests with guided ammunition. So as to enable European shooting ranges to perform this test firing, a generic mission abort system was designed and demonstrated. In the event of a deviation from the predefined flight path, the system will break down the projectile into two parts and these parts will not leave the surface danger area. The project progressed through several phases from concept through to overall design, more detailed designs, construction, integration, and design verification tests.The aerodynamic analysis, safety area calculations, and reliability analysis were also undertaken. The final test consisted of firing of two MAS demonstrators with the Howitzer PzH2000 and was conducted at Meppen Proving Ground (WTD91) in Germany in the third quarter of 2016. The feasibility of mission abort systems for guided ammunition was successfully proven. This represents an important step towards the utilisation of European test ranges in the performance of guided ammunition tests. Possible miniaturisation of electronic components could facilitate the integration of MAS into rounds with calibres smaller than 70 mm. Another possibility might be the implementation of MAS into operational ammunition. The demonstrator was developed by Diehl BGT Defence and Finmeccanica and the test projectile used was the Vulcano 155mm (subcaliber 92 mm).

EDA_NEWS_0251	2017-09-25	NEWS	Phase 1 of Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in Defence completed	 The fifth and last meeting of the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector (CF SEDSS) was held in Thessaloniki on 19-21 September 2017.The conference was opened by His Excellency Panos Kammenos (Hellenic Minister of National Defence), Mr Jorge Domecq (Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency, EDA), Mr Tudor Constantinescu (Principal Adviser to the Director-General Energy of the European Commission) and Professor Athansios Konstandopoulos, the Chairman of Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH). Mr Dominique Ristori, the Director-General of the Directorate-General Energy of the European Commission, greeted the participants by video message. It was closed by Mr Denis Roger, the European Synergies and Innovation Director at the EDA. Opening the conference, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq thanked the participants for the active involvement in the Forum over the last two years. He also used the opportunity to give direction for the future: “As we move to the next phase of the Consultation Forum, we need to focus on defence energy projects and their funding. We need to focus on results.” As possible project areas, Mr Domecq highlighted infrastructure improvements leading for example to the refurbishment of buildings to Nearly Zero Energy Building standards. Projects relating to the assessment of renewable energy technologies could be analysed for where investments could be made to make commercial renewable energy technologies suitable for military use. Finally, there could also be scope to develop policy tools and training on raising energy awareness as well as the development of tools for optimum technology selection. European Commission Director-General Dominique Ristori said the energy transition was a “top priority of the European Union”. “It is not only about energy and climate alone. It is about accelerating the fundamental modernisation of Europe's entire economy, making it low-carbon, energy and resource efficient, in a socially fair manner. And making it less dependent on imports. It requires the transformation of the whole energy system. All sectors need to contribute and to reap the benefits. I am therefore very pleased that we will continue with the second phase of the Consultation Forum as of October. This would allow, inter alia, a deeper analysis of the issues at stake and the identification of bottlenecks that need to be resolved to allow the defence sector to benefit fully from sustainable energy and to use the energy transition as a major economic opportunity”, he stated. The aim of this week’s last meeting of the Consultation Forum was to reach agreement on the content of final report with recommendations for a more implementation focused second phase. The conference was attended by around 100 experts from government administrations, as well as industry, academia, NATO representatives and the European Commission. In total, there have been five conferences of this first phase of the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector. In closing the conference, Director European Synergies and Innovation Denis Roger highlighted, that “we have built a defence energy community which did not exist before”. Second phase The second phase of the Consultation Forum will have an implementation focus to take the knowledge developed in the first phase and turn this into results. The focus will remain on energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, and the protection of critical energy infrastructure in relation to the implications of relevant EU legislation when applied to the defence sector’s infrastructure. This means that results will have direct benefits for the delivery of defence infrastructure capability, while contributing to the broader objectives of the Energy Union. Background The Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector is a European Commission initiative managed by the European Defence Agency. It brings together experts from the defence and energy sectors to share information and best practice on improving energy management, energy efficiency, and the use of renewable energy. The Consultation Forum has taken place in a series of five plenary meetings over 24 months, and its first phase will be concluded in October 2017. The work is carried out in three parallel working groups each with a particular focus: (1) Energy Management, (2) Energy Efficiency & 3) Renewable Energy. There was also a Protection of Critical Energy Infrastructure PCEI) Experts Group which developed a conceptual paper on PCEI. More informationConsultation Forum webpage	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/09/25/phase-1-of-consultation-forum-for-sustainable-energy-in-the-defence-completed
EDA_NEWS_0252	2017-09-28	NEWS	EDA’s Joint Personnel Recovery Staff Course hosted for the first time by Italy	 The 12th edition of the Joint Personnel Recovery Staff Course (JPRSC), a project initiated and supported by the European Defence Agency (EDA), was co-organised and hosted for the first time by the Italian Joint Air Operation School from 12th to 22nd of September 2017 in Guidonia, Italy. A total of 19 students, from 6 contributing countries (Cyprus, Ireland, The Netherlands, Germany, Spain and Italy) benefitted from the knowledge and experience of a cadre of instructors from Germany, Hungary and Italy. The European Personnel Recovery Centre (EPRC), a close partner of EDA, contributed to the event by organizing a specific instructor course aimed at ‘training the trainers’. The main focus of the course was to train staff officers to support their commanders in personnel recovery related matters. The course was designed for personnel in Tactical Operational Centres (TOCs), Personnel Recovery Coordination Cells (PRCCs) or Joint Personnel Recovery Cells (JPRC’s). The overall objective of the JPRSC is to ensure that trained personnel are available to support any future personnel recovery activities in an operational context. Personnel recovery is a vital element of modern operational planning as it provides a security net for deployed personnel. Most importantly, it boosts morale and acknowledges the responsibility of Member States and the European Union to develop and provide relevant capabilities to recover and reintegrate isolated personnel deployed in the context of crisis management operations under the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). The next EDA JPRSC will take place from 15th to 24th November 2017 in Italy (Poggio, Renatico) and will be organised by the European Personnel Recovery Centre (EPRC). Background The EDA PRCPC project was established on 30 May 2013 as an EDA Category B project under the lead of Sweden. As of today, it includes eight contributing EU Member States (cMS): Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Hungary, Italy, The Netherlands and Sweden. The course has been extended three times and will be finalised on 30 May 2019. The JPRSC is part of the EDA’s Personnel Recovery Controller and Planner Course (PRCPC). 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/09/28/eda-s-joint-personnel-recovery-staff-course-hosted-for-the-first-time-by-italy
EDA_NEWS_0253	2017-09-22	NEWS	EDA seeks European defence industry’s input on Main Battle Tank optimization	 In spring 2017, the European Defence Agency (EDA) launched the ‘OMBT-Leo2’ project, a new Pooling & Sharing initiative which aims at optimizing existing Main Battle Tank (MBT) capabilities in Europe with an initial focus on the Leopard 2A4. The concept foresees the offer of surplus Leopard platforms available in certain Member States (the ‘providers’) and transfer them (lease, rent or sell) together with an upgrading package to one or several other Member States (the ‘receivers’) interested in acquiring and introducing in-service this type of capability. The Pooling & Sharing of training, exercises and maintenance between providers and receivers, using already existing facilities, is also part of the concept. Additionally, regarding economies of scale, Member States owning and operating for national purposes the same type of MBTs, can opt-in for upgrading their in-service fleet. Business Case The EDA is now elaborating a business case based on the upgrading of participating Leopard 2A4 platforms to the latest configuration (2A7) and invites the European defence industry to provide its input. For this purpose, the Agency issued a Request for Information (RFI) on 22 September to the AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD) and National Defence Industry Associations (NDIAs) of EU countries, encouraging the European defence industry to consider creating cross-border industrial partnership. Upgrade of legacy MBTs to the latest technical standards would have a positive impact for European defence industry in the area of land systems. It would also contribute to the maintenance of technological excellence of the European Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB). This RFI encourages the establishment of European multinational cross-border industrial partnerships as the preferred mechanism to exploit this opportunity. Additionally, EDA considers this programme as a suitable vehicle for enhanced access for Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) to the cross-border supply chain. The business case will have to provide information on the content and cost of the Integrated Logistics Support package provided by industrial partners covering recurring/scheduled maintenance as well as estimated figures for the Life Cycle Costs of the upgraded tanks. With the support provided by EDA on updating the business case, interested Member States will further evaluate the possibility of acquiring/upgrading this up-to-date version of the tanks. The deadline for responding to this RFI is 8 December 2017. All the responses will be evaluated by experts from EDA and interested Member States at the beginning of 2018. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/09/22/eda-seeks-european-defence-industry-s-input-on-main-battle-tank-optimization

EDA_NEWS_0255	2017-09-19	NEWS	‘COSME’ grants now available for defence clusters	 For the first time ever, COSME (the EU Programme for the COmpetitiveness of enterprises and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises) offers grants for European defence clusters cooperating in international partnerships.The European Defence Agency (EDA) has been exploring and highlighting COSME opportunities for  defence-related SMEs and clusters since 2016. An EDA exploratory study addressed defence-related clusters and informed about their potential eligibility for COSME grants, including through a dynamic EDA’s COSME web-platform.  Last March,  EDA hosted a workshop dedicated to EU opportunities for defence-related clusters. Among other topics, the meeting envisaged a future defence-oriented call from the European Commission (EC) allocating COSME grants to EU clusters and, in this respect, EDA started facilitating transnational cluster partnerships during a dedicated cluster-to-cluster (C2C) session.For the first time ever, and building on the continuous and productive coordination EDA-EC, defence-related clusters now have the opportunity to apply for earmarked grants under the call for proposals - just issued by the Commission’s EASME – “Clusters Go International in the Defence & Security sector”.The deadline for applications is 13 December 2017 (17:00 Brussels time).Eligible consortia will have to be composed of at least three different clusters/business network organisations established in three different EU Member States.At least one of them must be a defence-related entity, meaning :either a member of a National Defence Industry Association (see, as non-exhaustive examples, the dedicated EDA’s directory)or devoting part of its sales to defence marketsor taking part in national or European defence-related projects (for example as part of a project managed by the EDA).EDA stands ready to facilitate the building of cross-border cluster partnerships applying to the just published EASME’s call for proposals. More information E-mail EDAEDA’s summary table on EU funding opportunities for defence-related stakeholders EDA’s “COSME web-platform”EDA’s work supporting access to EU fundingEDA’s work in support of industryEDA’s work in support of Small-and-Medium-Sized Enterprises 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/09/19/cosme-grants-now-available-for-defence-clusters
EDA_NEWS_0256	2017-09-18	NEWS	EDA advances work towards open architecture for soldier systems	 The industry workshop on Standard Architecture for Soldier Systems focusing on data management and infrastructure (STASS II) was successfully completed on 6 September 2017. Twenty participants from seven countries and 14 organisations (industry and research) attended the workshop and discussed a suitable approach towards the realisation of an open architecture for soldier systems. Industry and research representatives acknowledged and welcomed the progress made in the development of standard architecture to date. Some of the most relevant topics discussed were:The lack of standard connectors suitable for dismounted soldier systems (DSS) impedes the standardisation process as standardisation is only possible in cases where at least two sources are available. Lack of data interfaces between weapon devices and soldier systems in the “NATO Powered Accessory Rail” document. Instead it focuses only on the mechanical and electrical interfaces. It was stressed that recommendations be included for such data interfaces in the STASS II architecture. The lack of data interface standardisation means that each manufacturer has to define a data interface which significantly reduces the opportunities for future interoperability.Cognitive burden to soldiers imposed by large amounts of available information. The participants recommended the study team to focus not only on technical aspects of soldier systems architecture but also the possible effects on soldiers of such large amounts of data. This aspect is critical of the way tactical information is presented. If a soldier is overwhelmed with information his/her attention can be easily diverted from the battlefield situation and as a result put him/her in danger. The storage of collected information. Nowadays, the sensors that provide Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) capabilities generate large volumes of data. A soldier is considered an important asset to collect and thus to support ISTAR capabilities. However this creates the need for equipping him/her with additional equipment. Taking into account the current trend to reduce the cognitive, thermal or weight burden for soldier systems this aspect requires further assessment. As stressed during the workshop, a business model and cost-benefit assessment are important prerequisites prior to investments in  soldier systems. While the majority of benefits are for the user, a STASS II compliant system facilitates a flexible and powerful arrangement that otherwise would be extremely costly.The STASS II study will be completed by the end of 2017 and together with the STASS I results will propose a comprehensive open reference architecture for soldier systems. The approach initiated under the STASS studies will be further developed under the EU Preparatory Action for Defence Research 2017 (PADR 2017) call for Force Protection and Soldier Systems by defining and technically validating a generic open soldier systems architecture which should be ready for standardisation.All presentations given during the workshop are available here: 2017-09-06 - STASS II Industrial Workshop - Presentations More informationCapTech Ground Systems page	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/09/18/eda-advances-work-towards-open-architecture-for-soldier-systems
EDA_NEWS_0257	2017-09-07	NEWS	First cyber exercise at EU ministerial level focuses on strategic decision-making	 EU Defence Ministers today participate in “EU CYBRID 2017”, a strategic table-top cyber defence exercise. The exercise, the first of its kind, is organised by the Estonian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, the Estonian Ministry of Defence and the European Defence Agency (EDA). The objective of EU CYBRID 2017 is to raise awareness of cybersecurity incident coordination at political level and of the potential effects of offensive cyber-campaigns. It focuses on situational awareness, crisis response mechanisms and strategic communication.  Cyber is widely recognised as a major threat in the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), yet there has been limited attention to EU missions and operations’ resilience . To address cyber threats in CSDP, Estonia is organising in cooperation with the European Defence Agency a strategic table-top cyber-exercise “EU CYBRID 2017” for EU Ministers of Defence during their informal meeting in Tallinn on 7 September 2017. “Cyber, the fifth domain of warfare, must be given as much attention as land, air, sea and space. There is no 100% protection in cyber. It is imperative that EU Defence Ministers test their cyber defence mechanisms. The buy-in of Member States is key for the EU to have the necessary skills, technology and capabilities”, Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency, said. The scope of the exercise is crisis response to a major offensive cyber campaign against EU military structures in a hybrid warfare context. The objectives of the exercise are: Situational awareness. Use the EU Intelligence and Situation Centre (INTCEN) to ensure a common understanding of the crisis and the impact of hybrid attacks on EU military structures and to give initial assessment/context for the cyber-campaign. Crisis Response. Raise awareness of the instruments available to the EU in to give strategic guidance on the response to a major offensive cyber-campaign against CSDP structures in a hybrid warfare context. STRATCOM. To coordinate initial messages among EU Member States at political level. Cyber defence. Raise awareness on cybersecurity incident coordination at political level and demonstrate potential effects of offensive cyber-campaigns. Trigger discussions at Council level with a view to examine possible measures in response to specific events, drawn from the crisis scenario.   About the exercise EU CYBRID 2017 is a table-top cyber exercise focused on strategic choices and considerations at the EU ministerial level. It is not expected that exercise participants address specific technical issues that arise during the exercise: this will be addressed later in associated exercises (e.g. EU PACE 2017). The goal of the exercise is to highlight a number of strategic concerns and topics that arise in connection with any hypothetical cyber crisis. This exercise should serve as a forum for discussion at ministerial level and provide strategic guidance to address future crises. The exercise scenario include an orchestrated cyber-attack campaign against an EU-led military operation affecting both an EU Headquarter in Rome (OHQ Rome) and its subordinated maritime assets. Multiple cyber-attacks covering a range of cyber threats combined with other incidents will take place over the course of the exercise. The exercise scenario refers to fictitious countries, organisations and operations.  Cyber defence and the European Defence Agency Cyber defence is one of the priorities of the EDA’s capability development plan and of the NATO-EU Joint Declaration. A project team consisting of EDA and its participating Member States' representatives is responsible for jointly developing cyber defence capabilities within the EU CSDP, supported by R&T experts. The Agency’s main focus is on supporting member states in building a skilled military cyber defence workforce and in ensuring the availability of proactive and reactive cyber defence technology. The EDA for example develops, pilots and delivers a variety of cyber security & defence courses and exercises from basic awareness over expert level to decision maker training.  More information:Cyber defence project page and factsheetCybersecurity and the Estonian Presidency of the Council of the European Union	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/09/07/first-cyber-exercise-at-eu-ministerial-level-focuses-on-strategic-decision-making

EDA_NEWS_0259	2017-08-24	NEWS	France becomes 24th member of EU SatCom Market	 On 22 August France joined the EU SatCom Market, becoming the 24th member of this EDA initiative launched in 2009 to provide contributing members with flexible commercial satellite communication (SatCom) solutions and more recently also Communication and Information System (CIS) services.SatCom and CIS services are fundamental for Communication, Command and Control in any military or security related operation or mission. It enables Commanders to connect units in remote areas with HQs and capitals and to manage its mission and tasks. The EU SatCom Market project provides a flexible and cost-effective way of doing this, offering members a pay-per-use solution without imposing any binding financial commitments beyond services ordered. The contributing members have mandated the EDA through a ‘Joint Procurement Arrangement’ (JPA), to manage the project including the negotiation and management of Framework Contracts (FWCs) and service requests on their behalf.  So far contracts are signed with Airbus Defence & Space for SatCom  services and with Airbus Defence & Space and Thales Communications & Security for CIS services. The current 24 contributing members are: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, France, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, the United Kingdom, Republic of Serbia, the Athena Mechanism and the civilian missions EUCAP SAHEL Niger, EUCAP SAHEL Mali, EUAM Ukraine, EUCAP NESTOR and EUMM Georgia. More information: EU SatCom Market project pageEU SatCom Market factsheet	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/08/24/france-becomes-24th-member-of-eu-satcom-market
EDA_NEWS_0260	2017-09-12	NEWS	Future European GOVSATCOM programme takes next step	 The EDA GOVSATCOM Demo Ad-Hoc Working Group will meet this week to further proceed with the Project Arrangement detailing the rules and procedures of the Governmental Satellite Communications (GOVSATCOM) Pooling and Sharing demonstration project. Additionally, Member States have recently agreed for the EDA to conclude an Implementing Arrangement with the European Space Agency (ESA) on their cooperation for GOVSATCOM. This Arrangement will maximise synergies between the activities of the two Agencies to support the European Commission in its efforts for preparing an EU GOVSATCOM initiative.The EU GOVSATCOM initiative aims to provide EU Member States, organisations and operators with assured satellite communication services by 2020. As part of the programme, the European Space Agency (ESA) this week contracted Airbus to produce a demonstrator providing a technical solution for secured interconnections between different SatCom architectures and users. This demonstrator contract follows on from two design studies running between 2015 and 2017 on behalf of the ESA and EDA respectively. The studies served to define and quantify the nature of the European governmental users’ needs and assess the various technologies and architectures of the GOVSATCOM programme, as well as the advantages of the ‘pooling and sharing’ model. The GOVSATCOM programme will initially focus on the pooling and sharing of communication capabilities provided by governmental satellites and commercial operator satellites already in orbit. In June 2017, 14 EDA Member States (Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom) and Norway agreed to develop a demonstrator for pooling and sharing satellite communication capabilities. BackgroundReliable, stable and secure communications are crucial in any CSDP mission or operation. Yet, terrestrial network infrastructures are not available everywhere, for instance in areas hit by natural disasters, at sea, in the air or in hostile zones. Satellite communications (SATCOM) can be the solution: rapidly deployable, flexible and distance insensitive, they offer communication links where terrestrial networks are damaged, overloaded or non-existent.However, access to SATCOM cannot be taken for granted at any time, especially not when government users require them at short notice and without pre-arranged agreements. In situations of high demand, competition with other users of commercial SATCOM capacities creates a risk of non-availability and high costs. Against this backdrop, EU leaders decided in 2013 that there was a need for a new solution combining the advantages of commercial and military satellite systems in order to address both civil and military needs through European cooperation. The European Defence Agency, in collaboration with the European Commission and the European Space Agency, is now preparing the next generation of GOVSATCOM. GOVSATCOM will be a capability that is placed in between the commercial satellite communication market and the highly protected military satellite communication capability.  More information  14 EDA Member States to pool & share GOVSATCOM capabilities Governmental Satellite Communications (GovSatcom) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/09/12/future-european-govsatcom-programme-takes-next-step
EDA_NEWS_0261	2017-08-02	NEWS	5th EDA Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC) completed	 The European Defence Agency’s 5th Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC), which ran over several weeks at Royal Air Force (RAF) base in Linton-on-Ouse (North Yorkshire, UK) and Arvidsjaur Airfield in Lapland (Sweden), was successfully completed in July. The course began in May with a four-week classroom phase, which included simulator exercises at Linton-on-Ouse, followed by a three week deployment to Arvidsjaur Airfield in Lapland/Sweden where participants engaged in live flying exercises. Supported by personnel from No 1 Helikopter Skvadron in Lulea, the flying phase included a complex operational scenario employing: dissimilar formation flying, evasion training against a range of airborne threats, Electronic Warfare (EW) against both ground-based and airborne systems and a variety of additional tasks such as Helicopter Assault, Convoy Escort, Mutual Support and Vehicle Check Points. The Staff Instructors came from Sweden, Austria and the UK with several supporting air assets: Hawks from 100 Sqn (UK), Gripens from 211 and 212 Sqn (Sweden) and Alca Jets from the Czech Air Force (212 Sqn). In addition, EW assets and personnel was provided by RAF Spadeadam. In total, 10 Bronze, 6 Silver and 3 Gold Badges were awarded ensuring that the international cadre of Helicopter Tactics Instructors has once again been strengthened and grown for the 5th year in a row.   Background EDA’s Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC) provides aircrew from participating nations with the skills and knowledge to teach advanced tactics to front-line aircrews from within their own national organisations and to assist in delivering the EDA’s Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP), the Helicopter Tactics Course (HTC) and the future HTIC. Successful graduates from the course are awarded a qualification recognised by other Member States. HTIC development courses run over two years: in the first year, prospective instructors refine their own knowledge of advanced helicopter tactics to the maximum degree. In the second year, the emphasis shifts to develop the participants’ ability to teach those tactics. In turn, Instructors who have demonstrated above average abilities in delivering the course will be individually selected to come back a third time and teach alongside the existing instructional staff to finally achieve their Gold instructor qualification to become supervising instructors for future HTIC. The three main elements of HTIC include Evasion Training, Electronic Warfare and advanced Operations. They are initially taught as stand-alone skills before being brought together in a complex, non-permissive environment in the framework of the planning and execution of Composite Air Operations (COMAO). 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/08/02/5th-eda-helicopter-tactics-instructors-course-(htic)-completed

EDA_NEWS_0264	2017-07-20	NEWS	EDA study confirms benefits of laser for detection & identification of underwater targets	 For underwater applications, laser based technologies offer a complementary solution to existing sensors (sonar) for the detection and identification of underwater targets, particularly in shallow waters or in complex marine terrain such as archipelagos with numerous small islands, narrow sounds and inaccessible locations. This is the main result of a study commissioned by the European Defence Agency (EDA) and conducted by a consortium consisting of FOI, the Swedish Defence research Agency, and ISL, the French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis. The study details the use of laser systems - both LIDAR-based (Light Detection and Ranging, a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges) and LADAR-based (LAser Detection And Ranging) - and indicates that their successful incorporation into existing detection and identification technologies for underwater targets in difficult operating conditions, such as those found in the Baltic Sea, can have a significant and positive impact on performance, particularly for rapid detection and identification. Laser systems can deliver operational improvements as compared to sonar systems: airborne laser scanning, for instance, can be deployed extremely quickly in order to detect, locate and track underwater or floating objects. It is also possible for airborne laser scanning to identify the types of targets, provided that the target is large enough. Once a target is detected it is then possible to quickly deploy a surface or underwater vessel equipped with a Laser Gated Viewing (LGV) or Underwater Laser Scanning (ULS) system to positively identify confirm the target information. The study concluded that laser based technologies are a viable and complementary solution for acoustic sensor systems, even in turbid waters or in waters with high organic content, such as shallow regions or archipelagos found in the Baltic Sea.   Methodology In order to analyse the performance of these technologies, three scenarios were defined: (1) Maritime mine identification, (2) Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and submarines detection and (3) Rapid environmental assessment (REA). The study used modelling techniques along with systems knowledge to assess the performance of laser baser underwater systems. In order to assess the performance of the systems in the defined scenarios and tasks, the conditions and systems were simulated.   Background The task to detect and identify underwater targets has traditionally been undertaken by sonar based systems, particularly in open water conditions and in waters with significant depths. However, there are situations where sonar-based systems could be assisted by complementary technology in order to achieve improved performance. Examples of such operating conditions are relatively shallow waters where sonars ships cannot operate and complex marine terrain such as coastlines with archipelagos numerous small islands, narrow sounds and inaccessible locations. The Baltic Sea, due to its high level of turbidity in coastal regions is one such area that is particularly challenging for the detection of underwater targets using laser based sensors. The occurrence of organic matter such as algae and the effect of sediment transport in the water column coupled with the seasonal optical attenuation contribute to difficulties in detecting underwater targets.   More information CapTech Maritime (EDA project page) Maritime Surveillance (MARSUR) - EDA project page MARSUR put to the test during live demonstration at OHQ EUNAVFOR MED SOPHIA (EDA webnews, May 2017)  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/07/20/eda-study-confirms-benefits-of-laser-for-detection-identification-of-underwater-targets

EDA_NEWS_0266	2017-07-18	NEWS	EDA developed Human Resources management tool used in international personnel recovery course	 The European Defence Agency (EDA) has developed a software tool to help the J1 (personnel) branch of EU headquarters manage the in-processing and out-processing of personnel at all phases of a CSDP operation.  This tool has recently been used at the annual Air Centric Personnel Recovery Operatives Course (APROC). 500 participants from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, the UK as well as the US attended the course which included academic classes as well as flying sessions, involving fixed wing, rotary wing asset crews as well as Extraction Forces (EF) as the primary training audience. First demonstrated in 2012, the Agency’s J1 FAS (J1 Functional Area Service) tool allows accurate and fast in-processing of personnel coming from different Member States. Staff can access the J1 FAS via a protected internet link before they deploy and provide the HQ with all the data they need to enable speedy integration within the HQ. J1 FAS also allows important management information to be synthesised from the database. After a trial phase in 2016, the tool has been used at the Operation Headquarters of EUNAVFOR MED operation Sophia. The J1 FAS is also currently under evaluation in an Operational Field Trial within the EU Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali). The J1 FAS was used during the Air Centric Personnel Recovery Operative Course (APROC) organised by the European Personnel Recovery Centre (EPRC) to support the two-day in-processing of the 500 participants. The J1 FAS reduced dramatically queues and waiting time for the participants arrived at the course venue in large groups. The tool demonstrated its ability to support effectively large scale events like the APROC. Air Centric Personnel Recovery Operatives Course (APROC) The European Personnel Recovery Centre (EPRC) organises the Air Centric Personnel Recovery Operatives Course (APROC) on an annual basis. The objective of the Course is to educate and train personnel on the planning and conduction of complex missions based on Personnel Recovery (PR) scenarios in which various types of means and various nations are involved. More experienced pilots are trained in the role of Rescue Mission Commander (RMC), allowing them to learn to lead the planning and the execution of complex PR missions, to provide briefings and debriefings regarding the missions to the benefit of the task forces employed and the commanders. Finally, among other objectives, the Course also aims at educating the Extraction Forces to the application of the standards envisaged for the recovery of the Isolated Personnel (ISOP) and to provide the medical assistance required.    More information: J1 FAS factsheet Support to operations 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/07/18/eda-developed-human-resources-management-tool-used-in-international-personnel-recovery-course
EDA_NEWS_0267	2017-07-06	NEWS	The EDA Materials & Structures Week - Workshop on smart textiles in defence	 EDA's CapTech Materials & Structures recently organised a workshop on “Smart textiles in defence” at AITIIP Technological Centre in Zaragoza (Spain). It gathered 27 experts from various European Ministries of Defence, industry, SMEs and academia related to this technology domain. The objectives were to raise awareness and better understand the potential of smart textiles and discuss the impact of these technologies on future defence capabilities.  Today, efforts in this field are focused on the development of standards to define terms, definitions, technical specifications and requirements for smart textiles. Future trends include multi-functionalities to make the soldier lighter, safer, and smarter. Specifically the main trends include the monitoring of the well-being, health status and protection of the soldier, including adaptive camouflage and reducing the weight. Given the interest of the smart textiles for different applications, highlighted in the Materials Strategic Research Agenda (SRA), this workshop sought to gather experts in related fields to discuss future research directions within Europe, when applying this kind of materials to defence systems. The workshop brought forward multiple success stories of smart textiles used in different defence applications with functions such as: thermal control, moisture control, UV protection, functional bactericidal and self-cleaning. Ongoing activities and projects were presented by EDA and organizations from Member States showing the increasing interest and potential of smart textiles for enhancing soldier systems. Among the most targeted research areas were shown to be: durability, thermal comfort,  adaptive camouflage, measurement and communication sensors, energy harvesting and recovery, modelling and simulation tools and new materials such as graphene or bio-composites.  The discussion also addressed manufacturing and commercialization of smart textiles, recognizing the growing market and opportunities stemming from the technological developments taking place in the civilian sector. Furthermore, the certification and standardization aspects were highlighted with particular attention paid to ensuring product quality and development of legislation.   The main outcome of the workshop was the identification of the areas for cooperation at EU level, especially in terms of identifying and testing the available systems, and several proposals were put forward for in-depth study and future activities. Another conclusion of the workshop included the need of shaping future priorities and defining stages toward the goal of achieving multifunction soldier uniforms.  The workshop was followed by the 37th meeting of the CapTech Materials & Structures held in the research centre ITAInnova on 31 May and 1 June. The meeting focused on the review of the CapTech’s current activities and on the discussion about future actions and upcoming opportunities. The efforts of the CapTech were further acknowledged with the occasion of the visit to the EDA Additive Manufacturing facility deployed in the Zaragoza Airbase. The successful deployment of a 3D-printing lab for the duration of EAATTC 17-3 represents the main focus of EDA’s ground-breaking project, “Additive Manufacturing Feasibility Study & Technology Demonstration”. The deployment underscored the strong interest and potential of AM technologies across all military branches (pilots, maintenance, technicians and logistic support), who were keen to learn how 3D-printing could benefit their area of expertise. The success of this showcasing has significantly contributed to raising awareness on the operational application of these technologies and on the potential synergistic effects of undertaking European defence R&T activities.  The workshop and the Materials CapTech meeting was co-organized by EDA’s CapTechs Materials & Structures, Land Systems and CBRN & Human Factors, and the Research and Technology Organizations CITEVE, AITEX, ITAInnova and the Spanish MoD.   More information: For further information, please contact CapTech.Materials@eda.europa.eu  CapTech Materials & Structures CapTech Ground Systems CapTech CBRN and Human Factors EDA Research & Technology European Defence Agency Role in Research & Technology - Towards Enhanced European Future Military Capabilities Combat Equipment for Dismounted Soldier Feasibility Study Programme (CEDS FSP) Future Soldier Systems CBRN Joint Investment Programme EDA Web news on Survey: EDA consultation to identify impact of 3D-printing technologies in defence EDA web news on AM Exhibition: Exploring Additive Manufacturing impact in Defence capabilities, 12 September 2017 EDA Web News on the AM Deployment: Successful test flight for EDA 3D-printing lab during deployment at EAATTC 17-3    	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/07/06/the-eda-materials-structures-week---workshop-on-smart-textiles-in-defence
EDA_NEWS_0268	2017-07-11	NEWS	Polish SME secures ESIF co-funding for R&T project relevant to military operations	 In line with defence R&T priorities identified within its CapTechs, the European Defence Agency has successfully supported a Polish small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) to access EU funding from the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) for a 2 million euro project dealing with tropospheric radio-wave propagation to extend the range of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) operations. (picture: Airbus DS) Following an EDA procedure inviting Member States’ Ministries of Defence to identify and propose R&T projects, which EDA could support in view of receiving ESIF funding, the Polish Ministry of Defence submitted this project to EDA. The project holder, an SME, has been awarded the full amount it had applied for, namely two-third of the total project cost. This is already the fifth EDA-supported R&T project funded by ESIF. EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq welcomed the fact that all five EDA-supported R&T projects funded by ESIF are led by SMEs, in line with the European Council’s call to all relevant actors to work on fostering investments in defence supply-chains, with a particular focus on SMEs. Within this scope, EDA has recently: launched a free-of-charge assistance process focusing on access to the second main fund among ESIF, the European Social Fund (ESF), in support of key skills and competencies for defence (KSC). Under this procedure [“ESF4KSC”], MoDs may forward to EDA (by the 18th of September 2017) KSC-related projects collected nationally from stakeholders; published an EDA’s “ESIF web-platform” to provide any potential defence-related stakeholder (e.g. MoDs, industry, research-and-technology organisations, academia, clusters) with an interactive mapping on ‘sources’ of regional, national and transnational calls for proposals under Structural Funds as well as respective contact details of ESIF managing authorities in charge for funding allocation. With EDA’s support, defence-related technology domains benefitting from ESIF so far include energy, naval, robotics, components and modules, radio-frequency sensors, aerial, advanced materials and structures, communication Information Systems. Therefore, EDA’s work has proved that ESIF is a relevant opportunity for both defence industry and RTOs, additionally to the budget earmarked for defence. EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq stated: “EDA will continue to act as a facilitator to exploit wider EU policies for the benefit of defence and, based on Member States’ prioritisation, to recommend the allocation of EU funding to projects and programmes”.   More information EDA’s summary table on EU funding opportunities for defence-related stakeholders EDA’s “ESIF web-platform” EDA’s “COSME web-platform” EDA’s work in support of Small-and-Medium-Sized Enterprises 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/07/11/polish-sme-secures-esif-co-funding-for-r-t-project-relevant-to-military-operations
EDA_NEWS_0269	2017-06-29	NEWS	European Union Training Mission in Somalia tenders medical support services	" The European Defence Agency (EDA) recently published a contract notice on its Contractor Support to Operations (CSO) platform for Role 2 Medical Support Services to European Union Training Mission in Somalia (EUTM-S). Procuring specific services such as Role 2 Medical Support or customised assets can be challenging especially on short notice. EDA assists EU military operations in fulfilling their needs for complex goods or services (e.g. armoured vehicles, air to ground surveillance, medical services ) through the CSO platform. A powerful tool for interaction, the CSO platform helps to connect economic operators and procurement authorities. Economic operators are invited to subscribe to the platform database to receive regular updates on business opportunities from EU-led operations or other governmental and institutional authorities. EUTM-S is currently seeking for Role 2 medical care services to cover the region of Mogadishu. Medical care support is categorised into four roles that identify the functions and the capabilities of a medical unit or element. Most of the care capabilities of each role are subordinates to the next higher role. In general a Role 2  as medical care support is characterised by its ability to perform surgical interventions, including damage control  surgery and  surgical  procedures  for  emergency  surgical  cases,  to  deliver  life,  limb  and  function  saving  medical  treatment and to perform reception / triage of casualties. The full contract notice, as well as another contract notice from EUFOR Althea HQ in Bosnia and Herzegovina for food, water and catering supply, can be found on the CSO Platform which constitutes the one-stop-shop for EDA contractor support to operations.   Support to operations Since the creation of the European Defence Agency in 2004, support to the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and to EU operations has been part of EDA's core mission. Procurement of contracted solutions has become increasingly relevant for EU military operations not only to fill capability gaps in the force generation process, but also as a general planned support for ongoing operations. Several activities are ongoing in support of CSDP military and civilian operations or missions as well as EU Battlegroups at the request of Member States, such as  the provision of satellite communication, the use of EDA-developed projects, and the testing of EDA-funded demonstrators, and soon in-theatre aeromedical evacuation services.   More information: Support to operations project page News ""EDA signs cooperation arrangement with Athena"" (2 March 2015) CSO platform (password required) "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/06/29/european-union-training-mission-in-somalia-tenders-medical-support-services
EDA_NEWS_0270	2017-06-29	NEWS	Germany and Norway formally join Netherlands and Luxembourg to operate pooled fleet of NATO-owned Airbus A330 MRTT tankers	 Order to be placed by NSPA through OCCAR under EDA initiative Germany and Norway officially joined the European/NATO program to acquire Airbus A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport aircraft along with Netherlands and Luxembourg. The two nations committed to participating in the project through the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding at NATO HQ in Brussels today. Known as the Multinational Multi-Role Tanker Transport Fleet (MMF) the programme was initiated by the European Defence Agency (EDA) in 2012. Europe’s organization for the management of cooperative armament programmes - OCCAR - manages the MMF acquisition phase as Contract Executing Agent on behalf of the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA). Following the acquisition phase, NSPA will be responsible for the complete life-cycle management of the fleet. The Programme is funded by the four nations who will have the exclusive right to use these NATO–owned aircraft which will operate in a pooling arrangement. The aircraft will be configured for inflight refuelling, the transport of passengers and cargo, and medical evacuation flights. The first two aircraft have already been ordered to be delivered from Airbus Defence and Space’s tanker conversion line at Getafe near Madrid in 2020. Five additional aircraft will now be ordered, and that order will include options for up to four further aircraft. NSPA GM, Peter Dohmen said “As NATO’s Support and Procurement Agency, we are proud to be a key enabler of this critical project to help European nations meet their air transport and refuelling requirements. The successful cooperation in this project - bringing together all our capabilities - bodes extremely well for further future NATO / EU collaboration.” OCCAR Director, Arturo Alfonso-Meiriño said: “The MMF programme has broken new ground in bringing together the combined capabilities of the EDA, NSPA and OCCAR as one team, with each organisation working within its particular sphere of expertise. I very much welcome that this important initiative has now attracted additional partners to join, and it still includes options for the participation of even more countries.” EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq said: “The MMF is a prime example of European defence cooperation which shows that once a capability shortfall has been jointly identified, European nations can pull together, work on a common project aimed at filling the gap, and eventually deliver. It’s Pooling & Sharing at its best”. Airbus Defence and Space Head of Military Aircraft Fernando Alonso said: “The A330 MRTT has established itself firmly as the world’s premier tanker/transport aircraft. It is extremely satisfying to now see it adopted as the core asset of one of Europe’s most important cooperative defence programmes. We hope that this collaborative approach will serve as a model for future joint procurements.”   Contacts for the media Airbus Defence and Space Kieran Daly T+34 689 669 661 European Defence Agency Helmut Brüls T+32 47 35 63 964  OCCAR Falko Fanslau T+49 22 85 50 21 16 NATO Support and Procurement Agency Karen Tissot Van Patot T+352 30 63 65 57                                  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/06/29/germany-and-norway-formally-join-netherlands-and-luxembourg-to-operate-pooled-fleet-of-nato-owned-airbus-a330-mrtt-tankers
EDA_NEWS_0271	2017-06-21	NEWS	Long term capability trends under review	 Thirty-five experts from 17 Member States as well as representatives from the EU Military Committee, the EU Military Staff, the EU Commission and NATO Allied Command Transformation participate in the European Defence Agency’s Table Top Exercise (TTX) on long term capability trends, starting today. Results of the exercise will feed into the revised Capability Development Plan (CDP) which will be presented to Ministers of Defence in the first semester of 2018. The three day long exercise is part of the CDP revision and addresses the review of the current Long Term Trend Capability Assessment, with a perspective on 2035 and beyond. It comprises in-depth analysis and assessment of all military tasks, identifying the evolution of key military requirements, the key trends towards 2035 and beyond, the future importance of the different tasks, as well as related risks and challenges. “Similar to previous table top exercises, we evaluate capability trends by using threat scenarios. Only this time, the elaboration of these scenarios was more complex as we are looking at trends in 2035 and beyond. We thus worked closely together with military R&T experts to elaborate scenarios including technology available in about 20 years. The aim is to derive future military capability development trends in a European setting”, says Roland Van Reybroeck, Cooperation Planning & Support Director at EDA. The TTX will address the full scope of military tasks in view of answering the question “which capabilities will Member States’ armed forces need in 2035 and beyond?” An important aspect thereby is to analyse in detail the capability implications in different scenarios. “If we take for example global warming and the melting of ice caps, apart from ecological and economic consequences, the military would need to look at its long term capability needs to face new geopolitical scenarios potentially resulting from climate change. In this context, military long term capability planners would for example examine related requirements for the next generation of frigates”, explains Lars-Ove Roos, Project Officer at EDA. The key findings from this exercise, will underpin the long term dimension to the Capability Development Plan. The post-TTX analysis and assessment is to be completed by December 2017.    More information: Factsheet Capability Development Plan Project page Capability Development Plan 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/06/21/long-term-capability-trends-under-review
EDA_NEWS_0272	2017-06-20	NEWS	Study on Counter-Surface-to-Air Fire produces strategy	 Military forces and airborne assets participating in EU-led military operations are highly likely to encounter adversaries armed with Surface-to-Air Fire (SAFIRE) weapons to interfere with, and potentially jeopardise, air operations. A recent EDA study developed a strategy on Counter SAFIRE (C-SAFIRE) with the aim to maximise air assets’ availability, survivability and freedom of manoeuvre in theatre of operations.  Counter- Surface-to-Air Fire (C-SAFIRE) capability is required on EU-led military operations in order to prevent the threat or use of SAFIRE being a risk to mission success, excessively constraining air assets’ (fixed wing and rotary) freedom of action, or imposing avoidable costs or casualties. The C-SAFIRE study supports an EU approach to facilitate Member States’ participation in EU-led military operations under the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), while supporting mission effectiveness and operational risk management for participating air assets. The study states the  C-SAFIRE capabilities required for participation in EU-led military operations and addresses how air platforms with different capabilities can be employed. Through the study, a technical, organisational and procedural guide on C-SAFIRE in EU led military operations was produced. The study also presented a common understanding of measures to be taken at national level to facilitate the development of an integrated approach in the assessment and development of Member States’ C-SAFIRE capabilities, training included.  The project was funded by the EDA and carried out by a contractor. The study design and implementation was coordinated by the Project Team C-SAFIRE,  that bring together experts from the Member States.  Copyright picture: Airbus Defence & Space More information Public Executive Summary - Study to Inform Strategy on Counter-Surface-to-Air Fire (C-SAFIRE) in EU-Led Military Operations  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/06/20/study-on-counter-surface-to-air-fire-produces-strategy
EDA_NEWS_0273	2017-06-27	NEWS	Successful Infoday & Brokerage Event	 The European Commission (DG GROW) and the European Defence Agency (EDA) today jointly organised a successful Infoday and Brokerage event to inform interested parties on the Preparatory Action on Defence Research (PADR) and the details of the calls for proposals published on 7 June.  The event was attended by more than 300 participants representing a wide variety of companies (including SMEs), research centres, universities, Ministries of Defence, European institutions, regional/local authorities and defence related organisations. The gathering was opened by keynote speeches held by Philippe Brunet (Director for Space policy and Research, Copernicus and Defence within the European Commission’s Directorate General Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, DG GROW) and Jorge Domecq, the European Defence Agency Chief Executive.  In his speech, Mr Domecq said that “the tremendous interest in the Preparatory Action from industry across the continent is a testimony to the role industry and research organisations can and must play in delivering present and future European defence capabilities”. He added: “With this Preparatory Action, the Commission, supported by EDA, is making an important contribution to European defence that must provide European added value, focus on capability priorities at the European level and in areas where Member States can no longer afford to go alone, benefit all Member States, serve agreed capability priorities and provide incentives for more cooperation at European level, both among governments and industry”. Commission Director Philippe Brunet said that “the Preparatory Action is an incentive for Member States and research actors to do better and more together” in view of strengthening the industrial and technological base of Europe’s defence industry.  Participants received detailed presentations and participated in interactive information sessions on the first three PADR calls for proposals issued in June. The Brokerage event which took place in the afternoon provide participants with plenty of opportunities for networking with partners interested in forming consortia. The PADR has the objective to test the added-value of the EU budget supporting defence research, in view of a potential EU programme in the next EU Multi-annual Financial Framework. The PADR is being implemented by the EDA through a Delegation Agreement signed on 31 May between the EDA and the Commission.   More information:  Speech (full text) of Jorge Domecq Infoday Presentations & Conclusions PADR factsheet PADR project page PADR calls for proposals   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/06/27/successful-infoday-brokerage-event
EDA_NEWS_0274	2017-06-29	NEWS	EATT17 closes with advanced tactical airlift operations	 For the last two weeks, Beja Airbase in Portugal has hosted the European Air Transport Training 2017 (EATT17), the annual tactical airlift training event, which has become an important feature of the Portuguese and several other European air force’s annual airlift training programmes. Some 600 military personnel from seven Member States (Portugal, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, the United Kingdom), the European Air Transport Command (EATC) as well as observers from Brazil and Hungary participated in this sixth edition of EATT. The tragic loss of life in northern Portugal as a result of wildfires was a sombre backdrop to this year’s training. Understandably, a large element of the exercise’s firefighting and heavy lift equipment was redeployed to the rescue effort at very short notice. Nevertheless, the training continued with eight aircraft (see below) and ten aircrews from seven nations and over 600 supporting personnel in the form of ground engineers, paratroopers, logistic teams and normal operational support personnel drawn from the air force, army and navies of the contribution nations, underlining the inherently joint nature of contemporary operations and training. As in previous years, the focus of the second week has been on advanced tactical operations with the crews dropping tactical loads and paratroopers within an increasingly complex intelligence driven scenario.  The main effort is to operate the aircraft in packages of up to six  to form the mainstream of a Composite Air Operation (COMAO) mission with integrated fighter aircraft as protection.  The training has offered a very sharp reality check through the addition of surface-to-air threat emulators that illuminate the aircraft, testing their tactical ability and drawing lessons on the challenges of operating  in contested air environments.  The German A400M was a welcome new addition to this year’s event and was put through its paces by the exercise staff who are drawn from the EATC, the newly formed European Tactical Airlift Centre (ETAC), EDA and the multi-national Core Planning team from the contributing Member States.  The training also enjoyed a visit from observers from the Brazilian Air Force and a multi-disciplinary team from Hungary who is planning to run a future EATT from Papa airbase.  Despite the restrictions on airspace and equipment resulting from the operations to the north to counter the wildfires, the participating crews are unanimous in the need to run more multi-national events to improve interoperability and to share best practice in this critical operational domain. EATT17 (as of 2018 to be renamed European Tactical Airlift Project Training, ETAP-T) is also an important milestone for EDA in that it marks the first practical handover of a training activity from the Agency to the ETAC following the formal transfer of responsibility that occurred on 8th June 2017 in Zaragoza.  HRVP Mogherini and the Spanish Defence Minister Mme de Cospedal opened the ETAC in a joint ceremony, which also included the symbolic handover of the ETAC banner from EDA’s Chief Executive Jorge Domecq to the newly appointed ETAC commander. EDA will continue to support the 20-nation European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) Programme in other areas of airlift such as harmonisation of diplomatic clearances and the development of user groups for specific aircraft operators. Assets Germany (C-160 Transall and A400M Atlas), France (C-130H Hercules), the Netherlands (C-130H Hercules), Poland (C295), Portugal (C-130H Hercules), Romania (C-27J), and United Kingdom (C-130J Hercules).    More information: Pictures of the event are available here.

EDA_NEWS_0275	2017-06-20	NEWS	TACTICS project completed	 TACTICS (Tactical Service Oriented Architecture), an R&T project launched in 2014 by Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway and Poland through the European Defence Agency (EDA) and carried out by a consortium of 9 contracting partners and 2 sub-contractors* with the aim to define a Tactical Service Infrastructure (TSI) enabling military tactical radio networks to participate to Service Oriented Architectures (SOA), was brought to a successful closure at a final meeting of the TACTICS working group at the EDA premises on the 8 of June.  Military systems, communications and information infrastructures are increasingly becoming service-oriented, both on a national level and in the context of international collaboration. However, while research on Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) in classical business environments has produced satisfactory and well-established solutions, this is not the case for mobile/tactical environments in which operators have to deal with much more complex challenges (such as the limitations of disruptive and throughput-constrained networks, aggravated by limited end user devices) for which existing SOA technologies are not an answer.  EDA’s TACTICS project was thus launched in February 2014 to: propose measures to mitigate the constraints of military tactical environments so that they can also benefit from SOA; and to formally describe a Tactical Service Infrastructure (TSI) in a reference architecture following the NATO Architecture Framework (NAF).   Results  At the beginning of the project, military constraints, operational requirements and expected SOA benefits were collected and defined with the help of national military experts. On this basis, a reference architecture for a Tactical Service Infrastructure (TSI) was designed in such a way that it can cope with the constraints.  By performing a number of technology studies in dedicated fields of research, it was ensured that the TSI reference architecture encompasses up-to-date and also novel research results reaching from security policy management, traffic engineering, quality of service provision and interoperability mechanisms for semantic service registries.  The resulting TSI reference architecture describes how a future SOA-based middleware could be established and what mechanisms the middleware can take advantage of, to support user-facing services’ realisation in a tactical constrained environment. Multinational live demonstration The findings were shown in a multinational live demonstration. The demonstration, carried out on the 11/12 April 2017 in Ditzingen (Germany), incorporated national tactical radios (UHF and VHF) and an emulated long-range satellite connection. Based on this, the Consortium presented selected SOA benefits and technical innovations in the researched areas using a proof-of-concept implementation of the TSI and exemplary user-facing services.  *The consortium is composed of the following companies/institutions: Thales Deutschland (Consortium Coordinator), Fraunhofer FKIE, Germany (Technical Coordinator), Patria Aviation Oy (Finland), Thales Communications & Security (France), Leonardo (Italy), Thales Starmille (Italy), University of L’Aquila (Italy), Norwegian University of Science and Technology (Norway), ITTI (Poland), Military Communication Institute (Poland), Military University of Technology (Poland).   More information Official project’s web site  Watch this video on the TACTICS project  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/06/20/tactics-project-completed
EDA_NEWS_0276	2017-06-19	NEWS	European Air Transport Training 2017 takes off	 Today marks the start of the sixth European Air Transport Training (EATT2017). Hosted by Portugal, several hundred military personnel from Portugal, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania and the United Kingdom will train from June 19 to 30 at Air Base 11 (AB11) in Beja. This multinational exercise was initiated within the framework of the European Air Transport Fleet Programme of the European Defence Agency (EDA) and will be executed by the newly founded European Tactical Airlift Centre (ETAC) and supported by the European Air Transport Command (EATC).  The overall objective of this exercise is to achieve a high level of interoperability among air transport capable EDA Member States by exposing their crews to a complex operational environment, in which to practice their procedures and tactics and to gain  the necessary qualifications to perform tactical operations in current theatres of conflict and humanitarian relief. EATT2017 is set up to give the participating aircrews a variety of training, from basic tactical elements like practicing assault landings and air drop procedures to complex multi-ship combat mission profiles. The planning and execution is assisted by mentors, ensuring proper application of the common tactical guidelines. In parallel, training of Combined Air Terminal Operation (CATO) personnel is taking place on the ground, dealing with cargo preparation, loading of aircraft, and administrative procedures.  Around 100 paratroopers from Germany, France, the Netherlands, Poland, and Portugal will be deployed daily by mission aircraft. From the multi-organisational staff to the multi-national contingents, EATT2017 focuses on the overarching goal of increasing the interoperability of European airlift assets through training based on agreed common procedures. With already over 100 crews having received European tactical airlift training and over 2,000 hours flown in the past five years, EATT2017 follows in this spirit, and is a tangible example of improving Europe’s military airlift provision for a strong European defence. Assets and staff from seven Member States participate in EATT2017: Germany (C-160 Transall and A400M Atlas), France (C-130H Hercules), the Netherlands (C-130H Hercules), Poland (C295), Portugal (C-130H Hercules), Romania (C-27J), and United Kingdom (C-130J Hercules).    More information: EATF project page EATT2017 Factsheet 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/06/19/european-air-transport-training-2017-takes-off
EDA_NEWS_0277	2017-06-16	NEWS	14 EDA Member States to pool & share GOVSATCOM capabilities	 On June 15th the EDA Steering Board accepted, by written procedure, the Outline Description for the Governmental Satellite Communications (GOVSATCOM) Pooling and Sharing demonstration project (GSC demo). Under the leadership of Spain, the project brings together Austria, Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, France, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Norway, which has signed an Administrative Arrangement with the Agency, is also participating in the project. The next step will be the establishment of a Project Arrangement. The project originates from an EDA Steering Board decision of November 2013 which tasked EDA to pursue its work on GOVSATCOM coordination with Member States, the European Commission and the European Space Agency in order to propose a comprehensive programme for Member States who wish to participate. Subsequently, the task to prepare the next generation of GOVSATCOM was confirmed by the European Council in December 2013 and work on GOVSATCOM has also started at the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Commission. The main objective of the project is to meet the GOVSATCOM demands of Member States and European CSDP actors through pooled capabilities (bandwidth/power and/or services) provided by contributing Member States. This governmental pooled capability is set up to provide SATCOM resources that cannot be obtained on the commercial market  with a sufficient level of guaranteed access and security.  The Steering Board acceptance marks the end of the GOVSATCOM preparation phase where EDA employed a sequential approach in developing this project, analysing since 2014 satellite communication needs for European actors involved in the conduct of national or CSDP operations and detailing potential solutions to address the capability development.   The work in EDA has been supported by a feasibility study since mid-2015. This study identified the GOVSATCOM Information Exchange Requirements and provided a forecast tool assessing both defense satellite connectivity requirements in support of European CSDP activities and national operations of EU Member States, as well as civil government requirements for European government stakeholders. The focus was on communications requiring guarantee of access, security and autonomy that go beyond standard commercial satellite solutions, without requiring the highest level of security that only military satellite systems can provide.  The next step then was to carry out a detailed assessment of existing and planned commercial and governmental satellite systems and their suitability to meet the aforementioned requirements. The study relied on a variety of sources and analytical processes, including the use of an external study conducted for the European Commission on civil government requirements and studies conducted for ESA to define new satellite systems to fill gaps identified in the assessment part of the EDA GOVSATCOM feasibility study. In parallel with the study, EDA’s SATCOM project team developed the GOVSATCOM Common Staff Requirements and an associated Business Case. Both documents have been approved by the Steering Board in March 2017.  The Business Case closely follows a recommendation of the study for EDA to explore a Pooling and Sharing demonstration as part of the European GOVSATCOM initiative. The project will be put in place progressively with due consideration given to the impact it might have on suppliers, users and alternative frameworks. The Pooling and Sharing demonstration will require close cooperation, not only  between the Member States which contribute to the SATCOM capability pool and those who use it but also with the other GOVSATCOM activities pursued in ESA and the Commission. The Ad-Hoc Working Group of the GSC demo project, consisting of all 14 Member States and Norway, will now establish the Project Arrangement detailing the legal conditions for the project.   Background Reliable, stable and secure communications are crucial in any CSDP mission or operation. Yet, terrestrial network infrastructures are not available everywhere, for instance in areas hit by natural disasters, at sea, in the air or in hostile zones. Satellite communications (SATCOM) can be the solution: rapidly deployable, flexible and distance insensitive, they offer communication links where terrestrial networks are damaged, overloaded or non-existent. However, access to SATCOM cannot be taken for granted at any time, especially not when government users require them at short notice and without pre-arranged agreements. In situations of high demand, competition with other users of commercial SATCOM capacities creates a risk of non-availability and high costs. Against this backdrop, EU leaders decided in 2013 that there was a need for a new solution combining the advantages of commercial and military satellite systems in order to address both civil and military needs through European cooperation. The European Defence Agency, in collaboration with the European Commission and the European Space Agency, is now preparing the next generation of GOVSATCOM.  GOVSATCOM will be a capability that is placed in between the commercial satellite communication market and the highly protected military satellite communication capability.   More information: EDA factsheet GOVSATCOM EDA project page GOVSATCOM Video: GOVSATCOM - SATCOM for security and defence   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/06/16/14-eda-member-states-to-pool-share-govsatcom-capabilities
EDA_NEWS_0278	2017-06-19	NEWS	EDA launches its ‘ESIF web-platform’	 As a follow-up to the Commission’s European Defence Action Plan acknowledging that European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) may be used by Member States in the defence sector, the European Defence Agency publishes the “EDA’s ESIF web-platform” to provide any potential defence-related stakeholder (including MoDs, industry, research-and-technology organisations, academia, clusters) both with: an interactive analytical mapping on ‘sources’ of regional, national, and transnational calls for proposals under Structural Funds and respective contact details of the hundreds ESIF managing authorities ultimately in charge for funding allocation. For the financial framework running till 2020, ESIF are made up of 5 specific funds totaling more than 450 billion euros, matched nationally by additional 180 billion euros. In the defence sector, ESIF may co-fund productive investment projects, and support the modernisation of the defence supply chains. EDA’s work supporting access to ESIF is focused on the two main funds (together commonly referred as “Structural Funds”): the European Regional and Development Fund (ERDF) and its “Interreg” share, which can support - inter alia - defence activities and dual-use activities in research and innovation at regional, national and transnational/cooperative level;  the European Social Fund (ESF), which can support the development and enhancement of key skills and competencies (KSC) for defence. With regard to the ERDF, EDA has been technically assisting successfully funded pilot R&T project applications. Concerning ESF for KSC, an EDA’s procedure aimed at supporting free-of-charge the application to the ESF for selected pilot KSC-related projects  is currently underway through Ministries of Defence.

EDA_NEWS_0280	2017-06-09	NEWS	Second JDEAL Deployable Capability now fully operational	 After a final test run successfully conducted last week, the second Joint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory (JDEAL) recently delivered to the permanent JDEAL training facility in Soesterberg (The Netherands) has now reached its full operational capability (FOC). This means that with two deployable capabilities available for participating Member States, EDA’s JDEAL project - which will be extended until 2021 - has now met its primary level of objective. Both deployable laboratories, considered to be key tools for improving the fight against improvised explosive devices (IEDs), are thus now ready for deployment upon requests by Member States. The new second laboratory is fully based on mission essential equipment and comes with a lighter housing version than the first one. Awaiting future deployments, both laboratories will be displayed during the next technical exploitation at the JDEAL Training Facilities in Soesterberg on 5/6 September 2017.   More information: EDA programme launched to improve IED Detection (webnews January 2017) Counter-IED (EDA project page) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/06/09/second-jdeal-deployable-capability-now-fully-operational
EDA_NEWS_0281	2017-06-02	NEWS	EDA-supported project awarded European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) in Estonia	 An Estonian research project on the technical aspects and threat vectors of cyber hygiene has been awarded co-funding (70%) under the main ESIF: the European Regional and Development Fund (ERDF). This 300,000 Euro applied research project is the first stage of a wider 3 million Euro project. The Estonian project holder, the Small-and-Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) CYBEXER TECHNOLOGIES OÜ, is a Tallinn-based joint company that will also provide the required ‘match funding’ (i.e. 30% of the total project). The TALLINN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, at the origin of the project idea, will also benefit from the ERDF co-funding. Following EDA’s procedure in 2015 requesting Member States’ Ministries of Defence to identify and propose promising dual-use R&T projects, this Estonian project was selected by EDA to benefit from EDA free-of-charge technical assistance aimed at maximising its chance to access ESIF. As usual, flexibility has been key to success: under EDA’s free-of-charge technical support, the original project has undergone decisive adaptations. Like in the previous pilot case awarded in Portugal  in 2016, EDA’s methodology addressing ERDF within the current multiannual financial framework running till 2020 has again proved to be successful. Above mentioned Estonian and Portuguese successful cases add to earlier two EDA-supported dual-use R&T projects, another Portuguese and a Polish, both co-funded too, under a first EDA support process launched in 2013. EDA has also recently launched a similar assistance process focusing on access to the second main fund among ESIF, the European Social Fund (ESF), in support of key skills and competencies for defence (KSC). Under this procedure [“ESF4KSC”], MoDs may forward to EDA (by the 18th of September 2017) KSC-related projects collected nationally from stakeholders.

The opening of ETAC marks a significant step forward in European defence cooperation and joint collaboration with the establishment of a permanent operational base for advanced tactical airlift training. Today (June 8) Zaragoza officially became the home of the European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) Training Programme in a ceremony marking the transfer of this project from the EDA to Spain. The newly created European Tactical Airlift Centre (ETAC) will serve as the permanent home for this project. Created by EDA in 2011, and signed by 20 participating nations, the EATF partnership aims to increase the EU’s airlift capabilities by addressing shortages and increasing interoperability. A flag handover ceremony between EDA Chief Executive, Jorge Domecq, and the ETAC Commander, Colonel Jose Luis Romero, marked the official project transfer of EATF training activities from the EDA to ETAC.   ETAC: Transfer from EDA to a permanent host nation The opening of the ETAC represents the largest transfer of a project, created and developed by the EDA, to one of its Member States on a permanent basis. Speaking about what this transfer means, EDA Chief Executive, Jorge Domecq, said: “This is significant moment for European defence cooperation and the EDA. This new centre is the culmination of 6 years of development in the EDA, I am proud that this project has reached maturity and will be transferred to the leadership of Spain as a new and permanent host nation. ETAC demonstrates exactly how the EDA enables positive defence collaboration and delivers real capability improvement for our Member States.”   Federica Mogherini (Head of the EDA, EU High Representative and Vice-President of the European Commission), Dolores de Cospedal (Minister of Defence of Spain)   ETAC: The new home of European tactical airlift   The establishment of a permanent multinational airlift training centre (ETAC) marks a major step forward in European defence collaboration in the critical capability domain of tactical airlift. 11 nations are the owners of this agreement (BE, BG, CZ, DE, ES, FR, IT, LU, NL, PT and NO) and they will share the burden to plan, organize and execute Advanced Airlift Courses, Training and Symposia in different locations (France, Italy, Bulgaria, Portugal & Sweden) by using a permanent lean command and control structure based at Zaragoza. ETAC will be manned by experts from the different participating nations on a rotational basis. The first composition will be made up from Spanish, Italian, German and French officers, who will be replaced within 3 to 4 years with staff from the remaining signatory nations.    Federica Mogherini   EAATTC 17-3: 11th training course successfully concludes In parallel to the ETAC opening, the graduating crews of the third European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course for 2017 (EAATTC 17-3) were also presented with certificates by members of the visiting delegation. Four crews, representing three Member States (Germany: C160; Poland C130 and Spain: C295 and C130) received their certificates following the completion of the two-week training course. Over 120 personnel were involved including support personnel from Italy, Belgium, the European Air Transport Command (EATC) and JAPCC. The training provided air transport crews with a focused airlift tactics training syllabus specifically designed to enhance interoperability between European air forces. Nine missions were executed, including very low level tactical flights, fighter engagement and evasive maneuvers from ground-to-air threats all trying to stop the air drops of critical cargo and paratroopers.  Each crew flew an average of 20 hours in a particularly demanding environment and completed several successful tactical flights to successfully graduate from the course.    Jorge Domecq (EDA Chief Executive), Federica Mogherini, Dolores de Cospedal   3D-Printing in defence: Successful test deployment of AM facility   EDA’s ground-breaking project, “Additive Manufacturing Feasibility Study & Technology Demonstration”, successfully deployed a 3D-printing lab to Zaragoza for the duration of EAATTC 17-3. The project aims to assess the areas where Additive Manufacturing (3D-printing) can have a positive impact on defence capabilities and to demonstrate the feasibility of on-site critical component manufacture. On May 31st, the lab was loaded on a Spanish C-130 and successfully completed a 30 minute flight. This test was pivotal to examining the feasibility of the facility to be deployed by air. After landing, the lab and its equipment was inspected and found to have encountered no issues from the airlift.  During the deployment, the AM lab generated a lot of interest from the multinational units involved in EAATTC 17-3. Lab technicians worked closely with EAATTC 17-3 officials in the design and production of different test parts. Through these interactions, the technicians were able to gather ideas to print parts on-site and on-demand. The deployment also underscored the strong interest and potential of AM technologies across all military branches (pilots, maintenance, technicians and logistic support), who were keen to learn how 3D-printing could benefit their area of expertise.  The deployment has been successful in terms of showcasing the technologies and raising awareness of their operational application. Furthermore, the lessons learned from the deployment and test flight of the AM lab will also contribute to shaping the design and requirement of future 3D-printing facilities.  The results of this feasibility demonstration will be presented in September, as part of an exhibition (Exploring Additive Manufacturing impact in Defence capabilities) to high-ranking military staff, to raise awareness on the possible impact of AM in defence.   More information:  EDA Fact sheet on EAATTC 17-3 EDA Fact sheet on 3D-printing   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/06/08/european-tactical-airlift-centre-opens-in-zaragoza

The latest European Defence Matters magazine is now available with a special focus on the EU’s Space Strategy and its implications, opportunities and challenges for Defence.  NEW: the magazine is now also available ONLINE in a user-friendly, state of the art responsive lay-out and accessible via all your devices: smartphone, tablet or desktop!  Check it out HERE Space-based civilian services have become indispensable in everyone's daily lives. Think of satellite TV, mobile phones, navigation systems in cars or taking the plane.  But Europe’s space policy is also gaining prominence in the context of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP): space-based communication, situational awareness, and navigation and earth-observation capabilities play an increasingly critical role in security and defence.  Against this backdrop, the new Space Strategy for Europe takes on a wider, much more significant meaning. For the first time ever, the EU identifies space as a ‘strategic asset’ for strengthening European security & defence and even a core element in achieving Europe’s objective of ‘strategic autonomy’. Reason enough to make of ‘Space & Defence’ the main dossier for this 13th edition of European Defence Matters.  We analyse the Space Strategy’s defence-related aspects and repercussions, especially in connection with the Commission’s European Defence Action Plan (EDAP), and give the floor to the main actors in this field: European Commissioner Elżbieta Bieńkowska, European External Action Service’s (EEAS) special envoy for space François Rivasseau, EU Satellite Centre (SatCen) director Pascal Legai, European Space Agency (ESA) Director General Jan Woerner as well as European Defence Agency (EDA) Chief Executive Jorge Domecq. To hear the European space industry’s views, we speak to Jean-Loïc Galle who is not only CEO of Thales Alenia Space but also President of ASD-Eurospace. Frank Haun, the President & CEO of Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) and Co-CEO of KMW+Nexter Defense Systems (KNDS), is our guest for this edition’s ‘Industry Talk’ in which he makes a plea for consolidation and streamlining to strengthen Europe’s defence industry.  In the same vein, the head of McKinsey & Company’s activities in the defence sector in EMEA,  Wolff van Sintern, tells us in a very interesting interview how important it is for Europe to overcome the current fragmentation of its defence market, to boost cooperation and to achieve greater integration based on standardized requirements and equipment. The analysis by Daniel Fiott (Security & Defence editor at the EU Institute for Security Studies) of the EU’s defence policy 60 years after the Treaty of Rome is another highlight.

EDA_NEWS_0286	2017-05-31	NEWS	Commission and EDA sign Delegation Agreement for Preparatory Action on Defence Research	 The European Commission Director-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, Lowri Evans, and the Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency (EDA), Jorge Domecq, today signed a Delegation Agreement by which the Commission entrusts the EDA with the management of the Preparatory Action on Defence Research (PADR) to be launched in early June. The signing was attended by Commissioner Elżbieta Bieńkowska, Deputy Director General Pierre Delsaux (DG GROW) as well as Jean-Eric Paquet, the Commission's Deputy Secretary-General. The aim of the Preparatory Action, which is the first substantial EU funded action for defence research, is to demonstrate the added-value of EU-funded research in the defence sector. Running over a three-year period (2017-2019), the PADR will be a genuine test-bed for proving the relevance of European defence research and laying the foundations for a fully-fledged EU defence R&D programme in the Multi-annual Financial Framework beginning in 2021. It is a central element of the ‘Research Window’ of the European Defence Fund proposed by the Commission last November. The PADR will provide European added value as the research projects will focus on capability priorities at European level, notably through the Capability Development Plan (CDP), and on areas where Member States can no longer afford to act alone. Thereby, it will also create new incentives for cooperation both among governments and industry. At the signing ceremony, Commissioner Elżbieta Bieńkowska stated: “The Commission is ready to play its role to the full and to even put EU funds and legal frameworks to support defence research and defence capabilities. This is potentially a game changer. However, to achieve this we need the expertise of the EDA. Together we can make a real difference. This partnership will continue to be important as we build the Defence Fund with the implementation of the European Defence Industrial Development Programme”. EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq thanked the Commission for making the Delegation Agreement possible and said the EDA was looking forward to a good and fruitful implementation. He stated: “Our work in carrying forward the Preparatory Action will be in line with EDA’s role as central operator for EU funded defence related activities as well as the preferred cooperation forum and management support structure at EU level for participating Member States to engage in technology and capability development activities, highlighted at EDA’s last Ministerial Steering Board. I am proud we have successfully achieved this agreement which lays the basis for a sound and fruitful cooperation between the Commission and EDA for the years to come. It is a balanced Delegation Agreement in which the Commission and EDA will be genuine partners. The Preparatory Action on Defence Research will be the test bed for the coming European Defence Research Programme”.   Foundations laid by successful Pilot Project The foundations for the Preparatory Action were laid last year with the successful launch of a much smaller ‘Pilot Project on Defence Research’ which is also managed by the EDA on the basis of a Delegation Agreement signed in November 2015. The Pilot Project was a first opportunity for the EDA to demonstrate its ability to manage EU funding for defence research. Mr Domecq stressed that the Agency was now ready and well prepared to run the much bigger PADR with its €90 million budget of which €25 million are earmarked for 2017. The EDA played an important ‘upstream role’ in setting up the Preparatory Action and will also have a crucial ‘downstream’ task to fulfil, as a hub for the exploitation of the outcome of the different R&T projects under the PADR.   Next steps Now that the Delegation Agreement is signed, the EDA will immediately proceed with its implementation. The first step will be the launch, on 7 June, of the 2017 calls for proposals. An Information Day is then scheduled for 27 June in order to inform entities from industry and the research community (including universities) about the opportunities and modalities of the Preparatory Action. Proposals can be submitted by the autumn and the signature of the first grant agreements is envisaged by the end of this year. Calls for 2018 proposals are expected to be launched early next year.   More information: EDA factsheet on PADR Practical details on 27 June Information Day Preparatory Action on Defence Research: Commission adopts financial decision with project détails (EDA webnews, April 2017) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/05/31/commission-and-eda-sign-delegation-agreement-for-preparatory-action-on-defence-research
EDA_NEWS_0287	2017-06-02	NEWS	Successful test flight for EDA 3D-printing lab during deployment at EAATTC 17-3	 In a major step forward for EDA’s innovative Additive Manufacturing (AM or 3D-printing) in defence project, the AM lab completed a successful test flight on-board a Spanish C-130, fulfilling all airlift requirements for a military deployment and civilian transport. The test flight,  part of the simulated deployment the 3D-printing facility is currently undergoing at the European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course (EAATTC 17-3) in Zaragoza, was pivotal to examining its feasibility to be deployed by air. EDA’s ground-breaking project, “Additive Manufacturing Feasibility Study & Technology Demonstration”, aims to assess the areas where Additive Manufacturing (AM) (3D-printing)  can have a positive impact on defence capabilities and to demonstrate its feasibility. The second work strand of this project is currently underway in Zaragoza as part of EDA’s airlift training course - EAATTC 17-3. In the morning of May 31st, the lab was loaded on-board a Spanish C-130 and completed a successful 30 minute flight. This test was pivotal to examining the feasibility of the facility to be deployed by air. After landing, the lab and its equipment was inspected and found to have encountered no issues from the airlift.  The lab has now been transferred to its final location in Zaragoza airbase where it will begin producing test parts. Over the next week, technicians will interact with the officials deployed at EAATTC 17-3, presenting the possibilities offered by the equipment, and identifying in close dialogue what are the main needs in an operation that could be fulfilled by an AM facility. Together, the technicians and the officials will select a number of different test parts to be produced on site and on demand, with different grades of complexity.  The project represents a clear example of how cross-fertilization of ideas from different domains, from R&T to operations, will enhance defence capabilities, especially when supporting deployed missions. The overall study has the objective of raising awareness in the defence community and of promoting a better understanding of the potential held by these technologies, thereby stimulating their implementation in defence specific areas.    AM Facility on display at ETAC opening On June 8 the new European Tactical Airlift Centre (ETAC) will be officially opened by Head of the EDA, High Representative and Vice-President of the European Commission, Federica Mogherini and Minister of Defence of Spain Dolores de Cospedal.

EDA has issued to Ministries of Defence (MoDs) a “Request for Projects” to collect projects enhancing Key Skills and Competencies for Defence (KSC).  Industry, Research-and-Technology Organisations, Universities, entities of the MOD/Armed Forces, as well as other holders of potential projects supporting KSC, can address their MoD to receive the relevant documentation in view of submitting KSC-related projects to their MoD for further submission to the EDA. Once received KSC-related project proposals through the MoD (by the deadline September 18, 2017), EDA will then select some to benefit free-of-charge from high-level advisory services on ESF requirements and to fully develop the application folder, by eventually applying in response to ESF Calls for Proposals. Since 2014 EDA assists various defence stakeholders to access to EU funding and has been successfully supporting selected pilot dual-use R&T projects applying to the main ESIF, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), thereby paving the way to the acknowledgement that ESIF may fund defence projects [see European Defence Action Plan, COM(2016) 950, 30/11/2016]. Based on past and ongoing EDA’s studies, now EDA addresses its support to access EU funding both to skills in defence industry/RTOs and procurement competencies in MoDs/Armed Forces.    More information: Contact EDA on this procedure (“ESF4KSC RfP”) EDA’s work on Access to EU funding EDA’s work on Key Skills and Competencies for Defence EDA’s work in support of Small-and-Medium-Sized Enterprises EDA’s webpage “Industry Info”   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/05/23/eda-launches-esf4ksc-access-to-the-european-social-fund-for-key-skills-and-competencies-for-defence
EDA_NEWS_0290	2017-05-22	NEWS	FIRE BLADE 2017: 11th EDA Helicopter exercise concludes after successful live firing operations	 Exercise FIRE BLADE 2017, which was hosted by the Hungarian Defence Forces, came to an end on Thursday 11 May 2017 and was officially closed by the acting Chief of the Hungarian Air Force, Colonel Pal Szűcs and LTC Roel Cuppes, who represented the EDA. This was the 11th helicopter exercise under the umbrella of EDA’s Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP). With 16 air assets and roughly 500 military participants, it once again proved the immense value of collaborative training for the troops, aircrew, maintenance and support personnel who took part. Organised at Pápa in Hungary, the Exercise proved to be a high-tempo, dynamic event. A total of 250 flight hours were accumulated, almost 28000 ammunition rounds and 480 non-guided rockets fired. The five participating Member States (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Slovenia and Hungary) participated with 14 different European helicopters. The first week included a complete day of briefings covering flight safety, expected battle rhythm and host nation support, weapon range procedures and a review of joint helicopter tactics. This theoretical element was followed with familiarisation of the aircrew with Pápa airbase, emergency rehearsals with firefighters and (SOF) troops to take account of the different helicopters types and to ensure high safety levels were achieved in all areas.  The first week continued with individual training, helicopter operations by day and night, fighter evasion missions with Hungarian JAS-39 GRIPEN jets and live-fire training on the different weapon ranges. Despite significant bad weather with low cloud and thunderstorms, all day and night missions were completed successful. In the second week, the shooting ranges north of Lake Balaton were fully utilised, allowing the flying participants to train in a highly realistic mixed rural and urban environment and adapt their thinking to complex missions with integrated live-firing scenarios. As the exercise matured, the multi-national crews conducted coalition level training, which culminated in the planning and execution of  7 Composite Air Operation (COMAO) missions. These covered a spectrum of advanced helicopter manoeuvre tactics including a large formation of helicopters with embarked troops and integrated training Joint Terminal Air Controllers (JTAC), set against complex threats such as SA-6 SAM, T-72 Main Battle tanks and GRIPEN fighter aircraft. The experience of working together and practicing live firing tactics in combined and joint missions is a critical requirement to maintain operational readiness at a realistic level. With most nations working within tight financial constraints, this level of advanced training is virtually impossible to achieve on a purely national basis.  However, in addition to the cost sharing benefits, the exercise also offers a step change in improved interoperability which has become the hallmark of the HEP. In his closing remarks, the Exercise Director expressed his appreciation to everyone who had contributed to the success of the exercise: “During this two week period all of you demonstrated a high sense of commitment and accomplished your tasks with diligence and professionalism. We come from different nations, with different languages, but we have the same missions and the same challenges to address. You have demonstrated that working together is the only solution to achieve our appointed tasks and reaching success.” Even as the Exercise draws to a close, work to identify critical lessons begins.  FIRE BLADE 2017 is but a waypoint in the Programme’s objective of continuous improvement of European helicopter operational capability.   The job now is to build on this excellent foundation as we move forward to the next exercise in Portugal in June 2018.   More information: Fact Sheet Exercise FIRE BLADE 2017 Helicopter Initiatives (EDA project page) 11th EDA Helicopter Exercise “FIRE BLADE” ready for take-off in Hungary!  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/05/22/fire-blade-2017-11th-eda-helicopter-exercise-concludes-after-successful-live-firing-operations
EDA_NEWS_0291	2017-05-17	NEWS	Second Test and Evaluation Community Days Conference held in Vienna	 The second Conference on Test and Evaluation (T&E) was held in Vienna on 24-27 April 2017 with the title “European priorities - challenges and opportunities for a large EU network of T&E Centres“. Building on the success of the first conference held in Rome in 2014, the Vienna conference was attended by around 100 experts from 17 EDA Member States, the European defence industry, and the European Commission, as well as NATO representatives. The aim was to provide a forum for the T&E community to exchange ideas, information and experiences. The conference was opened by Lieutenant General Norbert Gehart, Armament Director, Austrian Federal Ministry for National Defence and Sport, and Mr Rini Goos, Deputy Chief Executive, European Defence Agency, and was hosted by the Austrian Armament and Defence Technology Agency. The conference sessions were moderated by the EDA Cooperation Panning and Support Director Mr. Roland Van Reybroeck, together with members of the Defence Test and Evaluation Base (DTEB) Plenary Group. Current challenges for T&E requirements derived from the Capability Development Plan (CDP) in the wider context of the under the EU Global Strategy provided the basis for more than 20 presentations and interactive discussions among conference participants. European T&E cooperation examples and visits to Austrian test facilities provided practical insights and the opportunity to exchange experiences and lessons learned. Main results of the conference included the acknowledgment of common challenges facing the T&E community and the need for a large European network of test facilities. Test and evaluation was recognized as a key enabler in support ofEU capability development priorities contributing to the objectives of the EU Global Strategy Implementation Plan on Security and Defence. The conference encouraged participating Member States to enhance cooperation and coordination of T&E initiatives under the EDA umbrella, to improve awareness of existing T&E capabilities, to explore opportunities for civil and military cooperation and to maintain and further develop key skills and competences in the T&E domain to the largest extent possible.   Background The Test and Evaluation Community Days Conference is an EDA initiative held every three years in cooperation with a participating Member State. It brings together experts from Europe’s government Test Centres, project managers, T&E Directors, and European Defence Technology Industry Base (DTIB) representatives to exchange information, learn from each other and initiate new T&E projects, and create strategic networks to support EU forces.   More information: EDA prepares inter-laboratory test round to counter electromagnetic effects on operations (News, July 2016) Inaugural Test and Evaluation conference delivers results (December 2014) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/05/17/second-test-and-evaluation-community-days-conference-held-in-vienna
EDA_NEWS_0292	2017-05-12	NEWS	Cyber Ranges: EDA’s First Ever Cyber Defence Pooling & Sharing Project Launched By 11 Member States	 On May 5th, the Project Arrangement (PA) for the first ever Cyber Defence Pooling & Sharing Project was signed by all eleven contributing Member States. The Cyber Ranges Federation Project brings together Austria, Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Finland, Ireland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden  under the co-lead of the Netherlands, Finland and Greece. The project originates from an EDA initiative and will be carried out under the EU pooling & sharing agenda with support from EDA. The core aims of the project include: increasing the availability of existing and emerging cyber range facilities; increasing the occupation rate and efficiency of cyber ranges and platforms;  mainstream and improve cyber defence training, exercises and testing at European level. Under this PA, the objectives will be achieved in a spiral approach over the next 36 months. The Cyber Ranges Federation Project is the first of four Cyber Defence Projects launched so far under the Pooling & Sharing agenda. While other projects such as Improved Cyber Situation Awareness, improved Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) detection, and pooling of Member States’ demand for private sector-provided cyber training are still in the preparation phase, the Cyber Ranges Federation Project is the first cyber defence related collaborative EDA project that is moving from the preparation phase to the implementation phase. A total of 30 work packages are foreseen for the project, divided between two spirals. Work on the first spiral, composed of 19 different work packages, will commence with the first meeting of the Project Management Committee under the lead of the Netherlands. Spiral 1 is expected to be completed within 18 months. The remaining 11 work packages will be completed after a review of the results of spiral 1 under the lead of Finland in spiral 2. It is expected that the projects will substantially contribute to improving the quality and authenticity of cyber defence related education, training and exercise formats for all stakeholders in Europe. This will be achieved by providing on the one hand wide ranging and capable technical platforms and on the other by establishing a European community of experts on up-to-date cyber defence training and exercises.  The sharing of knowledge and best practice is also an implicit objective of the project. In doing so, the Cyber Ranges Federation will also be supported by an EDA developed web-based Cyber Defence Training and Exercise Coordination Platform (CD TEXP), which is expected to be operational by the end of this year. In addition to training and exercise support, the cyber ranges can also be effectively employed in the areas of research as well as modelling, simulation and testing. Project preparation was observed by NATO, and in the light of the NATO-EU Joint Declaration, additional ways for cooperation with the project of NATO to establish its own cyber range capacity will be sought by the contributing Member States.     Background The success of military operations, including EU-led operations, is increasingly dependent on the availability of, and access to, cyberspace. The EU Cyber Security Strategy 2013 recognizes Cyber Defence as one of the strategic priorities of the EU and Heads of State and Governments decided in December 2013 that Cyber Defence should be one of four key areas for capability development.  An essential element of EU cyber defence capability is highly skilled and well-trained personnel. Enhancing awareness and education of technicians, operators and decision-makers is urgent. Cyber ranges to support training and exercises are both essential and scarce. In the 2014 Capability Development Plan, the scarceness of cyber range facilities in support of Training and Exercises was recognized as an important capability gap that urgently needs resolution. The now established project serves to close this capability gap. Pooling & Sharing projects are an integral means for closing capability gaps in the cyber domain.    More information: Cyber: EDA, ENISA, EC3 and CERT-EU discuss future cooperation EDA supports Operation Sophia with Cyber Awareness Seminars (webnews November 2016) Cyber Defence (EDA project page) Cyber defence factsheet 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/05/12/cyber-ranges-eda-s-first-ever-cyber-defence-pooling-sharing-project-launched-by-11-member-states
EDA_NEWS_0293	2017-05-16	NEWS	Call for submissions: EDA Defence Industry workshop looking at the long-term outlook for RPAS	 EDA has opened a call for submissions from defence industry representatives on the topic of Remotely Piloted Air Systems (RPAS). This call is in response to the agreement between EDA defence ministers to develop a more structured and regular dialogue with industry. In this domain, the EDA has developed an approach that is supported by Member States and invites defence industry representatives and research institutes to respond to the call for papers (attachment below). Submissions must be sent to the EDA by the 16th of June 2017.   The aim of the process is to enrich the CDP long-term view with industry inputs on the long term perspective of the industrial and technological outlook for specific capability areas. This will not be a forum for discussing the commercial aspects of current systems but a dialogue intended to explore the long-term (20 years ahead) aspects of military warfare focused on Remotely Piloted Air Systems (RPAS). The EDA will hold a one day workshop on the 12th of September 2017. Selected industry representatives will be invited to share their views of long-term outlooks focusing on the questions listed in the questionnaire.  Speakers will be selected based on this call for papers, which will be evaluated by the EDA. Submissions are sought from as wide as possible a range of industries involved in aspects of development related to RPAS. Though responses to all questions in the questionnaire are encouraged, submitters may develop answers to specific questions in greater detail based on their area of expertise. This will allow thematic discussion panels to be formed. Submissions will be judged on their innovativeness and relevance as well as ability to stimulate discussion on the future role of RPAS in the military context.

EDA_NEWS_0294	2017-05-18	NEWS	Outcome of EDA Ministerial Steering Board	 At the European Defence Agency’s (EDA) ministerial Steering Board which met this Thursday morning under the chairmanship of HR/VP Federica Mogherini in her capacity as Head of the Agency, Defence ministers endorsed the conclusions & recommendations of EDA’s Long Term Review (LTR), approved the establishment the Cooperative Financial Mechanism (CFM) as an EDA Ad-Hoc Cat A programme and encouraged the Agency to continue, together with the EEAS, its work on the definition of the planned Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD). The Long Term Review (LTR) conclusions and recommendations endorsed by Ministers will reinforce the Agency to keep it fit for purpose in the light of upcoming, more ambitious tasks and challenges deriving from the EU’s new Global Strategy. Set to be implemented over the coming months, the agreed measures will strengthen the EDA as the main intergovernmental prioritisation instrument at EU level in support of capability development, with a more output-oriented Capability Development Plan (CDP) and a key role in operating the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD). They also will enhance the EDA as the preferred cooperation forum and management support structure at EU level to engage in technology and capability development activities, ranging from R&T to critical enablers, exercise and training as well as support to operations, including the industrial dimension. The Agency is also to be reinforced as an interface between Member States and EU institutions and as a central operator for EU-funded defence-related activities such as, for example, the upcoming Preparatory Action on defence research and the future European Defence Research Programme.   Cooperative Financial Mechanism (CFM) Ministers welcomed the financial and legal package presented by the Agency and approved the setting up of an Cooperative Financial Mechanism as an EDA Ad-Hoc CAT A programme. Negotiations with Member States on a Programme Arrangement will start soon. The EDA was invited to report to the Steering Board on progress made during these negotiations before the signature of the Programme Arrangement. The objective of the Cooperative Financial Mechanism, to which contributing Member States would participate and contribute on a strictly voluntary basis, is to incentivize defence cooperation by overcoming the lack of budgetary synchronisation between Member States and the problems that this causes for the launch of cooperative defence cooperation projects. Experience has shown that unsynchronized budget availability at the launch phase of a collaborative programme is one of the key challenges. Through the CFM, Member States can support each other via a system of reimbursable advances and deferred payments. The mechanism can also be used more widely as a hub for managing investments, such as EDA R&T projects, and ring-fencing resources allocated for cooperative purposes. It will facilitate the launch of collaborative projects and have positive repercussions in capability, technological and industrial terms.   Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD) Ministers welcomed the work carried out by the EDA, in close cooperation with EEAS, on the definition of the scope, principles, methodology and detailed modalities of the CARD which will start with a trial run as of this autumn. The Agency was encouraged to pursue this work. Minister agreed to present a report on the trial run to the Steering Board in November 2018. The CARD aims at facilitating Member States delivering in particular on EU capability development priorities agreed in the framework of the Capability Development Plan (CDP). The CARD will also allow Defence Ministers to regularly take stock of the European capability development landscape, assess progress in cooperative capability development to date and share information on defence spending plans.   Engagement with industry, other topics Ministers endorsed EDA’s revised approach towards establishing a structured dialogue and enhanced engagement with industry based on a set of priority actions focused on the capability development process, exercises, R&T prioritization, innovation, SES/SESAR, Key Strategic Activities and support to industry. These priorities will guide the 2017-2018 activities of EDA in relation to industry. The Steering Board tasked the Agency with presenting an assessment report of these priorities and their implementation in November 2018. Ministers also welcomed the work already conducted by the EDA on the Preparatory Action on Defence Research, with the Delegation Agreement expected to be signed end of May. Ministers also took stock of the Agency’s main cooperative programmes (such as, for example, Air-to-Air Refuelling, Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems - RPAS, GovSatCom and Cyberdefence) and reviewed the progress made in other projects within the portfolio of more than 50 capability projects currently run by the EDA. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/05/18/outcome-of-eda-ministerial-steering-board
EDA_NEWS_0295	2017-05-18	NEWS	Zaragoza to permanently host the European Tactical Airlift Centre from June	 On June 8 the new European Tactical Airlift Centre (ETAC) will be officially opened by Head of the EDA, High Representative and Vice-President of the European Commission, Federica Mogherini and Minister of Defence of Spain Dolores de Cospedal. ETAC represents one of the largest transfers of a project, created and developed by the EDA, to one of its Member States on a permanent basis.  Zaragoza will officially become the home of the European Air Transport Fleet (EAFT) Programme on June 8th in a ceremony marking the transfer of this project from the EDA to Spain. Created in 2011 by EDA, and signed by 20 participating nations, the EATF partnership aims to increase the EU’s airlift capabilities by addressing shortages and increasing interoperability. The establishment of a permanent multinational airlift training centre (ETAC) marks a major step forward in European defence collaboration in the critical capability domain of tactical airlift.    An EDA first: Joint Deployment of EAATTC 17-3 and 3D Printing Lab  The third European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course for 2017 (EAATTC 17-3), hosted by the Spanish Airforce at Zaragoza airbase will run from 28 May to 9 June 2017. This edition of EAATTC gathers five aircraft from four different countries (Belgium: C130; Germany: C160; Poland C130 and Spain: C295 and C130). This training aims to provide air transport crews with a robust airlift tactics training syllabus in order to enhance interoperability between European air forces. The graduation ceremony for participating aircrew will take place as part of the opening of the ETAC on June 8 2017. As part of EDA’s approach to explore new avenues for defence cooperation and enabling technologies, its innovative project on 3D printing in defence will be deployed as part of EAATTC 17-3. The project, officially titled “Additive Manufacturing Feasibility Study & Technology Demonstration”, aims to assess the areas where Additive Manufacturing (AM) (3D printing)  can have a positive impact on defence capabilities and to demonstrate its feasibility.  The second work strand of this project is a technology demonstration of AM in a simulated deployment scenario. Its aim is to demonstrate the feasibility and operational utility of deploying these technologies in support of a military operation. The deployment of the 3D printing lab represents a significant step in bridging the data gap on 3D printer performance in deployed conditions and will demonstrate the operational utility of these technologies.  First of all the lab will be deployed on a test flight to examine its feasibility to be deployed by air. During the exercise the lab technicians will interact with the officials deployed at EAATTC 17-3, presenting the possibilities offered by the equipment, and identifying in a close dialogue with them what are the main needs in an operation that could be fulfilled with an AM facility. Together, the technicians the officials will select a number of different test parts to be produced on site and on demand, with different grades of complexity.  The project represents a clear example of how cross-fertilization of ideas from different domains, from R&T to operations, will enhance defence capabilities, especially when supporting deployed missions. The overall study has the objective of raising awareness in the defence community and of promoting a better understanding of the potential held by these technologies, thereby stimulating their implementation in defence specific areas.   Media Day – June 8 Members of the media can avail of a special one day media flight from Brussels to Zaragoza airbase (kindly provided by the Belgian Ministry of Defence) for the opening of ETAC. All details can be found here. On June 8 EDA will be live from Zaragoza airbase for special coverage of the opening of ETAC.  Throughout the day we will be bringing you live updates on twitter of the opening ceremony, graduation of aircrews, interviews and visits to the 3D printing lab. Visit our twitter page (@EUDefenceAgency) and get involved using #EUdefence.   More information: EDA consultation to identify impact of 3D-printing technologies in defence EDA letter - support to Additive Manufacturing feasibility study & technology demonstration EDA news on the AM kick-off meeting (December 2016)     	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/05/18/zaragoza-to-permanently-host-the-european-tactical-airlift-center-from-june

EDA_NEWS_0297	2017-05-04	NEWS	Delivered EDA study to help improve medical support for ,,small” operations	 The larger a military operation is in size (Member States, troops, equipment involved), the more sophisticated and complete the medical support tends to be. The military medical support options in Europe used to be designed and optimised for military operations of a larger scale. For some of the current missions conducted in the context of the European Union’s Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP), such as antipiracy or training missions, a far smaller number of personnel has to be deployed than in the operations mentioned above. Against that background EDA carried out the study “Medical Support to Light Footprint Operations” which involved EDA’s ‘Project Team Medical’ and other Ad Hoc Medical Working Groups. The key issue investigated by the study was to keep the quality of medical support at the highest possible level for missions of smaller scale. The overarching goal was to provide participating Member States with the analytical means to identify new ways of providing effective medical support to so-called ‘Light Footprint Operations’ (LFO) in the context of CSDP. As LFOs are not formally described in current EU or NATO doctrines, there is no agreed set of principles or best practices to tailor medical support to this type of missions. The study commissioned by EDA analysed key elements of LFOs provides recommendations on a way forward on how to tailor and improve medical support for LFOs, namely: EU Medical Concept - requirements for medical support for LFOs and best practices for the provision of medical support must be introduced into the current EU Medical Concept; Further harmonization of qualification, material and concepts – based on lessons identified in recent CSDP missions, including difficulties and major obstacles, the study describes options for improved interoperability between units providing medical support, including to facilitate harmonisation and standardisation; Categorization of Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) - based on lessons identified in recent CSDP missions, the study analyzed that the concept of allocation roles should be revisited to consider modularization of medical units as a cost-effective way; New technologies and research activities - the study indicates opportunities for multinational cooperation in development and research activities for new technologies, that could be used for both reduce the footprint of medical support in LFOs and the improvement of medical care; Engagement between military and civilian medical community - the study identified a number of crossovers in the domains of training of medical professionals and the make-up of deployed medical staff, medical practices of information sharing and medical technologies. To address the synergies and concerns, the study suggests that EDA should seek opportunities to serve as a forum to build trust between the consumers of the technology, the developers and the manufacturers.   More information: Medical support (EDA project page)  EDA symposium discusses EU deploy capabilities for CSDP operations (EDA webnews, June 2016) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/05/04/delivered-eda-study-to-help-improve-medical-support-for-small-operations
EDA_NEWS_0298	2017-05-10	NEWS	EDA consultation to identify impact of 3D-printing technologies in defence - deadline extended!	 Additive Manufacturing (AM), widely known as 3D-printing, has been identified as one of the key enabling technologies to improve European industrial competitiveness. Although AM technologies have been developed in the civil sector, it is considered that there is significant potential for additive manufacturing technologies to enhance defence capabilities. Among them, the most likely are mobility, sustainability, effect and protection through e.g. field repair & maintenance, reduced logistic burden and improved sustainability in warfightingand peacekeeping missions. Substantial economic benefits are also expected. To identify and explore areas where additive manufacturing will have a wider  impact, the European Defence Agency (EDA) has commissioned Fundación Prodintec (http://www.prodintec.es/en/) and MBDA FR (http://www.mbda-systems.com/) to conduct a project on “Additive Manufacturing Feasibility Study & Technology Demonstration”, with expected delivery in December 2017. The study  targets the entire spectrum of European defence and Additive Manufacturing (AM) stakeholders, at all levels of defence and AM supply chains. The project is composed of three work strands with specific and intertwined objectives:  A desktop study to place AM and its potential in a defence context. The main outcome of this work strand will be the identification of opportunities for AM in the European defence sector. At the same time, it will aim to highlight factors preventing European defence forces from reaping the benefits of this breakthrough technology The second work strand is a technology demonstration of AM  in a simulated deployment scenario. Its purpose is to demonstrate the feasibility and operational utility of deploying these technologies in support of a military operation Following the desktop study and the technology demonstration, the conclusions of this feasibility study, including the equipment used and typical objects and materials produced, will be presented in an exhibition. The objective is to raise the military awareness of AM  technology and to exemplify how it could improve the way operations, logistic support or maintenance of platforms are conducted. Therefore, this study has the objective of raising awareness in the defence community and of promoting a better understanding of the potential held by these technologies, thereby stimulating their implementation in defence specific areas. By doing so, not only the R&T community will be informed, but also other potential beneficiaries of the technology, linked to the EDA capabilities mentioned above. This will create a synergy between the Materials R&T community and the operational staff, helping the R&T community to understand the requirements from the operational side. The contractor for the study has recently kicked off the consultation process through different means (questionnaires, interviews, etc.) with all competent stakeholders, such as: participant Member States MoDs, European Commission, European Space Agency (ESA), European Defence Technology and Industrial Base (EDTIB), and AM related stakeholders (Industry, SMEs and academia). Deadline extended! Ministries of Defence stakeholders are especially invited to take part in the consultation, by replying to the questionnaire from the dedicated link (below), by 30 June 2017 at the latest. If you have any technical difficulty or if you need any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact the EDA contractor via dsg@prodintec.com.

EDA_NEWS_0299	2017-05-10	NEWS	MARSUR put to the test during live demonstration at OHQ EUNAVFOR MED SOPHIA	" Today (10 May 2017) the OHQ EUNAVFOR MED Operation SOPHIA with the sponsorship of the European Defence Agency hosted the Maritime Surveillance Networking (MARSUR) Live Demonstration at the OHQ in Rome. MARSUR Networking was designed to enhance the  Recognized Maritime Picture and to support CSDP Operations. Following its launch in 2006, MARSUR has grown to become EDA’s longest running project, with 17 EU Member States plus Norway now forming the MARSUR Community. Today’s capability demonstration was attended by 30 distinguished guests from 15 EU Member States and Norway plus representatives from the EUMC, EMSA and the EU SATCEN. The forum was also addressed by EDA Deputy Chief Executive Mr. Rini GOOS and the EUNAVFOR MED operation SOPHIA Deputy Commander, Rear Admiral Luc-Marie LEFEBVRE. The key enabler for maritime operations is having the maritime information needed to operate on dangerous seas. Within this challenging domain, decision-makers need to receive the information they need in a readily usable format, allowing to them incorporate different data and information from civilian and military actors. To respond to this need an innovate capability that allows actors to exchange operational data, which in turn enhances situation awareness, was created by EDA, MARSUR. Speaking before the launch of the live demonstration, EDA Deputy Chief Executive Mr. Rini Goos addressed the forum and highlighting how MARSUR represents a vital aspect of EDA’s strong commitment to supporting the naval aspects of European defence. “The link between Operation SOPHIA and MARSUR is the perfect example of constructive and targeted efforts to implement the EU Maritime Security Strategy, ensuring overarching information exchange among European actors in a cross-sectoral and comprehensive way. This interaction with multiple maritime security stakeholders and the backing it provides to EUMMS’ vision, makes MARSUR and SOPHIA’s endeavor an excellent implementation example of the goals and principles we have set for our Union in the maritime domain.”  For the first time, the event brought together the input provided by Member States via the respective Maritime Operations Center’s (MOCs) and demonstrated how they can be used to create a comprehensive Maritime Situation Picture. At the live capability demonstration, EUNAVFOR MED Operation SOPHIA Deputy Operation Commander stressed the role and relevance of Operation SOPHIA and its dependance on maritime situational awareness. The success of Operation SOPHIA depends on a large extent on the cooperation of EU Member States which is true for the recognized maritime picture profiting from the input of the MARSUR Networking, as well. In building the demonstration, a storyboard created for this event outlining the contribution of several MARSUR Participating Member States (PMS) over several months with information gathered in the MOCs by naval assets not assigned to Operation SOPHIA providing valuable input to the Operations situational awareness. The picture quickly filled up with relevant information in a short time. 6 MOCs corresponded to specific requests by relevant core services offered by the MARSUR capability: Live Chat, Email, Voice of IP and Track Streaming were specific services provided, and helped to add, analyse and deal with suspicious or otherwise relevant tracks in Operation SOPHIA. Even PMS without a completely developed MARSUR capability were able to contribute by helping to identify different Vessels of Common Interest (VCI) or providing amplifying information about their movement.  During today’s live demonstration, a mobile component of the MARSUR capability was presented - a German Auxiliary Vessel assigned to Operation SOPHIA, the FGS RHEIN, demonstrated the use of the MARSUR capability as a maritime situational awareness tool installed on a potential Force Headquarter afloat.  With some further support and integration into national systems MARSUR could become a most valuable tool for any future CSDP Operation, making best use of naval units already deployed in an area of responsibility not part of the Operation. Pointing to this aspect, Mr. Rini Goos commented, “I am certain that this standard of European concerted effort will be taken further because, as the demonstration will show, the use of the MARSUR capability could become a blueprint for any future CSDP Operation.”  The significance of the live demonstration at OHQ EUNAVFOR MED SOPHIA has also helped to advance the trust and close cooperation among Navy MOCs in Europe, uniting a common European cause pursued through Operation SOPHIA.    Background    EUNAVFOR MED operation SOPHIA EUNAVFOR MED operation SOPHIA, launched in June 2015, presents its core task to contribute to wider EU efforts to disrupt the business model of human smuggling and trafficking networks in the Southern Central Mediterranean. To date, we have apprehended 109 suspected smugglers and traffickers and neutralized 426 boats, preventing them from being re-used by smugglers. Additionally, from October 2016, we are fully involved in the training of the Libyan Navy and Libyan Navy Coast Guard and in the implementation of the arms embargo off the coast of Libya according to UNSCR 2292(2016).   European Defence Agency The European Defence Agency was established under a Joint Action of the Council of Ministers on 12 July, 2004, ""to support the Member States and the Council in their effort to improve European defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the European Security and Defence Policy as it stands now and develops in the future”.

EDA_NEWS_0300	2017-05-03	NEWS	Enhancing EDA-Norway cooperation discussed during visit of the State Secretary of Norway Øystein Bø to EDA.	 Today (3 May 2017) Chief Executive Jorge Domecq welcomed Mr. Øystein Bø (State Secretary at the Ministry of Defence of Norway) to the EDA for productive talks focused on further enhancing EDA-Norway cooperation. As a non-member of the European Union, Norway signed an Administrative Arrangement with the EDA in 2006, and is now actively involved in a range of EDA projects and programmes. The meeting provided an excellent opportunity to access progress on EDA-Norway cooperation as well as investigate areas where cooperation could be expanded.  Mr. Domecq welcomed State Secretary Bø  by expressing his deep appreciation for Norway’s involvement and support to the EDA through Norway’s overall commitment to cooperation with the agency. As an example of this cooperation, Mr. Domecq highlighted that almost all the actions agreed between the EDA and Norway during his meeting with the Norwegian Minister of Defence Ine Eriksen Søreide in January 2016 have been concluded. One of the most concrete actions has been the successful secondment if a Norwegian expert to EDA who leads EDA’s work on CBRN R&T.    Before the meeting began, EDA Project Officers presented State Secretary Bø with selected EDA capability development projects, offering an opportunity to demonstrate the work that the EDA is currently undertaking in CBRN, SESAR and Cyber.  Norway has a long standing and deep participation in EDA activities, most notably in Air-to-Air Refuelling (Norway signed in February 2017 together with Belgium and Germany a Declaration of Intent confirming that it will sign the MMF MoU in 2017), GOVSATCOM which Norway is now officially participating in, also equally involved in projects and programmes related to C-IED such as JDEAL and CBRN. Furthermore, as a full member of the European Tactical Airlift Center (ETAC), Norway will participate in EAATTC (Tactical Airlift Training) 17-4 in Zaragoza this September. However most prominent involvement of Norway in EDA’s work is its active participation in projects and programmes in the field of research and technology. Speaking at the conclusion of the visit, Mr. Domecq commented; “I am delighted to have welcomed State Secretary of Norway Øystein Bø to the EDA for positive and forward looking discussions. I am particularly grateful for Norway’s participation and contribution to the EDA. The cooperation we have built has been very fruitful and also serves as a model for EDA’s cooperation with partners. I believe we can look forward to developing new ways to enhance cooperation with Norway.”   More information: EDA Chief Executive and Norwegian Minister of Defence discuss defence cooperation Administrative arrangements with non-EU members EDA programme launched to improve IED Detection Multinational Multi-Role Tanker Transport Fleet (MMF) takes shape 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/05/03/enhancing-eda-norway-cooperation-discussed-during-visit-of-the-state-secretary-of-norway-%C3%B8ystein-b%C3%B8-to-eda
EDA_NEWS_0301	2017-04-27	NEWS	Jorge Domecq extended as European Defence Agency (EDA) Chief Executive	 Following a proposal by Federica Mogherini, the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Vice-President of the European Commission, as Head of the European Defence Agency, EDA Member States have decided unanimously to extend the initial three year mandate of Jorge Domecq as Chief Executive of the Agency for an additional two years, up to 1 February 2020.  Jorge Domecq leads the EDA since February 2015. Mr Domecq’s prolongation comes at a crucial time for EU defence in general, and for the European Defence Agency in particular. As the Agency is crucially involved in the practical implementation of all recent European defence initiatives - from the EU Global Strategy and its Implementation Plan to the European Defence Action Plan (EDAP) and the implementation of the EU-NATO Joint Declaration – Mr Domecq’s extension will provide the necessary continuity in EDA’s top team to make sure the Agency can play its role to the full. The implementation of the EDA’s Long Term Review, which was set in motion by the Head of the Agency last autumn and that Ministers will consider at the 18 May Steering Board and the upcoming launch of the European Commission’s Preparatory Action on Defence Research (PADR), in which the EDA will play a central managing role through the signing of a delegation agreement with the Commission, are two additional challenges lying ahead of the Agency and its re-confirmed Chief Executive.   More Information: Profile of Jorge Domecq  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/04/27/jorge-domecq-extended-as-european-defence-agency-(eda)-chief-executive
EDA_NEWS_0302	2017-04-28	NEWS	11th EDA Helicopter Exercise “FIRE BLADE” ready for take-off in Hungary!	 Exercise FIRE BLADE 2017 (FB17) will take place at Papa Airbase in Hungary from 1-12 May 2017 with around 500 personnel and 16 aircraft taking part from 5 Member States. This is the 11th Helicopter exercise to be conducted under the umbrella of EDA’s Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP). The European Defence Agency continues to offer an operationally realistic framework for Member States to develop, consolidate and share best practice in advanced helicopter operations. The conflict in Afghanistan brought several contributing Member States (cMS) together to jointly overcome reduced availability of combat ready crews and platforms. Several common factors were identified: a lack of effective crew training, sub-optimal technical equipment and the challenges of logistic support to remote deployed operations. The HEP successfully addressed the training need and continues to offer a unique vehicle for improved helicopter capability development. Exercise FIRE BLADE will provide an operationally demanding environment for participating Member States to train together and improve tactics and interoperability, including the coordination and integration of Joint Terminal Air Controllers (JTAC’s) into live fire scenarios.   Exercise FIRE BLADE 2017 FIRE BLADE will not only provide crews with the opportunity for live weapon engagement, it will also allow them to conduct complex air operations in a realistic and challenging environment. A total of 14 helicopters from Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary and Slovenia, as well as two fixed wing aircraft from Hungary will take part. FIRE BLADE will deliver tactical training, over the two week period, offering participants a unique opportunity to plan and execute Composite Air Operation (COMAO) missions within a joint and combined framework. Trained Helicopter Tactics Instructors trained under EDA’s Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC) will mentor the multinational crews in the preparation and execution of theses challenging COMAO missions. The mentor team for FIRE BLADE will include 5 instructors from Austria, Germany, Sweden and the UK. EDA’s Director for Cooperation Planning and Support, Roland van Reybroeck, highlighted some of the key benefits of the exercise: “FIRE BLADE marks another major milestone in EDA’s Helicopter Exercise Programme and will offer a very demanding period of training for the operational crews. Since its launch, the HEP has developed into one of the most intensive formats for joint European helicopter training. The realistic settings and complex missions are particularly challenging and the crews and aircraft will be stretched to their limits. I would especially like to thank Hungary for hosting the exercise for the first time and congratulate them on becoming the 7th Member State to do so.”    Background The overall aim of the HEP is to enhance interoperability at tactical level  between helicopter units by using the COMAO concept in a combined, joint, realistic and challenging environment and to teach and learn helicopter Techniques, Tactics and Procedures (TTPs). During FB17 the units will fly a diverse set of day and night training missions, with a focus on live firing operations. FB17 is a real-world example of what can be achieved through European defence cooperation.  Further updates on FB17 can also be found on Twitter using #FIREBLADE2017.   Another important milestone for the EDA   The HEP is one of the EDA’s helicopter training programmes. The exercises focus on individual, environmental and multinational training, increasing interoperability through practical experiences, sharing operational experience and developing common tactics, techniques and procedures. HEP started in 2012 as a ten-year programme, it offers a tangible example of how collaboration in training can be a critical component of improved European helicopter capability and interoperability.   EDA Helicopter Exercises In Numbers Between 2009 and 2017 : 229 helicopters, 1.590 aircrew members and almost 13.500 technical and logistics personnel, as well as infantry and special forces, from 19 Member States have deployed to the EDA exercises which were held in France, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Finland and Belgium.   DVD exercise FIRE BLADE 2017 A Distinguished Visitors Day (DVD) will be held on May 11th, which senior officials of the participating Member States will attend. This FIRE BLADE DVD will be combined with a Media day with international media visiting the airbase.

In January this year EDA signed a framework contract with Airbus Defence and Space. Over the last year more than 40 orders have been passed adding up to a total of over 75 to date, with a total value €15.2 million since first order was placed in 2013.  The current 23 contributing members are: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, the United Kingdom, Republic of Serbia, the Athena Mechanism and the civilian missions EU-CAP SAHEL Niger, EUCAP SAHEL Mali, EUAM Ukraine, EUCAP NESTOR and EUMM Georgia.  With the Athena Mechanism and civilian missions as members, the EU Satcom project directly supports the full range of CSDP operations and missions.   More information: EU SatCom Market project page EDA and CSDP civilian missions develop cooperation (EDA news June 2016)  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/04/06/poland-becomes-23th-member-of-eu-satcom-market
EDA_NEWS_0310	2017-04-06	NEWS	EDA welcomes Switzerland’s first project participation	 EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq today welcomed the announcement made by the Swiss government that Switzerland is going to participate in its first EDA project under the ‘Framework for Cooperation’ agreed with the Swiss ministry of Defence in 2012. The research project in question deals with the Protection of Autonomous Systems against Enemy Interference (PASEI). Germany, as the lead nation, as well as Finland and Austria are also participating. “I very much welcome that Switzerland, beyond its current involvement in different EDA activities of common interest, has decided to make full use of the ‘Framework for Cooperation’ that has been set up with the EDA in 2012 by participating in its first concrete cooperation project.  The PASEI project, which deals with the protection of autonomous systems against enemy interference, is an important topic on which European cooperation makes sense, even beyond EU borders. The Agency looks forward to cooperating with the Swiss government and industry on this interesting project”, Mr Domecq stated. He also expressed the hope that Switzerland will participate in more EDA projects in the future.  The aim of the PASEI project is to carry out a 1-year study to identify the potential types of enemy interference with autonomous and semi-autonomous unmanned mobile systems and the disturbing or disrupting impact they can have on the systems’ military tasks (including remote controlled operations). Based on this identification work, the study should also propose methods to detect enemy interference and recommend possible technical countermeasures to avoid and mitigate the risks of interference. In a next phase, the project could be followed up by the development of a technical demonstrator applying the recommended techniques to protect against hostile takeovers of current or future unmanned systems.   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/04/06/eda-welcomes-switzerland-s-first-project-participation

EDA_NEWS_0313	2017-03-29	NEWS	The EDA Materials & Structures Week - Workshop on High Performance Light Weight Structures	 During the second week of March, the EDA Workshop on High Performance Light Weight Structures and the 36th meeting of the CapTech Materials & Structures took place at Airbus facilities in Manching (Germany). During the week, more than thirty experts, representing the Materials network from various European Ministries of Defence, industry, SMEs and academia related to this technology domain, gathered to share interests and plan future R&T activities. Today, aerostructures know-how is mainly based on monolithic metallic and composite material structures. This also holds true for military applications. The potential offered by combining different materials in a hybrid design solution, by developing novel design concepts or by integrating several functionalities within one design solution etc. is not fully utilized today. Therefore, on 7 March 2017, high-level experts on materials and structures for defence platforms gathered to define a potential European level cooperative R&T project that will represent an important step toward further developing this concept. This form of international collaboration facilitates the sharing of background information on European interests and of current or foreseen issues specific to this domain. Having and applying the resulting insights could lead to forging common targets and to helping further EU collective capability in high performance low weight structures. The main outcome of the workshop was the identification of the most promising avenues for cooperation in this area, namely preparing the knowledge base required for future platforms, starting with design elements derived from existing ones  and identifying capability requirements and maintenance needs which exceed the current state of the art.  This interesting and constructive workshop was followed by the 36th meeting of the CapTech Materials & Structures. The meeting focused on the review of the CapTech’s current activities and on the discussion about future actions and upcoming opportunities for advancing the scope and coverage of its work. Special attention was given to the impact of the ongoing developments in European defence research on the future SRA. These circumstances have been acknowledged as game changers also for the Materials & Structures community. In this regard, the planning of the new Materials Strategic Research Agenda, (SRA) following the EDA Overarching Research Agenda (OSRA) methodology, was discussed in depth. In order to prepare this update, the OSRA methodology was also applied to the development of Technology Building Blocks (TBBs) by analysing the technology gaps identified in the current SRA.  Another evolving dimension of particular relevance is the incorporation of new Materials CapTech members, resulting from the continuous efforts of EDA and the Materials CapTech National Coordinators to welcome key stakeholders, growing the CapTech network from one meeting to the next one. On EDA’s side, the joint efforts with the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN) to support dual-use small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is continuously leading to concrete opportunities by identifying SMEs potentially interested in the work of the CapTech. At this moment, the network is composed of more than 200 experts from various types of entities (Ministries of Defence, industry, SMEs, research centres and universities).  The workshop and Materials CapTech meeting was co-organized by the EDA’s CapTech on Materials & Structures, the German Ministry of Defence-WIWeB, and Airbus DS-Manching.

EDA_NEWS_0315	2017-03-29	NEWS	Effectiveness of Multinational Training in Air-to-Air Refueling evident at EART 2017	 The 4th European Air-to-Air Refuelling Training (EART 2017) exercise is currently underway at Eindhoven Airbase until 7 April. Four European nations (Germany, the Netherlands, Italy and France) have been training together since March 26 concurrently with the multinational Frisian Flag fighter training exercise.  EART 2017 specifically aims to train tanker crews in AAR operations within a realistic and multinational framework. In combination with the Frisian Flag exercise, EART 2017 represents a unique opportunity for specific training for air crews, planners, taskers and engineers in planning and executing missions in a complex COMAO (composite air operation) environment. During the training exercise, crews will have the opportunity to increase their know-how in complex multinational scenarios. Furthermore crews can enhance their knowledge of multinational tanker aircraft and exchange information and procedures. EART 2017 is part of an approach that puts a premium on joint training exercises and increased standardisation to enhance overall effectiveness and interoperability of forces.   EART 2017 Press Day A Press Day for EART 2017 was held on March 29th. It was attended by Member State’s representatives, exercise partners and the media. The event provided an opportunity to witness at first hand the latest developments in joint European AAR training. Speaking at the Press Day of EART 2017, EDA Director for Capability, Armament & Technology, Mr. Peter Round commented: “AAR is one of the four key projects in which EDA and its Member States has identified a capability gap. We are working hard to overcome the shortfall in Europe in the AAR domain and this exercise is very important building block in that process. Training and standardisation leads to increasing interoperability and thus to a more efficient capability and force enabler in the sky.”   Why AAR Matters  AAR is an area with Europe faces critical capability shortfalls, highlighted by operations in Mali, Libya and Kosovo. With AAR, pilots can extend the radius of their planes and flight time, and more complex missions can be performed. Moreover, the planes do not need to return to their base to refuel between missions.    Background  The EART concept was introduced in 2014 following EDA’s air-to-air refuelling (AAR) initiative, and is run by European Air Transport Command (EATC) from Eindhoven airbase. It is a dedicated AAR training for tanker and crews to become familiar with scenarios they are not regularly exposed to, maintain proficiency and enhance knowledge of multinational tanker aircraft. The exercise is supported by the Host nation (the Netherlands), MCCE and EDA. EART is organised on a yearly basis and is pooled with the multinational Frisian Flag fighter exercise that operates from Leeuwarden Airbase.   More information: Air-to-Air Refueling Project page 4th European Air-to-Air Refuelling Training takes off in the Netherlands Air-to-Air Refueling Fact sheet 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/03/29/effectiveness-of-multinational-training-in-air-to-air-refueling-evident-at-eart-2017

EDA_NEWS_0318	2017-03-24	NEWS	EDA and JRC launch new project to enhance Technology Watch activity	 A new EDA project aimed at the development of a media and technology monitoring system for EDA was launched with the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission on March 23rd, 2017. This initiative represents a continuation of previous EDA Technology Watch activities and projects and has the purpose to increase access to high quality defence technology information for the Agency and its stakeholders.  This new capability will help EDA  provide better support to the activities of Member States as well as those foreseen under the Preparatory Action for Defence Research and the future European Defence Research Programme.  Having a systematic understanding of evolving technical trends and their effect on future European defence capabilities, both long and short term, is of great significance for EDA’s work. The Technology Watch activity is providing one of the inputs for the EDA CapTechs process of technology identification. The objective of this new project is to develop customized versions of JRC’s monitoring and data analysis tools adapted to the needs of defence. The modules identified in JRC’s tools have been assessed as crucial for understanding the state-of-the-art technologies relevant for the defence sector and their evolution. The new system will provide both media and technology monitoring components, use diverse information sources and offers a combination of search methods. Furthermore, JRC’s instruments give the possibility to identify in real-time tendencies in specific domains. This is especially important in the current context of fast-paced technological development and can represent a strategic advantage for the European defence community.  The outputs from the monitoring systems can serve as background information to be used in the assessment and prioritization phases of defence R&T planning, essential for the development of the CapTechs Strategic Research Agendas. These activities will also support the dual-use link with the Long-term strand of the Capability Development Plan (CDP), EC Key Enabling Technologies (KETs), for short and medium term applications, and with the EC Future Emerging Technologies (FET), for forward looking technologies and applications. The kick-off meeting between EDA and JRC took place on 23 March 2017 at the EDA in Brussels.    More information: EDA Technology Watch & Horizon Scanning Tool  JRC European Media Monitoring  JRC Tools for Innovation Monitoring 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/03/24/eda-and-jrc-launch-new-project-to-enhance-technology-watch-activity

During the training exercise, crews will have the opportunity to increase their know-how in complex multinational scenarios. Furthermore crews can enhance their knowledge of multinational tanker aircraft and exchange information and procedures. EART 2017 is part of an approach that puts a premium on joint training exercises and increased standardisation to enhance overall effectiveness and interoperability of forces.  EDA Live coverage: March 29th EDA will be live from Eindhoven airbase for special coverage of EART2017. Throughout the day we will be bringing you live updates on twitter of the training exercise, interviews and coverage of air-to-air refuelling in action. Visit our twitter page (@EUDefenceAgency) and get involved using #EART2017.   Air-to-Air Refueling: EDA’s Global Approach EDA has developed a global approach with three objectives: optimizing the use of assets, increasing the overall AAR capacity and reducing fragmentation of the fleet. This work has led to three complementary work-strands, on some of which EDA is cooperating closely with other agencies and organizations like OCCAR, the Movement Coordination Center Europe (MCCE) and the European Air Transport Command (EATC). EART 2017 is part of EDA’s first work strand (optimization of existing capabilities), which is achieved by supporting training exercises. In this domain, EDA has also taken the lead to streamline the different certification processes leading to a clearance. By standardizing these processes the different aviation authorities can easily identify the differences between their own process and their counterpart. By working closely together, already fielded capabilities and future capabilities, can work more cost efficiently and increase their operational output.    More information:  Air-to-Air Refueling Project page Air-to-Air Refueling Fact sheet 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/03/22/4th-european-air-to-air-refuelling-training-takes-off-in-the-netherlands

EDA_NEWS_0322	2017-03-21	NEWS	5th EDA Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC) to ‘take off’ with home-grown teachers	 The 5th in the series of Helicopter Tactics Instructors Courses (HTIC) to be ran by EDA on behalf of Member States will kick off on 15 May 2017 at Royal Air Force (RAF) Linton-on-Ouse, North Yorkshire in the United Kingdom.  The HTIC has grown significantly over the four previous courses both in terms of scope and quality and, for the first time, almost all of the staff instructors (90%) will be successful graduates of previous courses.  This point of self-sustainment is a long-held aspiration, which dates back to when the programme was first initiated by the EDA over five years ago, and marks a final chapter on its route to maturity. The 5th HTIC will begin with a four-week classroom phase including simulator exercises at Linton-on-Ouse.  This is followed by a three week deployment to Arvidsjaur Airfield in Lapland (Sweden) where the participants will engage in live flying exercises operating Swedish Blackhawks, Austrian Huey, Kiowa & Blackhawks and German CH-53s.  The Staff Instructors will come from Sweden, Austria and the UK with supporting air assets including: Hawks from 100 Sqn (UK), Gripens from F21 Wing in Lulea (Sweden) and Alca Jets from the Czech Air Force.  Additionally, a DA-20 Falcon from Cobham Aviation will provide EW and C2 support, augmented with ground based Electronic Warfare (EW) assets provided by RAF Spadeadam’s EW Range.  In total, around 35 trainees and instructors will participate in the ground phase.  However, that number will swell to  over 120, with all the supporting assets, engineers and operations personnel during the flying phase.   Background The EDA’s Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC) provides aircrew from participating nations with the skills and knowledge to teach advanced tactics to front-line aircrews from within their own national organisations and to assist in delivering the EDA’s Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP), the Helicopter Tactics Course (HTC) and the future HTIC. Successful graduates from the course are awarded a qualification recognised by other Member States.  HTIC development courses run over two years: in the first year, prospective instructors refine their own knowledge of advanced helicopter tactics to the maximum degree. In the second year, the emphasis shifts  to develop the participants’ ability to teach those tactics. In turn, Instructors who have demonstrated above average abilities in delivering the course will be individually selected to become supervising instructors for future HTIC. The three main elements of HTIC include Evasion Training, Electronic Warfare and advanced Operations.  They are initially taught as stand-alone skills before being brought together in a complex, non-permissive environment in the framework of the planning and execution of Composite Air Operations (COMAO).  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/03/21/5th-eda-helicopter-tactics-instructors-course-(htic)-to-take-off-with-home-grown-teachers
EDA_NEWS_0323	2017-03-10	NEWS	EDA’s Annual Report 2016 released!	 2016 was a seminal moment for European defence and the European Defence Agency. A year that added a new sense of urgency and determination to European defence efforts. The Annual Report 2016 presents the main activities and achievements of the EDA across its full range of activities and projects. The report is free to access and is available for download here. The Welcome Word by EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq sets the scene on what was a defining year for the EDA.  2016 was a seminal moment for European defence and a defining year for the European Defence Agency (EDA). The events that shaped 2016 added a new sense of urgency and determination to see Europe delivering on its potential in defence.  The time has gone when Europe’s achievements were judged in terms of what it agreed on paper. Henceforth the success or failure of European ambitions in defence will be judged exclusively on the basis of  action and implementation. Defence is now, and needs to remain, firmly on the European political agenda.  Three major initiatives contributed to a momentous shift in European defence thinking in 2016. First, Federica Mogherini, the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and Head of the EDA, presented the  European Union Global Strategy (EUGS) in June, calling for the full use of the “Agency’s potential as an essential prerequisite for European security and defence efforts.” This was followed by the Implementation Plan on Security and Defence, which set out a new level of ambition for the EU in defence. Second, the European Commission adopted the European Defence Action Plan, paving the way for a substantive European Defence Fund. Thirdly, the EU-NATO Joint Declaration added new impetus and concrete substance to the EU-NATO strategic partnership. These defining actions of 2016 have opened a window of opportunity for Europe to achieve concrete results starting in 2017. This means that the critical work on implementation has to begin now. And EDA, whose core tasks are to support capability development through European defence cooperation, increase cooperative efforts in research & technology, and strengthen the industrial and technological base of the European defence sector, will be fundamental.  2016 put the spotlight on the added-value and expertise of the EDA. The four key capability programmes welcomed by the European Council in 2013 have made significant progress over the last 12 months. The contracts for a Definition Study of the European MALE RPAS (Medium Altitude Long Endurance Remotely Piloted Aircraft System) and for Air-to-Air Refuelling (AAR) were both signed in the summer. Cyber security poses ever-changing challenges that require a cross-sectoral approach to developing effective cyber defence capabilities. In 2016, EDA continued to facilitate efforts in education, training and exercise to enhance Europe’s cyber capability. Governmental Satellite Communications (GovSatCom) activities have also progressed well with studies to identify Member States’ requirements with a view to exploring a pooling solution of existing capabilities. The Agency’s work in support of operations and enhanced standardisation and certification continues to yield positive results. EDA remains ambitious about what can be achieved in these programmes in 2017, in terms of increasing the number of Member States involved, addressing the full life cycle of defence capabilities, and developing effective education, training, and exercise initiatives.  This Agency was also a driving force in 2016, breaking new ground in an area that up to a few years ago would have been deemed inconceivable: defence research funded by the EU. The EU’s Pilot Project on defence research, which marks the first time that the EU budget is used for defence research, is run and managed by the EDA on behalf of the European Commission. Its implementation is well advanced and the three contracts it foresees were signed in October. As a test bed for the conditions of defence research in an EU framework, it also paves the way for the next milestone on the road towards dedicated EU defence research: the launch of the so-called ‘Preparatory Action’ on CSDP-related research.  A pivotal moment for the EDA, but 2017 will be equally crucial in demonstrating the added-value of EU-funded research in the defence sector. I believe that 2016 is defined by the fresh momentum behind European defence, but sustaining this momentum requires a strong partnership with industry. Europe’s strategic autonomy is dependent on a globally competitive, technologically advanced and innovative industrial base, that supports the development of the military capabilities Europe needs. This year EDA has identified sources of support for the defence industry, launched a process to earmark future activities and concrete initiatives in support of defence-related SMEs, and has started to reorient is engagement with industry to better reflect the evolving defence industrial environment.  The growing interest of the European Commission in defence issues puts a premium on ensuring that the Agency plays its role to the full as the interface between Member States and the Commission. It has already done this successfully, be it in terms of the Pilot Project and the Preparatory Action on defence research, or EU legislation that has implications for defence, such as REACH, related to hazardous chemicals which may have a direct impact on the operational effectiveness of the armed forces as well as the competiveness of the European defence industry. Equally, the establishment of the EDA Single European Sky (SES) Military Aviation Board,  a milestone that will form the basis for EDA’s work on relevant military aspects of SES, underscores the pivotal role of this Agency.   EDA is an outward looking agency that puts a premium on enhancing cooperation with other institutions and bodies to consolidate cooperation and optimise our overall impact. Its relationship with NATO, based on substantive dialogue at all levels, is ensuring mutually-reinforcing capability development. The Administrative Arrangements with both OCCAR and European Space Agency (ESA) have greatly improved synergies across programmes this year. In 2016, the EDA signed new agreements with SESAR JU, EUROCONTROL, and the European Union Satellite Centre (SATCEN).  The next twelve months will have a transformational impact on European defence. EDA will be at the heart of it. Each year, this Agency grows its expertise and track record of delivery: 2016 was no different. The EDA has now passed the 185 mark in terms of projects facilitated and managed since its inception, representing almost €1 billion in R&T investment by the contributing Member States. In 2017 this Agency will continue to work in support of our Member States and strive to reinforce the European industrial and technological defence base.  The launch of the EDA Long Term Review at the end of 2016 aims to set out the long-term objectives, priorities and way of working for this Agency as we move into the future and carry forward the implementation of the EUGS. 2016 has elevated European defence to a new level and set out an ambitious vision for the future. This Agency will work with even greater determination and will deploy its full range of expertise so that successful implementation will be the defining characteristic of the year ahead. I hope that 2017 will witness an even greater evolution in European defence cooperation.  Jorge Domecq, EDA Chief Executive    More information: EDA Annual Report 2016  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/03/10/eda-s-annual-report-2016-released!
EDA_NEWS_0324	2017-03-13	NEWS	EDA Chief: “Defence cooperation is not just inevitable, it also pays off”	 In an Opinion Editorial published this weekend simultaneously in a number of selected European newspapers and online media(*), EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq highlights the multiple benefits of deeper European cooperation in the field of defence (especially cost-savings and increased efficiency & interoperability) and called for “making defence a matter of genuine European interest”.  Here is the full text of Mr Domecq’s article:   Deeper EU defence cooperation is not just inevitable: it also pays off for governments and citizens Long treated as a marginal aspect of the European Union’s wider Common and Security Policy, defence has emerged as a top priority on the European agenda. Successive EU and Member States initiatives in 2016 have catapulted defence to centre-stage. More than that: as EU leaders prepare to meet in Rome on 25 March for the 60th anniversary of the Rome Treaties in the midst of one of the most challenging and turbulent periods the Union has ever faced, defence is put forward as an area in which the European project could be reinvigorated with success. I share this ambition: the time has come to make defence a matter of genuine European interest. Let’s be frank: we, Europeans, have no credible alternative but to join forces and think and act on security and defence in more European terms, beyond national lines. The growing threats in our immediate neighbourhood, the future of our transatlantic relationship and the technological revolution that is taking place on a global scale should convince even the most skeptical that, at this time, Europe will not get out of doing more and better for its own security. Politically, a stronger and more cooperative European approach to defence seems inevitable. To put it bluntly: the changing global order will sooner or later oblige European nations to pull together and to act collectively if they want to remain capable of protecting their interests and citizens. But pressure from outside should not be the only driver. In fact, there are also many practical reasons why enhanced European defence cooperation makes lot of sense. Budgetary sense, first and foremost. Today, Europe’s defence market remains seriously fragmented. Budgets are planned and spent nationally by 28 Defence Ministries without any proper coordination. This is costly and often leads to duplication of effort and spending as each Member State tries to cover the whole spectrum of defence capabilities. Better planning, joint procurement and the pooling and sharing of defence capabilities can therefore improve the output of military spending and save large amounts of taxpayers’ money. Estimates(**) suggest European governments could save almost a third (!) of what they spend on military equipment if they decided to coordinate investments. We are talking here about billions and billions of euros which could be saved or freed for additional long-term investment. But cost-effectiveness is not the only benefit. Interoperability and increased effectiveness are equally important outcomes of a more cooperative approach on defence spending. Compared to the US, European Armed Forces operate far too many different types of military capabilities. In 2016, for example, EU Member States had 20 different types of fighter aircraft (compared to 6 in the US), 29 types of frigates (4 in the US) or 20 types armoured fighting vehicles (2 in the US). More cooperative planning, procurement and operation of assets would streamline the capabilities in use and thereby considerably improve Member States Armed Forces’ interoperability. Pooling and sharing is therefore key to making sure that European Armed Forces become more effective/interoperable and European citizens and taxpayers get better value for money. To facilitate such cooperation and initiate and manage cooperative projects between willing Member States is the bread and butter of the European Defence Agency (EDA). Since its creation in 2004, the Agency has become THE ‘hub’ for European defence cooperation with expertise and networks that are second to none. Experience clearly shows that if Member States have the political will to seriously engage in cooperation, the EDA is able to deliver. Today, at a time when the EU’s institutional lines between internal and external security are becoming increasingly blurred, it is worth recalling that Member States have always, since the beginning, considered the EDA to be their main tool and vehicle for advancing defence cooperation, since it is in EDA where they, the national governments, decide what the capability priorities are and how to manage them. The support that the European Commission is willing to provide through the recently adopted European Defence Action Plan (EDAP) is most welcome in this respect. Defence cooperation is needed urgently. We cannot afford to allow this important issue to be dragged into political or institutional debates that do not strictly focus on our common goal: making European defence stronger. To achieve that, Europe needs to make the best out of the tools it has and the EDA is certainly among them. The European Union is at a crossroads. Visionary decisions and ambitious actions are needed to keep the European project alive and thriving.

EDA_NEWS_0326	2017-03-08	NEWS	GeohuB: Successful Training and Operational Field Trial concluded at EUNAVFOR MED Operation SOPHIA HQ	 Geographic Information to Support decision Making in Operations (GISMO) is a cooperative project between the European Defence Agency and the European Satellite Centre and  involves the European Military Staff, the Multinational Geospatial Support Group and Member States. The main output from the project is a geospatial information management capability called GeohuB.   GeohuB was first demonstrated in 2016 and has now been successfully implemented at the Operational Headquarter (OHQ) in Rome in support of the EUNAVFOR MED Operation SOPHIA. The availability of Geospatial Information (GI) is a key requirement to ensure effective planning, conduct of operations and support to decision-making. The GISMO project, initiated jointly by EDA and EU SATCEN, is addressing this requirement.  The GeohuB tool was initially deployed in a standalone capacity in the EUNAVFOR MED Operation SOPHIA Operational Headquarters in Rome. Early in 2017 the tool was successfully installed into the Operation Sophia Classified Mission Network.   In February 2017 a Training and Operational Field Trial (OFT) was conducted within the OHQ with the objective of assessing the maturity and the operational value of the GeohuB tool and associated GI management capability.  The availability to all staff of geographic-based information was easily accessible through web services in the Classified Mission Network.  Such GI access enables improved shared situational awareness and to inform the decision making process within the OHQ. The intuitive and user friendly access to the GI provided by the GISMO GeohuB facilitated the access to shared information by both expert and non-expert GI users in the OHQ. CJ2 and JOC products were produced using the GeohuB during the OFT, with higher value for the CJ Staff.   Looking to the future, based on this successful OFT and associated training, the project will now transition the GeohuB to a Fielded Initial Operating Capability with the long term objective being to provide a Full Geographic Information System Capability within EU-led Missions and Operations.

EDA_NEWS_0329	2017-03-02	NEWS	EDA project helping to increase artillery accuracy	 The European Defence Agency (EDA) has just completed a project aimed at increasing the accuracy of artillery systems used by Member States’ Armed Forces. The Course Correction Fuze (CCF) project was initiated in 2012 within EDA’s Smart Munition Working Group (SMWG) with the objective to develop common technical knowledge on cost-effective and affordable solutions for reducing ballistic dispersion and enhancing the accuracy of Member States’ artillery rounds, by introducing a new type of fuze. Subject experts from EDA Member States (Belgium, Poland, Sweden, UK) as well as Norway (which has signed an Administrative Arrangement with the EDA) looked into the subject and came up with a Common European Requirements document for CCF which was agreed and distributed to participating Member States’ capability and armaments authorities in late 2016. Moreover, it was also recognized that there is a need to have a harmonized approach to the challenge of integrating and Test & Evaluating CCF into existing and future artillery systems in order to generate costs savings. In this way a dedicated investigation on CCF integration with Artillery Systems in EU was developed during 2016 and successfully delivered in early 2017. This investigation was divided in three different phases: Phase 1 was mainly devoted to the collection of information on available CCF solutions, artillery systems and ammunition in the EU. Five of the identified CCF solutions were selected, some of which use airbrakes to reduce the down range dispersion while others use fixed or movable canards that reduce both down range and cross range dispersion; Phase 2 consisted of an analysis of those five CCF solutions and their integration into both the artillery systems and the ammunition used by the participating Member States. As there exist many different artillery systems in Europe, in order to be able to integrate the selected CCFs into all those systems, the artillery systems were divided into three categories: CAT I – Manual; CAT II – Semi-Auto loading & Gun laying; and CAT III – Auto Loading and Gun laying; Phase 3 of the project focused on developing conclusions and recommendations in view of identifying future opportunities for cooperation among participating Member States.   Many opportunities for cooperation One of the main conclusions is that there are many opportunities for cooperation and pooling & sharing despite the fragmented picture of artillery systems used by European Armed Forces. Several countries use the same type of artillery system and, therefore, can easily share and follow the same CCF integration steps. But opportunities for collaboration even exist for countries using different systems for which at least some synergies can be found in terms of similar subsystem characteristics such as calibre, fire-control software or ammunition types. In a broader perspective, the joint development of ballistic calculation software and fuze setter standards and the definition of interfaces and data protocols for CCFs were also recommended to achieve an efficient integration in artillery systems. Specific work strands were identified and an action plan has been proposed. It also became clear that the (currently ongoing) review of the Capability Development Plan (CDP) should take into account future CCF integration into artillery systems.

EDA_NEWS_0330	2017-03-01	NEWS	11th Edition of EDA Helicopter Exercise Programme Confirmed for Hungary in May	 Exercise FIRE BLADE 2017 will be hosted by Hungary at Pápa Airbase and takes place from the 1st to the 12th of May. 17 air assets and 450 personnel are expected to take part in this live fire focused training exercise.   FIRE BLADE 2017 (FB17) marks the 11th helicopter exercise under the umbrella of the Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP). The HEP is one of the European Defence Agency’s (EDA) helicopter training projects and programmes. It is the first time that Hungary will host a HEP event, thus becoming the 7th member state to do so.  In excess of 450 personnel are due to take part in this exercise programme. A total of 17 air assets from 5 Member States (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Slovenia) are expected to take part. In addition, observers from Italy and Czech Republic are foreseen. FB17 will deliver tactical training, over a 12 day intensive programme, offering participants an unique opportunity to plan and execute missions within a joint combined framework. FB17 will be designed to allow European helicopter crews to train, adopting joint procedures while operating in a challenging scenario. Today at the EDA in Brussels the Final Coordination Conference for FB17 took place. Following on from the Main Planning Conference which was held last October in Hungary, today’s conference put the final preparations in place ahead of the beginning of FB17 on May 1st. Tom Bennington, Head of Education, Training & Exercise Unit at EDA commented, “the exercise gives a good opportunity to train in a realistic operational setting. Specifically we will be working with Special Forces, and will be focusing on live weapons firing using the Composite Air Operations Concept, effectively operating the helicopters with fast jets and ground assets [e.g. surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems]”. At the event, on behalf of the host nation Hungary, Lieutenant colonel Péter Simon of the Hungarian Air Force and Commander of the Air Task Force for exercise FB17 said, “as per previous Blade exercises, FB17 will have its own training subjects, in this case live firing. Hungary is an excellent location for live fire exercises due to diversity and quality of ranges available to visiting European crews”.     The aim of the exercise is to enhance interoperability at a tactical level between helicopter units by using the COMAO concept in a combined, joint, realistic and challenging environment and to teach and learn helicopter Techniques, Tactics and Procedures (TTPs). During FB17 the units will fly a diverse set of day and night training missions, with a focus on live firing operations. FB17 is a real-world example of what can be achieved through European defence cooperation.   Further updates on FB17 can also be found on Twitter using  #FIREBLADE2017.     More information: Helicopter Initiatives (EDA project page) Pictures from Exercise BLACK BLADE 2016 Fact Sheet Exercise BLACK BLADE 2016 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/03/01/11th-edition-of-eda-helicopter-exercise-programme-confirmed-for-hungary-in-may

EDA_NEWS_0332	2017-02-23	NEWS	Jorge Domecq outlines the importance of the military in SES/SESAR ahead of World ATM Congress 2017	 The approach of the world’s largest air traffic management event (World ATM Congress, 7-9 March, Madrid) has placed one of the largest air traffic users, the military, in focus. With more than 11,000 military aircraft stationed in Europe, state air forces represent the biggest fleet operators and airport owners in Europe. Ahead of EDA’s participation at WAC 2017 (SESAR stand 889), EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq writes that the military represents a key and credible partner in SES/SESAR. In the context of increased regional and global instability and given the evolving security challenges facing Europe, it is crucial for security and defence that any development in air traffic modernisation takes military requirements fully into account, in order to avoid any adverse impact on national and collective defence capabilities. The implementation of the European Global Strategy (EUGS), the European Defence Action Plan (EDAP) and the EU/NATO Joint Declaration, offer a window of opportunity to address and contribute to strengthening European Security and Defence. Military aviation is a key part of this. The EDA facilitates the coordination of military views related to the challenges of SES facing Military Aviation and acts as an interface between the military community and the European Commission. In doing so, EDA ensures coherence and complementarity across the military community through staff-to-staff coordination with NATO and EUROCONTROL, while actively developing its cooperation with key civil stakeholders.  The Aviation Strategy for Europe defined by the European Commission and the revision of the EASA Basic Regulation provide opportunities for early involvement of the military. Military aviation significantly contributes to ensuring the required secure environment in Europe. It is crucial for security and defence that any development in air traffic modernization takes military requirements fully into account, in order to avoid any adverse impact on national and collective defence capabilities. The changes brought about by technological solutions in terms of procedures, regulations, equipment and organisation need to be considered at the earliest possible stage and on the basis of a systemic approach, by relevant military organisations. The Military Aviation Strategy in the context of Single European Sky reflects the shared view on military aviation as an integral part of the air traffic in Europe for the coming decades. It establishes the strategic vision that European aviation will incorporate the security and defence dimension at a level that will ensure that Military Aviation continues to provide and further improve, effective security and defence in Europe in the changing context of the civil aviation sector, without prejudice to the safety of civil air traffic. It includes fundamental principles related to safety, civil-military coordination and cooperation across the military community, as well as strategic objectives on security and defence, access to airspace and use of air navigation services, confidentiality, cyber security, and interoperability. In supporting its implementation, the European Defence Agency contributes to ensuring that the military are recognised as credible and reliable partners for excellence in global aviation. Jorge Domecq (EDA Chief Executive)   EDA will be at World ATM Congress 2017  The World ATM Congress, the world’s largest air traffic management event, will take place 7-9 in Madrid.

In his speech, Mr Goos thanked Mr Rowntree for the good cooperation with the European Defence Agency and praised him as a person “who served defence cooperation in Europe with excessive commitment”. EDA’s close cooperation with OCCAR started immediately after the creation of the Agency in 2004, leading to the Administrative Arrangement (AA) signed in 2012 and then to the Interface Document concluded in 2013. Thanks to Mr Rowntree’s efforts and his close and pragmatic cooperation with EDA at different levels, those agreements have been implemented with success and already led to concrete outcomes such as the MMF programme, MALE RPAS, the smooth interaction in other projects of common interest (such as MMCM and MUSIS), cooperation in areas where EDA and OCCAR can benefit from each other’s expertise (for instance Security of Supply or REACH) as well as the revision of the Interface Document of 2015 which led to a more detailed and descriptive guide to ensure mutual cooperation benefits for the EDA and OCCAR, Mr Goos stated. “The key success factor for this remarkable progress was Mr Rowntree’s results oriented approach which fully fits to the Agency’s way of work”, he stressed. The EDA Chief Executive said he was fully confident that Mr Rowntree’s successor, Arturo Alfonso-Meiriño, will pursue the good cooperation with the EDA and work successfully on the challenges to come. He wished Mr Alfonso-Meiriño good luck and great success. “The EDA looks forward to working with you to achieve our common objectives”, Mr Goos concluded.   More information: EDA and OCCAR strengthen cooperation (webnews, December 2015) OCCAR website 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/02/22/eda-deputy-chief-praises-departing-occar-director-hails-good-cooperation

In early 2016, it was decided to further enhance training cooperation and EDA was tasked to develop a proposal to improve communication and to facilitate joint exercises.  In close cooperation with the European Air Group (EAG) and the European Union Military Staff (EUMS) who were also active in this area. Consequently, a joint programmer was formed to deliver hardware simulators (EDA), improved harmonization and interoperability (EAG) and realistic operational scenarios (EUMS) for MALE RPAS to underpin the Community’s work. The Agency signed a contract with DCI and DIGINEXT of France to design and build the systems over 2017/18, which will enable collaborative tactical development and harmonization of training across the Community.  The project represents a step change in improved interoperability in this increasingly important air domain and the work will be carried out in close cooperation with the EAG and EUMS with view to launching the first RPAS specific exercise in late 2018. _____________ 1 (DE, EL, ES, FR, IT, NL and PO) and to BE and UK who had expressed an interest to join.   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/02/13/european-male-rpas-community-launches-new-simulator-training-programme

EDA_NEWS_0338	2017-02-09	NEWS	EDA is partnering for excellence in global aviation at the World ATM Congress 2017	 The World ATM Congress, the world’s largest air traffic management event, will take place 7-9 in Madrid. The Congress, now in its fifth year, gathers representatives from every segment within aviation to exchange knowledge about the latest air traffic management trends. This year EDA will be there as part of the SESAR stand (889) to represent the military aspects of SES/SESAR.    The implications for the military of the Single European Sky (SES) initiative and its technological pillar, the Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research (SESAR) programme, are considerable. One of the principle tasks that Member States have given to the EDA in this field is to connect the military with each other and the European Institutions, and to develop ways to engage Europe’s military in the SES initiative.  “Partnering for excellence in global aviation” is the theme of the activities taking place at the SESAR stand. EDA is collaborating with the project hosts SESAR Joint Undertaking (SESAR JU) and the SESAR Deployment Manager (SESAR DM). Other European representatives from the European Commission, European Aviation Safety Agency Network Manager,and EUROCAE, make up the joint SESAR representation at the World ATM Congress.  In the lead up to this event, EDA has launched an updated brochure on its activities in this domain; “The Military in SES/SESAR”, which outlines EDA’s activities, priorities and partnerships in SES/SESAR.  Our experts will be on the stand throughout the congress, so pass by and find out more about the EDA and its work on SES/SESAR.     More information: EDA SESAR Project Page The Military in SES/SESAR (Brochure) EDA and SESAR JU sign Memorandum of Cooperation (EDA news 19 December 2016) EUROCONTROL and the European Defence Agency consolidate their cooperation (EDA news 17 November 2016) Partners step up efforts to address the integration of drones into European airspace (EDA news 8 November 2016) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/02/09/eda-is-partnering-for-excellence-in-global-aviation-at-the-world-atm-congress-2017
EDA_NEWS_0339	2017-02-07	NEWS	EDA Project to Improve Corrosion Control for Navy Ships	 The CCNS (Corrosion Control for Navy Ships) project, which ran from 2013-2016 in the EDA framework, involved major European industrial stakeholders, top-rated European research institutes, specialised entreprises and also academic organisations. It successfully tested and identified solutions with high potential, which also triggered numerous scientific publications.  Increasing military requirements combined with environmental regulations, such as REACH, lead to critical situations in the sense that they put at risk the operational availability and running costs of Navy ships in terms of corrosion and surface protection. In addition, there is a requirement to extend repair intervals to 6-10 years in order to reduce maintenance levels and related costs, to maintain  ship security and to comply with environmental regulations. The consequences of these requirements and regulations are various and have types a serious impact on potential risks, unsuitability and/or suppression of existing technical solutions. In this context, the aim of the project was to consider new approaches and solutions for defining in particular the adapted conditions based maintenance. In order to achieve this, the vast Corrosion Control of Navy Ships (CCNS) study was undertaken between 2013 and 2016 to establish the critical areas within Corrosion Control Technology. Through its extensive tests, the project produced very positive results in the field of sensors and fouling treatment. One sensor, which is now commercialised, offers a promising solution for on-board applications. Interesting results for new faster accelerated aging tests have also been obtained, showing the relevance to real in-service degradation of coatings and corrosion. The study revelead that the process of data collection is especially challenging in terms of measuring on-board currents. A database including relevant and usable data for modeling of cathodic protection was created. Collection and integration of such data into an improved numerical model will help optimise the systems used by navies of all participating countries. The project was managed and funded by France (DGA), Germany (WiWEB), Italy (Marina Difensa) and UK (DSTL) in the frame of the European Defence Agency, and carried out by Institut de la Corrosion (Project leader, France) DCNS research (France), Centro Sviluppo Materiali (Italy), CNR-ISMAR (Italy), BAE Systems (UK), University of Southampton (UK) and AISH technologies (UK) with contribution from DGA (France), BWA WIWeB and BWB WTD 71 (Germany).   More information: CCNS - Article EDA  About Capability Technology Areas and R&T in EDA  R&T Brochure – EDA Role in Research and Technology For further information, please contact: CapTech.Materials@eda.europa.eu 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/02/07/eda-project-to-improve-corrosion-control-for-navy-ships
EDA_NEWS_0340	2017-02-06	NEWS	EDA project highlights potential of hybrid manned-unmanned platooning	 A collaborative research project on ‘Hybrid Manned Unmanned Platooning (Hy-MUP)’ has just been successfully completed at the European Defence Agency (EDA). The main aim was to prove that it is feasible to coordinate and operate unmanned ground systems together with regular manned vehicles in future mounted combat missions. It also helped the military community to become familiar with heavy unmanned ground vehicles. The Hy-MUP project was funded by the two contributing Member States - France and Germany - and carried out by a consortium consisting of ECA Robotics and Thales for France as well as Diehl BGT Defence and Rheinmetall Landsysteme for Germany. The Hy-MUP project was in fact a continuation of a previous project on ‘Semi-Autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicle (SAM-UGV)’ conducted by the same consortium. Both projects were hosted in the EDA CapTech Ground Systems (Land). The project’s objectives were to: (i) prove the feasibility of the operation of unmanned ground systems in coordination with regular manned vehicles in future mounted combat missions by analysing and defining use-cases for platooning, (ii) identify the high safety requirements and (iii) develop a demonstrator of a hybrid fleet (manned and unmanned vehicles) to be deployed in convoy reconnaissance and/or surveillance (platooning) missions with a mobile Control and Command Vehicle (CCV) manned driven and an mobile robotized vehicle which can either be tele-operated by an operator from the Control Station installed in the CCV or configured to follow a Leader Vehicle autonomously. In addition to that, from the military perspective, another project goal was to help the military community to become familiar with heavy unmanned ground vehicles by progressively introducing heavy robotics in the Armed Forces.   Different ‘Leader Following’ functionalities For the practical part of the project, various case scenarios for using mixed platoons of manned and unmanned vehicles were defined and demonstrated. The Control Station and the communication unit were installed in a Control and Command Vehicle lent by the French MoD. A 4x4 wheels drive civilian vehicle (ISUZU D-MAX) was then equipped with a Drive by Wire capability (including a Drive By Wire (DBW) kit from Paravan and a Robotic kit updated from the SAM-UGV project), several sensors enabling autonomous motion by using ‘Leader Following’ facilities. An additional communication unit enables tele-operation via control station. Two different ‘Leader Following’ functionalities were implemented and evaluated during trials with various Leader Vehicles, various weather conditions and various environments: The first Leader Following functionality runs two algorithms in parallel: (i) one uses the centre vision camera and (ii) the other uses the information coming from a Velodyne - 3D LiDAR sensor. In case one of the algorithms loses the leader, the other can reinitialize the connection of the first one. The second Leader Following functionality combines the data coming from an algorithm using vision camera mounted on Hy-MUP robotized platform and a sign panel installed at the rear of the Leader Vehicle, on one hand, and an algorithm using information from a Velodyne - 3D LiDAR sensor, on the other hand. An ‘Obstacle Avoidance’ function which, in real operations, is required to avoid intruders or collisions (with pedestrian or vehicles) was also tested but could not be fully evaluated during the trials due to project constraints. The Hy-MUP project developed the so-called ‘Hy-MUP system’: it consists of an integrated demonstrator with a Control Station (installed in a manned vehicle of the convoy) and a robotized platform. Teleoperation and autonomous Vehicle Following are available from a moving Control Station. Obstacle Avoidance will have to be further integrated and evaluated. Even though the Hy-MUP system is not yet fully completed and validated, it nevertheless already demonstrated the benefits and importance of manned/unmanned vehicle convoy capabilities in military operations. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/02/06/eda-project-highlights-potential-of-hybrid-manned-unmanned-platooning
EDA_NEWS_0341	2017-01-27	NEWS	EDA project to foster defence innovation	 A new EDA project aimed at understanding the different forces influencing innovation has just been launched. This initiative represents a first try to identify ways and means by which innovation activities could be more systematically managed in order to create additional value for the Agency and its stakeholders. Fostering innovation is key in strengthening Europe’s defence capabilities as it has been clearly stated in the new EU Global Strategy (EUGS) and its implementation plan as well as in the European Commission’s European Defence Action Plan which emphasises the multidimensional role of innovation in defence. In this context, innovation can be perceived as the creation and application of new products, services and processes. This includes the creation of a new technology, product, process or service, as well as the application of existing technology to a different problem or domain. By introducing innovative technologies developed in other domains, both the initial investment risk and the time from ideation to military capability are minimized. Nevertheless, innovation is not only focused on the creation of new concepts. It also focuses on the value that the new concept will create for end-users. In this regard, innovation in the defence sector should aim at enhancing military capability. The new project takes the form of two studies to be carried out by RAND Europe and Indra Systemas S.A respectively and dealing with different aspects of innovation. The project’s objectives are the following: Analysis of the current defence research innovation strategies and identification of best practice in terms of organisational structures, supporting policies and incentives for research innovation management Analysis of stakeholders, environment, specific defence requirements related to innovation and identification of appropriate organizational structures applicable to defence Identification of candidate technologies for innovation injection and preparation of scenarios for a follow on proof of concept Identification of innovation management methods and state-of-the-art practices, such as design thinking and transfer of knowledge to be used within the EDA’s research and innovation communities. The kick-off meetings of both studies, which took place on 16th and 20th of January respectively, set the ground for a very promising project. The working teams have already discussed in depth the transformation of the objectives into tangible outcomes for the Member States in support to the European efforts of fostering innovation in defence. The envisaged outputs will help EDA to provide better support to the innovation activities of Member States as well as those innovation actions foreseen under the Preparatory Action for Defence Research and the future European Defence Research Programme. The kick-off meeting was attended by EDA and staff from the aforementioned contractors. The project is led by Dr. Panagiotis Kikiras Head of Unit Innovative Research. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/01/27/eda-project-to-foster-defence-innovation
EDA_NEWS_0342	2017-02-02	NEWS	Ammunition Classification Under REACH – EDA Task Force Continues Industry Outreach	 EDA’s continued outreach to industry,  which aims to enhance defence industry interaction and cooperation on defence related REACH issues, took another productive step forward on January 25th. The EDA, the EDA REACH Task Force (comprised of Member States REACH experts) and defence industry representatives gathered to exchange views on the topic of Ammunition Classification under REACH. Discussions focused on specific complex ammunition categories, such as smoke ammunition, and benefited from industry’s substantial experience and past work in this field. The meeting was hosted by Nexter Munitions at their industrial facilities in Bourges, France. The agenda for the day included live demonstrations and controlled use of selected types of ammunitions at Nexter Munitions’ testing facilities, providing an in-depth insight into the design of ammunitions as well as the functioning and operating principles of explosives and propellants.  The discussions helped in establishing a common understanding between governmental and industrial experts on the complexities of specific categories of ammunition and in identifying important factors for their classification under REACH, providing a solid basis for further EDA work in this area.  Representatives from  Nexter Munitions, Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD), Etienne Lacroix Group, Rheinmetall Waffe Munition and BAE Systems Land also participated in the meeting. The following day (26 January 2017), the EDA REACH Task Force discussions continued in a Member States only format, at the French Ministry of Defence Training Centre in Bourges, where various types of munitions mock-ups were made available, in view of further elaboration on the design and function of specific categories of ammunition.  EDA’s work on Ammunition Classification under REACH, aims to build a common understanding of the regulatory provisions and to exchange best practices. An overall list of ammunition types used by Member States (MoDs) together with an assessment of the classification of each type under REACH, using prior related guidance by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) as reference, is currently under examination.  The targeted outcome of this project is to establish a potential Member States’ common position, which could also serve as a supportive reference for the defence industry (ammunition manufacturers), as well as the Commission and ECHA, when classifying specific ammunition categories under REACH, in the future.   More information: EDA Reach Project Page EDA Study on Impact of REACH and CLP Regulations on the Defence Sector 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/02/02/ammunition-classification-under-reach-eda-task-force-continues-industry-outreach
EDA_NEWS_0343	2017-01-26	NEWS	EDA Study on the Impact of REACH & CLP European Chemical Regulations on the Defence Sector Released	 A study by EDA has concluded that considering the complexity of defence supply chains and long lifecycles of military equipment, REACH (and associated CLP) regulation, as they stand now, may impact the actual operability of Member States’ Armed Forces.  EDA outsourced a dedicated study to examine what impact the EU’s regulations on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and on the Classification, Labelling and Packaging of chemical substances and mixtures (CLP) have had on the European defence sector (governments and industry) since they entered into force in 2007 and 2009 respectively. Further to assessing the impact of REACH (and associated CLP) regulation on defence, the study aimed to develop recommendations for further improvement of REACH regulation and its current implementation regime. The basis for the study, which was finalised in December 2016, aimed for a win-win solution achieving two principle goals: a high level of health and environmental protection, as well as ensuring the operational effectiveness of Member States’ Armed Forces and enhancing the competitiveness and innovation of the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base. The study’s consultation facilitated input from a wide range of European defence stakeholders including, in particular, the EDA Member States’ Ministries of Defence (MoD), European Commission, European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), Member States’ Competent Authorities on REACH and CLP and  the defence industry. The main conclusions propose several improvements and related actions for stakeholders, broadly grouped into the three main areas: More time and resources (for innovative substitution of Substances of Very High Concern); Consistency of REACH, other EU laws and policies;  EU-level solutions for defence under REACH.  EDA has informed the competent stakeholders (Member States’ MoDs, European Commission, ECHA and the defence industry) on the outcome of the study and is now in the process to further liaise with them, and to support further examination and implementation of the study proposals.  The study recommendations addressed to the Commission also serve as EDA input to the upcoming Commission review of the REACH regulation in 2017.    More information: EDA REACH and CLP Study Final Report REACH - EDA project page 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/01/26/eda-study-on-the-impact-of-reach-clp-european-chemical-regulations-on-the-defence-sector-released
EDA_NEWS_0344	2017-01-26	NEWS	Preparatory Action on defence research: EDA ready to sign delegation agreement	 Speaking before the Security and Defence (SEDE) subcommittee of the European Parliament on 25 January, Denis Roger, the EDA’s Director for European Synergies and Innovation (ESI), hailed the good and effective cooperation between the European Commission and the European Defence Agency on preparing the upcoming Preparatory Action (PA) on defence research which is close to its official launch. “The EDA now stands ready to sign a new Delegation Agreement with the Commission relating to the PA and building on the positive experience of the Pilot Project”, he said. Philippe Brunet, the Commission’s Director for Space Policy and Defence within DG GROW, who also participated in the SEDE debate, indicated that the delegation agreement should be signed quickly, if possible in March 2017. Mr Roger recalled the importance of the Pilot Project (PP) on defence research which is currently being implemented through a delegation agreement signed in November 2015 between the Commission and the EDA, has proved a great opportunity to test the interface between the Commission and the EDA in the implementation of a centrally-funded defence research scheme at EU level. Several ‘lessons learned’ from the PP are being applied in the preparation for the PA, for instance the need to have some more innovative and adapted to defence specificities Intellectual Property Rules (IPR) or to have a wider pool of evaluation experts available. “For the Preparatory Action, the basic rule should be to draw the lessons already learnt from the Pilot Project, to keep the way of working when it demonstrated to be satisfactory and to improve what needs to be improved, while adapting to the increased scale”, Mr Roger said. In particular, he referred to the key ‘upstream role’ the EDA has in consulting all stakeholders (government, industry and RTOs) about key research priorities and consolidating them with Member States. He also mentioned the execution and exploitation (‘downstream’) roles the Agency played in the PP and which it would also have to play in the PA implementation.   Focusing on priority military needs Mr Roger stressed the need to make sure that collaborative defence research undertaken under the Preparatory Action will be linked to priority military capability needs of Member States: “I must insist on this point, which is a key specificity of Defence Research. Since the market is a monopsony, the only buyer being the Ministries of Defence, it is absolutely essential to make sure that the technical requirements of the projects match the future Capability needs defined by Member States and reflected in the Capability Development Plan endorsed at the level of the Ministers of Defence”. “In accordance with article 45 of the Treaty on the European Union, EDA has a key role to play in guaranteeing this consistency between Capability and Research priorities”, he stated.   EDA prepares for PA implementation role Implementing the PA means that the EDA will also have to adapt its own structures because compared to managing a relatively small Pilot Project (three projects with a total budget of €1.4 million), the task of managing a substantially bigger Preparatory Action (€90 million budget over three years with probably more than a dozen projects in total) will be much more of a challenge. That’s why the EDA has already set up a dedicated PA Unit in order to manage EDA’s ‘upstream role’ and its forthcoming implementation role. It already includes four people and additional growth is anticipated once the delegation agreement is signed. The first short term task of that new unit will be the practical implementation of the Preparatory Action Work Programme: launch of the calls, organisation of the evaluation and signing of the grant agreements. “But we also need to have a longer term vision: a key success indicator of the preparatory Action will be the usefulness of the results for Member States’ future Capability Development Programmes”, Mr Roger said. EDA’s existing structures (CapTechs, Project Teams, Working Groups) will contribute to make sure that the PA results are fully taken into account and to promote follow-on projects and programmes. The PA unit could also have a key role, in permanent coordination with the European Commission, to draw, in real time, the lessons learnt from the Preparatory Action that can benefit to the setting up of a potential wider future European Defence Research Programme (EDRP) after 2020.   More information: Full speech of Roger Denis at SEDE committee (25 January 2017) Preparatory Action on defence research (EDA factsheet) First EU Pilot Project in the field of defence research sees grant agreements signed for €1.4 million 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/01/26/preparatory-action-on-defence-research-eda-ready-to-sign-delegation-agreement
EDA_NEWS_0345	2017-01-24	NEWS	High industry attendance at Vienna seminar on EU funding for defence R&T projects	" Rini Goos, EDA’s Deputy Chief Executive, today addressed Austrian security and defence stakeholders at a seminar in Vienna on EU funding opportunities for defence research (R&T) projects. The event was jointly organised by the EDA, the Austrian Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) with the support of the Austrian Defence & Security Industry (ASW). Around 80 representatives from the Austrian MoD, the Federal Economic Chamber, the security and defence industry, business associations, defence-related research and technology organisations as well as universities participated in the seminar which included awareness raising and in-depth know-how building sessions. The seminar showed in concrete terms how to access funding and other instruments available within three European Union funding programmes, i.e. COSME (EU Programme for COmpetitiveness of SMEs), the Structural Funds and the Preparatory Action for Defence Research (PADR). In his opening speech, Rini Goos said: ""We take further legitimation and momentum from a ‘window of opportunities’ opened by the 2016 EU Global Strategy of the High Representative of the Union Ms Mogherini (who is also Vice-President of the European Commission and Head of the EDA), and strengthened by the European Defence Action Plan [EDAP] released by the European Commission. The Global Strategy clearly stated that Union funds - to support defence research and technologies and multinational cooperation - are essential prerequisites for European security and defence efforts, underpinned by a strong European defence industry”. This seminar was the first delivered by EDA since the EDAP proposed that Structural Funds may fund the defence sector. It was also the first EDA’s seminar in a Member State addressing the forthcoming funding opportunities under the Preparatory Action for Defence Research. The EDA, the European Commission, the Ministry of Defence and Sports, the Research Promotion Agency (FFG) and the Austrian Conference on Spatial Planning (ÖROK - as national authority in charge of Structural Funds deployment in Austria) delivered effective presentations about EU funding available for the defence sector currently and in the future. Under the COSME section of the seminar, a particular focus was put on the Enterprise Europe Network’s local free services. Additionally, more than 40 Austrian project managers have been trained to apply for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF, the main among the European Investment and Structural Funds) during a dedicated practical coaching session simulating the application process. The seminar raised interest across all attending stakeholders who were able to establish promising contacts in view of an effective follow-up aimed at accessing EU funding opportunities. Taking into account the increasing opportunities arising from the recent statement in the European Defence Action Plan (EDAP) that Structural Funds may be used to fund the defence sector, different stakeholders have been very keen to exchange views with Mr Goos and EDA’s experts on how to take advantage of EDA’s related work in close cooperation with the Austrian Ministry of Defence and Sport.   More information: Access to EU funding (EDA project page) Dual-use research (EDA project page) Successful seminar on EU funding opportunities in Spain (EDA news) 3 out of 3: another EDA supported dual-use R&T project is awarded ESIF funding (EDA News) Polish dual-use R&T project co-funded by ESIF (EDA news) New funding opportunity for dual-use research "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/01/24/high-industry-attendance-at-vienna-seminar-on-eu-funding-for-defence-r-t-projects
EDA_NEWS_0346	2017-01-20	NEWS	New Defence Energy Managers Course Launched	 The European Defence Agency has launched a new, specialised Defence Energy Managers’ Course (DEMC), which aims to enhance MoD capabilities through the integration of Energy Management Systems within their organisations.  The participants of the DEMC will reinforce their understanding of the complexities of managing energy within a defence organisation or sub-organisation and will acquire the capacity to structure, implement and improve effective Energy Management Systems (EnMS). Through the attendance of the course, MoD/Armed Forces personnel will be trained to the required technical standard to deliver practical, cost-effective solutions and, uniquely, will benefit from case-specific mentoring support to their first project delivered within the context of their normal work activities. After the course, the trainees will have sufficient knowledge to continue to develop their skills in a continuous cycle of self-improvement through on-going mentoring, alumni relations and as members of the European Defence Energy Network (EDEN) with permanent access to its established on-line resources.  Following relevant support from EDA’s EnE WG  participating Member States as well as the pertinent requirements of EU legal framework on Energy Efficiency regarding Energy Management Systems (EnMS), the Agency has  proceeded to contract a developmental educational service from a consortium of professional education service providers.  Based on the ISO 50001 International Energy Standard, the course is tailored to the specificities of the Defence sector and it is divided into the following phases: • One DEMC – Pilot Course, which will provide the initial EnMS approach in the Defence sector and synchronise the various relevant national requirements. The Pilot Course is scheduled to last 14 months, comprising of classroom sessions and alternating with relevant mentoring and in situ on–the-job training (OJT) for developing and implementing an EnMS at home for MoD organisations.  • A maximum of 6 DEMC – Steady State are scheduled for the 3 years to follow a successful completion of the Pilot Course. These courses will comprise the DEMC - Pilot structure, in addition to incorporating the previously gained experience as well as any recommendations and feedback from participating Member States.  The consortium consists of: • ENMS Ltd (Ireland); • Centre for Renewable Energy Sources and Saving (CRES) (Greece) and  • GEN Europe Soluciones Energéticas SL (Spain).

EDA_NEWS_0347	2017-01-23	NEWS	EDA workshop on MARSUR capabilities held in Rome	 Last week (15-20 January), an EDA workshop aimed at training operators and technicians in the daily use of Maritime Surveillance (MARSUR) capabilities was held at the HQ of operation SOPHIA in Rome. The humanitarian crisis resulting from migration via the Mediterranean has led to EU Member States launching a response. So far there are five Naval Operations led by military and civilian entities as well as numerous operations run by Non-Governmental Organisations. While the focus and the aim of military operations such as the NATO-led Ocean Shield and the EU NAVFORMED Operation SOPHIA may differ, one element is vital to all naval operations: Maritime Situational Awareness. Naval Forces the world over are striving to establish what is called a recognized maritime picture. In basic terms that means finding out exactly what is happening in any given operational area at sea, including whether ships (‘contacts’ in naval terms) are transiting the area or working within it. Maritime Situational Awareness also includes knowledge about events taking place in and around a maritime area. Current operations in the Mediterranean have underlined the need to include both military and civilian information to get a full picture. There are many different military and civilians systems around – all of which need to be compiled, verified and analysed – so a significant challenge lies in bringing the relevant information together. To this end, the European Defence Agency (EDA) helped to design an interface acting as a system of systems to support CSDP operations such as the EU NAVFORMED Operation SOPHIA. It does this by enabling maritime headquarters to exchange data and information with other networks through various services such as chat, email, tactical drawing, video recordings and track streaming. The SOPHIA Operational Headquarters was connected to the MARSUR Networking Community which encompasses 17 EU Member States plus Norway. To enhance the input of information, EDA has sponsored and designed a complex workshop which trains operators and technicians in the daily use of the MARSUR capability. This training took place from 15-20 Jan 2017 in Rome, Italy. As a lead nation of Operation SOPHIA and a host nation for the training, Italy offered ideal training conditions. 36 participants from 12 Member States and Norway spent a week at the Italian Tor di Quinto Naval Club. The participants were joined by MARSUR contractors’ representatives, trainers and representatives from the MARSUR community and representatives from the Italian Navy and Operational Headquarters. The week provided a unique opportunity to exchange experience, skills and knowledge about the MARSUR capability and the requirements of Operation SOPHIA. Most of all, meeting counterparts from other Member States helped to personalise the otherwise faceless messages on the screen. The resulting network serves to build up the most important asset of information exchange and cooperation: trust. To provide even more support to Operation SOPHIA, representatives from EDA met with staff from the SOPHIA Operational Headquarters, the Italian Navy and the MARSUR community to ensure that information is sent not only from those ships engaged in Operation SOPHIA, but also all Member States’ ships transiting the Mediterranean. This type of cooperation is a good example of the implementation of the EU Maritime Security Strategy which envisions cross-sectoral information exchange among European actors.   More information: Maritime Surveillance (EDA project page) European Defence Agency supports CSDP operations European maritime surveillance network reaches operational status    	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/01/23/eda-workshop-on-marsur-capabilities-held-in-rome

EDA_NEWS_0349	2017-01-13	NEWS	EDA project to push Circular Economy in Defence	 A new EDA project aimed at setting a roadmap for future activities designed to transpose the ‘Circular Economy’ concept into the defence sector has been launched this Friday 13 January. During a kick-off meeting held at the EDA premises, the first steps of this ambitious project were discussed with experts from the ‘Circular Economy Research Initiative’ of the Cambridge Judge Business School (CJBS) which is the contractor for this project. The project will result in a study scheduled to be finalized by end of October 2017. The CJBS researchers will be working closely with the EDA project team in order to perform the initial assessment of possible constraints and opportunities that could derive from applying the Circular Economy concept and principles to the defence sector. Both teams will then establish a roadmap for follow-on actions and propose suitable alternatives in areas where problems may arise. Circular Economy is a new policy domain that was launched by the European Commission in late 2015 with a communication entitled “Closing the loop: Commission adopts ambitious new Circular Economy Package to boost competitiveness, create jobs and generate sustainable growth”. Then, on 30 November 2016, the European Commission adopted the European Defence Action plan which paved the road for the Circular Economy principles to be applied to the defence sector. As Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen wrote in EDA’s European Defence Matters magazine recently, “the transposition of the circular economy principles in the defence sector can benefit the European industry and economy in many ways.” Indeed, the Circular Economy’s underlying principles are not unfamiliar to the defence sector which has managed to follow a similar path over the years, for instance by applying a through-life management approach. Therefore, it was deemed important that a proactive step be taken in view of assessing the possible alignment or gaps between the flagship initiative of the European Commission and the defence framework. In this respect, the EDA thinks that an assessment of the feasibility of a transposition of the Circular Economy concept into the defence sector could be beneficial. In particular, introducing the Circular Economy principles at an early stage of the research and technology (R&T) phase could produce more systematic and structural benefits. A positive outcome from project study could be highly beneficial for the Member States. The benefits for the defence industry (of which a large part are small and medium enterprises) will be also be explored. The EDA expects that this initial assessment will shed some light on the potential benefits and challenges of applying the Circular Economy package to the defence sector. Moreover, it should allow to identify topics, opportunities and areas that require further assessment and analysis. These topics will be dealt with in the follow-on actions that EDA will take for establishing the work strand in the area of Circular Economy in defence and enable a smooth and beneficial transition. The project team of the Circular Economy Research Initiative of the University of Cambridge Judge Business school consists of Dr Khaled Soufani, Dr Mark Esposito and Dr Tse Terence. The EDA project team is composed by Dr Panagiotis Kikiras, Mr Giorgos Dimitriou and Ms Patricia López Vicente. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/01/13/eda-project-to-push-circular-economy-in-defence
EDA_NEWS_0350	2017-01-12	NEWS	EDA programme launched to improve IED Detection	 A new promising EDA research and technology (R&T) programme aimed at improving Member States’ capabilities in detecting Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) was launched on 23 December 2016 when four EDA Member States (Austria, Belgium, The Netherlands, Poland) as well as Norway (which has an Administrative Arrangement with the Agency) signed an agreement for the 3-year ‘IED Detection’ (IEDDET) ad hoc R&T programme with a total budget of €14 million. The main objective of the IEDDET programme is to develop, improve and field-test IED detection capabilities in order to better protect troops and increase Armed Forces’ operational freedom of movement. Concretely, the programme encompasses three main projects, each of them dealing with a specific topic, namely: Vehicle Mounted Early Warning of Indirect Indicators of IEDs (VMEWI3). The objectives of this project is to focus on the detection of indirect indicators with forward looking camera systems. The technology demonstrator will be based on remotely operated unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) platforms with multi-camera head. The UGV platform will be controlled from a manned vehicle. The aim is to detect indicators of IED presence even while moving with a speed of at least 20-30 km/h (early warning capacity). UGV stand-off multi-sensor platform for IED component detection (MUSICODE). This project will develop new unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) stand-off capabilities for detection of IED components by using remotely operated multisensory platforms. Confirmation, Identification and Airborne Early Warning of IEDs (CONFIDENT). The objectives of this project are two-fold: (i) to focus on the confirmation and the identification of relevant components of IEDs including electronic parts, explosives and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) payloads prior to the release of the agents and (ii) to provide complementary early warning capability. The demonstrators will be based on remotely operated platforms (robot and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, UAV). The UAV will be used for airborne early warning. In order to ensure the coherence and interoperability between the projects, an offline detection map will be produced and shared to best explore the full set of information available for future route clearance operations and the programme will be concluded by a joint demonstration. IEDDET will involve technology companies (including SMEs), academic institutions as well as governmental and non-governmental research organisations which will all cooperate under the guidance of a management committee consisting of experts from the contributing Member States. Countering Improvised Explosive Devices (C-IED) was confirmed as a top priority in the EDA Capability Development Plan (CDP) revision of 2014. The launch of the IEDDET programme is part of the practical implementation of this priority in terms of technology development and seen as a crucial step towards improving existing C-IED capabilities.   More information: Counter-IED (EDA project page) Joint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory (JDEAL) EDA to offer new C-IED application for improved situational awareness (EDA news, November 2016) “C-IED proficiency needs to be improved and shared”, says Jorge Domecq (EDA News, October 2016 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/01/12/eda-programme-launched-to-improve-ied-detection
EDA_NEWS_0351	2016-12-15	NEWS	Commission VP Katainen attends R&T Steering Board meeting	 Jyrki Katainen, the European Commission Vice-President in charge of Jobs, Growth, Investment and Competitiveness, today joined the European Defence Agency’s R&T Steering Board meeting at directors level to present the Commission’s European Defence Action Plan (EDAP) and discuss its research implementation. It was the first time a European Commissioner participated in an EDA Steering Board meeting at directors level which, in itself, reflects the increased importance defence related policies have gained in recent weeks and months, and with it the work done within the Agency. Vice-President Katainen presented R&T Directors of Member States’ MoDs with the main elements of the European Defence Action Plan (EDAP) adopted by the Commission on 30 November, especially the proposed setting up of a European Defence Fund and its ‘research window’ to fund collaborative defence research projects at the EU level. This ‘window’ will be mainly implemented through the Preparatory Action on defence research and should lead to a dedicated European Defence Research Programme (EDRP) in the post-2020 EU multiannual financial framework. R&T directors reviewed and discussed the EDA involvement in the Preparatory Action as well as the Agency’s role within a potentially upcoming EDRP. They were also updated on how the EDA intends to engage industry in the Capability Development Plan (CDP) process. EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq thanked Vice-President Katainen for his presence and welcomed his EDAP presentation. “Any initiative or measure that can help strengthening European defence cooperation and the underlying European Defence and Technological Industrial Base is more than welcome. The Commission has some powerful instruments at its disposal as set out in its Action Plan and I sincerely believe that we should make best use of, interact with and complement those”, he said. Mr Domecq added: “There is a need to carefully articulate and find the right balance between the intergovernmental and the community approach. Finding such balance will determine whether we will be successful together in generating more capabilities, more in cooperation and on a more cost-effective basis”. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/12/15/commission-vp-katainen-attends-r-t-steering-board-meeting
EDA_NEWS_0352	2016-12-22	NEWS	3D printing: EDA launches new project to test feasibility in the defence field	 A innovative and promising defence-related project on Additive Manufacturing (AM, better known as 3D printing) was launched by the European Defence Agency at the kick-off meeting held on 21 December 2016. The project’s objective is to assess the areas where AM can have a positive impact on defence capabilities and to demonstrate its feasibility. The rise of Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies has created a variety of possibilities and potential benefits for the defence community. The “Additive Manufacturing Feasibility Study & Technology Demonstration” was initiated in the framework of the CapTech Materials & Structures, within the EDA Research & Technology (R&T) domain. Raising awareness and promoting a better understanding of AM’s application and potential in different military contexts will contribute to its timely and effective implementation in defence specific areas. The first activity carried out under this initiative will be a desktop study to place AM and its potential in a defence context. This work will summarise the state of the art ability of relevant AM technologies, identify existing R&T and manufacturing capabilities in Europe, and determine areas where further R&T activities should be carried out. The second work strand is a technology demonstration of AM. To this end, a 3D printer will be deployed as part of the EDA Sponsored Airlift Exercise, to be held in Zaragoza (Spain). This represents a significant step in bridging the data gap on 3D printer performance in deployed conditions and will demonstrate the operational utility of these technologies. At the end of the project, the results will be presented at an exhibition to high-ranking military staff, along with equipment and demonstrators, in order to raise awareness on the possible impact of AM in defence. The project represents a clear example of how cross-fertilization of ideas from different domains, from R&T to operations, will enhance defence capabilities, especially when supporting deployed missions. The EDA contractors, the research centre Fundación Prodintec, and the defence industry MBDA France, will work together to support the activities described, and help to create the synergies that will strengthen the links between research activities, industrial development, and the Armed Forces. The project aims to demonstrate how R&T can contribute to strengthening European cooperation, defence capabilities and European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB). The meeting was attended by EDA staff and consortium, European Commission, FOI (SE), FFI (NO), and ES MoD representatives. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/12/22/3d-printing-eda-launches-new-project-to-test-feasibility-in-the-defence-field

In compliance with the initial agreement, the cooperative work has been updated by the two organisations for the years 2017-2018 in order to accommodate the tasks as defined in the SESAR 2020 programme. The work programme makes EUROCONTROL’s expertise in civil-military ATM coordination available to EDA to facilitate EDA’s role regarding the coordination of military views in the context of the Single European Sky (SES) and its interface towards the EU institutions. During the implementation of the previous joint work programme, the EDA-EUROCONTROL cooperation successfully contributed to the provision of harmonised military inputs to the 2015 ATM Master Plan update campaign, supported Member States bidding for EU co-financing in INEA calls and provided technical impact analysis on the SESAR deployment programme and EASA regulatory material under development. “The needs of military aviation often go beyond the scope of civil aviation,” said Frank Brenner, Director General of EUROCONTROL. “To work effectively, European airspace management must address both military and civil airspace user needs with coordinated processes and consultation between civilian and military stakeholders. EUROCONTROL and EDA are working together to contribute to this process”. “To preserve military access to all airspace, it remains essential that we develop harmonised low-cost interoperable SESAR solutions, including standardisation and certification processes, and that we provide common mitigation actions”, said Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency. “Moreover the deployment phase of SESAR offers an opportunity for the military, to avail itself of funding to enhance their ATM technology, when appropriate. This has already been the case for INEA Call 2015, whereby 14 military projects submitted through EDA have been awarded funds adding up to a total of €53.5 million, which is roughly 10.5% of total funds awarded.” EUROCONTROL and EDA have been working closely together since 2008 to ensure improved coordination and cooperation between civil and military air traffic, moving towards a Single European Sky for both military and civil air transport.   For further information, please contact: Kyla Evans Head of Corporate Communications EUROCONTROL Tel: +32 2 729 51 51 press@eurocontrol.int www.eurocontrol.int Eric Platteau Head of Media & Communications European Defence Agency Tel: +32 2 504 28 23 eric.platteau@eda.europa.eu www.eda.europa.eu 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/11/17/eurocontrol-and-the-european-defence-agency-consolidate-their-cooperation
EDA_NEWS_0362	2016-11-18	NEWS	EDA supports Operation Sophia with Cyber Awareness Seminars	 Last week (8-11 November), and for the second time since December 2015, the European Defence Agency (EDA) provided cyber awareness training to more than 100 staff from EUNAVFOR MED operation SOPHIA at the mission’s Operations Headquarters (OHQ) in Rome, Italy. The seminars covered important aspects such as mission-specific cyber threats, the legal framework applicable to cyberspace, common vocabulary and best practices when using communications and information systems. They also served to inform participants about the development and establishment of EU cyber defence capabilities for CSDP military operations and missions. The seminars also allowed the command team of OHQ Rome and the EDA to exchange views on the next steps to be taken to enhance the cyber defence capabilities for EUNAVFOR MED Operation Sophia and other EU-led military operations. The seminars were conducted with the support of the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE) in Tallinn and from SYMANTEC Corporation. The EDA started organizing Cyber Awareness Seminars in 2014 in support of EUFOR RCA as a valuable contribution to raising cyber awareness for all the personnel of activated Headquarters (HQ) for EU-led military operations.   Background The EU Cyber Defence Policy Framework, as adopted by the Council on 18 November 2014, states that “Cyberspace is often described as the fifth domain of military activity, equally critical to European Union (EU) Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) implementation as the domains of land, sea, air, and space. The successful implementation of CSDP has been increasingly dependent on the availability of, and access to, a secure cyberspace. Robust and resilient cyber defence capabilities are now required to support CSDP structures and CSDP missions and operations”. The Policy Framework puts strong emphasis on cyber education and training.   EUNAVFOR MED Operation Sophia EUNAVFOR MED operation Sophia is only one element of a broader EU comprehensive response to the migration issue, which seeks to address not only its physical component, but also its root causes such as conflict, poverty, climate change and persecution. The mission core mandate is to undertake systematic efforts to identify, capture and dispose of vessels and enabling assets used or suspected of being used by migrant smugglers or traffickers, in order to contribute to wider EU efforts to disrupt the business model of human smuggling and trafficking networks in the Southern Central Mediterranean and prevent the further loss of life at sea. Since 7 October 2015, the operation has moved to phase 2 International Waters, which entails boarding, search, seizure and diversion, on the high seas, of vessels suspected of being used for human smuggling or trafficking. Last June , Operation Sophia’s mandate was extended until 27 July 2017 and also reinforced by adding two supporting tasks: training of the Libyan coastguards and navy; contributing to the implementation of the UN arms embargo on the high seas off the coast of Libya. On 30 August and 6 September 2016, the Political and Security Committee (PSC) authorized the launch of the capacity building and training task, and the start of the mission’s role contributing to the implementation of the UN arms embargo respectively.   More information: Support to operations (EDA factsheet) EDA provides cyber defence support to operation EUFOR RCA (webnews September 2014) EEAS website on EUNAVFOR MED       	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/11/18/eda-supports-operation-sophia-with-cyber-awareness-seminars

EDA_NEWS_0364	2016-11-16	NEWS	10th EDA Helicopter Training Exercise Programme takes off in Belgium	 Exercise BLACK BLADE is hosted by Belgium at Florennes airbase and takes place from the 14th of November to the 2nd of December. Over 400 personnel will take part in this exercise, with a total of 14 air assets from 4 Member States being deployed. This edition marks the 10th helicopter exercise under the umbrella of the EDA Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP). The European Defence Agency is working to provide Member States with a framework to develop, consolidate and share best practices in order to meet the challenges of flying helicopters in a modern operational environment. In consultation with Member States (MS), several factors were identified which were thought to contribute to the non-employability of helicopters; a lack of training for the crews, a lack of technical equipment for the aircraft, and the challenges of logistic support to deployed operations. The EDA is helping participating MS address these issues with the training element being the main focus. Exercises such as BLACK BLADE are fundamental to the EU capability development process.   Exercise BLACK BLADE BLACK BLADE marks the 10th helicopter exercise under the umbrella of the Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP). BLACK BLADE is a Special Operations Forces oriented helicopter exercise, focusing on enhancing interoperability at a tactical level in a realistic and challenging environment. Over 400 personnel will take part in this exercise programme. A total of 14 air assets from 4 Member States (13 helicopters from Belgium, Slovenia and Austria and one Falcon aircraft from the UK) will be used. BLACK BLADE will deliver tactical training, over a three week period, offering participants a unique opportunity to plan and execute missions within a joint combined framework. The seamless coordination and integration of the Belgium Special Operations Ground Forces into individual scenarios for the benefit of training will be one of the specific focuses of the exercise. Commenting at the start of exercise BLACK BLADE, EDA Chief Executive, Jorge Domecq pointed to the significance of this edition:  “The 10th edition of the Helicopter Training Exercise Programme, comes at a moment when European defence is high on the political agenda. The 10th edition is a milestone for this programme, the EDA and the Member States involved. Exercise BLACK BLADE is European defence cooperation in action. It represents a dynamic and tangible example of what cooperation among the Member States can achieve. It also highlights the importance of joint training as a prerequisite to enhance interoperability and a key enabler to ensure readiness to deploy. A positive step forward for European defence”. The ultimate goal for BLACK BLADE is to develop and improve immediate output through pooling and sharing, enhance training skills among European countries for flying in different environments, and to train for future European crisis management operations.BLACK BLADE is a real-world example of what can be achieved through European defence cooperation and highlights that at very low cost, immediate operational output can be realised.   New milestone for the EDA The HEP is one of the EDA’s helicopter training projects and programmes. By enhancing the operating skills of helicopter crews across Europe, the HEP plays a part in increasing the deployable helicopter capability for contingency operations. The exercises focus on individual, environmental and multinational training, increasing interoperability through practical experiences, sharing operational experience and developing common tactics, techniques and procedures. HEP is a ten-year programme, a concrete indication that training together is an integral part of enhancing European capability and interoperability.   EDA Helicopter Training In Numbers Between 2009 and 2016 : 206 helicopters, 1320 aircrew members and almost 13000 infantry from 19 Member States have deployed to the exercises which were held in France, Spain, Italy, Portugal and Belgium.   Future Events A Distinguished Visitors Day (DVD) will be held on November 30th , which the Head of the EDA, High Representative and Vice-President of the European Commission, Federica Mogherini will attend.   More information: Fact Sheet Exercise BLACK BLADE 2016 Helicopter Initiatives (EDA project page) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/11/16/10th-eda-helicopter-training-exercise-programme-takes-off-in-belgium
EDA_NEWS_0365	2016-11-15	NEWS	Outcome of EDA Ministerial Steering Board	 At the EDA ministerial Steering Board which met this Tuesday morning (15 November) under the chairmanship of HR/VP Federica Mogherini in her capacity as Head of the Agency, Defence Ministers tasked EDA to review the Capability Development Plan (CDP), approved the 2017 general budget and agreed to set up a working group to study the potential creation of a Cooperative Financial Mechanism. Ministers agreed to the review of the Capability Development Plan (CDP), to improve the capability development process by taking into account R&T and industrial aspects, and tasked the EDA to present a new set of EU priorities for military capability development for Steering Board adoption by spring 2018. The CDP review is a key element of the new EU Global Strategy (EUGS) which states that, in order to match the level of ambition set out in the strategy, Member States will need high-end military capabilities, i.e. full-spectrum land, air, space and maritime capabilities, including strategic enablers. The CDP serves as a reference for national capability planning by informing Member States about capability requirements over time, identifying areas for capability improvements and translating capability priorities into concrete collaborative programmes.   EDA 2017 budget: first increase since 2010 Ministers approved EDA’s general budget for 2017: €31 million compared to €30.5 million in 2016.   Cooperative Financial Mechanism (CFM) Ministers were presented with EDA proposals for the potential establishment of a ‘Cooperative Financial Mechanism’ (CFM) the objective of which would be to overcome the lack of budgetary synchronisation between Member States and the problems that this causes for the launch of cooperative defence cooperation projects. They agreed to set up a working group within EDA in view of submitting a legal and financial package and associated recommendations in spring 2017. Experience has shown that one of the key factors that block or hinder cooperation is budget asymmetry or lack of synchronisation of budget availability. A potential Cooperative Financial Mechanism could alleviate this challenge by supporting the launch of projects (R&T, capability development). It would potentially incentivise cooperation by tackling the problem of absence of budgetary synchronisation, but also increasing the availability of common resources/ring-fencing budgets allocated to cooperation. The CFM will have to respect the budgetary specialty principle as expressed in the national budgetary laws and ensure that Member States keep full control of their resources and on the use of the mechanism. These aspects will be dealt with in the EDA working group.   Implementation of EDA key taskings Ministers welcomed the progress made on the implementation of the Agency’s ‘key taskings’ in the various capability programmes and the work carried out in relation to the Preparatory Action, and were briefed on the planned next steps, notably in the context of the taskings that emerge from the Council conclusions adopted yesterday (14 November) on implementing the EUGS in the area of Security and Defence. The EDA was invited to develop a structured dialogue with industry, including not only prime companies but also national defence industry associations (NDIAs) and SMEs from Member States, in support of Key Strategic Activities (KSA) the first five test cases for which have also been welcomed.

EDA_NEWS_0366	2016-11-15	NEWS	EDA to offer new C-IED application for improved situational awareness	 As part of its ongoing efforts to improve Counter Improvised Explosive Devices (C-IED) capabilities, the European Defence Agency (EDA) will shortly share a new C-IED tool with its participating Member States. Under the umbrella of the existing Framework Cooperation Agreement with the C-IED Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Madrid/Spain, a new ‘Counter-IEDs analyst Interagency Unclassified Situational Awareness Tool’ (C-IUSAT) will soon enter into service in order to promote information sharing between C-IED operators. The application is expected to be released in December 2016. The tool will help users to gain a better situational understanding by projecting, with several degrees of probability, the next actions that the enemy or other threat elements are likely to carry out. Thereby, further exchanges of information between military and other involved agents such as host nations, Law Enforcement, governments, NGOs, private companies, etc. can be ensured. C-IUSAT will be a common information exchange tool, with restricted access, available to different services/agencies and private organizations. It will help them to collect information, show it on maps and generate models which can subsequently identify expected paths or ways of action. C-IUSAT will be a web based tool, accessible by PC or mobile phone. It stores its own map data which can be used to generate different data layers for various events/activities/sources thereby enhancing situational awareness. A meeting will be organized at the EDA in early 2017 to proceed with a live demonstration of the tool’s main features.   More information: Counter-IED (EDA project page) “C-IED proficiency needs to be improved and shared”, says Jorge DOMECQ (EDA webnews, October 2016) First C-IED workshop successfully completed (EDA webnews, June 2016)  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/11/15/eda-to-offer-new-c-ied-application-for-improved-situational-awareness
EDA_NEWS_0367	2016-11-14	NEWS	EDA Helicopter Tactics Symposium held in Athens	 The European Defence Agency’s 7th Helicopter Tactics Symposium, organised under EDA’s Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP), was held in Athens/Greece from 7-9 November. As in previous years, the symposium offered a unique opportunity for European helicopter crews to discuss and share experience in helicopter techniques, tactics and procedures. The symposium was opened by Brigadier General Iliopoulos (Hellenic Army Aviation Directorate) in the Greek Officers’ Mess in Athens. Over 40 helicopter tactics instructors and experts from 14 countries, with representatives of the Helicopter Tactics Course (HTC), of the Helicopter Tactics Instructor Course (HTIC) and of the Joint Air Power Competence Centre (JAPCC) gathered for this annual Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP) event to analyse lessons learned and best practices identified in recent exercises, and to learn about new training opportunities offered by the contributing Member States of the HEP. Briefings and discussions covered the tactical lessons learned from Dutch helicopter operations in Mali, the Czech Special Operations Aviation Task Unit (SOATU) training, the mentoring of Afghan aircrew by Hungary, the Belgium Mission Planning Process and the environmental training in extreme conditions experienced during exercise Cold Blade 2016 in Ivalo, Finland. In addition, host nation Greece presented its approach to Helicopter Aviation training, fire-fighting and MEDEVAC missions with their CH-47D Chinook helicopters. The presentations were followed by panel discussions for both attack and support helicopter operators; they brought a useful insight into the latest developments in night vision goggles training, Electronic Warfare, landing zone tactics, use of sensors and technologies applied in Degraded Visual Environments, currency and proficiency challenges and helicopter self-defence aids used by the Member States. The discussions triggered new proposals for updating the HEP Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) - the capstone tactics manual for multinational helicopter operations. The academic sessions were followed by operational and planning discussions with a view to updating the HEP SOP, the HEP, HTC and the HTIC programmes as well as the NATO ATP-49. The aims and objectives of the upcoming HEP exercises were presented in detail, including Black Blade 2016 in Belgium (with a focus on helicopters and Special Operations Forces exercise) and Fire Blade 2017 in Hungary (helicopter live-firing and urban operations). The next HEP event, Exercise BLACK BLADE 2016, starts today (14 November) at Florennes Airbase in Belgium and will last until 2 December.   More information: 4th EDA Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC) successfully concluded (EDA news, October 2016) Helicopter Initiatives (EDA project page)  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/11/14/eda-helicopter-tactics-symposium-held-in-athens
EDA_NEWS_0368	2016-11-10	NEWS	"Slovak EU Presidency at EDA Annual Conference: ""Common solutions are needed on defence"""	 Speaking today at the EDA Annual Conference 2016 on behalf of the Slovak EU Presidency, State Secretary of the Ministry of Defence Dr. Róbert Ondrejcsák called for “common solutions” on European defence. In his keynote speech, Dr. Ondrejcsák praised the publication of the new EU Global Strategy as “the strongest impetus the CSDP received in terms of strategy since 2003” and recalled the implementation work launched since then, notably the High Level Conference on EUGS Implementation organised by the Slovak Presidency and also attended by High Representative Mogherini. “The debate since then shows how diverse positions of the EU Member States are in defence domain”, he said.   “Important to find common solutions on defence” Dr. Ondrejcsák stated: “Consensus is well reached on the main principles of the level of ambition, such as responding to external conflicts and crises, building the capacities of fragile partners and protecting the Union and its Member states, but when it comes to details, the unanimity is far more difficult, or impossible to reach. Despite the common goal, we still diversify in visions and plans concerning defence cooperation, financing CSDP missions and operations, EU Battle Groups and form of support of our partner countries. Slovakia is not an exception, of course. But it is important that at the end of the day we find common solutions, agreeable to every Member State”.   Active role for the EDA The work of the European Commission is seen by the EU Presidency as “of great importance for the current CSDP context”. In this respect, the upcoming European Defence Action Plan, as part of the wider package, “also creates a space for an active role for the European Defence Agency”, Dr. Ondrejcsák said. He continued: “We support fostering European defence industry and defence research creating a basis for modern capabilities to maintain security and defence needs of the EU. The initiative with its funding instruments should be open to all beneficiaries with a close focus on small and medium enterprises. We also welcome special attention the European Defence Agency pays to defence industry in Central and Eastern Europe. I am referring to an extensive analysis about measures to enhance balanced defence Industry in Europe, which identifies obstacles and proposes solutions for defence cooperation among central and eastern European countries. The Agency regularly offers room for national armaments directors from the Visegrad 4 countries to seek possibilities for collaborative projects”.   European Defence and Technological and Industrial Base “In times of increasingly fast-changing environment of creating new technologies and the continued need for innovation and the creation of new business models, the European defence sector needs to cope with these changes to remain an important part of the global defence market and remain relevant”, the State Secretary said. “This means preparing for an age of relative uncertainty that can be highly diversified, hybrid and flexible and can well require from the defence sector to adapt quickly to changing innovation patterns, new mind-sets and corporate cultures. In this strategic context, an innovative and competitive European industry is a strategic asset to support EU Global Strategy implementation and be at the centre of development of defence-related capabilities, skills and industrial manufacturing capabilities”. He added: “At present, we are still situated in an environment of significant economic restrictions in the defence sector. Member States' budgets cuts, increasing prices of defence products and new players on the global military equipment and technology market impact the European defence industry. Therefore, it is necessary to change the approach. If not, the EU and its Member States will face reduced military effectiveness and the defence sector declined military business opportunities. If we use funds more efficiently, combine our efforts and share common capabilities, we can achieve the high effect for less money spent”.   Defence R&T Another risk Europe faces is the lack of Research and Development (R&D) funding, lack of innovation and procurement of new military equipment and defence systems. “In reality it means that Europe and its Member States will no longer be able to afford sophisticated modern military capabilities that would necessarily need to fulfil the tasks determined. It creates a risk for the European defence industry, which will face an increasing competition from companies producing military equipment in the third countries”. “Pooling requirements and achieving significant savings from economies of scale would enable Member States to acquire the necessary military capabilities that would otherwise could not afford individually. Some activities can be done also on bilateral basis, such as common maintenance, training, exercises and joint research and development. The creation of a common European market for defence would strengthen the European defence industry and would also help Member States to develop military capabilities they need to fully perform its tasks in accordance with the CSDP”, he stated.   More information Federica Mogherini opens EDA Annual Conference 2016 / speech / video Listening to the supply & demand sides: EDA Annual Conference panels deliver interesting insights Commissioner Bieńkowska outlines upcoming European Defence Action Plan at EDA Annual Conference EDA Annual Conference 2016 closes with call for cooperation on defence innovation Pictures of the EDA Annual Conference 2016 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/11/10/slovak-eu-presidency-at-eda-annual-conference-common-solutions-are-needed-on-defence
EDA_NEWS_0369	2016-11-10	NEWS	EDA Annual Conference 2016 closes with call for cooperation on defence innovation	" EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq closed today's Annual Conference 2016 with a call for ""cooperation to generate innovation"". In his final remarks wrapping up a ""very insightful and constructive conference"", Mr Domecq thanked all the speakers for their interesting contributions: Federica Mogherini, Head of the Agency, High Representative and Vice-President of the European Commission, Commissioner Bieńkowska, Slovak State Secretary Ondrejcsák and Mr. De Spiegeleire. He also expressed gratitude to the members of two panels ""who brought their insights, expertise and assessments to the table today"".   Main takeaways Mr Domceq singled out a number of takeaways from this year's EDA conference, in particular: in our increasingly challenging security environment, innovation in research, planning and funding is paramount; therefore, safeguarding leadership in strategic technologies is more pressing than ever. Especially fields like biotechnology, nanotechnology and deep intelligence will have a profound impact on Europe’s ability to develop strategic assets at the same time, new technologies and new innovation will require a new mind set: to seek out and import commercial sector innovations and quickly develop new concepts of operation; to tap into innovation in the private sector and channel it into defence; and also to achieve cross-border competition which is speciually important to SME's and start-ups in Member States which do not have prime defence companies we have to find a balance between not suffocating SME's and start-ups and taping their knowledge for defence and, on the other hand, provide our governments with assurances that these new players will respect the specificities of the defence and security world European collaboration generates innovation and ""remains the best guarantee for achieving value for money and developing cutting-edge defence capabilities"". ""Cooperation is voluntary but it is a need""  the main challenges arising from a third industrial revolution are to integrate future innovations into development and production cycles, gain awareness of emerging leap-ahead technologies, access non-traditional sources of innovation, and ensure the reliability of trusted supply chains innovation does not come for free: the massive decline in budgetary terms of our defence R&T efforts is a matter of the highest concern because capabilities of the future are at stake here and the competitiveness of our defence industry is at risk. Therefore, fresh funding and the reinforcement of our R&T and innovation efforts will be key to structure European cooperation to reap the benefits, and not just adapt, to a third industrial revolution, Member States should make systematic use of the programmatic, financial and policy instruments offered by the EU which can support defence research, identify key enabling technologies and support testing and experimentation in view of potential uptake in defence products the EDA is looking to get ahead by also working “up-stream”, notably by facilitating Member States’ convergence on identifying and prioritising research topics without a strong incentive, the current momentum may tail off. We must incentivise the right actions and the right programmes cooperation in defence is still not part of Europe’s DNA. Yet, it remains the most efficient and cost effective way to ensure Europe’s strategic autonomy strategic autonomy and a committment to a strong relationship with our partners are two sides of the same coin; otherwise, the technological gap will create a political gap  as a hub for innovation, collaboration and action, EDA will continue to engage with industry and R&T innovators as valuable partners in providing technology and solutions which address the needs of Member States.   EDA : ""At the service of Member States"" Mr Domecq concluded the Annual Conference 2016 by recalling ""EDA's mantra: at the service of its Member States"". However, ""the Agency's output depends entirely on Member States input. So, view this agency as a crucial and natural partner. Use our resources and expertise"".   More information Federica Mogherini opens EDA Annual Conference 2016 / speech / video Listening to the supply & demand sides: EDA Annual Conference panels deliver interesting insights Slovak EU Presidency at EDA Annual Conference: ""Common solutions are needed on defence"" Commissioner Bieńkowska outlines upcoming European Defence Action Plan at EDA Annual Conference Pictures of the EDA Annual Conference 2016 "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/11/10/eda-annual-conference-2016-closes-with-call-for-cooperation-on-defence-innovation

EDA_NEWS_0371	2016-11-09	NEWS	Satellite imagery analysis & exploitation workflows tested at REACT implementation meeting	 22 satellite imagery analysts and experts from seven EDA Member States (Austria, Belgium, Spain, France, Italy, The Netherlands, Poland) plus Denmark, as well as six analysts from the European Union Satellite Centre (EU SATCEN) and one from the European Border and Coast Agency (FRONTEX) met from 19-21 October at the SATCEN headquarter in Torrejón de Ardoz/Madrid for a REACT study implementation meeting. The REACT (Radar imagEry Applications supporting ACTionable intelligence) study, initiated and managed by the European Defence Agency (EDA) in cooperation with EU SATCEN and participating Member States, aims at giving more value to imagery data, identifying areas where military imagery analysts can be assisted by tools/workflows to produce valuable and possibly actionable intelligence, according to users’ information requests. The study is focused on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery processes and in the combined use of SAR and electro-optical images. The study has been awarded to an international consortium composed by: e-GEOS, Telespazio Ibérica and INTA. The contract was signed in January 2016. The aim of the REACT implementation session was to test, in a pseudo-operational environment, the workflows for the exploitation of satellite radar imagery defined during the previous phases of the study. Several workflows were tested: Monitoring, Damage Assessment, Search/Targeting. New algorithms, still in a research and development phase, were also presented. For each of programme topics, the operational experts received a “Request for Information” task. The operators were tasked to perform imagery processing and imagery analysis in accordance with the workflows previously defined during the REACT study. Satellite radar imagery was provided by the EU SATCEN and by the industrial consortium. The session proved to be extremely useful for the participating experts in many respects, especially because it helped them to face the intrinsic complexity of working with radar imagery and provided practical information in each step of the defined workflow. The expertise acquired during the session will also help the imagery analysts to establish effective working procedures for radar imagery exploitation, understand the pros and cons of using the several software suites available and evaluate the state of the art of new tools and algorithms for radar imagery exploitation (e.g Automatic Target Detection & Recognition). An additional similar session will be organized in Rome in December for two scenarios typically encountered during FRONTEX activities: pre-frontier and coastal monitoring. The results of the REACT activities will feed into the work of the forthcoming EDA Project Team Space Based Earth Observation. In addition to that, the lessons learned during the meeting on the new tools and algorithms may also be discussed in the relevant EDA CapTechs.

EDA_NEWS_0372	2016-11-03	NEWS	Successful seminar on EU funding opportunities in Spain	" The Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency (EDA), Jorge Domecq, today addressed Spanish security and defence stakeholders at a seminar in Seville on European Union funding opportunities. The event was jointly organised by the EDA, the Spanish Ministry of Defence and the Agency of Innovation and Development of Andalusia (IDEA). Around 130 representatives from the Spanish Ministry of Defence, defence industry and business associations, defence-related research and technology organisations and universities participated in the seminar, which included awareness raising and in-depth know-how building sessions. The seminar showed in concrete terms how to access funding and other instruments available within two major European Union funding programmes running until 2020, i.e. COSME (EU Programme for COmpetitiveness of SMEs) and the Structural Funds. Rear Adm. Jesús Manrique Braojos, Deputy NAD of the Ministry of Defence of the Kingdom of Spain, welcomed the audience followed by introductory remarks by the Andalusian regional minister for Employment, Enterprise and Commerce, José Sanchez Maldonado. In his opening speech, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq said: ""A 'window of opportunities' was opened by both the June 2016 EU Global Strategy of the High Representative of the Union, Federica Mogherini, and the State of the Union speech by Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in September. The Global Strategy clearly stated that Union funds - to support defence research and technologies and multinational cooperation - are essential prerequisites for European security and defence efforts, underpinned by a strong European defence industry. EDA’s work has already provided a positive answer to the question whether Structural Funds may co-fund dual-use research and technology projects, which clearly have a favourable impact on both the civilian and the defence fields. EDA has also recently clarified the conditions legitimizing access - for both defence and dual-use related SMEs and clusters - to the opportunities of the EU COSME Programme 2014-2020. Altogether, considering EDA encouraging results on Structural Funds and COSME so far, one can say that the time for action is now”. Both the European Commission and the Spanish Ministry of Enterprises and Public Administrations’ Directorate in charge for the coordination of the national deployment of Structural Funds made presentations about currently available EU funding for the defence sector. A particular focus was put on dual-use R&T funding and on the Enterprise Europe Network’s local free services in native languages. Additionally, more than 40 Spanish project managers were trained to apply for the European Regional Development Fund during a dedicated coaching session. Finally, around 60 business-to-business meetings were arranged during a conclusive matchmaking session. The seminar raised interest across all attending stakeholders, who have established promising contacts in view of an effective follow-up aimed at accessing EU funding opportunities. Taking into account the increasingly blurred lines between internal and external security on the one hand and civil and defence technology on the other hand, different stakeholders exchanged views with Mr Domecq on how to take advantage of EDA’s work, through close cooperation with the Ministry of Defence of the Kingdom of Spain, in order to promote civil/military synergies wherever appropriate.   More information: Access to EU funding (EDA project page) Dual-use research (EDA project page) 3 out of 3: another EDA supported dual-use R&T project is awarded ESIF funding (EDA News) Polish dual-use R&T project co-funded by ESIF (EDA news) New funding opportunity for dual-use research "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/11/03/successful-seminar-on-eu-funding-opportunities-in-spain
EDA_NEWS_0373	2016-11-08	NEWS	Partners step up efforts to address the integration of drones into European airspace	" The European Commission's services (DG MOVE), the European Defence Agency (EDA), the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the SESAR Joint Undertaking (SJU) are stepping up efforts to address the integration of drones into the European aviation and air traffic management (ATM) system. A new coordination mechanism was agreed upon at a meeting of the organisations’ director generals on 27 October, which aims to address the research and development (R&D) and regulatory requirements of all categories of remotely-piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) – a subset of drones. It was agreed that these requirements take into account the EDA’s ""dual-use strategy"" for the integration of military drones. The SESAR project in coordination with EASA will provide the necessary support framework to address the R&D and regulatory needs in Europe and from a global perspective. This work will be done in close and efficient coordination with the EDA, while further efforts will be undertaken to engage other organisations in Europe in this coordination endeavour. The coordination mechanism will look at ATM requirements for drone integration and their technical implications. The findings will be reported to DG MOVE in order to support the definition and coordination of policy initiatives with the relevant Commission services. The overall ATM requirements for drone integration will be incorporated into the next update of the European ATM Master Plan – the roadmap for ATM modernisation. Planned for 2017, the next update will aim to provide a description of the overarching technical, operational, financial and performance related needs and requirements for the integration of drones, while also addressing the global context of initiatives falling under the aegis of ICAO.

EDA_NEWS_0374	2016-11-10	NEWS	Listening to the supply & demand sides: EDA Annual Conference panels deliver interesting insights	" After HR/VP Federica Mogherini's capturing opening speech and an inspiring presentation by Stephan De Spiegeleire of the Hague Centre for Strategic Studies on innovation and research as part of a wider vision for a future European defence, the attendees of the EDA Annual Conference 2016 witnessed two lively and interactive panel debates moderated by Graham Muir (Head of EDA's Strategy & Policy Unit) on the opportunities and challenges from the supply and demand sides.   Panel 1: Supply side High-level panelists in this first roundtable were Lowri Evans (Director General DG Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SME's at the European Commission), Heikki Allonen (former CEO and President of Patria Oyj, the Finnish national defence induystry group), Dr. Kurt Braatz (Senior Vice President at Krauss-Maffei Wegman), Pedro Sinogas (CEO of Tekever) as well as Prof. Witold Holubowicz (CEO of research/consulting company Itti Ltd.). The panel raised and discussed a number of crucial questions related to the future of the European defence industry, such as 'Are Europe's defence industrial models suited for the future?', 'How best to bring innovation closer to defence?', 'Is enough being done to capitalise on civil and military synergies?' and 'What measures can the European Commission bring to support innovation in defence?'. A particular emphasis was put on how the role of SMEs and Start-Ups in the defence supply chain could best be maximised and how their full potential as a source of innovation and a key enabler for competitiveness can be realized. In this respect, the need was stressed to promote SME's access to defence research pogrammes and to encourage their greater involvement in EU funding programmes.   Panel 2: Demand side The second panel debate in the afternoon saw high-profile representatives from national governments and EU institutions sharing their views on implications for the defence sector at large: whole-of-government policies in support of strategic innovation, emerging risks and vulnerabilities in terms of technology control, interface with industry, impact on acquisition choices and life-cycle management. The four high-level panelists were: Rear Admiral Matteo Bisceglia (Director for Naval Armaments, Italy), Ioan Mircea Paşcu (Vice-President of the European Parliament and former Defence minister of Romania),Vice Admiral Mark Mellett (Chief of Defence, Ireland) and Alexander Weis (Vice-Director of the Bundeswehr Planning Office, Germany). Among the questions discussed were the following: 'Are the current procurement processes of Defence Ministries best adapted to the challenges and opportunities presented by innovation?', 'How important is continued and sustained national investment in research & innovation?', 'What do policy-makers need to do to provide the best possible environment to foster the technological innovations required?', 'How can Europe respond to the US Third Offset Strategy?' and 'How to overcome fragmentation of demand?'. There was broad consensus on the EDA's role in defence R&T and innovation: the Agency should continue to act as a ""catalyst"" by identifying innovation gaps and potential collaborative opportunities, bringing interested Member States together and facilitating collaborative R&T projects. However, it was stressed, R&T initiatives need to be driven by capability requirements. The objective is not to fund industrial policy, said Mr Weis. ""The EDA has to make sure that R&T projects are capability driven, be it national or EU capabilities"".   More information Federica Mogherini opens EDA Annual Conference 2016 / speech / video Slovak EU Presidency at EDA Annual Conference: ""Common solutions are needed on defence"" Commissioner Bieńkowska outlines upcoming European Defence Action Plan at EDA Annual Conference EDA Annual Conference 2016 closes with call for cooperation on defence innovation Pictures of the EDA Annual Conference 2016 "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/11/10/'opportunities-and-challenges-from-the-supply-side'-debated-at-eda-annual-conference
EDA_NEWS_0375	2016-11-10	NEWS	Federica Mogherini opens EDA Annual Conference 2016	" The European Defence Agency (EDA) Annual Conference 2016 entitled 'A third industrial evolution or revolution in defence?' was opened Thursday morning (10 November) in Brussels by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission, Federica Mogherini, who is also the Head of the Agency. Addressing a 500 strong audience coming from the whole European defence spectrum - governments, armed forces, industry, EU institutions, NATO, think tanks and media - Mrs Mogherini said in her opening speech that time had come to make urgent and concrete steps towards a stronger and more efficient European defence, and to do it “the European way”. We don’t need another theoretical and endless debate about a potential EU army or treaty change but what is needed are ""very concrete actions"" to be delivered in the next months to make sure Europe can protect it citizens and become a global security provider. This is what citizens expect now that Europe is facing a ""security crisis"", she stressed. “There are no excuses, we have to do it and we have to do it now”. March 2017, when Europe will celebrate the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, will be a good moment to have a concrete implementation process up and running and to deliver on defence integration. ""Sixty years ago, the founding fathers and mothers of our European Union believed that a united Europe had to be built on two pillars: a European Economic Community, and a Defence Community. They knew that a true Union could not simply rely on the integration of the markets. They were right, and yet they failed. Sixty years later, I believe the original intuition has become even more relevant"", Mrs Mogherini stressed. To move ahead towards a defence union, Europe has not to start from scratch because the Treaty of Lisbon already offers all the tools that are required. “We just need to use them. This is a matter of political will, stated Mrs Mogherini adding that she saw now a “clear window of opportunity” to achieve concrete results in the coming months. She recalled the three parallel processes currently ongoing, namely the implementation of the EU Global Strategy, the Commission’ upcoming European Defence Action Plan (EDAP) and the follow-up on the recent joint EU/NATO Declaration. These three processes have to be complementary, she insisted. We have to advance quickly, “we have to run”, to make sure that those processes lead to first concrete results by spring 2017. In this respect, the European Defence Agency can act as a pivot between the Commission and Member States on European defence, Mrs Mogherini said.   Capabilities are crucial The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission put a special emphasis on the need to make sure Europe has the required capabilities to play its role in defence. Capabilities have to be up to the task. ""And here, Europe has to be very careful, I believe, very careful, that the investment gap is not translated into an ever wider technology gap. Because a technology gap would then lead to an interoperability gap. And if left unchecked, this could translate into a political gap which would clearly not be in our interest. And I would add, this would also have economic implications for our continent"". There will be no strategic autonomy and defence role for Europe without a strong and smart and innovative European defence technology and industrial base, Mrs Mogherini concluded.   More information Speech of the HR/VP Mogherini / video Listening to the supply & demand sides: EDA Annual Conference panels deliver interesting insights Slovak EU Presidency at EDA Annual Conference: ""Common solutions are needed on defence"" Commissioner Bieńkowska outlines upcoming European Defence Action Plan at EDA Annual Conference EDA Annual Conference 2016 closes with call for cooperation on defence innovation Pictures of the EDA Annual Conference 2016 "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/11/10/federica-mogherini-opens-eda-annual-conference-2016
EDA_NEWS_0376	2016-10-25	NEWS	4th EDA Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC) successfully concluded	 After two intense months of training, the 4th EDA Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC), which had kicked off mid-August at RAF Linton-on-Ouse in the North of England, was officially completed on 9 October at Vidsel Airbase in Northern Sweden. Involving helicopters and aircrew from Sweden, Germany, the United Kingdom and Austria, the course was branded by experienced participants as the ‘most challenging yet’ in terms of adverse weather conditions, aircraft unserviceability and a particularly intense flying programme. Ten instructors managed to graduate with a Silver and eight with a Bronze Level; they are now fully ready and prepared to complete the course in 2017. After threat briefs and lectures from Air Battle Space Management, the course started with a simulation phase covering all aspects of tactical formation, evasion training and electronic warfare. It culminated in a complex simulated sortie requiring detailed planning and the ability to complete a task in a hostile and contested environment. All trainees reached the required standard that allowed them to move on to the next level: the live flying phase which took place in the Vidsel Test range in Northern Sweden. During that live flying training in Sweden, HTIC staff was complemented by operations & logistics staff from the Swedish Air Force as well as from the UK. Having such a strong team proved vital in the two weeks that followed when course participants had to cope with very poor weather conditions, unserviceable aircraft and sick aircrew. Despite the flying programme changing constantly, the high degree of flexibility provided by the team made it possible that sorties were still manageable and successfully achieved under testing conditions. When the weather started to improve, participants had to conduct two sorties every day to make up the delay caused by the earlier bad weather. Most sorties were completed to a satisfactory level meaning that all participants were allowed to move ahead to the Composite Air Operations (COMAO) phase which all completed successfully.   More information: Third Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course successfully accomplished (webnews, November 2015) Helicopter Initiatives (EDA project page)  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/10/25/4th-eda-helicopter-tactics-instructors-course-(htic)-successfully-concluded
EDA_NEWS_0377	2016-11-03	NEWS	EDA Workshop on Materials 2050	 As the defence and security landscape moves into more complex and uncharted areas, studying and developing the capabilities of the future is becoming increasingly challenging. The emergence of new platform concepts and the lead times, often spanning over decades, for materials used in major platforms result in a pressing need to start research efforts in the present. On 18 October 2016, 25 experts from various European Ministries of Defence, the U.S. Department of Defense, European institutions, and industry participated in an EDA workshop to identify materials envisioned to be used by military forces in the year 2050. High-level experts on materials and defence technologies gathered to discuss the types and functionalities of materials with a potential to improve military operations in 35 years as well as major advances that might be foreseen. Thought-provoking presentations from the European Defence Agency (EDA), the Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI), the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the European Union Institute for Security Studies (EUISS) and the European Space Agency (ESA) underlined the importance of long-term defence R&T strategic planning. They showed how innovative materials and manufacturing can be used in a wide range of applications - lowering the burden of the soldier, stealth and protection, ammunition enhancements - and can improve the lifespan, logistical aspects and functional capabilities of existing & future platforms – air, naval and land. Using a structured brainstorming method, the organizers dynamically combined the various experts in groups to create a maximum level of interaction and balance between governmental and non-governmental actors. The main outcome of the workshop was the identification of promising ideas and possible Research & Technology needs in 4 main areas: additive manufacturing, advanced smart materials, functional materials and structural materials. Computer-assisted modelling, deployed 3D printing, multifunctional materials, integrated sensors, frequency-adaptive signature control materials, and biomimetics were among the topics viewed to be of especially high interest for military forces in the next decades. Although the participants recognized that predicting the future poses difficulties in the context of evolving political, technological, economic and legislative factors, they considered that defence technology in 2050 will be shaped by capitalizing on the windows of opportunity opened in the present. The seminar was co-organized by the EDA’s CapTech on Materials & Structures, Fraunhofer INT, ISDEFE, FOI, FFI.

EDA_NEWS_0378	2016-10-26	NEWS	“C-IED proficiency needs to be improved and shared”, says Jorge Domecq	 On 25 October, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq participated in the opening ceremony of the IAWS 2016 workshop organized by the Counter Improvised Explosive Devices Centre of Excellence (C-IED COE) at the Guardia Civil Officers Academy in Aranjuez/Madrid, Spain. At this occasion, he stressed the important work done so far by the EDA on C-IED and called for increased cooperation between institutions and stakeholders on this crucial issue. The European Defence Agency is involved in countering IED since the very beginning because C-IEDs has been one of the Capability Development Plan (CDP) priorities almost since the launch of the EDA CDP process itself, Mr Domecq recalled in his speech. In 2010, the Agency invested one million euros to establish a Counter IED exploitation deployable laboratory. That initiative grew into the Multinational Technical Exploitation Laboratory - or MNTEL - which was successfully deployed to Afghanistan from 2011 to July 2014. MNTEL subsequently led to the establishment of the Joint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory (JDEAL) – a capability which presents a real opportunity to tackle technical exploitation in general, and exploitation of Improvised Explosive Devices in particular. “The pressing operational need to Counter IEDs has been a major driver for these developments. EDA’s projects have aimed to generate exploitation capabilities that directly improve the understanding, identification and exposure of threat networks. And they were successful”, Mr Domecq stressed. In August 2016, a full exploitation deployable capability was deployed to the multinational exercise ‘Bison Counter 2016’.   Cooperation is key To be even more effective in the future, stakeholders have to cooperate and share their knowledge and expertise, Mr Domecq insisted. “We, at the EDA, demonstrated our openness to cooperation very clearly when we signed a successful and productive Cooperation Framework Agreement with the Centre of Excellence C-IED in Madrid. C-IED demands a strong Interagency approach, as do exploitation issues. This agreement has definitely paved the way for others to come. Just opening new lines of action and cooperating with stakeholders enables Institutions to work better and faster together, and of course to broaden the scope for further opportunities”. The EDA Chief Executive added: “We are strong proponents of developing exploitation capabilities and so is NATO. At the end of the day, Member States and Allies each have one set of forces to deploy and protect, be it for national or EU or NATO or UN engagements. Hence we will continue our close staff-to-staff discussion on what we are currently doing on exploitation and our future intentions. Sharing in certain domains - such as the recent NATO C-IED Task Force meeting - is of enormous benefit to our on-going activities, and also helps avoid duplication of effort”. “Exploitation disciplines should no longer be a national secret. Proficiency in this domain needs to be improved, shared and deployed by organizations and nations – to fail to do so leaves the door open for those who wish to do us harm. In this respect EDA is delivering capabilities and providing options to strengthen cooperation between MS as well as between all relevant stakeholders. Exchange of experts and training capabilities must underpin the fight against insurgent networks and hybrid hazards and this event provides the best avenue to do so”, he concluded.   Background The IAWS2016 is a 3-day event to discuss about the current situation and the future initiatives on the use of exploitation as an essential tool to counter threat networks that employ or facilitate IEDs. The general objective for the IAWS 2016 is to promote and enhance interagency cooperation among military, law enforcement and civil organizations and agencies, at both national and international levels, in order to better counter the threat networks that facilitate and employ IEDs. The IAWS 2016 addresses the current IED threat situation, with a special focus on sensitive areas for NATO and its partners. Exploitation will also be tackled, from a twofold point of view: currently existing exploitation capabilities in the military as well as in the law enforcement, and exploitation-related, capacity-building initiatives in partner countries and possible ways ahead and standards.

EDA_NEWS_0379	2016-10-28	NEWS	First EU Pilot Project in the field of defence research sees grant agreements signed for €1.4 million	" Grants agreements worth a total of €1.4 million were signed today 28 October at the European Defence Agency (EDA) for three selected research activities to be carried out under the EU’s first Pilot Project in the field of defence research. The grant agreements were signed at the European Defence Agency in presence of EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq, European Commission Deputy Director General Pierre Delsaux (DG Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs) and representatives of the three winner consortia.   Uncharted territory – An EU first The signing marks an important step in EU defence integration since it’s the first time that the European Union is testing the conditions for defence research in an EU framework, funded by the EU budget. The Pilot Project also paves the way for the launch, in 2017, of the European Commission’s Preparatory Action (PA) on defence research which, in turn, leads to a fully-fledged European Defence Research Programme (EDRP) as part of the EU’s next Multiannual Financial Framework (2021-2027). All of them - Pilot Project, Preparatory Action and the future European Defence Research Programme - should support R&T that is serving capability priorities identified by Member States in the Capability Development Plan and be taken up in future collaborative capability programmes. DG GROW Deputy Director General Pierre Delsaux said: ""EU funding for defence research was almost inconceivable a few years ago for EU institutions, Member States and the defence community. This Pilot Project is therefore the precursor of a new era."" Mr Delsaux thanked the European Parliament for its support on the Pilot Project and underlined that a lot of effort and intensive work done by both from the Commission and the EDA, to make the Pilot Project work. He also explained that there is still a long way ahead for EU funded defence research and that ""the Commission, in accordance with its institutional role and in full compliance with the EU legal context, is ready to work on defining the optimal framework and overseeing the implementation of the defence research priorities set by the Member States."" EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq said: “Today’s signing marks an important milestone and opens a new chapter in the way defence research is funded in Europe. The European Parliament, the European Commission and the EDA have worked together, hand in hand, to set up this Pilot Project which is an important test bed for more defence research funded from the EU budget in the future”. He particularly thanked German MEP Michael Gahler and other members of the European Parliament’s SEDE committee whose relentless efforts back in 2014 resulted in the EP earmarking funding for an EU Pilot Project in the field of defence research for the first time ever. “The EDA is now looking forward to advancing the activities and making the Pilot Project a success”. Mr Domecq stressed the “additional boost” EU funding possibilities, such as the Pilot Project and the upcoming Preparatory Action, will give to defence R&T by complementing national research programmes and existing cooperative funding schemes. “Using the EU budget for funding defence R&T will help to generate critical mass, to network European research entities and to increase interoperability and standards. The Pilot Project has already shown to what extent EU funding in conjunction with priorities set by Member States at intergovernmental level can be a powerful catalyst to attract Primes and SMEs, Research Centers and Academia, from big and small Member States. Research in defence also has concrete and profitable spill-over effects for everyday life”, he said. “R&T is not nice-to-have. It is an essential prerequisite to develop the required defence capabilities of the future and thus to provide for our citizen’s security”, the EDA Chief Executive concluded.   EDA call for proposal The three activities were selected following an EU-wide call for proposals organized by the EDA between 23 March and 23 June 2016. They cover the following topics:   Inside Building Awareness and Navigation for Urban Warfare (SPIDER) - Grant: €433.225  The objective of this activity is to provide a proof of concept for an innovative system to improve soldiers’ inside building awareness by introducing into buildings miniaturized sensors which can move and change position to provide better coverage and improved performance. The activity will analyse the possibilities that new technologies and pioneering concepts provide to this aim. The proposed system will be composed by two distinct sensor subsystems: a static outdoor subsystem (a network of radiofrequency sensors that can recognize humans inside the building) and a mobile indoor subsystem which will be based on mobile robots capable of sensing the interior of the building using video camera and range-finding sensors such as depth sensors. The robots will be controlled by operators through a secure communication system. A separate station will receive all information obtained by both outdoor and indoor sensors to reconstruct an indoor map of the building. By visualizing the indoor map, the soldiers will have a crucial awareness enabling them to safely navigate inside the building. The system will be designed to be highly robust to endure operation in hostile environments. This activity was won by a consortium led by TEKEVER, a Portuguese technology company, and composed of IT Aveiro - Instituto de Telecomunicações (Portugal), Aralia (UK) and the Bulgarian Defence Institute (BDI).   Standardisation of Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) Detect and Avoid (TRAWA) - Grant: €433.292  The aim of this activity is to contribute to the development of standards for a performant and affordable detect and avoid (DAA) system usable on-board Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS). In concrete terms, it will specify ‘well clear’ boundaries in exact terms so that specifications for DAA technical systems can be derived from them. It will also develop requirements for remote pilot HMI (Human Machine Interface) characteristics. In addition, a method will be provided through which it can be identified which RPAS types can be integrated into airspace together with other aircraft categories, and vice versa, given their DAA technology capabilities. The proposed solution will be complementary with on-going European activities of the European Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment (EUROCAE), Eurocontrol and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in this field. It will in particular follow the EUROCAE ED78a standardisation process. The activity is an enabler for the widespread use of RPAS in non-segregated airspace in Europe because it supports the development of standards for the certification of DAA solutions and helps to identify technology capabilities which need to be developed by the European defence industry. This activity was won by a consortium led by the Netherlands Aerospace Center (NLR) with the following partners: the German Aerospace Center (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt, DLR), Deep Blue (Italy), Tony Henley Consulting (UK) and EuroUSC (Italy).   Unmanned Heterogeneous Swarm of Sensor Platforms (EuroSWARM) - Grant: €434.000 This activity will demonstrate, through a live experimentation, that typical military missions and tasks can be performed in exemplary scenarios by an unmanned, autonomous and heterogeneous ‘swarm’ system of systems, using emerging enabling technologies. EuroSWARM’s main objectives are: - to develop key techniques for adaptive, informative and reconfigurable operations of unmanned heterogeneous swarm systems, namely: optimal task allocation and resource management; sensor fusion, cooperative guidance, robust sensor network; - to integrate the developed enabling techniques; - to validate the developed enabling techniques based on empirical simulation studies; - to demonstrate the proposed solutions based on a small scale of experiments.     The activity is expected to deliver a control & command architecture for autonomous and heterogeneous swarms of sensors. The architecture will host a wide variety of piloted and autonomous swarm elements, such as unmanned air/ground/naval platforms, steerable mast, unattended remote-controlled sensors, protective devices (laser, jammer, smoke generators etc.). Any kind of weaponry is excluded from the system. Using static/mobile sensors and vehicles in an unmanned swarm-based autonomous system such as EuroSWARM can become a pilot for large scale usage to deal with critical European and global challenges such as border control or surveillance-security. The activity was won by a consortium led by the University of Cranfield (UK) which also includes the French aerospace research agency ONERA (Office National d'Etudes et de Recherches Aérospatiales), the Swedish Defence Research Agency FOI and the University of Patras (Greece).       Pilot Project implementation The signing of the grant agreements fires the starting shot for the implementation phase of the three activities as off 1 November 2016. SPIDER and EuroSWARM will be delivered after 12 months (November 2017) while TRAWA will run for 18 months (May 2018). The Pilot Project is run and managed by the EDA on behalf of the European Commission based on a delegation agreement signed between the Agency and the Commission in November 2015. As a result, the EDA is responsible for the project’s implementation and management.   More information: Details on the three projects (Pilot Project call for proposals) Factsheet ‘Preparatory Action for CSDP-related research’  "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/10/28/first-eu-pilot-project-in-the-field-of-defence-research-sees-grant-agreements-signed-for-1.4-million

EDA_NEWS_0382	2016-10-13	NEWS	EDA SME Senior Advisors attend their first SME network meeting	" Francisco González Mené and Dušan Švarc, EDA's two recently appointed SME Senior Advisers, participated in their first Member States’ SME Point of Contacts (PoCs) meeting this Thursday 13 October at the Agency premises in Brussels. The meeting was mainly devoted to taking stock of the implementation of the 2016 priorities of the EDA SME Action Plan and the results of the EDA exploratory study on SMEs. Participants also discussed the progress report on the implementation of the ‘Guidelines for facilitating SME’s access to the defence market’ and EDA future work to support SMEs accessing COSME opportunities. Both advisors expressed satisfaction about the outcome of their first SME PoCs meeting. ""I was impressed by the hands on approach taken by EDA to provide concrete and practical support to defence-related SMEs so that they can access EU funding"", said Dušan Švarc. In his view, ""the key for EDA's future work in this domain will be to simplify ways, means and procedures for SMEs to benefit from EU funding and other forms of support"". Francisco González Mené said he appreciated the increasing role played by the EDA in supporting the development of defence-related SMEs. It was agreed that at the next SME PoCs network meeting scheduled for spring 2017, the two EDA SME Advisors would share with the group first ideas on how to support defence-related SMEs even better in the future.   Exploring new ideas and initiatives in support of SME The appointment of the two SME Senior Advisers was identified in the EDA SME Action Plan, approved by the March 2013 Steering Board, as one of many means to promote defence-related SMEs. Following a call for expression of interest and a selection process, Mr Francisco González Mené (Spanish) and Mr Dušan Švarc (Czech) were appointed in summer 2016.

EDA_NEWS_0383	2016-10-17	NEWS	Expert group looks into protection of critical energy infrastructures for defence	 On 17 October, the Protection of Critical Energy Infrastructures (PCEI) expert group, established in May of this year, met at the EDA under the chairmanship of the Hellenic Ministry of National Defence. The Ministries of Defence (MoDs) of Cyprus and Greece offered to take the lead on this project within the framework of the EDA. Colonel Georgios Drosos, Head of the Infrastructure & Environment Department of the Hellenic MoD, was appointed as the group chairman. He stressed that the group’s main objective was “to assess how EU legislation on the Protection of European Critical Energy Infrastructure can be applied by the defence sector in a holistic way”. Each and every part of defence critical infrastructure needs to be protected appropriately to ensure that the overall energy supply chain can function properly. As Colonel Drosos said, maintaining and improving regional energy security and sustainability within the EU will contribute to achieving this goal. The expert group’s chairman also stressed that possible shortfalls can be addressed by developing “projects of common interest for the defence sector”.   Collaboration between defence and research To promote joint efforts and scientific collaboration between the defence sector and the research community, Professor Athanasios Konstandopoulos, chairman of the board of the Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH) was appointed as the co-chairman of the group. Professor Konstandopoulos pointed out that “the task of securing Energy Strategic Autonomy in a highly connected world presents challenges and creates opportunities for strengthening collaboration between the research community and the defence sector”. He called on stakeholders “to face the challenges and exploit the opportunities.” To accomplish its goals, the PCEI expert group will use the expertise of EDA Member States’ Ministries of Defence, national academic and research centres as well as EDA’s partners: the European Commission DG ENERGY, Joint Research Centre, and the NATO Energy Security Centre of Excellence. Air Commodore Peter Round, EDA Capability Armaments and Technology (CAT) Director, stated that “EDA aims through the PCEI Experts Group to identify common capability and research shortfalls and to address them collectively to help to achieve resilience of Armed Forces in Europe.” Denis Roger, EDA European Synergies and Innovation (ESI) Director, emphasized that “in times of crises, it is imperative to ensure the continued availability of secure and sustainable energy supplies and we are glad that EDA can contribute to this vital work by exploring the defence element of critical energy infrastructure.” The PCEI expert group is supported within EDA at an inter-directorate level (CAT and ESI) by CAT Project Officer Protect, Constantinos Hadjisavvas, and ESI Project Officer Energy and Environment Systems, Richard Brewin.   Way Ahead The next PCEI experts group meetings will be hosted by Cyprus in January 2017 and by Greece in March 2017. The meetings will be open to all the participating Member States of the Agency, the Agency’s partners as well as other international organisations.   Background Securing Energy Strategic Autonomy for European Defence (SESAED) is becoming more vital than ever for national and international security and economic prosperity due to the increased number of terrorist attacks, and the emerging threats from hybrid and asymmetrical warfare as well as vulnerability to the impacts of climate change and natural hazards across Europe. Hence, Protection of Critical Energy Infrastructures was identified as one of the component areas to be examined as part of the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector (CF SEDSS) which was jointly launched by the European Defence Agency (EDA) and the European Commission in October 2015. In May 2016, the PCEI Experts Group was established to explore PCEI further from a defence point of view. The Cypriot and the Hellenic Ministries of Defence (MoDs) offered to take the lead on this project within the framework of EDA. In this effort academic and research support is provided by the KIOS Research Center, the Cyprus University of Technology, the European University Cyprus, the Centre for Research & Technology, Hellas CERTH and the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).   More information : Energy and Environment Programme (EDA project page) Second meeting of the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in Defence opens in Dublin (EDA webnews) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/10/17/expert-group-looks-into-protection-of-critical-energy-infrastructures-for-defence
EDA_NEWS_0384	2016-10-18	NEWS	Jorge Domecq at Euronaval: “More cooperation needed to develop the next generation naval platforms”	 EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq today (18 October) visited the Euronaval exhibition in Paris where he had a range of bilateral meetings with industry leaders. He also participated in a panel discussion organized by GICAN (Groupement des Industries de Construction et Activités Navales) on the “The future of naval warfare: high-end operations”. In his panel intervention, Mr Domecq called for more cooperation between Member States on European programs and the development of the next generation of platforms. “The current scattered approach is ultimately putting at risk the very survival of our naval industry (…) European navies operate 20 different types of frigate, four different types of aircraft carrier, and multiple types of support ships and MCM Vessels. This situation is no longer affordable”, he said. “There is no need to develop a ‘one size fits all’ solution. But we do need a full, frank, fair and mutual analysis of common gaps, common requirements and respective investments made at national and multinational level by Member States, including on high-end capabilities”, the EDA Chief said. He called on Member States that face similar regional or procurement challenges to agree on common platforms with an open architecture approach for subsystems. “And I would like to encourage industrial stakeholders not to be afraid about competition nor about possible European consolidation”, he stated.   EDA tools available Tools developed within EDA like the Collaborative Database are unique instruments to identify the business case for cooperative capability developments. 45 collaborative opportunities for naval platforms have already been identified such as ‘surface combatants’, ‘submarines’, ‘maritime patrol vessels’ or ‘auxiliary ships for logistics support’ but also specific naval assets such as ‘maritime patrol aircraft’ and ‘naval helicopters’ or capabilities like ‘naval radars’, ‘sonars’, ‘naval air and missile defence’ and ‘ship protection’. In particular, the capability of replenishment at sea and logistic support are essential. Many of the Member States share a common need for improved endurance at sea. “Applying a model like the European Air Transport Command (ETAC) can be of interest”, Mr Domecq said.   Increased R&T needed Mr Domecq also said that European naval forces have probably never been confronted with security challenges as big as today, ranging from territorial protection to dealing with refugee crises and combatting criminal trafficking networks in the Mediterranean and the Aegean Sea. He recalled that the recent EU Global Strategy explicitly highlights the importance of maritime security which will also be part of the upcoming revision of the Capability Development Plan (CDP) for which the EDA will seek a mandate by Defence Ministers in November. Regarding the CDP revision, Mr Domecq insisted on the need to ensure strong interaction between the naval industry and research and technologies (R&T) community. “These efforts have to lead to an increased R&T commitment, either on an intergovernmental level through the European Defence Agency or on the basis of the future Preparatory Action and the European Defence Research Programme (EDRP). It’s paramount that we push ahead with innovation on disruptive technologies”, the EDA Chief Executive said.   More information: EU naval industry in good shape but more R&T investment needed, study says (EDA webnews, October 2016) Unmanned Maritime Systems Conference (EDA webnews November 2015) Unmanned Maritime Systems (UMS) research (EDA project page) Key Industrial Capabilities - Naval Domain (EDA project page) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/10/18/jorge-domecq-at-euronaval-more-cooperation-needed-to-develop-the-next-generation-naval-platforms
EDA_NEWS_0385	2016-10-06	NEWS	EU naval industry in good shape but more R&T investment needed, study says	 Goods news from our shipyards: EU manufacturers of military vessels and submarines are doing well, especially on international markets where exports are booming. No reason though for the industry to rest on its laurels as it urgently needs to invest in research & technology (R&T) if it wants to stay at the top, as a recent study commissioned by the European Defence Agency (EDA) shows. This article appeared in the EDA's European Defence Matters magazine issue 11 Despite difficult conditions on a growingly turbulent global naval market – mainly caused by rising exports from Chinese, Russian and South Korean shipyards - Europe’s naval industry has managed to maintain its position as a highly competitive global player if not a world leader, notably thanks to its technological edge and strong exports, the EDA-commissioned “Study on Industrial and Technological Competences in the Naval Sector” concludes. The study, which was carried out by a consortium in 2015 and early 2016 (see box below), confirms that European naval industries are very strong in their respective domestic European markets - but also in international markets such as the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Latin America which all devote growing budgets to defence and often have no meaningful indigenous naval industry. Also due to decreasing defence budgets in Europe (at least over the past decade, whereas the trend has now started to reverse), export markets nowadays account for 42% of the European naval order book value.   Healthy successful industrial base, but... Another positive characteristic of the European naval industry, according to the study, is its ability to design, integrate and produce the whole range of naval ships and almost the totality of its core systems and components. “Considering the complexity and sophistication of the products designed and built by these companies, they can be regarded as ‘system integrators’, dismissing once forever the old image of shipbuilders as mere assemblers of steel blocks”, it says. The European naval industry’s supply chain is also considered both diverse and complete with no area in which a monopoly exists. Most importantly (with regard to Europe’s strategic autonomy in defence) there are European alternative suppliers and replacement options in place for all systems/components currently procured from outside Europe. Business diversification is another trump card played by the European naval industry. The majority of the naval players are also successful players in the high-end segments of merchant shipbuilding (e.g. cruise ships and mega-yachts) and in the related maritime activities (e.g. offshore and marine renewable energies). “This diversification strategy has created a favourable cross-fertilization between civil and military technologies (dual-use technologies), both at the Prime Contractors and at the Supply-Chain levels, leading to cost-effective designs and solutions”, the study says. The study’s overall conclusion could hardly be more encouraging: “The European Naval Industrial Base today is made up of healthy, capable, diversified and successful export-oriented companies”.   … more R&T investments needed However, all forecasts in the study are not entirely rosy. The study also warns that some threats stemming from non-European competitors are on the horizon such as fierce price competition from non-EU countries, especially China, South Korea and Russia. Countries which very actively support their naval industries “as an act both of foreign and industrial policy”. According to the study, the best way to counter this threat is by maintaining Europe’s technological lead at the Prime/System Integrators level as well as across the full supply chain “through increased, more supported, more coordinated and more focused investments in Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) at national and European level”. In order to increase intra-EU cooperation in the naval defence and security domain, a dedicated area for naval related research should be secured within the next multi-annual Framework for Research, Development and Innovation starting in 2021, the study recommends: “This is essential to the long-term sustainability of the European naval industry”. The European Commission’s upcoming Preparatory Action (PA) on defence-related research and the Defence Action Plan (scheduled for later this year) could also play a key role as political frameworks to increase the resources devoted to defence research activities, including in the naval domain, the study concludes. “Here, a distinct role of overall coordinator is foreseen and advocated for the EDA”, it says. The study also pleads for a regular exchange of ideas between the EDA and the major players in the naval shipbuilding sector in order to better coordinate and integrate the objectives of the future R&T programmes in this field. Finally, the study has also led to a list of technologies considered of “primary importance” both to maintain the European competitiveness and technological lead and to ensure the required level of operational superiority. In total 13 high priority topics and 4 new items were identified. The high priority list includes surface technologies topics (virtual ships, simulation, maintenance, oceanography, environmental protection, supply & support), subsea technologies (hydrodynamics and UxV integration, modularity, UxV integration, vulnerability reduction, propulsor) as well as services and transversal technologies (uninhabited systems, propulsor & propellers). The identified new R&T topics to be focussed on in the future are 3D printing, high capacity batteries, augmented reality and drones.   About the study: With the adoption of the EU Maritime Security Strategy in 2014 which also encompasses defence-related aspects through its CSDP dimension, the maritime domain has gained renewed focus at EU level. The ability for European nations to implement such a strategy will depend on both the availability of required capabilities for both civilian missions and military operations, and the existence of a competent and competitive naval industrial base. Therefore, in 2015, the EDA commissioned this study – which was conducted by a consortium of Sea Europe (lead partner), Damen, DCNS, Fincantieri, Navantia and TKMS - to acquire a comprehensive picture of the European Naval Technological and Industrial base and its technological priorities.   More information: Unmanned Maritime Systems (UMS) research (EDA project page) Maritime Mine Counter Measures - New Generation (EDA project page) Modular Lightweight Minesweeping (EDA project page) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/10/06/eu-naval-industry-in-good-shape-but-more-r-t-investment-needed-study-says
EDA_NEWS_0386	2016-10-05	NEWS	Annual Military Airworthiness Conference in Lisbon	" Hosted by the National Aviation Authority of Portugal (Autoridade Aeronáutica Nacional, AAN), the Annual Military Airworthiness Conference kicked off in Lisbon this Wednesday with keynote speeches delivered by EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq and General Manuel Teixeira Rolo of AAN. The two-day event (5/6 October) brings together key stakeholders from national authorities, industry, European agencies, NATO and international organisations for presentations and discussions on a variety of topics related to harmonization of military airworthiness requirements , implementation experiences and integration into a global context. In his speech, Mr Domecq stressed that standardisation, including in the area of airworthiness requirements, was a ""key enabler"" for the implementation of the EU Global Strategy. ""The application of common standards and recommended best practice is a key enabler for defence cooperation and helps strengthen the European Defence Technological and Industrial base. Most importantly, from a defence perspective, such standardisation would support effective cooperation and improve interoperability"", he said.  He also recalled that since the establishment of the Military Airworthiness Authorities (MAWA) Forum, a lot of work has been done particularly in the area of European Military Airworthiness Requirements, the EMARs. “With the EMARs that are now developed, nations have created a baseline for a common approach to processes like certification, organisational approvals and the preservation of airworthiness”. However, “a real common approach can only be established if EMARs are also implemented in a uniform way, which is a national responsibility of the Member States”, he stressed. Based on an earlier EDA funded study by Eurocopter, it is estimated that the adoption by Member States of optimised and harmonised military airworthiness regulations through the European Military Airworthiness Requirements would deliver a reduction of up to 50% of the development time and at least 10% of development costs up to initial-type certification. Significant further cost savings could also be achieved during the in-service phase.   Positive trend Currently, the status of implementation of the EMARs varies from nation to nation, and at this stage the application is still mostly limited to some multinational aircraft programmes like A400M. “That said, there are signs that things are moving in the right direction. For example, NAHEMA has decided to use EMARs for the certification framework of its NH90 programme. And the participating nations in the MRTT programme will make use of the EMARs to benefit from a common approach”, Mr Domecq said. In the next years, the focus should be on the standardisation of how the Member States ensure and preserve their military airworthiness, Mr Domecq said. The ultimate outcome Member States should aim for, he said, should include: 1. a single certification approach for multinational programmes, which would result in less development costs and optimised use of certification resources; 2. the development and application of common agreed industrial standards which would strengthen the position of the European defence industry in the global market; 3. optimised pooling and sharing of spare parts and maintenance resources within a single regulatory and oversight system (of key interest in relation to civil-derivative aircraft, but also with regard to military platforms such as A400M, Eurofighter, NH90 and others); 4. optimised use of oversight resources by collaboration in oversight obligations; 5. minimised gaps or differences between national regulatory and oversight systems, which would in turn minimise safety risks in multinational materiel cooperation programmes.   More information: EDA project page on European Military Airworthiness Authorities Forum (MAWA) MAWA Annual Conference 2015  "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/10/05/annual-military-airworthiness-conference-in-lisbon
EDA_NEWS_0387	2016-10-03	NEWS	EDA chief and Romanian Minister discuss defence cooperation	 EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq held talks today (3 October) in Bucharest with Romanian Minister of Defence Mihnea Ioan Motoc. Romania’s participation in EDA projects, the Security & Defence Implementation Plan of the EU Global Strategy and the European Commission’s upcoming European Defence Action Plan were among the main topics on the agenda. During the meeting, Mr Domecq welcomed Romania’s involvement in EDA projects and activities, for example: EU Satcom Market, the Joint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory (JDEAL) project and the European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) programme. Romania was also the first contributing Member States to join the EDA’s ‘Sharing of Spare Parts’ project which allows it today to share military spare parts with eight other Member States who have also joined. The EDA is currently also providing technical assistance to three Romanian dual-use research project proposals as candidates for co-funding by the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). The upcoming Preparatory Action for CSDP-related research, to be launched in 2017, as well as the planned future European Defence Research Programme will open many interesting R&T opportunities, also for Romania, it was stressed at the meeting. Mr Domecq commended Minister Motoc for Romania’s overall support to EDA and encouraged further engagement in the Agency’s work in the future. “In the light of Romania's 10 year development plan in which it committed to devote 2% of GDP for defence expenditure, EDA is ready to provide all the necessary support as effectively and efficiently as possible, making use of opportunities for cooperation and the EU tools available in support of defence”, Mr Domecq stated. Tailored approach for CEE countries Mr Domecq recalled that EDA takes into account the ‘diversity’ of the European Defence Industrial and Technological Base and that it supports the Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries in the same way as it does the V4 or LoI countries. Based on a specific CEE study which was commissioned by the EDA in 2015, the Agency is currently exploring a number of recommendations for providing more tailored expertise and support to CEE MoDs and industry, especially on defence industry policy and collaborative programmes. As part of this effort, one idea is to try to identify a pilot collaborative programme which could be undertaken by interested CEE countries, enhancing interoperability among them. CEE countries are currently being consulted on these ideas. Mr Domecq encouraged Romania to participate and to take the lead in some areas.

EDA_NEWS_0388	2016-10-05	NEWS	EDA’s Personnel Recovery Demonstrator used in Polish courses	 EDA’s Personnel Recovery Functional Area Service Advanced Technology Demonstrator (PR FAS ATD), a sophisticated information management and Command & Control (C2) tool recently developed within the European Defence Agency to increase the efficiency of personnel recovery actions during military operations and missions, has now started being used by Member States in national PR courses. Poland broke the first ground with two national Personnel Recovery (PR) courses, one in May and the most recent one from 12-23 September at the National Defence University in Rembertów in which the PR FAS ATD was successfully deployed and used. Organised on a regular basis by the Personnel Recovery Branch of the Polish Armed Forces Operational Command (AFOC), these courses aim at familiarising Polish military staff with PR. More than 60 students were trained on how to collect information and plan the recovery of isolated personnel in challenging and realistic scenarios. EDA facilitated the on-site training of users and provided information and technical support. The demonstrator almost completely replaced the usual ‘table-top’ exercise.   Easy to handle After the courses, students agreed that the demonstrator was easy to use and intuitive. They especially praised its accuracy and considered it an important step in the delivery of PR education and training. “I believe that PR FAS ATD is a very handy tool for exercise purposes and I liked using it” said Major Robert Kietliński, one of the trainees. “Although it is just a technical demonstrator, I can see its potential benefits for real-life missions”. Lt. Col. Zbigniew Zblewski, the chief of the Polish Armed Forces Operational Command Personnel Recovery Branch, welcomed the new possibilities offered by the demonstrator as a “significant leap forward” in PR training. According to him, “it is time to use the demonstrator on a much wider scale and to introduce it to more students”. “Every piece of available information that matters for PR is centralized in a single tool, everything is stored within the system which is very convenient for students and future controllers alike”, he commented. The National Defense University in Rembertów was also engaged in the project; its representatives noted that “PR FAS ATD is an important step towards modernizing Personnel Recovery and unifying this field of knowledge within the Polish Armed Forces”. Moreover, an evaluation of the course results showed that students with varying degrees of knowledge of PR consistently found the system to be user friendly and comprehensive; they also concluded that it had improved their knowledge of PR significantly.   Demonstrator ready for other deployments PR FAS ATD is the latest operational output developed in the context of the EDA’s Project Team Personnel Recovery. The tool supports planners and controllers with a number of functionalities and improved situational awareness. While it is usually possible to use the demonstrator through a standard PR FAS physical workstation, an internet-based (on-line) solution was chosen for the Polish course with the connection of six different computers each running an independent system. EDA has distributed the tool to all its participating Member States (pMS), the European Union Military Staff (EUMS) and the European Personnel Recovery Centre (EPRC). The Capability, Armament & Technology Director, Air Commodore Peter Round, underscored that” the EDA is always ready to provide deployment support and training”. The Agency is also working to address the various aspects of the through-life management of the tool to ensure its operational functionality in the long-term. “An important objective of the EDA is to support member states in the development of the capabilities required to effectively recover isolated personnel and save lives”, Pete Round stated.   More information: Polish MoD link to PR course EDA Personnel Recovery project page Hungary hosted EDA Personnel Recovery course (June 2016)   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/10/05/fit-for-purpose-eda-s-personnel-recovery-demonstrator-used-in-polish-courses

EDA_NEWS_0390	2016-09-29	NEWS	3 out of 3: another EDA supported dual-use R&T project is awarded ESIF funding	 A dual-use R&T project aimed at developing advanced lightweight impact resistant materials, proposed by a Portuguese consortium and supported by the European Defence Agency (EDA), has been awarded a € 830 000 funding under the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). It is the first of 30 EDA supported projects to have fully completed the new ‘Request for Projects (RfP)’ procedure that EDA introduced in 2015 in order to maximise project chance to access ESIF. Under the previous procedure, two EDA supported research projects, one Portuguese and one Polish, were assessed by the competent ESIF Managing Authorities and both were successful already. This means that all three EDA supported dual-use R&T projects which have gone so far through the entire ESIF assessment process have been awarded funding – an exceptional 100% success rate! The latest successful Portuguese project called “Advanced Lightweight Impact Resistant Materials, Components and Structures” (ALIR-MCS) aims at developing, within a 3-year timeframe, a new kind of composite material with high-impact resistance, for the production of components and structures. The objective is to make sure the new material can have both civilian applications (especially in the aeronautical sector) and defence applications, mainly in bulletproof equipment. Of the total required investment (€ 1.21 million), ESIF will fund € 0.83 million (69%). Project leader is X AERO SYSTEMS, S.A., a Portuguese SME based in Vila Nova de Gaia, a municipality near Porto. The consortium is composed by a wide variety of stakeholders: INEGI- Institute of Science and Innovation in Mechanical and Industrial Engineering (a Research Centre), Critical Materials (another SME), the University of Aveiro as well as the Portuguese Ministry of Defence (Estado Maior Do Exército). Under EDA supported R&T projects, this is the first time that an MoD is directly funded by ESIF. Since 2013, EDA has been providing technical assistance in order to improve the ESIF eligibility of dual-use R&T projects. The Portuguese ALIR-MCS project, which has now been granted funding, was first selected by EDA within the EDA’s ‘ESIF RfP’ process; it then received technical assistance to enhance and finalize its ESIF application, which proved to be successful. EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq welcomed the third successful ESIF application in a row for EDA supported dual-use R&T projects. “It proves that with the right support and expertise of EDA, dual-use research projects, even proposed by small consortia led by SMEs, can access EU funding. It’s a great success that confirms there are funding opportunities for defence-related stakeholders available within the EU’s multiannual financial framework running till 2020, especially for SMEs with dual-use R&T projects”, Mr Domecq stated.   More information: EU funding opportunies (EDA project page) Dual-use research (EDA project page) Polish dual-use R&T project co-funded by ESIF (EDA news) New funding opportunity for dual-use research  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/09/29/3-out-of-3-another-eda-supported-dual-use-r-t-project-is-awarded-esif-funding
EDA_NEWS_0391	2016-09-28	NEWS	European MALE RPAS Definition Study contract awarded	 In August 2016, the contract for a Definition Study of the European MALE RPAS (Medium Altitude Long Endurance Remotely Piloted Aircraft System) Programme was awarded by OCCAR to Airbus Defence and Space GmbH, Dassault Aviation and Leonardo S.p.a.. The contract kick-off meeting chaired by OCCAR and involving the three companies as well as the programme Participating States was held on 6 September 2016 at Airbus premises in Manching/Germany. The Definition Study Contract award marks the initial phase to deliver this important European capability. The MALE RPAS Programme will further develop and strengthen the European industrial expertise and skills in this essential technological area. OCCAR awarded the contract in the name of the four programme Participating States France, Germany, Italy and Spain. The three companies Airbus Defence and Space GmbH, Dassault Aviation and Leonardo S.p.a. are working together as co-contractors to perform the Definition Study. OCCAR and the European Defence Agency (EDA) will cooperate in respect of air traffic insertion of MALE RPAS and the potential participation of other states in future phases of the programme. “The EDA congratulates OCCAR, the four contributing Member States and the companies involved on this important step towards the development and delivery of a European MALE RPAS capability. This is a decisive step in the direction set by Heads of States and Government at the European Council in December 2013 to prepare the next generation of MALE RPAS in Europe. It is also a concrete example of the need to ensure the necessary European strategic autonomy as foreseen in the EU Global Strategy. The Agency will continue to support the programme building on the work already achieved”, said Jorge Domecq, EDA Chief Executive. MALE RPAS will be a remotely piloted air system for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) missions. The first step of the programme is a two-year definition study to define the baseline specifications/design for the future MALE RPAS. The definition study includes both a System Requirement Review (SRR) and a Preliminary Design Review (PDR). Air traffic integration and certification of the MALE RPAS is a key objective of the programme. Preparation for the potential next steps (development and production) will be part of the activities to be performed during the second year of the definition study. The entry into service of MALE RPAS is aimed at the 2025 timeframe. Prior to the contract award, the MALE RPAS Programme was formally integrated into OCCAR with the signature of the respective Programme Decision by the members of the OCCAR MALE RPAS Programme Board. The OCCAR MALE RPAS Programme Division will be located in Munich/Hallbergmoos.   More information: EDA project page on RPAS OCCAR website 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/09/28/european-male-rpas-definition-study-contract-awarded

EDA_NEWS_0394	2016-09-21	NEWS	"“European consolidation is an efficient way to achieve competitiveness and interoperability"""	 In December 2015, Nexter and Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) announced the completion of their association and the creation of a new joint holding company - KNDS - which, many say, could trigger a wider consolidation in the sector of land defence systems in Europe. To find out more about the strategy behind the transaction and its wider impact on the defence industry landscape, we spoke to Stéphane Mayer, CEO of Nexter and co-CEO of the newly created KNDS. This interview appeared in the EDA's European Defence Matters magazine issue 11 Q.: Which were the main drivers behind the Nexter-KMW merger and the creation of KNDS (KMW + Nexter Defense Systems): synergy and cost-saving considerations or more long-term, strategic ambitions? Stéphane Mayer: The strategic aim of the joint venture between Nexter and KMW is to create a European leader in land defence offering joint products that meet the operational needs of the French and German armies, and obviously those of other European and international forces. This will result in genuine convergence for users that often operate together in the same theatres. The success of our alliance will be boosted by two kinds of convergence between our Governments, which must not only define common requirements, but also adopt the same approach to export controls. Over the last few months, we have been developing synergies by gradually combining our efforts in several areas: sales, communication, purchasing, finance, products, engineering and production. We are aiming to both boost revenue and limit costs. The process does not involve any restructuring, because both Nexter and KMW are profitable companies with order books representing more than three years of business. Would you say that KNDS is the starting shot for a major consolidation process in the European land defence systems market to ensure Europeans remain competitive?   When we announced our joint venture, we were the first, and the move came as a surprise to some. In Europe, our Governments need efficient and competitive products and are aiming for more inter-operability. On the worldwide market, the competition is extremely strong. A European consolidation process is an efficient way to achieve those objectives. Besides France and Germany, we are aiming to progressively expand our industrial footprint in other European countries to continue this strategic move. Some say KNDS could become the “Airbus of the land systems sector”. Is this your ambition and are you already looking for additional European partners to join the group? The joint venture between Nexter and KMW is the first step towards a strong, durable and independent European industry. Since we started the project, we have consistently stated our desire to drive European consolidation, partly through new industrial alliances. Today, we are laying the foundations of a new group, based on the excellent fit between Nexter and KMW's businesses and the expertise of two companies leading their national markets. In the future, we want to strengthen the group further by welcoming new partners that are an equally good fit and equally effective. I am very confident about this new phase of consolidation, although at the moment the priority remains setting up KNDS with Nexter and KMW. I would also like to take this opportunity to talk about European consolidation in another area, that of ammunitions. In 2014, Nexter acquired Mecar in Belgium and Simmel Difesa in Italy who joined our Nexter Munitions division, which is now Europe's third-largest munitions player. Combining these three companies has allowed us to generate multiple synergies in ammunitions, but more importantly to maintain a high level of quality in terms of precision, effectiveness and security. As a result, the KNDS group can rely on a solid munitions business. R&T is a domain where huge synergy effects can be expected from this merger. What do you hope to achieve in R&T together what was not possible alone and how do you see the future of R&T at EU level? KNDS will indeed lead to R&T synergies. Financing innovation is crucial for the success of our plans, since innovation will allow us to maintain a technological edge over our rivals by developing distinctive systems. Naturally, we will work to eliminate potential duplication of R&T within the new group. Moreover, we welcome the willingness of the Governments to support advanced technologies and R&T studies for the current and future systems. The single most important subject for us in terms of R&T and innovation is linked to the Franco-German initiative to jointly develop the technologies for the MGCS (Main Ground Combat System) and CIFS (Common Indirect Fire System). It seems that in a first phase, both companies involved in KNDS will keep their organisation, staff and even their own range of products. When do you foresee the first jointly developed and produced KNDS weapon systems - for instance a combat tank - to be on the market? For many years, we will have to keep large parts of our present organisations unchanged in order to deliver on our commitments to our customers and our existing partnerships and to remain able to support our products in service. However, we are already starting to identify synergies, to act jointly on several matters (sales, product policy, finance, purchasing, communication, etc.). We have also started to work together on future systems, including combat tanks and artillery systems. These programs will be managed, developed and produced by a shared organisation. Their calendars are mainly driven by the operational needs of our customers and the timeframe to achieve a common vision between the German, French and other European customers. In the Defence industry, this takes 5 to 10 years! 2016 has seen a lot of movement in CSDP (EUGS set to be followed by a sectoral defence strategy; launch of Pilot Project and preparation of the Preparatory Action on defence-related research) and more is expected in the coming months (European Defence Action Plan by the EC). How optimistic are you that all this will give a boost to the European defence industry in general, and to the land systems sector in particular? We can be optimistic, while remaining realistic. The land defence market is doing well internationally, and there are still many opportunities, particularly in Asia and the Middle East. However, it is an extremely competitive sector and every tender process requires increasingly large investments from the companies involved. In Europe in the last few years, Nexter and KMW have taken part in tender processes with products such as our 8x8 combat vehicles (VBCI and Boxer) and 155mm artillery systems (Caesar and PZH2000). We were not successful. Unfortunately in some cases buyers decided to purchase non-European equipment or untested equipment. Of course competitiveness is essential in order to meet the European market's needs. But there are also needs for greater European awareness regarding defence, and particularly land defence. Armies on the ground need to be much more integrated through common equipment, we need to maintain an independent EDTIB that maintains Europe's superiority in certain areas of excellence (protection, firepower, communication systems, etc.) and we need to maintain and develop a European industry that guarantees the sovereignty of EU states. On the other hand, there is also the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote and the prospect of the UK leaving the EU. How will all this impact European defence cooperation? The European defence project is vital and the many dramatic events we have seen in recent years are a reminder that we must not let down our guard on security and defence issues. We are therefore confident that the United Kingdom will remain a staunch ally and continue to develop a strong defence relationship with France. Nexter has a joint venture with BAE, CTA International, based in France. CTA International specialises in telescoped 40mm-calibre armament systems, and has developed a revolutionary new cannon. This 40mm cannon has been acquired by both the French and British armies as part of the Scorpion and Scout programmes, proving both the effectiveness of the weapons themselves and the wisdom of our Franco-British joint venture. Brexit is unlikely to have an impact on our projects.   Biography Stéphane Mayer joined the Airbus group (formerly EADS) in 2003 as Chairman and CEO of EADS Socata, an aviation component and aircraft manufacturer.

EDA_NEWS_0395	2016-09-23	NEWS	EDA Chief Executive calls for action to boost defence industry and R&T	 Recent developments in the EU have created a “window of opportunity” which should be seized to relaunch the European defence policy and strengthen the European defence industry by taking decisive action, the Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency (EDA), Jorge Domecq, has said. Speaking at an industrial event in Brussels Thursday night (22 September), Mr Domecq stressed that “never before over the last 10 years have we had such opportunity to relaunch the European defence project and provide it with renewed impetus and commitment”. The EU Global Strategy (EUGS), the various initiatives taken by different Member States, the Commission President’s State of the Union address have all added to this “general sense of step change”, he said. “I sincerely believe that what we now need is action, not words: seizing a window of opportunity not window dressing or declarations of intent”. The EUGS, Mr Domecq said, has to be backed up by a “concrete and ambitious Implementation Plan” which will have to tackle many issues at the same time: Permanent Structured Cooperation, Defence Semester, a more output oriented Capability Development Plan, the identification of key strategic activities, the advancement on critical enablers such as standardization, certification and airworthiness.   Strengthen the EDTIB  The EDA Chief Executive, who was delivering the key note speech at a diner-debate organized by the Saab Group, particularly insisted on the need to strengthen the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) to ensure its remains competitive, efficient and capable of providing Europe’s Armed Forces with the capabilities they will need in the future. Investing more in Research and Technologies (R&T) will be absolutely key, especially given that today’s defence R&T expenditure is down to its lowest level since 2006. “The massive decline in budgetary terms of our defence R&T efforts is a matter of the highest concern. It is the capabilities of the future which are at stake here. It is also the competitiveness of our defence industry which is at risk”, he said. “Without a strong and competitive EDTIB we will not only loose our freedom of action, an appropriate level of strategic autonomy, our ability to design and develop, operate and maintain state-of-the-art defence equipment, but our defence culture altogether”, Mr Domecq warned.   Better exploiting EU funding  Mr Domecq also called for an optimal use all available means to incentivize cooperation among Member States and improve the quality of spending. “The EDA can play a key role here, including by closely cooperating with the European Commission to better exploit the relevant EU funding, policy and programmatic instruments that the European Defence Action Plan is going to highlight by the end of the year”, he said.   More information Mr Domecq's full speech	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/09/23/eda-chief-executive-calls-for-action-to-boost-defence-industry-and-r-t
EDA_NEWS_0396	2016-09-20	NEWS	Battlefield Vehicle Forensics Course kicks off in Sweden	 The first Train the Trainers Battlefield Vehicles Forensics course (BVF) is currently being held at the facilities of Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) in Karlsborg (Sweden). The course, which will end on 23 September, takes place under the umbrella of the European Defence Agency’s (EDA) C-IED Training and Education initiative. Fifteen students from Member States participate in this course that focuses on enriching skills of operators responsible for the examination of a vehicle having been damaged/destroyed due to an IED attack.   The BVF concentrates on collecting and processing all identifying marks (i.e. data plates), as well as evidence photographing and documentation recording: Vehicles are thoroughly searched for weapon signatures, weapon fragments, spall or behind armor debris. Additionally, damages are documented, and collected fragments are measured and photographed in accordance with accepted forensic collection standards.  BVF is strictly a forensic collection activity to support technical analysis. A large number of post blast exploitation practices are planned for duration of the course.  Copyright picture: Swedish Armed Forces   More information: C-IED project page JDEAL project page 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/09/20/battlefield-vehicle-forensics-course-kicks-off-in-sweden
EDA_NEWS_0397	2016-09-06	NEWS	EDA project launched to assess biological effects of military RF signals	 Recommendations and guidelines regarding the exposition to pulsed electromagnetic signals are very different depending on the organization which publish it (like it is the case for IEEE or ICNIRP). These discrepancies create some difficulties regarding which guideline to follow. To have a better understanding on the effects produced by these electromagnetic fields, the European Defence Agency (EDA) has initiated the RFBIO project which was officially launched at a kick-off meeting on 1 September at the EDA premises. At this stage, there are two EDA Member States contributing to this Category B project: Sweden, as the lead nation, and Germany. Additional Member States are expected to join later. The RFBIO study is being carried out by the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and the Bundeswehr Institute of Radiobiology in Munich. Over the next five years, these institutions will analyze the biological effects of Electromagnetic Fields with specific characteristics which have not been completely characterized for the time being. The duty of care for military personnel is the main driver behind this research project the results of which will benefit the armed forces of all EU Member States.   More information: Bundeswehr Institute of Radiobiology Karolinska Institute in Stockholm 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/09/06/eda-project-launched-to-assess-biological-effects-of-military-rf-signals
EDA_NEWS_0398	2016-08-31	NEWS	Bison Counter 2016 successfully closed	 More than 1,000 personnel from 21 countries and organisations as well as non-European observers participated in the multinational Counter Improvised Explosive Devices (C-IED) exercise Bison Counter 2016 (BC16). The exercise was hosted by the Swedish Armed Forces and the Swedish Göta Engineers Regiment from 15 to 27 August 2016. It was the first time the EDA’s Joint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory (JDEAL) was successfully integrated into a multinational exercise. A Visitors Day with the participation of high-level guests from participating countries and organisations was organised on 26 August.  The main aim of the exercise was to evaluate the full C-IED concept from the first responders’ perspective until delivery of C-IED related intelligence production, so as to tackle all C-IED work strands. A large number of different C-IED enablers ranging from Military Search, Military Working Dogs, Explosives Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and Improvised Explosive Devices Disposal (IEDD), EOD divers, Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear and explosives (CBRNe) experts, Military Engineers and Weapon Intelligence Teams (WIT) from land, maritime and air domains took part in the exercise.  One of the key elements of the exercise was to practice the hand over process of responsibilities and duties in C-IED operations such as route clearance to EOD operators to WIT teams and the transfer of collected samples to the JDEAL. The exercise scenario foresaw training such processes in high threat environments and between multinational units.  The inclusion of the Joint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory (JDEAL) marks the first time the laboratory deployed in its full operational mode. It was successfully integrated in the exercise chain of command. The laboratory was manned by around 30 JDEAL permanent staff, non-permanent staff, observers and trainees leading to the processing and exploitation of more than 50 cases which ranged from car bomb exploitation to cell phones and electronic media data recovery.  The results of the exercise will now be thoroughly analysed however initial feedback from participants was very positive, highlighting especially the benefits obtained on a tactical and operational level.  The first Bison Counter exercise took place in The Netherlands in 2013. Building on this experience, the EDA’s C-IED Project Team decided to institutionalise Bison Counter as a bi-annual C-IED dedicated activity under the umbrella of the EDA. The next exercise is scheduled for 2018.  Copyright picture: Jimmy Croona/Swedish Armed Forces More information: Bison Counter 2016 information on the website of the Swedish Armed Forces C-IED project page JDEAL project page 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/08/31/bison-counter-2016-successfully-closed
EDA_NEWS_0399	2016-09-16	NEWS	Latest issue of EDA magazine on EU Global Strategy and Defence	 The latest European Defence Matters magazine is now available with a special focus on the new EU Global Strategy and “What’s next for Defence?” When the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission, Federica Mogherini, presented last June the EU’s new ‘Global Strategy for Foreign and Security Policy’ (EUGS), our choice for the cover story of this 11th issue of European Defence Matters became a no-brainer. Indeed, as Prof. Dr. Sven Biscop, Director at the Egmont Royal Institute for International Relations in Brussels and one of our guest writers in this magazine, accurately points out, “The EUGS is one of the most ambitious EU documents on defence to date”. Among the most ambitious EUGS statements, ideas and proposals, many are related to defence and military capabilities. In this issue, we therefore propose an analysis of the defence aspects of the EUGS while also looking at the follow up, especially in view of the strategy’s concrete implementation. We also spoke to Nexter CEO Stéphane Mayer about the recent merger with Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) and the creation of KNDS which, many say, could be the beginning of a consolidation process in the land defence systems sector in Europe.   EU-NATO cooperation is another topic after the two organisations signed a Joint Declaration last July. We also spoke to NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg about this, the recent Warsaw NATO Summit and the EU Global Strategy. We also looked at the growing importance of energy management in the defence as the impact of energy consumption on defence budgets and military effectiveness is growing drastically. In our ‘Opinion’ section, Jyrki Katainen, European Commission Vice-President, shared his analysis about the importance of the ‘circular economy’ concept for the defence sector and how it can help to improve the European defence industry’s competitiveness.  We also have an exclusive interview with the chair of the EU military Committee (EUMC), General Mikhail Kostarakos.

EDA_NEWS_0400	2016-08-31	NEWS	INEA CALL 2015 results in € 53.5 million for military SESAR projects	 Following approval by the EU Member States in July, 14 military projects on SESAR deployment will receive a total of € 53.5 million in EU funding under the 2015’s call for proposals of the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) published by the Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA-call). This represents around 10% of total funds awarded to the related SESAR clusters. In its role of military coordinator for SESAR deployment, the European Defence Agency (EDA) had supported Member States to identify and prepare bids for this call. In preparation of the INEA-call, around 100 projects were identified in close cooperation with Member States, NATO and Eurocontrol. Early 2016 over 20 key military projects were submitted to INEA through the EDA ranging from ground systems, to air platforms and also specific studies. This is the first time, the military benefits of financial instruments previously not at reach. The next stage for the funded stakeholders, including the military, will be the formalisation of this award decision, turning it into the Specific Grant Agreements required under the SESAR Framework Partnership Agreement in order to have the projects coordinated by the SESAR Deployment Manager (SDM) and to receive the awarded funding through SDM. Building on the lessons learned from the 2015 call and the priorities identified in the Deployment Programme 2016, EDA is already working with Member States and other stakeholders, to encourage and facilitate increased participation in the 2016 CEF Transport INEA Call on the basis of high quality military projects. Early identification of relevant candidate projects is essential in this perspective.   More information:  Single European Sky project page 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/08/31/inea-call-2015-results-in-53.5-million-for-military-sesar-projects
EDA_NEWS_0401	2016-08-30	NEWS	Defence Policy Database now with 130 official documents	 The EDA’s Defence Policy Database which has been launched earlier this year was recently updated. The database currently contains 130 official documents from International Organisations and Member States providing a comprehensive overview of governmental documents on a wide spectrum of issues related to security and defence. The database was created to share information on Member States’ defence policies. It mainly contains national defence and security strategies, strategic defence reviews, white papers, strategic concepts, R&T and industrial policies, military planning guidelines as well as defence procurement regulations. The latest update also encompasses the EU Global Strategy which was issued in June this year.  The database features a repository of all documents and the analytical functionalities of the software allow users to search for specific information. For instance, content can be filtered along several indicators including strategic objectives and long term vision, threat perception, geographical areas of interest, and level of ambition. The next major update is envisaged for October 2016.

EDA_NEWS_0402	2016-07-29	NEWS	EDA prepares inter-laboratory test round to counter electromagnetic effects on operations	 Common Security and Defence (CSDP) missions and operations are teamwork by nature, involving troops from different contributing Member States, all of them bringing with them and using their own specific equipment and outfit. Although the bulk of the materiel used in such multinational operations is traditionally of military nature and therefore well-known to all of the participating troops, serious issues can arise from civilian, commercially available off-the-shelve electronic products and utensils which are increasingly used by the Armed Forces to complement their purely military toolbox.   Such a patchwork of military, dual-use and civilian equipment used by troops from different Member States in a joint operation can entail considerable risks – from hampering the mission’s effectiveness to putting at risk soldiers’ lives. Against this background, one crucial question arises: How to make sure that different troops coming from different Armed Forces using different types of technical equipment can nevertheless work together efficiently and safely? Ensuring proper testing and evaluation of critical equipment - be it military or civilian - is part of the answer.   Electromagnetic Effects (EME) That’s why the European Defence Agency (EDA) has taken the initiative to promote more systematic technical testing of CSDP equipment by Member States’ Test Centres and to set up an EU-wide Test and Evaluation Network, the Defence Test and Evaluation Base (DTEB). One of the areas where Testing & Evaluation (T&E) is particularly crucial is that of Electromagnetic Effects (EME). Indeed, it is not unusual that commercially acquired electronic devices used by Armed Forces generate adverse interferences with its own military equipment or with that used by partner troops in joint missions. Measures against such harmful and potentially dangerous electromagnetic effects can be seen in our daily experiences. For example, civil cell phones interfere with avionic devices; this is why sending functions of cell phones have to be switched off during flights. The damaging effects of electromagnetic interference pose unacceptable risks especially in military technologies; it is therefore necessary to control such interference and reduce the risks to acceptable levels by testing, evaluating and characterizing the threats. It is also important to set appropriate and updated design standards for emission and susceptibility levels and to test the compliance with those standards.   EME Networking in Europe In order to mitigate the risks of fatal interference, several European nations have developed a network of military test centres, specialised in Electromagnetic Effects, which joined the EDA’s Defence Test and Evaluation Base (DTEB) to examine, amongst others, the hazardous impact of civil equipment on military operations and vice versa. This EU Network of military EME Test Centres (ENTER) conducts joint tests, exchanges results and works on harmonized standards towards enhanced interoperability of multinational forces. Second round of tests to be launched in September After having carried out a first, more general inter-laboratory comparison test (so-called ‘Round Robin Testing’), the ENTER group has now decided to launch a follow-up test in autumn 2016 which will entirely focus on current and future Electromagnetic Effects (EME) concerns. The preparatory meeting for this test round will take place end of September at the EDA in Brussels. National test centres from six EDA member States (Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Spain – the lead nation) will participate in this joint test event. The objective is to evaluate a series of test methods and procedures in order to verify their accuracy and comparability. This is of great importance to national test centres because if it can be concluded that different methods and procedures applied by Member States’ testers are of identical quality and that they lead to the same results, then it will possible for national test centres to mutually recognize their test results - which means substantial savings of time and resources. At this stage, ENTER is made up of the national test centres of the six afore-mentioned EDA members but the objective is to continuously expand the group. “Important to share experiences and qualification methods” Major Dr Ir Thierry Gilles, is an expert on electromagnetic effects working in the Belgium Laboratory of Electro-Magnetic Applications (LEMA) which is located in the Brussels-based Royal Military Academy. LEMA is a member of ENTER. “Even with a rather small test equipment, our laboratory can contribute to EME qualifications and tests because we are complementary to other EU test facilities in the EME Network. Our strength is for example the close relationship with research topics. This means that future developments can be taken into account for capability investments. This is a valuable contribution to the Network of EME T&E Centres”, Mr Gilles states. “For example, deminers use firing devices which can be very sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances. Wireless devices are a cause for concern, in particular radio transmitters used in proximity of such life-critical devices. The risk of malfunction, such as a non-detection of a buried mine, or the premature explosion of the detonators must be evaluated”, he stressed. The importance of sharing test results and qualification methods among European Armed Forces is obvious. “It is very important for us to share those kind of experiences and qualification methods with other EU experts in the EME Network to optimise our qualification methods in an interoperable way”, says Mr Gilles. Thomas Honke, the EDA’s Project Officer for Qualification Test and Evaluation, adds: “The example of electromagnetic effects is only one aspect in the large field of EU Test and Evaluation domains. Those kind of T&E collaborations in the defence sector will help to save lives, especially if shared test methods discover weaknesses of military equipment in a pan-European context. Based on exchanging this information in qualification, test and evaluation expertise networks, EU Member States can develop adequate countermeasures. This is the spirit of our EU Test and Evaluation Networking”.   More information: European Network on Electro Magnetic Effects Test & Evaluation capabilities Rationalization (ENTER) - EDA project page Defence Test and Evaluation Base (DTEB) portal EDSTAR portal 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/07/29/eda-prepares-inter-laboratory-test-round-to-counter-electromagnetic-effects-on-operations
EDA_NEWS_0403	2016-08-30	NEWS	“A corporate mind-set favourable to innovation is critical”	 How do key European defence companies approach and deal with the challenge of strategic innovation? European Defence Matters, the EDA's official magazine, spoke to Marwan Lahoud who is Executive Vice President International, Strategy and Public Affairs of Airbus Group. The article below appeared in the 10th edition of European Defence Matters, the EDA’s official magazine, which you can read by clicking here. Mr Lahoud, which lessons could you share with your peers regarding the specific features of strategic innovation in the area of defence? European Defence Matters, Magazine issue 10 A genuine and sustained dialogue between the armed forces, defence procurement agencies and our engineers is essential to defence innovation. Our armed forces need to respond to new threats as they arise. Good defence innovation that is built around a genuine dialogue is more able to deliver the best and technologically superior equipment, much more cost effectively. In defence, strategic innovation does not derive from incremental improvements but from a game-changer, a disruptor or a breakthrough. As Aesop’s fable “The Lion and the Mosquito” shows, a strong defence posture constantly requires adaption to new threats. Even the mighty lion can be beaten by the tiny mosquito if it can be lured into the spider’s web. That’s where strategic innovation comes into play. If an adversary takes a decisive advantage on a niche technology that can inflict severe damage to its opponent - it could be game over. Robotisation, big data and artificial intelligence are now widely recognised as defence disruptors. At Airbus Group, we are dedicating substantial resources to the area of “autonomy”, including Unmanned Vehicle Systems (UVS). Autonomous systems can better protect soldiers’ lives, ease decision-making on the ground and reduce the overall cost of operations. Our latest example is the Zephyr, a High Altitude Pseudo Satellite (HAPS). The Zephyr runs exclusively on solar power and is thus able to fly autonomously for month, offering new solutions in military intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. Beyond the demand from the armed forces, what are in your view the main drivers or blocking factors for strategic innovation? A corporate mind-set favourable to innovation is critical. To grasp strategic innovation, companies need swift decision-making, less-risk adverse behaviour, failure acceptance, and fast spiral development cycles. This is the recipe for strategic innovation. Many defence companies used to be like big ocean liners: slow to move ahead and slow to change trajectory. This is changing. Those who have not taken this seriously are bound to fail. On top of that, to be innovative, companies need to talk to the right guys outside the company. At Airbus Group we place a high priority on a continuous dialogue with SMEs, universities and research centers, partners and start-ups. We are maintaining an ecosystem that fosters and grows our innovation capabilities. This has led us to support centres like the Ludwig Bölkow Campus, right from the start. This Campus is an international hub for ground breaking innovations, new ways of thinking, and practical training in the aerospace industry. Located near Munich, which has one of the richest traditions of technology development in Germany, the campus is a place where science, education, and industry come together and take innovative ideas off the drawing board and turn them into real products. Defence innovation is also clearly shaped by regulation. Intellectual property rights (IPR) are a driver, and European defence companies are more likely to engage in innovation if they feel that they can retain IPR for future market advantage. I am convinced that European support to defence industries should take this point into consideration. The limited Research and Technology (R&T) budgets for defence clearly diminish the European potential of innovation in defence which is one of the reasons why Airbus Group seeks a close interaction between innovation in defence and in the commercial area. Our business model is based on the duality of civil and defence which allows us to pursue innovation to the largest extent possible. Government investment in defence and research does however remain extremely important in driving innovation. Considerable pressures of course remain on public expenditure, which is why we applaud efforts by EU Member States to substantially improve their defence budgets. As a minimum it is absolutely crucial that member states meet their commitment to the NATO Defence Investment Pledge (2% GDP on defence with 20% on research and innovation). Should European defence companies find new ways to promote innovation? How do you evaluate the business model and success of digital companies or actors such as SpaceX in this respect? Let’s face it, Silicon Valley has been the source of major strategic innovations in the US for decades. Thanks to a strong initial push by the US Department of Defense (DOD), 15% of US patents are now produced in the valley but more importantly, major GAFAs-like companies were born there. SpaceX and Google have undoubtedly marked an evolution in the aerospace industry. With OneWeb, Google and Airbus Group (as industrial partners for the design and manufacturing of a new fleet of microsatellites) are entering the “NewSpace”. OneWeb is about providing cheap internet access worldwide, thanks to an initial production of 900 satellites, each weighing less than 150 kilogrammes, for launch into low Earth orbit beginning in 2018. This industrial partnership clearly unites two of the world’s best players and I am sure this kind of joint effort will be replicated in other areas. SpaceX is also a case in point. This company has made great progress in the development of launchers and has capitalized on all possible drivers of innovation. But we cannot be naïve about this new approach. Beyond all the merits of SpaceX we cannot ignore the massive public support it has received from billions of dollars injected by NASA. Which measures should be taken to halt the reduction in R&D spending? Are cooperative programmes one of the vital solutions? In tough economic times, cutting R&D spending is an easy solution. Yet, countries like France, and Germany have not fallen into this trap. This is a shrewd decision, which we both recognise and welcome. Hi-tech corporations recognise the importance of sustained research investment and even in difficult times, boards will do everything they can to protect this investment, not to do so can cut companies out of future markets for years to come. It is the same in defence, cutting research investment can allow adversaries the window they need to develop threat capabilities that we will not be able to match. Yet, European Member States’ cumulative R&D efforts are still way too low. With around 170 million Euros invested in defence R&T across Europe, representing 8% of total R&T expenditure of the Member States, European collaborative defence R&T barely exists. More worrying is that over the last ten years, European defence investment in R&D has declined by 30%. To the contrary, the US spent an average of €9 billion per year on defence R&T (i.e. four times European Member States spending combined) and an average of€ 54.6 billion per year on R&D during the period 2006-2011. Thanks to its ‘Defense Innovation Strategy’ (DII), more commonly referred as the ‘Third Offset Strategy’ (3OS) this effort will even keep increasing. For the fiscal year 2017, the US Defense Secretary has announced that €67 billion will be requested in defence R&D appropriations. The Russian defence R&D budget has also doubled between 2012 and 2015 while think tanks estimate that the Chinese defence research budget will surpass the US by 2022. Against this background, the establishment of the EU’s preparatory Action on defence research and its subsequent larger programme post 2021 is more than a laudable effort. It is the right move even if we regret that it may take some time to happen. I expect this action to be translated into concrete collaborative, innovative programs, meeting the current and future needs of our armed forces. As an example, VTOL RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aerial Systems) could be a potential solution for a wide range of future military applications, including surveillance missions in the maritime environment, operation from naval platforms, or land operations. I am sure that the EDA is fully aware of the importance of the preparatory action and will play a crucial role in making this endeavour a success.

EDA_NEWS_0404	2016-07-25	NEWS	Cyber security discussed at conference co-organized by EDA and Slovak EU Presidency	 Representatives from 20 EU Member States gathered last week (20/21 July) in Bratislava for a two-day Cyber Security Cooperation Conference co-organized by the current Slovak Presidency of the Council of the European Union and the European Defence Agency (EDA). The event was centred around three panels in which participants discussed different aspects of cooperation on cyber defence, starting with the political aspects of cooperation, moving onto public-private sector cooperation, and finishing with the challenges for military-to-military cooperation. In his speech at the conference, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq stressed the importance of European cooperation in the cyber defence field. The EDA, he said, is involved in this domain since more than four years when it established a platform for Member States to speak with each other about their requirements in cyber defence and cooperation. “And we can proudly say that within that relatively short time, we have significantly influenced the development of the cyber defence domain in Europe”. “Despite the sensitivities surrounding cyber defence, there is enormous scope for cooperation”, Mr Domecq continued, stressing that the EDA was ready to move forward its role in fostering cooperation on cyber security and defence in all dimensions, even beyond the traditional understanding of military to military cooperation. “Admittedly, we are in many cases in ‘uncharted waters’ but that should not prevent us from starting to navigate those waters. Cyber and Hybrid Threats require comprehensive responses”, he said. Cyber threats are among the main risks and perils of the last decade, stated Ivan Máčovský, State Secretary at the Slovak Ministry of Defence. Therefore, the priorities of the Slovak EU Presidency are also geared towards consolidating the EU's unity and coherence in this field, he stressed. “It was acknowledged over the course of this conference that cooperation among the EU Member States in this field is of crucial importance, be it at the political or civil-military level. It is equally needed between the public and private sectors,” Mr Máčovský said at the conclusion of the event.   More information: Cyber Defence - EDA project page Communication and Information Systems - EDA project page  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/07/25/cyber-security-discussed-at-conference-co-organized-by-eda-and-slovak-eu-presidency

EDA_NEWS_0406	2016-07-05	NEWS	EDA seminar on the effects of hostile environments on materials	 Defence equipment and platforms are most often deployed in hostile environments where their underlying materials are affected by diverse factors such as humidity, pressure, temperature and radiation. The consequences are fatigue, corrosion, plastic deformation, erosion and other effects which harm the equipment and increase vulnerability in operations. On 15 June 2016, 31 experts from various European Ministries of Defence, Armed Forces, European institutions, industry and academia participated in an EDA seminar to address the effects hostile environments have on materials. High-level experts on materials and defence technologies gathered to discuss the effects of hostile environments on materials as well as possible solutions to mitigate these effects. In order to understand the importance of these issues, background information was provided on operational problems caused by material degradation and on current research work in this area carried out at EU level. The discussion focused on identifying the main effects suffered by materials used in military systems and platforms, the preventive technologies which could address them and the actions needed to reach the right Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) for the operational use of these technologies. Participants also addressed the challenges and the way ahead in view of raising awareness and sharing data. The main outcome of the seminar was the identification of promising solutions such as coatings, structural health monitoring, smart materials, additive manufacturing and nanotechnology fabrication methods. However, industry requires understanding of operational military needs, calling for a larger participation of end-users in knowledge-building activities. Also, the specification of environmental properties of materials was viewed as necessary for guiding the production and design of future materials. More cooperation between defence structures, industry and academia, coupled with appropriate financial resources were considered key elements for the advancement of research work in this area. The seminar was co-organized by the EDA’s CapTech on Materials & Structures, the Ministry of Defence Portugal, the International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory (INL) and the University of Beira Interior (UBI).   More information: For further information, please contact: CapTech.Materials@eda.europa.eu EDA brochure: European Defence Agency Role in Research & Technology - Towards Enhanced European Future Military Capabilities EDA Defence Research & Technology conference report available now (news published on 19 May 2016)  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/07/05/eda-seminar-on-the-effects-of-hostile-environments-on-materials

EDA_NEWS_0408	2016-07-18	NEWS	EDA and EU Satellite Centre (SATCEN) formalize cooperation with exchange of letters	 The European Defence Agency (EDA) and the European Union Satellite Centre (SATCEN) today formalized their close and fruitful cooperation, already in place since 2004, with an exchange of letters between Jorge Domecq (EDA Chief Executive) and Pascal Legai (SATCEN Director) at the EDA premises in Brussels. Both organisations perform complementary roles and activities in the space-based earth observation domain and more generally in the space and security sector. Whereas the EDA’s work is focused on the harmonisation of requirements and the promotion of appropriate schemes for future capability development, SATCEN’s activity supports the decision making and actions of the EU by providing products and services resulting from the exploitation of space assets in particular in the CSDP field. Since 2004, EDA and SATCEN have collaborated on projects as important as GISMO (Geospatial Information to Support Decision Making in Operations) and GISMO 2, SULTAN (Persistent Surveillance Long Term Analysis) and REACT. With today’s exchange of letters, the EDA and SATCEN establish a more structured cooperation meaning that they will even more focus on activities of mutual interest, such as studies, workshops, projects and programmes. The new enhanced relationship will also see the nomination of Points of Contact on both sides to facilitate communication and cooperation. Jorge Domecq, the EDA Chief Executive, hailed the exchange of letters as an important step and said he was “confident that, through our cooperation, EDA and SATCEN can bring a significant added value to their respective Member States by reducing administrative burden, facilitating common action where possible, supporting better planning, as well as contributing to the best use of our respective resources”. Specific cooperation areas and joint roadmap EDA and SATCEN have also identified specific cooperation areas such as imagery exploitation, geospatial analysis and applications, future space-based earth observation systems, cyber defence, Big Data exploitation in the space and security domain, space situational awareness or maritime surveillance. The two Agencies will also develop a joint roadmap for cooperation detailing the activities of common interest as included in the respective work programmes (3-year Planning Framework for EDA and annual Working Programme for SATCEN). The roadmap will be updated annually.   Background The European Union Satellite Centre, which is based in Torrejón de Ardoz (Spain), was established by the Joint Action 2001/555/CFS on the establishment of a European Union Satellite Centre repealed by Council Decision 2014/401/CFSP of 26 June 2014. The Centre supports the decision making and actions of the Union in the field of the CFSP and in particular the CSDP, including European Union crisis management missions and operations, by providing products and services resulting from the exploitation of relevant space assets and collateral data, including satellite and aerial imagery, and related services.   More information: GISMO2 (factsheet) Persistent SUrveillance Long Term ANalysis (SULTAN) - project page EDA CE Jorge DOMECQ visits the SatCen (press release October 2015) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/07/18/eda-and-eu-satellite-centre-(satcen)-formalize-cooperation-with-exchange-of-letters
EDA_NEWS_0409	2016-07-04	NEWS	EDA launches market survey on Role 1 and/or 2 services	 Since the creation of the European Defence Agency in 2004, support to the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and to EU operations has been one of EDA's core missions. Several activities are now ongoing to develop the support of CSDP military and civilian operations or missions as well as EU Battlegroups at the request of Member States. Typically, CSDP operations and missions are deployed on short notice to manage crisis in remote areas. In some cases, shortfalls on assets and equipment arising from the force generation have led to outsourcing some key services. This has been the case for Role 1and Role 2 services for several CSDP missions and operations. In order to inform decisions of various stakeholders, EDA is conducting the present market survey to better understand the range of commercially available solutions, which could fulfil possible future requirements for Role 1 and/or 2 services and associated risks or limitations. It has to be highlighted that the objective of this survey is to identify service providers of ‘turnkey’ solutions and not manufacturers of assets or supply providers. Operators are kindly invited to participate in the survey by submitting their answer by 30 September 2016.   More information Market survey for Role1 and Role2 services EDA Operations Support project page. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/07/04/eda-launches-market-survey-on-role-1-and-or-2-services

The EATT finds its origin in a wider multinational framework: the 20-nation, European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) programme, which sponsors several other airlift activities and underlines the critical importance of Pooling and Sharing capabilities as a means to improve cooperation in European defence.   More information: News ""Air transport community trains in Portugal"" (30.06.2016) EATT16 factsheet European Air Transport Fleet project page Exercises & training project page "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/06/30/5th-european-air-transport-training-draws-to-a-close
EDA_NEWS_0411	2016-06-29	NEWS	Importance of cooperation between defence, space & civil research highlighted	 More than 70 representatives from Member States, industry and EU institutions gathered on 28 June for the workshop “Opportunities for Dual-Use Technologies – Components” organised by the European Defence Agency, the European Commission, the ECSEL JU. The aim of the event was to find areas of cooperation and to pave the way for possibilities for dual-use research in the future. Khalil Rouhana, Director in the European Commission, opened the workshop by presenting snapshots of the Commission’s ambitions in the electronic field. Through dual-use research, we can make sure we have technology autonomy in Europe and industrial autonomy for the future. Denis Roger, EDA Director, underlined that the workshop will strive to have a better understanding of activities which can be jointly explored, believing that “better exploitation of dual-use synergies can bring a win-win situation for all stakeholders”. He addressed the issue of the fading borderline between civil and defence and stressed that “more cooperative investment and clear prioritisation in resource allocation is a must for defence”. Bert de Colvenaer, Executive Director ECSEL-JU, presented the joint undertaking’s role in investing in knowledge and innovation through its PPP-model. The projects presented during the workshop showed success stories of electronic components research from each of the three institutions. The main technological areas addressed were thermal management and robustness, RF components, III-V technologies and advanced digital components. Key takeaways from the discussions in the three sessions of the workshop were: the importance of developing value chains, ensuring supply, quality, appropriate business approaches, volume considerations, EU funding and support towards industry. In the panel “dual-use, dual-benefits”, representatives from the UK MoD, STM, DG GROW and ESA outlined the dual-use spin-off benefits, spin-in technologies, unique European assets and the role of innovative SMEs. The most important conclusion of the event was that exploiting synergies are highly necessary. Panagiotis Kikiras, Head of Innovative Research at the EDA, highlighted the perfect timing of this discussion in the context of the upcoming EU Global Strategy and European Defence Action Plan. Recognising the effort of the EC, EDA, and ECSEL communities as well as the need to further raise awareness on the subject, Willy Van Puymbroeck, EC, concluded that: “We need to seed in order to harvest but we have to dare to harvest the work that is being done.”	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/06/29/importance-of-cooperation-between-defence-space-civil-research-highlighted
EDA_NEWS_0412	2016-06-30	NEWS	Balkan Spartan: First European C27J exercise	 Three European C27J nations (Bulgaria, Italy and Romania) participate in the first edition of the Balkan Spartan exercise with the aim to increase interoperability among European C27J Spartan operators. The exercise, taking place from 29 June to 8 July in Sofia, Bulgaria marks the beginning of yet another deliverable from the European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) partnership signed in 2011 by twenty Member States. Designed by the European Defence Agency (EDA) and hosted by the Bulgarian Air Force, this first-of-its-kind flying event is aiming at promoting aircraft user type approaches to harmonise tactics, techniques and procedures as well as to develop more cost-effective solutions to operate and sustain the C27J. The objective of Balkan Spartan is to provide air crews with both academic and flight training as well as to have ground crews developing harmonised procedures to eventually allowing them to perform cross maintenance on each other’s aircraft.   This flying event was developed in the framework of the C27J cooperation concept launched in 2015 by EDA. This concept is looking at developing a far reaching level of interoperability amongst European C27J operators through a variety of projects in the areas of operations & training, logistics, airworthiness, common procurement and SESAR. In 2016 a similar working group has been created for the European C295 operators. The main advantages of EDA’s user groups – that are working in full transparency and cooperate with all other existing user groups led by other organisations, industry and/or service providers – is to group medium and small national fleets to take advantage of economies of scale, to exchange best practices and to be more cost-efficient in operating and sustaining the aircraft.   Background information The European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) partnership, launched in 2011 and now gathering 20 Member States (AT, BE, BG, CZ, DE, EL, ES, FI, FR, IT, LT, LU, NL, PL, PT, RO, SK, SE, NO and HU), aims at increasing the airlift provision in the EU, developing concrete solutions to increase the efficiency of existing and future fleets and to optimise the use of air transport organisations and structures. Other activities undertaken as part of EATF include the European Air Transport Training (EATT) and European Advanced Tactics Training Course (EAATC) events as well as the European Air Transport Symposium.   Balkan Spartan: List of participating air forces and aircraft Bulgaria: 1 x C27J Italy: 1 x C27J Romania: 1 x C27J Slovakia: Personnel included in the multinational command & control Observer nations: Greece, Lithuania, Australia   More information European Air Transport Fleet project page  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/06/30/balkan-spartan-first-european-c27j-exercise
EDA_NEWS_0413	2016-06-29	NEWS	EDA and Enterprise Europe Network (EEN) cooperation yields first concrete results	 Joint efforts by the European Defence Agency (EDA) and the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN) to support dual-use small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) led to a first concrete result this week (27 June) when a Dutch SME named IC3D Media, which had been put forward by EEN, was allowed to participate in the EDA’s expert cell (CapTech) dedicated to ‘System of systems, Battlelab and Modelling & Simulation’. It was the first time that a dual-use SME recommended to the EDA by the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN) was offered this opportunity. The CapTech meeting allowed the company in question, which develops gaming techniques for training of police agents and soldiers, to showcase its innovative products and know-how, as well as to discuss potential collaborations, synergies and future contract opportunities with the EDA’s participating Member States and their stakeholders. As a next step, IC3D Media could also participate to the EDA’s Modelling & Simulation platform which offers a virtual meeting room for SMEs active in this particular domain. The fact that this Dutch SME, with the support of the Enterprise Europe Network, was given the possibility to access the EDA CapTech demonstrates that the cooperation between the EDA and the EEN works effectively and that it can yield practical results; it also shows the way to follow by other SMEs. EEN is a network coordinated by the European Commission’s DG GROWTH (and co-supported by the EU COSME programme) providing SMEs with a wide range of free-of-charge services delivered by several hundreds of local points of contact in native language. In a recent ‘Assessment of defence-related SME access to the COSME Programme’, the EDA explored several opportunities for the defence sector within the EU Programme COSME (Competitiveness of SMEs) 2014-2020. As a result of this study, defence-related SMEs and clusters can access the newly created EDA’s ‘COSME web-platform’.   More information: EDA’s support to access EU funding for the defence sector EDA’s support to defence-related SMEs EDA’s COSME web-Platform EDA’s CapTechs  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/06/29/eda-and-enterprise-europe-network-(een)-cooperation-yields-first-concrete-results

EDA_NEWS_0415	2016-06-30	NEWS	21 proposals received for Pilot Project on defence research	" The European Defence Agency (EDA) has received so far 21 submissions in response to the “Call for Proposals for the Pilot Project on defence research” closed on 23 June.* The objective of the call is to award grant agreements for the value of almost €1.4 million for two technological development projects in the area of defence and one research and development project linked to certification for military and civil uses. Received proposals came from across Europe (twelve countries) and cover all of the aforementioned activities. “The good number of proposals received shows the interest in the Pilot Project by SMEs, industry and R&T organisations. The Pilot Project – as a predecessor to the larger Preparatory Action for defence-related research – is an important test bed for funding of defence research through the EU budget. The European Defence Agency is looking forward to advancing the projects and to opening this new chapter in the way defence research is funded in Europe”, comments Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency. The Pilot Project has been entrusted to EDA by the European Commission through a Delegation Agreement which was signed on 16 November 2015. As a result, EDA is responsible for the execution and management of the projects. The call for proposals, the submission of proposals, the evaluation and the awarding of the grant agreement is organised and coordinated by EDA.  The evaluation of the proposals will be conducted over the summer period with the objective to conclude the grant agreements before year end.   Background Research in defence related technologies is critical for the development of the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base and the strength and strategic autonomy of the EU Member States armed forces. The European Commission, in agreement with the European Council, will launch a Preparatory Action on defence research, which will start in 2017 and last for three years. Its aim is to test and prepare the ground for a possible defence research programme in the next Multiannual Financial Framework. The Pilot Project has been introduced in the EU budget (2015 and 2016) adopted by the European Council and the European Parliament, on the basis of an initiative of the latter. The EDA published the Call for proposals for the Pilot Project in March 2016. The deadline to respond was on 23 June 2016 and the three activities covered are relating to Unmanned Heterogeneous Swarm of Sensor Platforms, Inside Building Awareness and Navigation for Urban Warfare and Standardisation of Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) Detect and Avoid (DAA).” * More submissions might be received in the coming days by post.   More information: News ""EC and EDA sign agreement on defence related research"" (18 Nov 2015) "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/06/30/21-proposals-received-for-pilot-project-on-defence-research
EDA_NEWS_0416	2016-06-22	NEWS	EDA launches COSME platform for dual-use & defence SMEs	 The European Defence Agency has recently published a web platform with information on opportunities of the EU COSME Programme for dual-use or defence-related SMEs. COSME is the EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs, running from 2014 to 2020, with a budget of € 2.3billion. COSME aims at supporting SMEs in the following areas: facilitating access to finance; supporting internationalisation and access to markets; creating an environment favourable to competitiveness; and encouraging an entrepreneurial culture. The programmes provides SMEs with access to: finance, i.e. long-term loans (backed by EU guarantees) and risk-capital/equity investments; a wide range of free-of-charge services. Among other things, EDA’s COSME platform provides dual-use and defence-related SMEs with a dynamic and user-friendly mapping to identify their closest COSME’s financial intermediary (e.g., banks, equity fund) and their local free-service point of contact, in native language (from the Enterprise Europe Network - EEN). COSME also provides grants for cross-border cluster partnerships.

EDA_NEWS_0418	2016-06-21	NEWS	EDA symposium discusses EU deploy capabilities for CSDP operations	 More than 100 military and civil representatives from Member States, European institutions, international organisations as well as industry are gathering this week (21/22 June) in Brussels for a Deploy Capabilities Symposium organised by the European Defence Agency (EDA) under the auspices of the Dutch Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  The aim of the event is to raise awareness about this fundamental capability and to discuss ways towards a better coordinated EU deploy strategy and improved European capabilities in this domain. Deployment capabilities are crucial for any mission/operation because they have to enable the effective, timely, safe and integrated transportation of military troops and assets. Because of its multi-dimensional nature (land, sea, air), deploy is characterized by extremely high operational costs, long lasting administrative procedures and vulnerability of transport assets. These elements pose enormous challenges to Member States in their efforts to provide contributions for CSDP operations; the need for coordinated movement and transportation plans and optimization of transportation resources is thus of paramount importance.  Recent CSDP operations have demonstrated that the lack of an adequate level of deploy capabilities may seriously endanger not only the setting up but also the execution of the operation, including the re-deployment phases. Jorge Domecq, the EDA’s Chief Executive, opened the symposium on Tuesday by recalling that deployability is a priority action in the Agency’s Capability Development Plan (CDP) and that several projects designed to enhance Member States’ capabilities are underway, including the European Air Transport Fleet programme as well as other projects related, for instance, to the setting up of EU multimodal transport hubs and multinational modular medical units or the sharing of spare parts. Nevertheless, more needs to be done to further foster Europe’s deployment capabilities, Mr Domecq underlined. “They must be recognised and supported by an appropriate level of resource planning and strong political backing”, he said.  Mr Domecq called on Member States to show “commitment to working together, to identifying new opportunities for pooling and sharing and to bringing added value in terms of operational effectiveness, cost reduction and long term availability of assets”.    Consultation forum and EU deployment strategy The EDA Chief Executive also urged EU decision-makers to consider the idea of establishing a regular consultation forum to discuss and shape a pragmatic and sustainable EU strategy on deploy capabilities for CSDP. “Such a high-level consultation forum, as well as a consolidated strategy for deploy capabilities, are still missing”, Mr Domecq regretted. Deployment cooperation with NATO has progressed in the last few months, he said, adding: “I remain determined to develop this collaboration further, with the aim of exploring possible synergies and complementarity in order to avoid unnecessary duplication whilst optimizing the best use of scarce resources. A stronger Europe makes for a stronger and more credible NATO. This also applies equally to deployability”.   Deployment capabilities are “essential” for implementing EU Global Strategy In his welcome address, Major General Eric Schevenhoven of The Netherlands said that deployment, i.e. the ability to get military capabilities to where they are needed, was an “essential element” for the implementation of the upcoming EU Global Strategy. “As we speak, the new EU Global Strategy is nearing completion. After that, the follow-on discussion will start on how to implement the strategy. We have to think about scenarios, about which capabilities are needed and about how to overcome the shortfalls together. Deployment capabilities play an important part in this discussion. They are needed to make the EU Global Strategy viable”, he stated.   More information: Logistic Precision Air Delivery (EDA project page) Operations Support (EDA project page) Sharing of Spare Parts (EDA project page) European Air Transport Fleet (EDA project page) EU Multimodal Transport Hubs (EDA project page) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/06/21/eda-symposium-discusses-eu-deploy-capabilities-for-csdp-operations
EDA_NEWS_0419	2016-06-17	NEWS	Hungary hosted EDA Personnel Recovery course	 The 8th edition of the Personnel Recovery Controller and Planner Course (PRCPC), a project initiated by the European Defence Agency (EDA), took place from 30 May to 10 June 2016 in Veszprém, Hungary.  Organised and hosted by the Hungarian Defence Forces at the Air Command and Control Centre (ACCC), the exercise gathered 20 students from six European countries: Austria, Cyprus, Germany, Hungary, Italy and Sweden. The course was delivered by experienced instructors from Canada, France, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden. The course enabled students to be better prepared to plan and execute Personnel Recovery (PR) missions. Personnel Recovery is usually defined as the sum of diplomatic, military and civil efforts to effect the recovery and reintegration of isolated personnel.  From feedback we know that all participants gained expertise and knowledge from this multi-national training opportunity. As a result, European PR capabilities were strengthened and the number of trained personnel available to support future operations and missions was boosted.  During the course, the EDA’s Personnel Recovery Functional Area Service Advanced Technology Demonstrator (PR FAS ATD) was presented to the participants. This system is designed to provide headquarters-level PR staff with a planning tool to manage PR missions. It has been developed as part of EDA’s work to improve interoperability between European armed forces in this field. The next EU PRCPC will take place from 21 November to 2 December 2016 in Italy (Poggio, Renatico) and will be organised by the European Personnel Recovery Centre (EPRC).  Background The EDA PRCPC project was established on 30 May 2013 as an EDA Category B project, under the lead of Sweden. As of today, it gathers six contributing EU Member States (cMS): Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands and Sweden. On 31st May 2015 the cMS agreed to extend the PRCPC Cat B project until 30 May 2017 as they had an ongoing training requirement. The EPRC is a potential candidate for the continuation of the project.    More information: 7th edition of Personnel Recovery course (April 2016)  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/06/17/hungary-hosted-eda-personnel-recovery-course
EDA_NEWS_0420	2016-06-20	NEWS	EDA and CSDP civilian missions develop cooperation	 The European Defence Agency (EDA) is developing its cooperation with CSDP civilian Missions in the field of Satellite Communications (Satcom).  Since early June, the civilian Mission EUCAP SAHEL Mali in Bamako which aims at supporting the internal security forces in the country, is taking advantage of a Framework Contract established between Airbus Defence and Space and the EDA to cover its requirement for SatCom services. In concrete terms, this allows the Mission to benefit from a strategic satellite link between Mali and Europe. The services provided by Airbus Defence and Space include the rental, shipping, and installation of a C-band remote satellite communications terminal in Bamako, high data rate satellite bandwidth and anchoring in Europe. The services also include training of Mission personnel, 24/7 technical support and on site-intervention if required. In addition, the Mission is also provided with mobile satellite services to include e.g. a number of satellite phone subscriptions to cover the communication needs for Mission personnel moving around in the country. EDA’s Chief Executive, Jorge Domecq, welcomed this first use of EDA EU SatCom Market contract by a civilian CSDP Mission as “a concrete example of how the European Defence Agency and CSDP civilian missions can develop cooperation to make best use of resources”. Mr Domecq also said he was confident that other EU entities will make use of the extensive support the Agency can provide in this domain, thus further increasing the pooling effect and reducing costs for the benefit of all EU SatCom Market members. CSDP civilian Missions EUCAP SAHEL Niger and EUAM Ukraine have also ordered similar services to be provided in their theatres of operation. Fruitful cooperation The establishment of this satellite link is the result of extensive discussions to develop cooperation between the Agency and the relevant services in the European External Action Service (EEAS), especially the Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability (CPCC) directorate and the Service for Foreign Policy Instrument (FPI). The EEAS Civilian Operations Commander, Kenneth Deane, stated: “I very much welcome the possibility offered to civilian CSDP Missions to make use of the services provided through the EU SatCom Market Project. I am confident this will ensure best value for money and effectively help deployment and development of the CSDP civilian Missions in line with the relevant conclusions of the European Council.” The head of the EUCAP SAHEL Mali mission, Albrecht Conze (Germany), said he was “very happy about the fact that, thanks to the hard and dedicated work done by Mission CIS experts, the EDA and the contractor Airbus Defence & Space, the Mission now has a stable strategic SatCom link to Europe as well as all the other satellite communication services the mission needs.” EUCAP SAHEL Mali The EUCAP SAHEL Mali civilian Mission, launched on 15 January 2015 at the invitation of the Malian government, is an important element of the regional approach taken in the European Union strategy for security and development in the Sahel. In addition to the action already taken in Mali by the EUTM Mission providing support to the Malian armed forces and by the European Union Delegation, and in connection with EUCAP SAHEL Niger, the EUCAP SAHEL Mali Mission is helping the Malian government with the reform of its internal security forces (ISF) to enable them to provide more security and justice for Malians. EUCAP Sahel Mali is dedicated to supporting the Malian authorities' commitment to restructuring their defence and security forces. EU SatCom Market Within the EU SatCom Market project, the EDA acts as the central purchasing body on behalf of the contributing members. It purchases the services from a commercial provider. The project uses a ‘pay-per-use’ model, so members do not have to contribute with regular fees; instead they only pay for what they order. Since May 2013, 38 orders have been passed for a total value of over €6.2 million with more orders planned. Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxemburg, Portugal, Romania, the United Kingdom, Serbia, the Athena Mechanism, EUCAP SAHEL Niger, EUCAP SAHEL Mali, EUAM Ukraine, EUCAP NESTOR in Somalia and EUMM Georgia are the 18 members of the project.

EDA_NEWS_0422	2016-06-15	NEWS	Preparations underway for C-IED exercise “Bison Counter 2016” in Sweden	 Forty experts from fifteen participating EDA Member States gathered in Malmo (Sweden) on 8-9 June 2016 to discuss the final arrangements for the multinational Counter Improvised Explosive Devices (C-IED) exercise Bison Counter 2016 (BC16) to be hosted by the Swedish Armed Forces from 15 to 27 August 2016. During this final coordination conference, discussions focused on logistics and planning arrangements. According to the information compiled during the meeting, more than 200 troops from 20 European and non-European countries, as well as some 700 Swedish troops will take part in BC16. The exercise plan is to evaluate the full C-IED concept from the first responders’ perspective until delivery of C-IED related intelligence production, so as to tackle all the C-IED work strands. A large number of different C-IED enablers ranging from Military Search, Military Working Dogs, Explosives Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and Improvised Explosive Devices Disposal (IEDD), EOD divers, Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear and explosives (CBRNe) experts, Military Engineers and Weapon Intelligence Teams from Land, Maritime and Air domains will take part in the exercise. The Forces will be split up in different components such as Task Force C-IED, Brigade Level Staff, Training Teams, Observers and Lessons Learned among others. The scenario will see a large number of C-IED dedicated tasks being implemented in several locations in Sweden including maritime C-IED tasks at a naval base. The inclusion of the Joint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory (JDEAL) deployable capability (JDC) marks the first time the laboratory will deploy in its fully operational mode. Previously, the laboratory has been recently sent on a first expeditionary deployment to a Spanish exercise (Interdict 16). This time, more than 20 exploitation experts between lab members and observers will provide a 24/7 service. Major Lars Samuelsson (Swedish Armed Forces) pointed out the challenge of running such a complex and specific exercise (the only full C-IED dedicated exercise worldwide);he is expecting representatives from 20 different nationalities to attend. The first Bison Counter exercise took place in The Netherlands in 2013. Building on this experience, the EDA’s C-IED Project Team decided to institutionalize Bison Counter as a bi-annual C-IED dedicated activity under the umbrella of the EDA. A Distinguished Visitor’s Day is planned for 25 and 26 August.   More information:   First C-IED workshop successfully completed (webnews) JDEAL: ready for deployment (webnews) EDA Project Page: C-IED 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/06/15/preparations-underway-for-c-ied-exercise-bison-counter-2016-in-sweden
EDA_NEWS_0423	2016-06-16	NEWS	EDA Composite Air Operations (COMAO) planning course held in the UK	 End of May, helicopter crews and military staff dealing with Composite Air Operations (COMAO) from across Europe met for an EDA-led Planning Course at RAF Linton-on-Ouse, United Kingdom. During a full week, participants went through complex mission planning exercises within a contested air and land scenario, led by the Chief Instructor, Sqn Ldr Mike Gallagher. Composite Air Operations are interrelated and/or limited in both time and space, where units differing in type and/or role are put under unified control to achieve a common objective. The need for organising the COMAO course arose from lessons identified during the previous Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC) and Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP) exercise in Italy in 2015.  COMAO is a broad and complex subject and the number of military personnel with operational and training experience in this domain is shrinking across Europe.  This is especially pertinent to the rotary community which has limited access to existing organisations such as the Tactical Leadership Programme (TLP).  Additionally, bespoke courses in which complex helicopter operations are the main focus currently do actually not exist. The aim of the course at RAF Linton-on-Ouse was to increase participants’ knowledge of COMAO planning, using the so-called 4T’s (Task, Target, Threat and Tactics) process.  Equally important, the course allowed to create an environment in which numerous nations meet, work together and develop their capabilities while acquiring an in-depth knowledge and understanding of each other’s platforms. The course was very well attended which is testimony for the high demand of COMAO planning trainings across Europe.  There were helicopter trainees from Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Hungary, Belgium and the UK. Tactics and weapons instructors were provided from Sweden, the Dutch Weapons School and the UK.  Vitally, the course was supported by 8 Sqn AWACS from RAF Waddington and 100 Sqn Hawks from RAF Leeming bringing with them a wealth of knowledge concerning Air Battle Space Management and a remarkable breadth of fast-jet capabilities.  The UK provided a Ground Liaison Officer with comprehensive intelligence support.  In total, the platforms present at the course included the AB212, AS532, Mi-17, CH-47, CH-53, A-109, AH-64, Navy Lynx, E3-D Sentry and the numerous fast-jet platforms represented by the 100 Sqn pilots. The course began with lectures and platform capability briefs and was followed by 3 days of scenarios with one mission being planned and briefed each day. As the course was progressing, the missions increased in complexity, running from the start of hostilities and covert insertions for bridge demolition and distraction operations to troop reinforcements and Non-combatant Evacuation Operations (NEO).  The final event culminated in a complex night mission to arrest a High Value Target (HVT).  The threat level was raised each day; therefore the tactics to deal with those threats had to be reconsidered too before being implemented. The outcome of the course was praised as overwhelmingly positive by all the participants.  One of the key takeaways mentioned by them was that such courses need to be longer so that more time can be spent on the theoretical aspects and a deeper understanding of platform capabilities can be gained.  This recommendation will most likely be taken on board for the next edition, probably in 2017.   More information: EDA Helicopter Initiative project page EDA Exercises and Training project page COLD BLADE Helicopter training 2016 (news, March 2016)   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/06/16/eda-composite-air-operations-(comao)-planning-course-held-in-the-uk
EDA_NEWS_0424	2016-06-09	NEWS	Smart Blue Water Camps project launched	 Acknowledging water as a critical resource throughout Europe, five EDA Member States – Greece, Cyprus, Spain, Portugal and Ireland - have recently committed to participating in a novel water management project which seeks to examine water management on defence lands from a hydro-informatics, conservation, sustainability and technological innovation point of view. The Smart Blue Water Camps (SBWC) project was proposed and developed by Greece who will lead it supported by the EDA. The project seeks to assess existing military water management systems and installations on European soil. For the first phase of the project, the five participating Member States will conduct analysis of the water infrastructure on a chosen military site in each Member State through a series of workshops in order to define the ‘Smart Blue Water Camp Blueprint’. Interventions will be identified and listed according to suitability, cost and impact on the ‘Smart Blue Water Camp Blueprint’. Phase 1 will take place over a ten month period. Thereafter, phase two of the project will involve implementation of the most suitable identified interventions. Water management Existing civil and military water management infrastructure is facing pressure due to climatic changes and limited new investment. There are two major trends developing in water management technology: ‘smarter’ and environmentally integrated infrastructure. Military installations are among the least acknowledged elements in water cycle management. Military camps have great potential for improvement due to their unique characteristics such as significant water and energy demands, significant drainage and wastewater flows, generally aging and inefficient infrastructures, in some cases a need for more autonomy from centralised water and energy systems and a transient population of end users, all of which have a detrimental impact on water management. The opportunities that are presented by military camps in terms of improved water management include: (1) space abundance for the deployment of water demand management technologies e.g. sustainable draining systems, rainwater harvesting & recycling systems, green roofs & walls, (2) similarity of military installations from an upscaling perspective and transferability of best practices and knowledge and (3) the long term commitment of military from a continuation perspective. Background The Smart Blue Water Camps project is launched within the EDA’s energy and environment programme. Centred on four main themes: data collection and analysis, energy efficiency, alternative energy, and defence sustainability, the programme identifies and builds a portfolio of activity that spans the capability, armaments and research & technology perspectives with a view to sharing best practice and enabling collaborative activity wherever possible.

EDA_NEWS_0425	2016-06-17	NEWS	NATO and EU: Complementarity and collaboration in capability development	" On 16 June, the European Parliament subcommittee on security and defence (SEDE) held an exchange of views on the EU-NATO capability development cooperation with Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency, and General Denis Mercier, Supreme Allied Commander Transformation. The NATO-EU Capability Group was established in May 2003 to address common capability shortfalls and to ensure the coherence and mutual reinforcement of NATO and EU capability development efforts. Jorge Domecq highlighted in his speech the partnership between the EU and NATO, “Twenty two EU Members are Allies. We need to ensure that the differences in membership do not become more significant than the similarities. There is a need to continue our close dialogue to ensure complementarity of work. Due to our single set of forces, we cannot afford unnecessary duplication – especially in the field of programmes.” Mr Domecq furthermore stressed the significant strategic overlap between the two organisations, especially regarding crisis management, conflict prevention and peacekeeping. However, while complementarity was important, the EU needed sufficient freedom of action in defence. “That is why EU Member States should support initiatives in EDA to support the development of capabilities to face the whole spectrum of challenges we face in the changing security environment, including the protection of EU citizens.”   General Mercier stressed in his intervention that cooperation between NATO and the EU was ""no longer a question of choice, but a question of will"", and continued, ""I believe we have no other choice but to leverage the competencies of each organisation and make the most of limited resources."" Regarding cooperation with the EDA, General Mercier noted that closer collaboration could bring tangible proposals: ""I can assure you that ACT and EDA have already started working together and intend to deliver practical areas of cooperation in the coming months."" General Mercier concluded his intervention considering ""The collaboration of our two entities could also help synchronise national innovation efforts, including those developed in the United States, in order to keep the highest level of interoperability in the future.""   More information: SEDE website EDA CE Intervention to SEDE - 16 June 2016 "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/06/17/nato-and-eu-complementarity-and-collaboration-in-capability-development
EDA_NEWS_0426	2016-06-08	NEWS	Second meeting of the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in Defence opens in Dublin	 After a successful first meeting in Brussels in January this year of the two-year Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence &Security Sector, the second meeting kicked-off today in Dublin, Ireland. The conference was officially opened by the Assistant Secretary General and Defence Policy Director at the Irish Department of Defence, Mr Ciaran Murphy, the EDA Chief Executive, Mr Jorge Domecq, and the Chief Executive Officer of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, Mr Jim Gannon and Mr Dominique Ristori, Director General for Energy at the European Commission. “Defence is one of the largest energy consumers in Europe. One of the key challenges is to quantify the extent of this energy usage and to assess how projects stimulated through the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector can impact on overall EU energy usage”, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq said at the opening of the second conference. “This is a unique opportunity for change. We have the right experts gathered in the right place. The focus is on military installations and activity on European territory. The goal is to examine where improvements can be made and where assistance is required to address existing challenges”. Whilst the first meeting in Brussels was attended by over 80 participants, primarily from European government ministries of defence and armed forces, the second conference is attended by more than 140 experts from government administrations, as well as industry, academia, NATO representatives and the European Commission, namely DG ENERGY and EASME, the Executive Agency for SMEs. This unique Consultation Forum is actively supported by DG ENERGY and aims at progressing the work started with European Ministries of Defence and Armed Forces relating to energy management, energy efficiency in military buildings and infrastructure and the use of renewable energy systems on defence lands. The activity is now carried forward with the participation of 27 EU Member States including Denmark which shows the critical importance of energy efficiency. Background The Consultation Forum is a European Commission initiative managed by the European Defence Agency. It brings together experts from the defence and energy sectors to share information and best practice on improving energy management, efficiency and the use of renewable energy in the civil uses of the military. The Consultation Forum takes place in a series of five plenary meetings over two years. The work is carried out in three parallel working groups each with a particular focus: (1) Energy management, (2) Energy efficiency & 3) Renewable energy.   Picture: from left to right: Vice Admiral Mark Mellett, Chief of Staff Irish Defence Forces; Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defene Agency; Paul Kehoe Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Mr Ciaran Murphy, Assistant Secretary General and Defence Policy Director at the Irish Department of Defence, Mr Jim Gannnon, Chief Executive Officer of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  More information Consultation Forum page Website Directorate-General for Energy, European Commission 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/06/08/second-meeting-of-the-consultation-forum-for-sustainable-energy-in-defence-opens-in-dublin
EDA_NEWS_0427	2016-06-03	NEWS	First C-IED workshop successfully completed	" Twenty-five experts in Counter Improvised Explosive Devices (C-IED) matters participated in a workshop held in Soesterberg (The Netherlands) from 24-26 May 2016. The workshop - the first of its kind organised under the Joint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory (JDEAL) framework - attracted participants from across Europe (Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Romania, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden), from the United States as well as from the Centre of Excellence for C-IED. Discussions focused on JDEAL and on current and future trends in exploitation. Attendees agreed that the JDEAL was crucial for the technical exploitation of IED incidents (analysis of events, scenes, components and materials) in order to gain valuable technical and tactical information on such threats and identify supply chains. The briefings and discussions covered diverse but inter-linked topics, ranging from hybrid warfare through JDEAL potential support to common terminology and deployable capability concepts. Presentations were notably delivered by representatives from the Centre of Excellence C-IED, the EDA, NATO Headquarters, the Netherlands Forensic Institute, French munitions and explosive specialists, the Dutch Armed Forces as well as by US experts.  Participants also had the opportunity to visit the 1st JDEAL deployable capability (which is now fully operational) and to follow a guided tour of the JDEAL training facility in Soesterberg. The main takeaways of the workshop were summarized by JDEAL Commander, Major Geert Jan Verkoeijen, as follows:  now that JDEAL has been delivered and the first deployable capability is operational, it should be used to a maximum for the benefit of the community. Given that the impact of IEDs on missions and operations continues to be significant, Member States are encouraged to deploy JDEAL in operations and to continue to prioritize joint training capabilities; JDEAL should become as visible as possible and be considered both a strategic and rapid reaction asset for decision-makers; there is an urgent need for agreeing on a common C-IED terminology to be used by all stakeholders.    Francisco Cifuentes, the European Defence Agency (EDA) Project Officer for C-IED, welcomed the fact that the event had allowed to open new lines of communication and networking among experts which will certainly prove useful for the further development of the JDEAL project. 2016 promises to be a particularly busy year for the JDEAL deployable capability. In July, the laboratory will be sent to Spain to take part in multinational exercise ""Interdict"", followed, in August, by exercise Bison Counter 2016 in Sweden. The laboratory will be staffed by experts from all its contributing Member States as well as by observers from other stakeholders.   More information: JDEAL: ready for deployment (Feb.2016) Project page: Joint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory (JDEAL) "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/06/03/first-c-ied-workshop-successfully-completed
EDA_NEWS_0428	2016-06-07	NEWS	EDA study on REACH and CLP impact on defence	 What impact the EU’s regulations on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and on the Classification, Labelling and Packaging of chemical substances and mixtures (CLP) have had on the European defence sector since they entered into force in 2007 and 2009 respectively? To find out, the European Defence Agency (EDA) has commissioned REACHLaw Ltd. (www.reachlaw.fi) to carry out a study the results of which should be available by November 2016. The study is directed to the entire spectrum of European defence stakeholders including, in particular, the defence industry from small and medium-sized to big multinational companies, at all levels of defence supply chain.   The objectives of the study are threefold: to carry out an impact analysis of REACH and CLP regulations on the EU defence sector; based on the results of this analysis, to formulate practical proposals for the improvement of the REACH and CLP regulations and their current implementation regime. These proposals will then serve as a basis for the EDA and its participating Member States’ input into the European Commission’s upcoming REACH review process scheduled for 2017;     to collect information about the impact, on the defence sector, of other EU chemical regulations (especially the BPR, POP and ODS regulations) in order to define a strategy and proposals for improvements in the future. The overarching goal of the EDA’s study initiative is to come up with proposals to the European Commission, EU Member States, Ministries of Defence (MoDs) and the defence industry on how to make of REACH and CLP a win-win situation which would allow for both a high level of protection for health and environment and, at the same time, a strong, competitive and innovative European defence industry. The contractor for the study has recently kicked off the consultation process through different means (questionnaires, interviews etc.) with all competent stakeholders, such as: Member States MoDs, European Commission, European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), Member States REACH Competent Authorities and, last but not least, defence Industry. Defence industry stakeholders are especially invited to take part in the consultation, by downloading from the dedicated contractor’s webpage (link below), filling and returning the related questionnaire/survey and any attachments to EDAsurvey@reachlaw.fi, by Thursday, 30 June 2016 at the latest.

EDA_NEWS_0429	2016-06-07	NEWS	Aggregated defence data 2014 and 2015 (estimated)	 The European Defence Agency (EDA) collects defence data on an annual basis. The Ministries of Defence of the Agency’s 27 Member States (MS) provide the data. EDA acts as the custodian of the data and publishes the aggregated figures. The 2014 and estimated1 2015 figures refer to the total for all EDA Member States2, and if not otherwise stated, they are nominal. Key findings: Defence expenditure increased for the first time after six years of continuous decline Operation and maintenance expenditure further increased, while investment further decreased Defence R&T expenditure at its lowest level Collaboration increased in equipment procurement and European defence R&T Defence personnel decline slowed down Deployment figures noticeably decreased Slight progress recorded on two out of four collective benchmarks   Defence expenditure increased for the first time after six years of continuous decline The year 2014 marked a turning point for the European defence expenditure, the results of the EDA 2014 Defence Data gathering exercise reveal. After a continuous six-year decline, which started in 2008 following the outbreak of the global economic and financial crises, total defence expenditure of the 27 EDA Member States increased in 2014 by 2.3% from EUR 190 billion to EUR 195 billion, compared to the previous year. This was sufficient to overcome inflation and achieve a 0.6% or EUR 1.1 billion real-term3 growth. 2015 estimates suggest a further nominal increase of 2.6% or EUR 5 billion to EUR 200 billion, the level comparable to that before the crisis. In real terms, however, this increase translates into a 0.2% or EUR 0.33 billion decrease. This is the first time to have a decade’s perspective on the European defence spending, starting with 2005 data gathered through the pilot defence data exercise. From 2005 to 2015, although in nominal terms defence expenditure increased by 3.6% from EUR 193 billion to EUR 200 billion, in real terms there was a 10.7% or EUR 22 billion decrease. Counting from the peak of expenditure reached in 2007 with the EDA Member States collectively spending EUR 204 billion on defence to the lowest point of EUR 190 billion in 2013, total defence spending reduced by 6.8% (EUR 14 billion) in nominal terms or by nearly 12% (EUR 24 billion) in real terms. The share of defence expenditure in GDP4 and in total government spending being as high as 1.81% and 3.86% in 2005, has been steadily decreasing since then, and in 2015, it is estimated to have dropped to the lowest recorded level of 1.40% and 2.95%, respectively.   Operation and maintenance expenditure further increased, while investment further decreased As regards defence expenditure structure, the year 2014 further highlighted the trend that began to emerge back in 2011, namely that of increasing expenditure on operation and maintenance and decreasing investment. Operation and maintenance - the second largest component of total defence spend with the average share of 23% – appears to be on an upward trajectory as of 2011. During the years 2011 to 2013, it grew at an average annual rate of 2.3%, and in 2014, it jumped by 11.7% (9.8% real increase) to EUR 52.2 billion, the highest absolute and relative (26.8% of total expenditure) value since 2006. Overall, operation and maintenance expenditure increased in real terms by EUR 4.6 billion or 10.3% from 2006 to 2014. By contrast, defence investment, comprising equipment procurement and R&D (including R&T), continues to decline – a trend that started with a sharp 11.6% real decrease in 2011 and was reinforced with another significant real fall of 9.1% in 2014. Given a relatively small volume of R&D expenditure, this result was largely driven by another component of investment – equipment procurement – which in 2014 dropped by EUR 4.3 billion or 15.0%, compared to the previous year, the largest real decrease since 2006. R&D expenditure that has been declining as well, appears to be on an upward trend since 2012. In 2013, it achieved a 1.5% increase, and in 2014, it jumped by another 16.0% to EUR 8.8 billion, the biggest nominal increase observed so far. A real increase was slightly smaller, 0.8% in 2013 and 14.1% in 2014. From 2006 to 2014, R&D expenditure decreased by almost EUR 2 billion or 18.5% in real terms. The share of investment in total defence expenditure, traditionally accounting for around 20%, shrank in 2014 by almost two percentage points to 17.8%. Within the investment category, the share of equipment procurement, amounting to around 16% on average, reduced by over two percentage points to 13.3%, while the share of R&D increased by 0.5 percentage points to 4.5% between 2013 and 2014. On average, R&D share in total investment stood at around 4.3% between 2006 and 2014, with the highest value of 4.9% reached in 2006, and the lowest – 3.9% – in 2012. Personnel expenditure remains the largest component accounting for slightly above half – 51.2% – of total defence spend. Despite decreasing personnel numbers, personnel expenditure increased in some countries. At the aggregate EDA level, personnel expenditure has been gradually decreasing since 2006, but in 2014, it increased by 4.1% (2.4% real increase) to EUR 99.8 billion. During the entire period from 2006 to 2014, Member States’ real expenses dedicated to personnel reduced by over EUR 19 billion or almost 17%.   Defence R&T expenditure at its lowest level A slight increase (+3.2%) in R&T expenditure achieved in 2013, was lost the year after, as R&T spending dropped by 4.6% (-6.1% in real terms) back to 2012 level of EUR 2.0 billion, the lowest since 2006. R&T expenditure was highest in 2006 amounting to EUR 2.7 billion – the expected response to the ambitious goal set by the EU leaders at the Hampton Court summit in 2005 to achieve a paradigm shift in defence R&T by spending more and spending more together. However, it has been gradually decreasing since then, despite the repeated urge to invest in defence R&T now to have effective and credible defence capabilities in the future. A real-term decrease in R&T expenditure was rather dramatic, amounting to nearly EUR 1 billion or 32% from 2006 to 2014. The share of R&T in total defence spend has been gradually shrinking as well, from the biggest of 1.32% in 2006, to the smallest of 1.02% in 2014.   Collaboration increased in equipment procurement and European defence R&T5 Since 2012, it has not been possible to have a comprehensive picture of the total Member States’ expenditure on collaborative (including European collaboration) defence equipment procurement and R&T projects and programmes, as several Member States were not in a position to provide this data. Nevertheless, although incomplete, 2014 data suggests slight improvements on three out of four collaborative expenditure categories, namely collaborative and European collaborative defence equipment procurement and European collaborative defence R&T. Collaborative defence equipment procurement of the reporting EDA Member States increased by almost EUR 1 billion or 20.5%, compared to 2013, to EUR 5.7 billion. The share of European collaboration within this category increased in absolute terms – from EUR 4.5 billion to EUR 5.1 billion – but decreased in relative terms – from 94.6% to 89.8% of total collaborative procurement – during the same period. In relation to total defence equipment procurement expenditure, the share of collaborative equipment procurement increased from 15.9% to 22.1%, suggesting that the remaining 77.9% were directed to non-collaborative procurements. The share of European collaborative equipment procurement in total defence equipment procurement grew from 15.0% to 19.9%, an achievement of almost five percentage points with respect to the corresponding benchmark. As regards R&T, total collaborative defence R&T expenditure of the reporting Member States decreased by EUR 18.6 million or 9.2% to EUR 185 million from 2013 to 2014, while European collaboration part within this category increased in both absolute – from EUR 168 million to EUR 172 million – and relative – from 82.5% to 93.3% of total collaborative R&T – terms. In relation to total defence R&T, the share of collaborative R&T decreased from 9.7% to 9.3%, indicating that 90.7% were non-collaborative expenditure. Meanwhile, the share of European collaborative R&T in total defence R&T increased from 8.0% to 8.6% during the same period, signalling a minor progress in terms of the respective benchmark.   Defence personnel decline slowed down Since 2006, defence personnel (military and civilian) has been steadily declining, mainly due to internal restructuring processes. Between 2008 and 2011, this was more evident (-4.9% annual average decrease), possibly due to unfavourable economic conditions. Thereafter personnel numbers continued to fall, thought at a slower pace, a rate of -1.7% per year on average. From 2013 to 2014, total civilian personnel reduced by almost 2% to 400,000, whereas military personnel - by half that (almost 1%) to 1,423,000. During the entire period from 2006 to 2014, total defence personnel shrank by almost 500,000 or 21.4%, where civilian personnel decreased by almost 85,000 or 17.5%, and military personnel – by almost 411,000 or 22.4%. As total military personnel decreased, so did the numbers in each military personnel breakdown category. During the 2006-2014 period, Army reduced by 209,000 or 22.5% to 720,000, Maritime – by 36,000 or 16.0% to 191,000, Air Force – by 96,000 or 28.4% to 241,000, and military personnel not assigned to any of the above categories and nominated as “Other” – by 72,000 or 21.3% to 268,000. In relative terms, the shares of military personnel categories remained to a greater or lesser extent stable, with Army accounting for 52%, Maritime – for 13%, Air Force – for 18%, and Other – for 17% of the total military personnel, on average. Investment (equipment procurement and R&D) per military has been increasing since 2006 (except in 2011) – a growth caused more by decreasing military personnel numbers, than increasing Member States’ investment – but the last two years witnessed a decline resulting from faster diminishing overall investment. In 2014, investment per military stood at around EUR 24,000, a 6.8% reduction on the 2013 figure of EUR 26,000.   Deployment figures noticeably decreased The average number of troops deployed outside the European Union territory decreased by almost 46%, from 58,000 in 2013 to 32,000 in 2014, mainly due to disbanded ISAF6  security mission at the end of 2014 and withdrawal of participating Member States’ troops from Afghanistan. In relation to the overall strength of the 27 Member States’ military personnel, the share of deployed troops almost halved, from 4.0% in 2013 to 2.2% in 2014. During the period from 2006, when deployment figures were the highest, to 2014, the average number of troops deployed decreased by over 62% in absolute terms, and from 4.6% to 2.2% in relation to the total military personnel. Total number of deployable (land) and sustainable (land) forces also decreased between 2013 and 2014 by over 13% and over 28%, respectively. In 2014, the 27 EDA Member States had in total 417,000 deployable (land) forces and 79,000 sustainable (land) forces, both numbers being the smallest since 2006. The ratio between the sustainable and a pool of deployable forces, which remained virtually stable during 2006-2013 at around 1:4, in 2014, equalled to 1:5. After a five-year-long upward trend, costs of deployed operations decreased for the third year in a row, both in absolute terms and as a share of total defence expenditure. It reduced by over 25%, from EUR 7.4 billion (3.9% of total expenditure) in 2013 to EUR 5.6 billion (2.9%) in 2014, the lowest value and share since 2006, which is again largely a result of withdrawing Member States’ combat troops from Afghanistan. Operations costs per military deployed followed the same pattern in 2012 and 2013, but it increased in 2014 by almost 38% to EUR 176,000. This may signal that deployments become increasingly expensive, and, in the case of some Member States, can be explained by the fact that countries continue contributing to international operations financially, without sending actual troops.   Slight progress recorded on two out of four collective benchmarks In 2007, EDA Member States agreed on a set of four collective benchmarks for investment. There is no obligation in terms of timelines or translation of these benchmarks into national targets. Since 2012, due to incomplete collaborative data it is no longer possible to accurately measure progress towards two out of the four agreed benchmarks, namely European collaborative equipment procurement as a percentage of total equipment procurement (benchmark 2: 35%) and European collaborative defence R&T as a percentage of total defence R&T (benchmark 4: 20%). Nevertheless, the partial data suggests a slight increase in European collaboration in both equipment procurement (from 15.0% in 2013 to 19.9% in 2014) and R&T (from 8.0% in 2013 to 8.6% in 2014) among those countries that reported the data. With regard to the benchmark 1 – defence equipment procurement and R&T (investment) as a percentage of total defence expenditure – the trend has been mixed. Since 2006, it has been slowly but steadily increasing, but after reaching its maximum of 21.9% in 2010, it appears to be on a decline. It stayed above the 20% benchmark from 2007 to 2012, except in 2011, but in 2014, it dropped to the lowest recorded level of 17.8%. As for the benchmark 3, defence R&T expenditure as a percentage of total defence expenditure has been steadily declining since 2006, except in 2011 and 2013, when it slightly increased. In 2014, it dropped to the lowest level so far of 1.02%, which is barely above half of the 2% benchmark.   More information: Download the 2014 Defence Data booklet Footnotes 1. During the 2014 Defence Data gathering round, Member States were asked to provide not only the actual defence expenditure of the previous year (i.e. 2014), but also the estimated defence expenditure of the current year (i.e. 2015). At the aggregate level, however, these estimates are only available for total defence expenditure. At the same time, a major effort has been undertaken by EDA to revise all the previous years’ data, including 2005 data collected as part of the pilot exercise, to ensure the best achievable data accuracy and comparability across Member States and over time. Consequentially, numerous figures have been revised. 2. Data in this publication do not include Denmark, which is not an EDA Member State. 2005 data do not include Bulgaria and Romania, which joined EDA in 2007. 2006–2012 data do not include Croatia, which joined EDA in 2013. 3. In order to measure real growth and ensure a “real” comparison over years, inflation needs to be taken into account. Thus, data from 2005 to 2015 has been adjusted to 2010 economic conditions (Source of deflator: European Commission, DG ECFIN, based on the weight of the EU-28). 4. As of 2014, reduced defence expenditure shares in relation to GDP in most Member States can partially be explained by the new GDP accounting methodology implemented by Eurostat, following the introduction of the new European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010). 5. All 2012-2014 figures on collaboration are partial, as several Member States were not in a position to provide the data. 6. The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was a NATO-led security mission in Afghanistan, established by the United Nations Security Council in December 2001 by Resolution 1386, as envisaged by the Bonn Agreement.  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/06/07/aggregated-defence-data-2014-and-2015-(estimated)
EDA_NEWS_0430	2016-06-03	NEWS	Energetic materials: new research project launched	 Four EDA participating Member States - Sweden, Germany, Czech Republic, The Netherlands - as well as Norway have agreed to develop a joint project to enhance the European capabilities in the area of energetic materials.   Energetic materials are a class of material with high amount of stored chemical energy that can be released. These materials are commonly used in military applications, such as explosives, pyrotechnic compositions, propellants and fuels. The new research project builds on acquired expertise from the previous EDA Formulation and Production of New Energetic Materials (FPNEM) project in the framework of the Agency’s capability technology group dealing with ammunition technologies (CapTech AMMO). Under the lead of Sweden, experts will develop mutual awareness and knowledge of selected future energetic materials, production methods for critical components including raw materials, and small scale evaluation methods. The project was named Energetic Materials towards an Enhanced European Capability (EMTEEC) and kicked-off during a meeting at the Swedish Defence Research Agency on 19/20 May; it will run over 4 years. France also participated in the kick-off meeting as an observer as discussions about the country joining the project are ongoing.   More information: Project page: Research & Technology European Network of National Authorities on Ammunition (ENNSA) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/06/03/energetic-materials-new-research-project-launched
EDA_NEWS_0431	2016-06-03	NEWS	EDA workshop on ammunition technologies held in Utrecht	 Around 30 experts from EU Member States and defence research institutes as well as industry representatives participated in an EDA workshop on ammunition technologies which was hosted by The Netherlands in Utrecht (25/26 May). Over two days, participants discussed topics relating to energetic materials and missiles & munitions technologies as well as the possibility to launch common R&T activities on areas like 3D printing of energetic materials, extended range munitions and open architecture for missiles and munitions. Participants also had the opportunity to visit the laboratories of The Netherlands’ Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) where energetic materials and materials’ resistance to projectiles and blasts are tested and developed. The operational conclusions of the workshop will be further developed in the remit of the EDA CapTech “Ammunition Technologies”.   More information: Research & Technoloy European Network of National Authorities on Ammunition (ENNSA) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/06/03/eda-workshop-on-ammunition-technologies-held-in-utrecht
EDA_NEWS_0432	2016-05-26	NEWS	Multi-ship, format flying at the core of airlift tactics course in France	 The second European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course (EAATTC 16-2) of 2016, sponsored by the twenty Nation European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) Partnership, started on 22 May with the  arrival of six aircraft and six crews from France, Germany and Spain at the French Bricy Airbase near Orleans in France.  The course will run for two weeks and will take the already combat ready crews to the next level through an intensive round of academic lectures, one-on-one tuition and increasingly complex flying evolutions.  As with previous EAATTC courses, the weeks will focus on a specific aspect of advanced capability. For EAATTC 16-2 hosted by France, the focus will be on multi-ship, formation flying - training to drop both equipment and paratroopers in a simulated high threat environment, from multiple aircraft and in a precisely coordinated manner - accurate to the second and dropping within a very small target area.  This task is very challenging as the course involves three different aircraft types: C-130, C-160 and Casa-235. The complexity of each event builds over the period and by the end of the second week the crew commanders will be required to lead a full formation, at low level, evading enemy fighters and numerous simulated ground threat from small arms, hand-held missiles and more elaborate anti-aircraft systems. The third course for 2016 will run in Bulgaria from  31 July to 12 August.

EDA_NEWS_0433	2016-05-31	NEWS	Military Single European Sky community meets at EDA	 On 31 May, high-level representatives and experts from the Member States, EUMC and EUMS Staff, NATO Allies and Officials of the European Commission (DG MOVE), SJU, SDM, EASA, NATO and EUROCONTROL met at the European Defence Agency for the 8th edition of the SES/SESAR Military Implementation Forum. The meeting was followed by the first EDA Single European Sky Military Aviation Board (ESMAB) policy level meeting. The aim of this year’s Forum was to share with a wider audience, in an informal setting, the main strategic issues with regard to Single European Sky. The meeting was chaired by General Fernando de la Cruz Caravaca of the Spanish Air Force. Mr. Umberto Rossi of the European Commission replacing Mr. Henrik Hololei, Director General Mobility and Transport, opened the discussion on the challenges and opportunities for civil-military cooperation deriving from the EU Aviation Strategy and civil rulemaking activities in the framework of Single European Sky. The Chairman of the EU Military Committee General Mikhail Kostarakos then provided the vision of the EU Chiefs of Defence on SES/SESAR in the wider context of military aviation. Finally, Vice Admiral Ignacio Horcada focused on NATO C2 needs in the wider context of Single European Sky. The discussion provided for relevant exchanges on innovative technologies to be considered in SESAR, taking into account global trends in civil and military aviation. “The SMIF is a key opportunity for European air forces to come to a common understanding of key priority areas of the Single European Sky. Today also underlined the importance of a broad consultation and coordination between the European and Allied defence community as well as civil aviation. The SMIF reconfirms EDA’s commitment to the three-step consultation process with EUROCONTROL and NATO, to serve the need of Member States”, said Jorge Domecq. The first EDA Single European Sky Military Aviation Board (ESMAB) policy level meeting then brought together representatives from the participating Member States, as well as Denmark, Norway and Switzerland, and a representative from EUMC. Experts collectively agreed on priorities with regard to the upcoming milestones for Single European Sky in the broader context of military aviation and to ensure the necessary national involvement up to the appropriate decision-making level. Concretely, experts discussed and validated among other things the SES Military Aviation Action Plan and the roadmap on Performance Based Navigation.   More information: EDA in Single European Sky project page 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/05/31/military-single-european-sky-community-meets-at-eda
EDA_NEWS_0434	2016-05-24	NEWS	Personnel Recovery: A strong safety net for deployed personnel	 Ensuring swift and safe recovery of personnel isolated, missing, detained or captured in a hostile territory has become a high-priority component of all EU-led Crisis Management Operations. Through its dedicated “Project Team Personnel Recovery”, the European Defence Agency (EDA) actively supports its participating Member States to enhance Personnel Recovery capabilities and improve interoperability - with tangible results.   The article below appeared in the 10th edition of European Defence Matters, the EDA’s official magazine, which you can read by clicking here.   European Defence Matters, Magazine issue 10 Any Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) military operation or civilian mission carries the risk of deployed personnel being trapped, isolated, captured and/or maltreated by enemy forces. If it occurs, such an incident can have an adverse impact not only the operation’s security but also the troops’ morale as well as general public support. It is therefore imperative to ensure the effective and quick recovery and reintegration of isolated personnel. In this regard, all possible diplomatic, civil and military options should be combined and utilised. “Keeping personnel recovery high on the EU’s agenda conveys the right signal to our soldiers on the ground”, EDA’s Capability, Armament & Technology Director, Air Commodore Peter Round stressed. He further stated that “It is our responsibility to make sure that robust and effective personnel recovery capabilities and tools are in place and available, as an integral part of any deployment”. Since 2007 EDA’s Project Team Personnel Recovery (PT PR) has been working in support of its participating Member States (pMS) in order to enhance their Personnel Recovery (PR) capabilities and to effectively address these challenges. Under the German chairmanship and with the active participation of its 14 pMS, the PT has delivered tangible results and valuable studies. In its activities the PT is also supported by the European External Action Service’s bodies; the European Union Military Staff and the Crisis Management and Planning Directorate as well as of the newly established European Personnel Recovery Centre (EPRC), a close partner of the Agency. As CSDP Crisis Management Operations (CMO) involve many different Member States, Third States and other partner Organisations there is a growing need for ensuring common PR principles, practices, standards and capabilities that are interoperable. As Major Constantinos Hadjisavvas, EDA’s Project Officer on PR, underlines “developing a common personnel recovery culture supported by the relevant capabilities is vital in ensuring that an effective safety net is in place for those in need in the theatre of operations”.  From conceptual framework to operational PR support Personnel recovery is a complex process involving five main tasks: reporting, locating, supporting, recovering, and reintegrating. The first task, reporting, includes the recognition and notification that personnel have or may have become isolated. This information can be generated by an accountability mechanism, visual sightings, intelligence, and reconnaissance or even through direct contact with the isolated personnel themselves. The second step, the locating task, includes actions to find and geo-locate the isolated personnel, immediately followed by the supporting task aimed at providing them with mental, physical and emotional support. It is only once these essential preparatory steps have been taken that the core part of any PR mission, the actual physical recovery, can be launched. PR operations are finally concluded with the reintegrating task of the recovered personnel through medical assessments and debriefings before returning them back to duty and/or their families. Situational awareness, information management, command and control aspects as well as appropriate capabilities are thus absolutely crucial for any successful PR operation. However, as Major Hadjisavvas stresses, “even with the most cutting-edge technology, personnel recovery cannot be successful unless you have trained and motivated personnel”. Working on four different but interrelated work strands (Concept, Command & Control, Equipment and Training), the PT aims at addressing the full spectrum of PR; from the cultural and conceptual context through training aspects to the development of advanced technologies.  PR FAS ATD: an operational output of EDA PR provides the capability to safely recover isolated personnel. However, it was identified that an operational technical solution to plan, launch and monitor personnel recovery missions was missing. To close this critical gap, EDA has developed a conceptual framework which led to the successful development of the Personnel Recovery Functional Area Service Advanced Technology Demonstrator (PR FAS ATD), one of the most important operational outputs of PT PR so far. This ATD is an information management and Command & Control (C2) system designed to increase the efficiency of PR missions and operations. In fact, PR FAS ATD supports planners and controllers with numerous functionalities and a significantly improved situational awareness. The system is portable and works on a ‘plug and play’ basis, so it can be used by directly connecting to a number of laptops or integrating into existing networks in command posts or headquarters. Significantly, the ATD does not need any additional client software due to access via internet browser. This minimises the rollout effort and increases Information Technology (IT) security. The demonstrator was successfully evaluated and tested during multinational courses in 2015. In mid-2016, an important milestone was reached when PR FAS ATD was finally distributed to all pMS. They can now use the tool as a web based and stand-alone system during national or multinational trainings and exercises.  Deployment Support, Training, New Projects At this stage, the PR FAS ATD is still only a demonstrator, albeit an advanced demonstrator. In order to achieve operational capability additional organisational and technical measures have to be taken. Most important tasks include interfacing existing air command and control systems as well as the provision of service support. EDA is leading these tasks by providing deployment support to pMS, addressing the various aspects of the through-life management of the tool and ensuring its viability. Furthermore, the Personnel Recovery Controller and Planner Courses (PRCPC), run by the six contributing Member States (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, The Netherlands, Sweden) as an EDA project ensures that trained personnel are available to support any future PR activities under CSDP. Seven editions of PRCPCs have taken place so far, the most recent in April at the EPRC in Poggio Renatico Air Base (Italy). Additionally, by the end of 2016, pMS will also obtain a web-based e-learning tool for Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE), based on the existing Swedish e-training tool. The SERE project aims to provide pMS with PR training for their military personnel before being deployed. Instead of developing a new tool, EDA was authorised by the Swedish Armed Forces to translate the Swedish tool into English and disseminate it to all pMS. “SERE is a model of how pooling & sharing of assets and best practices can save time, resources and money”, Major Hadjisavvas explains. This tool could also be useful for the personnel deployed in the context of CSDP civilian or other humanitarian missions. Way Ahead The need for enhancing interoperability of European Armed Forces’ PR capabilities will be further enhanced by the increasing multinational character of CSDP operations and the volatile environment that the EU is operating in. Topics currently under consideration in the EDA to further advance this important work includes among others, the contribution to the possible revision of the EU’s conceptual framework for PR in support of CSDP and enhancing the PR efficiency with the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) support. Finally in November 2016 the Agency in cooperation with the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) will organise a PR Conference in order to enhance awareness of the importance of PR in saving lives and protecting the EU’s reputation. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/05/24/personnel-recovery-a-strong-safety-net-for-deployed-personnel

EDA_NEWS_0438	2016-05-12	NEWS	4th ENNSA Ammunition Safety Workshop in Switzerland	 Twenty-three experts from nine countries have recently gathered in Bern, Switzerland, for the fourth edition of the Ammunition Safety Workshop organised by the European Defence Agency (EDA). The primary objective of the event, which took place at the Armasuisse Test Centre in Thun, was to give Ammunition safety experts the floor to discuss results from a European ammunition safety test (Round Robin Test) and to provide an overview of the military test centre capabilities. Thanks to the fruitful expert discussions at the laboratories and test ranges, the workshop delivered tangible results to participants and contributed to the further harmonisation of ammunition safety test procedures. Furthermore, even the first test results of the Round Robin test demonstrated the importance of EU T&E networking, since all tests could only be performed in a collaborative approach.   More information European Network of National Safety Authorities for Ammunition (ENNSA) Defence Test and Evaluation Base (DTEB) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/05/12/4th-ennsa-ammunition-safety-workshop-in-switzerland
EDA_NEWS_0439	2016-05-18	NEWS	"""Defence cooperation is only way to retain military capabilities"""	 For its 10th edition which is now available, European Defence Matters, the EDA's official magazine, spoke with Dutch Minister of Defence Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert about the defence-related objectives of the current Dutch EU Presidency, the upcoming EU Global Strategy as well as the importance of European defence cooperation.   European Defence Matters, Magazine issue 10 Minister, one of your goals during the Dutch EU Presidency is to give a fresh boost to defence cooperation. What achievements do you strive for during the EU Presidency? Defence cooperation is not the easy way but it is the only way, if we want to retain our military capabilities, especially the high end capabilities. Cooperation demands a continuous and active pursuit of possibilities for cooperation and requires a persistent and determined mindset to become successful. The Netherlands would like to lead by example when it comes to defence cooperation. There are several examples of successful cooperation initiatives, like the France-UK cooperation under the Lancaster House Treaties, the Visegrad 4, NorDefCo and the Baltic Defence Cooperation, but I still think that we need more and closer cooperation. We should go beyond the obvious cooperation areas such as training, logistics and education. Joint training is a good start, but we have to go further. We should use small scale cooperation that works and build on those. The defence cooperation between Germany and The Netherlands could be used as an example. We are integrating a German tank battalion into a Dutch mechanized brigade, which itself will become part of a German armoured Division. This allows us to maintain our ability to fight with and against tank units, since we no longer have that capability ourselves. Another example is the long standing maritime cooperation between Belgium and the Netherlands, which has been developed to a high level. The cooperation between the BENELUX-countries in protecting their airspace is another promising example. During our EU Presidency I try to promote all these types of European cooperation where I can. And let’s not forget that these cooperation initiatives, be it for operational purposes or joint capability development, also need some kind of political framework and strategic guidance. This is why I attach so much value to the EU Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy which should be presented by HR/VP Mogherini in June. And I strongly believe that this new strategy should immediately be translated into actionable proposals to strengthen European defence cooperation. A ‘White Book like document’ should describe the CSDP-related tasks and means we need to execute the Global Strategy. It should give us a clear picture of which military capabilities we need the most and so guide our future cooperation efforts.   You mentioned the follow-up document to the Global Strategy, a ‘White Book like document’ as you call it. In your view, what should be its main elements? We see the Global Strategy, a possible ‘White Book like document’ and finally the European Defence Action Plan as three closely related documents. Essential elements for a ‘White Book like document’ are a clear military level of ambition in line with the Strategy, a description on the capability shortfalls and a proposal for a follow-up mechanism to monitor the progress at the political level.   The Netherlands are a forerunner in terms of defence cooperation. Your country has a history of successful cooperation with Belgium and Luxembourg for example. The latest example is the conclusion of far-reaching cooperation agreements with Germany. What are the lessons learnt? We have learned that for cooperation to be successful, partners should start as early as possible in the capability development process to identify shared interests. It is easier to find common ground when all options are still open. We have experienced that extending the scope of cooperation beyond the purchase of equipment into operations, maintenance and organization helps too. Requirements become more aligned and the relationship for the long term is bound to contribute to successful cooperation. Finally, it is important to have support at all levels. After all, it is a matter of commitment and trust. This is why the political level, the policy level and the executive level should all be involved.   But you are also active in many multinational programmes through EDA. What type of cooperation do you think gets most out of taxpayers' money? As an ideal, the taxpayers’ money would be best spent when a programme is aimed at addressing a shortfall at the European level, which corresponds to the national needs of a large number of Member States. A good example of such a combination of goals is the European Air Transport Command at Eindhoven. Furthermore, taxpayers are, in the long run, best served by a well-functioning European Defence market and a strong European industrial base which are not hampered by barriers. If the market functions well, we are more capable of developing innovative, high-end military capabilities in Europe. I think this would benefit the taxpayer, but more importantly, it benefits our armed forces.   To what extent has the Dutch defence industry benefitted from the country’s cooperative approach? The Dutch defence industry consists mostly of medium and small enterprises that offer high quality contributions to capability development. However, our cooperative approach does not automatically benefit our own national industry. We see that the defence industry in Europe is subject to national considerations. For SMEs especially, it therefore remains difficult to gain cross border access to defence and security contracts, even within the framework of cooperative programs. The result is that the competitive and innovative power of our European defence industry does not reach its full potential, something which we cannot afford if we really want to gain a degree of strategic autonomy in this market.   If you look at the upcoming Preparatory Action on defence research and the Commission’s Defence Action Plan: how do you see these two major initiatives develop? Will they be a game-changer for the sector? The Preparatory Action, as part of the European Commission Action Plan, will certainly be a game changer, if it succeeds in preparing the way for a dedicated European defence research programme. First of all, this initiative shows that the European Commission is involved and committed to strengthen European defence. Secondly, investing in R&T makes it more attractive for the defence industry to focus on non-dual use technology, being commercially less attractive, but essential nonetheless. Thirdly, the Preparatory Action and the subsequent dedicated research programme will serve as an incentive for joint capability development further down the line, when R&T efforts are used to develop real capabilities.   Biography Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert is Minister of Defence in the Dutch government since November 2012. Previously, she worked for the Directorate-General for Enlargement of the European Commission in Brussels as well as in Riga, Latvia. She was a Member of the European Parliament for the VVD (People's Party for Freedom and Democracy) from 2004-2010. In June 2010, she was elected to the Dutch House of Representatives.  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/05/18/defence-cooperation-is-only-way-to-retain-military-capabilities
EDA_NEWS_0440	2016-05-18	NEWS	Successful seminar on EU funding opportunities in Cyprus	" The Minister of Defence of the Republic of Cyprus, Mr Christoforos Fokaides and the Deputy Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency (EDA), Mr Rini Goos, addressed today the Cypriot security and defence stakeholders at a seminar targeting EU funding opportunities. The event in Nicosia was co-organised by EDA and the Ministry of Defence. More than 100 representatives from the Ministry of Defence, National Guard, industry, universities, research and technology organisations, and business associations participated in the seminar which included know-how building and in-depth coaching sessions. Experts from national authorities involved in the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) deployment in Cyprus have also attended the seminar. Minister Fokaides said at the opening, ""The seminar organised today in Cyprus seals in the most vivid manner the excellent collaboration of the European Defence Agency and the Cyprus Ministry of Defence. A collaboration which unfolds benefits for the Cypriot academia, SME’s, and the broader public and private sector. The pre-selection of the two projects recently submitted from Cyprus, out of 142 in total, serves as a solid proof which can only make us optimistic about future prospects. We want to facilitate Cypriot stakeholders to seize cooperative opportunities, to explore synergies, to open new avenues for SME’s creating new jobs. The seminar showed how to access the various funding and other instruments within main European Union funding programmes running until 2020, including ESIF, COSME (EU Programme for COmpetitiveness of SMEs), Horizon 2020 and SESAR. A particular focus was dedicated to dual-use R&T funding and Enterprise Europe Network free-of-charge services. Ways to participate in EDA networks and groups of experts was addressed as well. The seminar raised interest across all attending stakeholders, who established promising contacts in view of an effective follow-up aimed at accessing EU funding opportunities. On the occasion of his presence in Cyprus, EDA Deputy Chief Executive Rini Goos participated in a round-table discussion with high-level officials coming from the Ministry of Defence, Armed Forces, police, and other ministries and also from academia and the research community of Cyprus. The main objective was to raise awareness on EDA’s mission as well as concrete lines of work. Taking account of the increasing blurred lines between internal and external security on the one hand and civil and defence technology on the other, different stakeholders in Cyprus exchanged views with Mr Goos on how to take advantage of EDA’s benefits through close cooperation with the Ministry of Defence in order to promote civil/military synergies when appropriate.   More information: Access to EU funding "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/05/18/successful-seminar-on-eu-funding-opportunities-in-cyprus
EDA_NEWS_0441	2016-05-04	NEWS	EDA launches market survey on Camp Management Services	 Since the creation of the European Defence Agency in 2004, support to the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and to EU operations has been one of EDA's core missions. Several activities are now ongoing to develop the support of CSDP military and civilian operations or missions as well as EU Battlegroups at the request of Member States. 2016. Typically, CSDP operations and missions are deployed on short notice to manage crisis in remote areas. In some cases, shortfalls on assets and equipment arising from the force generation have led to outsourcing some key services. This has been the case for camp management services for several CSDP missions and operations2016. In order to better understand the range of commercially available solutions which could fulfil possible future requirements for camp management services and associated risks or limitations, EDA is conducting a market survey. It has to be highlighted that the objective of this survey is to identify service providers of ‘turnkey’ solutions and not manufacturers of assets or supply providers. Operators are kindly invited to participate in the survey by submitting their answer by 15 June 2016.

EDA_NEWS_0445	2016-05-03	NEWS	The next industrial (r)evolution: What implications for the security and defence sector?	 The following article is part of a comprehensive dossier focused on new trends related to European defence innovation and R&T which appeared in the 10th edition of European Defence Matters, the EDA’s official magazine, which is available now. European Defence Matters, Magazine issue 10 In times of ever faster technological change and constant emergence of new innovation and business models, the European defence sector has to adapt quickly if it wants to remain relevant. In 2016, more than ever, Europe needs to respond to short and longer-term security challenges both on its territory and beyond. The forthcoming EU Global Strategy will inevitably consider those developments, setting out European interests. Notably, for Europe’s security and defence sector this means preparing for an age of relative uncertainty that is prone to strategic surprises: at the level of threats that have become increasingly diverse, hybrid and versatile; and at the level of emerging technologies that, beyond inducing new vulnerabilities, may well require the defence sector to adapt to changing innovation patterns, new mind-sets and corporate cultures. In this strategic context, an innovative and competitive European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) is a strategic asset that supports the implementation of a credible and effective EU Global Strategy. “The industrial and technological dimension is not a mere enabler, it is at the core of any security and defence-related capability”, says Jorge Domecq, the Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency (EDA). This is why the so-called ‘Key Strategic Activities‘, be they specific technologies, skills or industrial manufacturing capabilities, will also have to be supported at the EU level if Europe wants to retain the necessary freedom of action, be interoperable with key Allies, and participate in global standard setting. As early as 2003, the Thessaloniki European Council underlined that the EDA was to aim at “promoting, in liaison with the Community’s research activities where appropriate, research aimed at leadership in strategic technologies for future defence and security capabilities, thereby strengthening Europe’s industrial potential in this domain.” Today, the question of how to achieve or safeguard leadership in strategic technologies is more pressing than ever. EDA has enabled close to € 700 million of investment in defence R&T projects, it has established synergies with the EU’s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, and it has participated in the identification of critical defence technologies, key enabling technologies and space technologies for European non-dependence. And there is more to come: the preparation of the forthcoming Preparatory Action for CSDP-related research and potential defence research programme that may follow within the next EU budgetary cycle may signal a paradigm shift. EDA is playing its part by shaping the content, setting priorities and preparing for the implementation of future defence-related research at the EU level. The European Defence Action Plan announced by the European Commission for the end of 2016 provides a further opportunity to reflect on how Europe will capture future innovation and drive leap-ahead technologies rather than be taken by surprise by disruptive technologies emerging elsewhere. Changing innovation patterns? For Europe to successfully spearhead innovation, it has to deal with at least four accelerating trends: (i) global competition for the lead in technology; (ii) emerging knowledge domains and technology convergence; (iii) increasingly faster innovation loops; and (iv) the growing importance of private investment in support of innovation. Each of these factors taken alone may hardly seem revolutionary, yet any combination and convergence of them in a fast-paced environment may prove to be so. The defence industrial and technological base is indeed part of a wider industrial and technological ‘ecosystem’ that is about to change dramatically, and this may lead to the disruption and far-reaching adaptation of public policy and traditional business models and practices. What has been qualified as a possible ‘third industrial revolution‘ by 2030 is characterised by an ever-accelerating speed of technological change and the ‘digitalisation of world markets’. The mastery, application and development of digital technologies and big data management will be a key ingredient of economic and industrial competitiveness. Already today US digital exports are estimated at € 500 billion a year, and Europe is the main customer. 4% of US GDP is estimated to be related to the Internet and associated business opportunities. Global revenues related to the ‘Internet of things‘ (big data and data-mining, cloud computing and super computers) are estimated in the order of USD 14 trillion between 2013 to 2022. ICT technology in particular will help to catalyse innovative applications in the area of human/machines, human/human and machine/machine interfaces, in addition to the expected convergence of bio-, nano-, and information technologies, robotics, artificial intelligence, materials and energy over the 2025-2050 time horizon. New players are emerging Based on such convergence, disruptive applications are expected to emerge from highly innovative start-ups and fast growing players that are modelled on today’s success of the so-called ‘GAFA‘ (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon…). These players will share important characteristics. R&T spending levels will be high (20% and more of annual turnover). They will embrace a risk culture and have access to venture capital. They will focus on prototyping, test and experiment with ‘rapid prototyping‘, ‘lean start-up‘, ‘minimal viable products‘ and spiral development, all with reduced procurement cycles and manufacturing lead times. From Silicon Valley and ‘Silicon Wadi’ in Israel to Bangalore, “access to finance, R&D investment and flexible and fast development and production are the ingredients of ever-fiercer competition among global innovation centres”, stresses Mr Domecq. The innovation models and philosophy of those commercial companies and start-ups has little in common with a highly regulated sector such as defence, which is characterized by the need for reliable, robust and complex systems, long-development cycles, public funding and a focus on quality control through customer engagement in design, production and servicing. Yet, it is with these emerging players that both governments and defence companies will have to interact to stay ahead. Beyond defence-specific R&T, there will be increasing spin-in from commercial technologies being developed by highly specialised SMEs or start-ups. Today, such companies may not even be thinking of interacting with the defence sector. Connected technologies will be among the most decisive factors in the development of security and defence-related technologies. “Robotics, automation, supercomputing, synthetic biology, data analytics and deep learning will play a growing role”, according to Michael Simm, EDA Project Officer. Private actors will bear important responsibilities as to cyber security. This also implies a new way of looking at how drones and robots are networked with the increased integration among human and technological factors. Keeping a highly competitive defence industrial base with highly skilled workers will be all the more crucial if innovation is to translate into cutting-edge defence capabilities. “The key challenge for defence will therefore be to find a modus vivendi with this ‘new economy‘, and to effectively integrate future innovations into defence development and production cycles”, Mr Simm states. It will be key for the defence sector to: (i) gain awareness of emerging leap-ahead technologies; (ii) effectively get access to non-traditional sources of innovation; and (iii) ensure the reliability of trusted supply chains. Overall, the challenge is for governments to be able to counter threats and increase society’s resilience while ensuring that the defence technological and industrial base remains a smart integrator of highly innovative products and technologies. A matter of resources and prioritisation… Innovation does not come for free. The sharp drop in defence-related R&T in recent years puts Europe’s standing at risk: the investment ratios in certain key domains such as electronic components being about 1:15 when compared to the US clearly endanger Europe’s status as a ‘smart follower‘. More investment, more cooperative investment and clear prioritisation in resource allocation are clear answers to that trend. Yet, more than today, an emphasis will also need to be put on ‘whole-of-government approaches‘ and cross-sectorial technological and industrial strategies that strike the right balance and allow for a mutually beneficial relation between the defence and the civilian dimension. Some of the more recently published national defence-related strategy documents indicate a growing awareness and provide inspiration regarding the need for increased foresight activities and refined analysis of innovation cycles; the need to craft industrial policies that are supporting key areas of security of supply with regard to industrial manufacturing capabilities, skills and critical technologies; or the need to launch defence-related innovation initiatives. As the UK Strategic Defence & Security Review (2015) recognises: “… to secure operational advantage and control our costs into the future, we need to recognise and respond quickly to transformative ideas and technologies. These will come from outside the traditional national security field, […] we must find, listen to and work effectively with new partners. We must test unconventional ideas rigorously against traditional ones, and be prepared to take risks […] we do not have all the answers, but continuing with our traditional mindset will not work”. In the case of the UK, this assessment is supported by the creation of a national cross-government Emerging Technology and Innovation Analysis Cell and the establishment of a defence and security accelerator for government to help the private sector turn ideas into innovative equipment and services for national security users. Inn a similar fashion, the US Third Offset Strategy recognises that many of the technologies that are potential game changers are no longer in the domain of DoD development pipelines or traditional defence contractors. Indeed, the DoD risks no longer having exclusive access to neither the most cutting-edge technologies nor the ability to control the development of them. This insight has led US officials to seek proposals from the private sector, including from firms and academic institutions outside the DoD’s traditional orbit. Robotics in particular is seen as an area where commercial investment outpaces military spending. The DoD’s ability to rapidly scout for and import commercial sector innovations and quickly develop new concepts of operation and doctrine is seen to be key. Numerous partnerships between the commercial sector and the US military, research and innovation centres, intelligence and law enforcement agencies exist to date. The creation of a permanent DoD office - called ‘Defence Innovation Unit X‘ - is part of this approach as is investment in promising technologies through a dedicated investment fund. Additionally, in March 2016 the US DoD announced the establishment of a Defense Innovation Advisory Board. The new board aims to enhance the DoD’s culture, organisation and processes by tapping innovators from the private sector. DoD will also further implement its ‘Better Buying Power Initiative‘ aiming, among others, at easing procurement procedures. … but even more of changing mindsets Yet innovation is not a mere matter of resources and stated policy objectives. It ultimately requires both the demand and supply side to have a capacity of early adoption of innovation. As far as the demand side is concerned, the new environment may have an impact on acquisition choices and investment decisions and the defence customer will have to adapt to much higher innovation rates and to potentially shorter life-cycles for equipment. The new environment may increase the need for plug-and-play systems, be a strain on obsolescence management or even change the type and way of procuring defence-related equipment and services. Modular Open System Architectures (MOSA) could be utilised to enable rapid incorporation of innovative upgrades throughout system lifecycles. A stronger focus on prototyping and experimentation may be a corollary to this approach. “The fact that innovation will increasingly flow from the civil to the defence sector does not mean that the defence sector should refrain from heavily investing in exploration, testing, adapting and integrating relevant innovations”, insists Mr Domecq. Prototyping and experimentation can allow the defence sector to keep pace with technology, to partner with industry and maintain critical industrial capabilities. Such efforts would help contextualise current capabilities in light of requirements and technical feasibility of future acquisition programmes. An innovative and adaptive approach may also impact on wider operational concepts, interoperability with partners and standard-setting. “Ultimately, MoDs will have to constantly adapt their in-house skills base and working practices in order to interface with the commercial sector”, explains Mr Simm. MoDs may also have to adapt procurement schemes (i.e. fast-track contracting vehicles), introduce more flexibility, shorten decision-making cycles and address certain perceived ‘costs‘ (i.e. administrative burdens and IPR regimes), which may dissuade high-tech commercial firms from engaging with the defence sector. Regarding the supply side, the change may be less fundamental and rather signal an acceleration of a longer-term trend. For some time now, the most innovative components have been generated by SMEs. While traditional defence companies are likely to continue playing the role of intermediary towards governments, they will nevertheless increasingly rely on the ability to integrate technologies according to a non-linear open innovation model based on a combination of internal and external knowledge, iterative shorter innovation loops and adding reliability and resilience to commercial technologies. This will mean to increasingly monitor cross-domain technology development. The role of a firm’s internal ‘gatekeepers‘ or ‘boundary spanners‘ able to understand and adapt technological innovation will rise. New partnerships, joint ventures For example, with the aim of capitalizing on transformative technologies and business models in the high-tech sector, a big European Group has followed US defence industrial players in establishing a ‘Technology and Business Innovation Center’ in Silicon Valley. In parallel, the company has established a venture capital fund worth an initial US $ 150 million in order to invest in promising, disruptive and innovative businesses generated around the globe. More widely, cooperation with non-traditional industrial players may take the form of partnering with high-tech companies in the ICT sector, joint business incubators or joint ventures according to the ‘make, team or buy‘ paradigm. This may alter the very fabric of industry, leading to more complex supply chain management and, ultimately, requiring increased flexibility and fluid cooperation between primes, SMEs and entrepreneurs across sectors. At the same time, one may have to deal with some side-effects. Indeed, the defence industry could be facing additional pressures on prices and margins, unexpected forms of competition, plus a growing mismatch in skills. Overall, both the demand and supply side, will have to develop a whole new risk culture: on the one hand, taking on more risk through a steady investment in expensive but potentially game-changing technologies; on the other hand, ensuring reliance on fully trusted and secure supply chains up in the context of a globalised and digitalised economy. It may imply changes to how one conceives of dual-use export (and import) control and the protection of sensitive technologies. The predominance of non-European and commercial software companies, clouds and cyber networks that are supposed to generate, manage and control big data may actually increase the vulnerability of European digital networks. The globalisation of R&T and commercial innovation is within the reach of players who can transform them into military relevant capabilities. This risk needs to be counterbalanced by capability development focused on resilience such as ‘rapid network recomposability’ technologies or ‘split fabrication’ (i.e. ICT building blocks that are designed, developed, manufactured in Europe). This is all the more important in the context of heightened hybrid threats, which may target the wider defence supply chain e.g. in terms of hostile takeovers (foreign investment), saturation of production capacities or second-round effect industrial sabotage (compromising single components or production processes). Think big – act smart Some of the aforementioned trends will develop, others may not. Yet, by failing to prepare for a potentially game-changing (r)evolution, one may well be preparing to fail. “When putting its Global Strategy into action, Europe requires a long-term vision and effective technological and industrial policy that supports its freedom of action”, underlines Mr Domecq. As with any other player in the world, Europe needs to acknowledge its industrial base as a strategic and economic asset alike, a cornerstone for safeguarding its influence and interests. This also means injecting the ‘whole-of-government‘ concept with real content, notably in support of guaranteed security of supply and autonomy in areas deemed critical. There is a need for systematic technology foresight, more dual-use innovation clusters and technology incubators and long-term spiral development programmes. As competition for and access to cutting-edge technologies will increasingly be done across globalised and non-defence specific supply chains, both the ‘E‘ (European) and the ‘D‘ (Defence) dimension of the EDTIB may increasingly vanish. “This raises an essential question: how does Europe want to ensure mastery over technologies that will be critical in the future? This is not a question of industrial competitiveness alone but of Europe remaining among the most capable defence players”, insists Mr Domecq. EDA can contribute by raising awareness, being a platform for exchange and building concrete tools when it comes to identifying Key Strategic Activities to be supported by available European funding tools, supporting longer-term security of supply and European non-dependence. On-going work developed inside the EDA together with Member States on critical defence technologies, Technology Watch, strategic research agendas or key skills and competences contribute to this effort. The support provided to innovative dual-use SMEs in accessing European Structural and Investment Funds is a further key work strand. EDA can also further provide a platform for innovative industry to engage with defence stakeholders on concrete projects, to present ideas and to understand defence-specific requirements. In order to move to the next level, however, Member States should also make systematic use of the programmatic, financial and policy instruments offered by the EU. These instruments can support defence research, identify key enabling technologies and support their testing & experimentation in view of potential uptake in defence products. The forthcoming European Defence Action Plan should make a strong plea for a credible defence-related research programme within the next Multiannual Financial Framework. This should be further supported by a wider European Defence Innovation Initiative that facilitates the scouting of emerging technologies for defence, increases interaction between the defence community and commercial communities and promotes innovative SMEs. One will also have to move towards a careful mapping of critical and cross-sector supply chains. Increasing the resilience and security of related key technological and industrial assets that are considered as genuinely critical infrastructure may also be required. As the defence sector will have increasingly to interact with players, processes and innovation models outside the traditional remit of defence, it will be all the more important to mainstream the defence dimension across available industrial policy tools, be they at the national or EU level. 2016 should provide ample opportunity to move ahead in this direction.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/05/03/the-next-industrial-(r)evolution-what-implications-for-the-security-and-defence-sector
EDA_NEWS_0446	2016-04-29	NEWS	EDA Chief Executive completes US visit	 On 29 April Jorge Domecq, the European Defence Agency’s Chief Executive, participated in a CSDP symposium organised by the EU delegation in the US at the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) in Washington, where he spoke on the topic of “Technology, Capabilities and Readiness: The Way Forward”. In his speech - the full text of which is available on the link below – the EDA Chief Executive stressed that “unlike the United States, there is no single European country that is able to develop, acquire and maintain the full suite of military capabilities single-handedly. That is why cooperation is so crucial”. Talking about the need to bring innovation into defence, topic related to the US Third Offset Strategy, he called on the US authorities “to do it working closely with your European partners in order to be a real partnership not only in the doctrinal or operational matters but also in technological and industrial issues”. On this occasion he also held talks with Ambassador Tina Kaidanow, Acting Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs in the US State Department, as well as with Keith B. Webster, Director International Cooperation for the Under Secretary of Defense (USD) for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&L). He also had a meeting with Fred Kempe, President and CEO of the Atlantic Council. On 28 April, Mr Domecq was the central speaker in a round-table dinner organized by the Atlantic Council with the participation of representatives from US defence industries. In his speech, the EDA Chief Executive highlighted the importance of strengthening the European defence capabilities – be it military, technological or industrial – in order to ensure a credible NATO. In this respect, Mr Domecq outlined the essential role of the EDA.

EDA_NEWS_0449	2016-04-29	NEWS	R&T seminar sparks lively debates and new ideas	 The EDA seminar on “Setting priorities for R&T in Europe to prepare the future together” was concluded on 26 April in Amsterdam after two days of inspiring presentations and lively debates. Organised in cooperation with The Netherlands’ Ministry of Defence, under the auspices of the current Netherlands EU Presidency, the conference saw some 150 participants discussing emerging and critical technologies, innovation in defence as well as strategic agenda setting for R&T in Europe. The event was opened on 25 April with key note speeches by The Netherlands’ Vice Chief of Defence, Vice Admiral Rob Bauer, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq, European Commission Deputy Director General Pierre Delsaux (DG GROW) and UK MoD R&T Director and current chairman of the EDA R&T Steering Board, Bryan Wells. Presentations and discussions then followed in three successive panels. Panel 1, “From emerging to critical technologies”, focused on a number of game-changing technologies, as well as on the question of how to find them. In panel 2 “How to innovate in defence?”, participants looked at innovation from various angles. The third panel, “Delivering Europe’s defence research agenda for the future”, was dedicated to the future agenda for R&T in Defence, building on the outcomes of the two previous panels. In his welcome remarks, EDA CE Jorge Domecq warned against the consequences of insufficient R&D investment and European cooperation in times of successive budget cuts. “In the longer term low R&T investment will lead to losing in Europe Defence and industrial capabilities. We can clearly not afford that risk”, he said. Now that defence budgets in many Member States are beginning to increase again, there is a “golden opportunity not only to invest in the here-and-now but also in the capabilities we will need in the future”, he said. Not only does Europe need to invest more in R&T “but it also needs to do so together, that is cooperatively”. Mr Domecq reckoned the upcoming Preparatory Action on defence research and the potential follow-on programme “will create a ‘game changer’ – provided the budgets are significant”. Domecq asked the question if we need to think about a European cooperation regarding technology watching and innovation on a low Technology Readiness Levels (TRL), in a structure he compared to DARPA. The Netherlands’ Vice Chief of Defence, Vice Admiral Rob Bauer, also pleaded for investment in a “European agenda for collaborative R&T”. “Collaborative research leads to collaborative development of cutting-edge technologies. And this leads to less waste of both money and opportunities for collaborative procurement and more interoperability. This is why the Netherlands is in favour of a large comprehensive EU-funded defence research programme”, he stated. European Commission Deputy DG Pierre Delsaux said the Commission’s objective was to make sure the European defence technological and industrial base is “broad, robust, innovative and fit or purpose”. If Europe does not invest in R&T, it won’t be able to cope with the security and defence responsibilities it has, he warned. European defence players need to cooperate more: “Competition should not be between Member States but with the rest of the world”, he said. UK MoD R&T Director Bryan Wells highlighted the change in defence innovation patterns as civil and commercial high tech players have now taken the lead in R&D, including in fields relevant for the military. The scale of civil R&T investment now dwarfs defence-specific research spending; this trend has already given rise to technology areas in which defence relies completely on civil developments. “We have to accept that we will no longer invent the scientific and technology futures – and we should expect to see truly disruptive innovations occurring in unexpected, unfamiliar places”, he said. The three experts panels highlighted the great quality of technological developments in Europe and the impact of emerging technologies on Defence, the need for innovation, collaboration, the importance of the Preparatory Action and its potential follow on Defence research programme and the need for a comprehensive prioritization scheme taking into account the different governance models and funding schemes for Defence R&T in Europe. EDA Deputy Chief Executive Rini Goos closed the conference on 26 April by commending speakers and participants for their “inspiring and active engagement”. The event confirmed that defence-related R&T is important because it underpins the needed future capabilities, he said. “But to do so, it needs adequate funding”, Mr Goos insisted. More information: The Netherlands EU Presidency, together with the EDA, will shortly publish a report summarizing the main findings of the seminar’s three panels. This report will be publicly available and can be obtained on the EDA website from 15 May 2016. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/04/29/r-t-seminar-sparks-lively-debates-and-new-ideas
EDA_NEWS_0450	2016-04-26	NEWS	Polish dual-use R&T project co-funded by ESIF	 Work underway in the European Defence Agency (EDA) and the European Commission to explore dual-use synergies on R&T with the support of existing EU funding instruments has led to a tangible result with the recent announcement that a €2.2 million dual-use research project led by a Polish SME will be co-funded by the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). The Polish project called “Intruder Detection and Avoid System” (IDAAS) aims at developing a sensor-based system helping to avoid collisions between general aviation and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV, or drones). It is the second dual-use research project co-funded under ESIF after a first successful pilot project in Portugal related to technologies for unmanned maritime systems (project TURTLE). Of the total required investment (€2.2 million), ESIF will fund €1.75 million (78,7%). Project holder is EUROTECH, an SME based in Mielec, a town in south-eastern Poland. IDAAS will integrate different types of independent measurement sensors (optoelectronic cameras working in visual range and infrared, acoustic microphones with a big sensitivity, laser scanner, radar) and a complex measurement and calculation module which will communicate directly with on-board or control systems. The fundamental advantage of IDAAS system will be its complete autonomy and independence from other devices and systems. Therefore it will be possible to use it as an independent or a supplementary anti-collision system. The IDAAS project was first selected within EDA’s “1st ESIF process”, issued in December 2012 to obtain EDA technical assistance in finalizing the application dossier under the EU multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2007-2013. Due to a lack of residual ESIF budget at the end of the previous MFF, EDA has kept supporting it for submission within the new multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2014-2020. EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq welcomed the ESIF co-funding and stressed the importance of seeing an SME taking the lead in such an innovative project. “It’s a great success which confirms that there are funding opportunities for defence-related stakeholders available in the EU’s multiannual financial framework running till 2020, especially for SMEs with dual-use projects”, Mr Domecq stated. “The challenge is to ensure that all current and future EU funding schemes or tools are complimentary to Member States’ existing R&T programmes and not seen as a replacement for them”, he added.  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/04/26/polish-dual-use-r-t-project-co-funded-by-esif

EDA_NEWS_0452	2016-04-20	NEWS	Personnel recovery course hosted by European Personnel Recovery Centre	 The seventh edition of the Personnel Recovery Controller and Planner Course (PRCPC), a project initiated and supported by the European Defence Agency (EDA), was held from 4-15 April 2016 at Poggio Renatico Air Base, Italy. The event was hosted for the second time by the European Personnel Recovery Centre (EPRC), a close partner of the Agency. All in all, 19 students from six Member States (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain) benefitted from the knowledge and experience of a cadre of instructors from Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The main focus of the course is to train staff officers in supporting their commanders in Personnel Recovery related issues. The course is designed for personnel who hold personnel recovery positions in tactical operation centres (TOCs), personnel recovery coordination cells (PRCCs) or joint personnel recovery cells (JPRCs). Most of all, the course aims at ensuring that sufficient trained personnel is available to support future PR activities. Personnel Recovery (PR) is a vital element of modern operational planning as it provides a security net for deployed personnel. Most importantly, it boosts morale and acknowledges national as well as European Union responsibilities to effect the recovery and reintegration of isolated personnel deployed in the context of Crisis Management Operations under the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). The next EU PRCPC will take place in Veszprem, Hungary from 30 May to 10 June 2016 and will be organised by the Hungarian Defence Forces. EPRC personnel will support this iteration with instructors. Background The EDA PRCPC project was established on 30 May 2013 as an EDA Category B project under the lead of Sweden. As of today, it includes six contributing EU Member States (cMS): Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands and Sweden. On 31 May 2015, the cMS agreed to extend the PRCPC Cat B project until 30 May 2017. The EPRC is a potential candidate for the continuation of the project. The EPRC closely cooperates with the European Defence Agency. It was created on 8 July 2015 by seven nations (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom) with the aim of improving the four phases of Personnel Recovery (Preparation, Planning, Execution and Adaptation) by developing/harmonising the Personnel Recovery Policy, Doctrine and Standards through clear lines of communications with partners/stakeholders (nations and international organisations), and providing assistance in support of education and training, exercises and operations.   More information: 6th edition of Personnel Recovery Controller and Planner Course (March 2016) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/04/20/personnel-recovery-course-hosted-by-european-personnel-recovery-centre
EDA_NEWS_0453	2016-04-19	NEWS	EDA presents hybrid threat exercise findings to Defence Ministers	 Ministers of Defence met in the European Defence Agency (EDA) Steering Board on 19 April, under the chairmanship of Federica Mogherini in her capacity as Head of the Agency. The EDA presented among other things progress of the four cooperative capability programmes, the interim report on the implementation of the Policy Framework for Systematic and Long-Term Defence Cooperation as well as a preliminary implementation roadmap for a dual-use strategy on RPAS regulation. Furthermore the Agency highlighted the key findings of the hybrid threats table-top exercise it conducted last month. The exercise involved some 80 experts from Member States, EU institutions and NATO. It underlined for example the critical importance of strategic awareness to allow Member States to detect and identify hybrid threats. The detection of hostile hybrid threats is the most challenging and yet most important aspect of an effective defence posture in this context. Greater levels of information and intelligence and close cooperation between civil and military actors were identified as important. Additionally, rapid decision-making and deployment of the necessary capabilities needs are necessary. While in a hybrid threat scenario civil actors might be in the lead, the military must stand ready and provide decision-makers with the full scope of military capabilities if necessary. Specific focus should be given to the ability to communicate. Therefore the resilience, redundancy and protection of CIS networks remains vital and the contribution of more secure defence systems (including those using satellites) is important. “The exercise was very useful as it allowed us to stress-test military capabilities in a hybrid threat environment. It also underlined the importance of close co-operation between military and civilian stakeholders in a hybrid threat scenario. However, we also saw that existing military capabilities should not be completely reoriented towards countering hybrid threats as the full spectrum of military missions must be considered”, Jorge Domecq, the Chief Executive of the EDA said. A second exercise in June will focus on the way ahead in different capability areas. Ministers of Defence were also presented with an interim report on the implementation of the Policy Framework for Systematic and Long-Term Defence Cooperation. The interim report – which was compiled on the basis of questionnaires sent to and completed by the Member States – highlights that the policy framework is well supported. The focus on information-sharing through the Agency’s Capability Development Plan as well as the Collaborative Database is deemed crucial by a large majority of Member States. Defence Ministers endorsed a preliminary implementation roadmap for a dual-use strategy on RPAS regulation involving questions of rulemaking, standardisation, technological solutions and issues of cyber security. The EDA will now start consolidating the roadmap with the European Commission and other relevant actors.  The Steering Board tasked the Agency, in close coordination with Member States, to engage with the Commission in the preparation of the Space Strategy for Europe, to ensure that common military views of Member States are taken into account. Furthermore, the EDA will support Member States’ dialogue and consultation with the Commission in order to contribute to the European Defence Action Plan. Jorge Domecq, the EDA Chief Executive, also informed Defence Ministers of recent activities in R&T. Between 2004 and the end of 2016, the Agency will have managed research projects with a total value of around € 1 billion in contributions by the Member States.  Mr Domecq also stressed that the EDA will continue to actively support Member States in their discussions with the European Commission in view of defining and agreeing on the research topics and priorities, the rules as well as the working modalities of the Preparatory Action (PA) on defence-related research scheduled to be launched in 2017.

EDA_NEWS_0456	2016-04-13	NEWS	EDA Chief Executive addresses German Bundestag Defence Committee	 Speaking this Wednesday (13 April) before the Defence Committee of the German Bundestag in Berlin, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq has called for a profound reassessment of Europe’s common security and defence-related aspirations and endeavours for the future, to make sure the EU has a clear vision on the sort of project it wants for the next decade. “Europe is being shaped in reaction to crises. We need a positive story, a new narrative for Europe. I am personally convinced that defence and security can become the drivers for the European project”, Mr Domecq said. The EU’s collective level of ambition should include the ability to protect its citizens, to secure its direct neighbourhood (East and South), and to enable and support its partners to become security providers themselves, he stressed. “Protect, secure, enable. This should be at the very heart of the Global Strategy” which High Representative Federica Mogherini is set to present in summer, Mr Domecq stated. However, he continued, “such a vision needs to be put into motion and will therefore require investment, support of EU instruments, capabilities and a strong industrial base”. As far as military capabilities are concerned, Mr Domecq called for more cooperative programmes. “Member States face the stark choice between cooperating to acquire new capabilities or risk losing them altogether”, he said. “While there are many political declarations calling for more cooperation, the reality is that we face the renationalisation of defence. In the past, we carried out more cooperative programmes than we do today; we used to cooperate more in research and technology; we created instruments such as OCCAR or the European Defence Agency which has a strong European conviction. But today, Member States seem to be shying away from cooperation, there seems to be too much of conservatism in ministries of defence”, he said. The EDA Chief Executive commended Germany for being “a driving force in Europe”. “I sincerely hope that, with the support of State Secretary Suder and (Lieutenant) General Bühler, as Chairman of the EDA Steering Board of Capability Directors, with whom I work very closely, we will take European defence to a new level, taking advantage of the context of the Global Strategy and potential European Defence White Book. Europe can simply no longer afford to be a free-rider in defence”, Mr Domecq concluded.

EDA_NEWS_0457	2016-04-13	NEWS	EDA launches market survey on in-theatre helicopter medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) services	 Since the creation of the European Defence Agency in 2004, support to the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and to EU operations has been one of EDA's core missions. Several activities are now ongoing to develop the support of CSDP military and civilian operations or missions as well as EU Battlegroups at the request of Member States. Typically, CSDP operations and missions are deployed on short notice to manage crisis in remote areas. In some cases, shortfalls on assets and equipment arising from the force generation have led to outsourcing some key services. This has been the case for in-theatre rotary wing medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) in the CSDP military training mission in Mali (EUTM Mali) or the CSDP civilian rule of law mission in Kosovo (EULEX Kosovo). In order to better understand the range of commercially available solutions which could fulfil possible future requirements for in-theatre helicopter MEDEVAC services and associated risks or limitations, EDA is conducting a market survey. It has to be highlighted that the objective of this survey is to identify service providers of ‘turnkey’ solutions and not manufacturers of assets or supply providers.  Operators are kindly invited to participate to the survey by submitting their answer by 6 May 2016.

EDA_NEWS_0462	2016-03-18	NEWS	NEXTT project launched with a small research company leading the consortium	 A new promising defence-related project on Energy Storage Technology was launched by EDA at a kick-off meeting on 11 March. The so-called NEXTT project standing for “New Energy storage using compleX hydride Tanks for Thermoneutral systems”, was initiated by the European Defence Agency in the framework of the second Joint Investment Programme on Innovative Concepts and Emerging Technologies (JIP ICET 2). The project’s objective is to develop a new energy storage system for hydrogen, using new materials and advanced tank solutions with the following targets: high gravimetric density for high mobility of the system; high volumetric density for compactness and practicability of the system; and optimized heat absorption leading to low heat losses and thus reduced thermal signature of the overall system. Involving the full spectrum of R&T players The NEXTT project demonstrates and reflects in an exemplary manner the key idea behind the JIP ICET 2 programme, namely to involve the full spectrum of entities in the R&T cycle, ranging from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) over research centres to big industry, as the end-user of the technology development. The NEXTT consortium is led by a small research subsidiary of an Austrian University (Forschungs- und Technologietransfer GmbH, FOTEC) with two major research centres (Fraunhofer IFAM, Germany, and Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives CEA, France), as well as an industrial end-user (DCNS Group, France) also participating. This bandwidth allows the consortium to cover all aspects of the targeted development from research in advanced materials and system integration up to the military application. The NEXTT project also promotes civil-military synergies and dual-use technologies as it aims to transfer technologies and knowledge already used by the space industry to the defence sector for further development. The launch of NEXTT completes the lists of projects which had been earmarked under JIP ICET 2 in view of fostering the development of new, innovative technologies that have potential to enable future military capabilities. JIP ICET 2 is managed and funded by Austria, Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden in the framework of the EDA.

EDA_NEWS_0463	2016-03-11	NEWS	Countering Hybrid Threats: EDA hosts first Table Top Exercise	" Around 80 experts participated in the EDA Hybrid Threats Table Top Exercise (TTX) which took place at EDA premises in Brussels over three days. The event gathered participants from Member States, representatives from the European Commission (DG Grow, DG Energy, DG Move, DG Home, DG Echo), the European External Action Service (Crisis Management and Planning Directorate, EU Military Committee,  EU Military Staff), CERT, ENISA, and Europol, as well as observers from NATO. The objective of the TTX was to identify and analyse implications of hybrid threats for European military capability development. Is anything new required from the military? Which priority actions are affected in the hybrid context? These questions were tackled through discussions and exchanges placed in the context of a generic scenario and planning situations developed specifically for this exercise. The exercise was concluded today with a VIP visitors’ day where main take-aways from the working sessions were presented. As part of this concluding session, Dr Javier Solana delivered a special address highlighting the necessity for EU Member States to act collectively in this newly emerging security environment, making use of the toolbox we have available on an intergovernmental level. Final findings and recommendations derived from the TTX will be delivered at the Ministerial Steering Board in April. A second TTX is planned in June, will take a more detailed look into the different capability areas where shortfalls and vulnerabilities have been indicated.

EDA_NEWS_0464	2016-03-14	NEWS	Successful Personnel Recovery Course held in Sweden	 The sixth edition of the Personnel Recovery Controller and Planner Course (PRCPC), a project initiated and supported by the European Defence Agency (EDA), was organised and hosted for the third time by Sweden in Karlsborg from 29 February to 11 March 2016.  Instructors from Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, Netherlands, Spain and Sweden shared their knowledge and experience of Personnel Recovery (PR) matters with a group of students coming from Austria, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. The main focus of the course was to train staff officers in supporting their commanders in PR related issues. The course is designed for personnel who man personnel recovery positions in tactical operation centres (TOCs), personnel recovery coordination cells (PRCCs) or joint personnel recovery cells (JPRCs). Overall, it is acknowledged that PR capabilities in Europe benefitted through the increased number of trained personnel available to support our future operations and missions. Personnel Recovery Personnel Recovery is usually defined as the sum of efforts needed to recover isolated civilian or military personnel. Certainly, PR is a vital element of modern operational planning as it provides a security net for deployed personnel. Most importantly, it boosts morale and acknowledges national as well as European Union responsibilities to effect the recovery and reintegration of isolated personnel deployed in the context of Crisis Management Operations under the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). Next Course The next EU PRCPC will take place at the European Personnel Recovery Centre (EPRC) at Poggio Renatico Air Base (Italy) from 4 to 15 April 2016. Background The EDA PRCPC project was established on 30 May 2013 as an EDA Category B project under the lead of Sweden. As of today, it includes six contributing EU Member States (cMS): Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands and Sweden. On 31 May 2015, the cMS agreed to extend the PRCPC Cat B project until 30 May 2017. The EPRC is a potential candidate for the continuation of the project.   More information: News 5th edition of Personnel Recovery Controller and Planner Course (PRCPC) (15 Dec 2015) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/03/14/successful-personnel-recovery-course-held-in-sweden
EDA_NEWS_0465	2016-03-22	NEWS	COLD BLADE 2016 Helicopter Exercise successfully completed	 Exercise COLD BLADE 2016, hosted by the Finnish Defence Forces, was formally completed Wednesday evening March 16th 2016 by the Chief of Finnish Army Aviation, LtCol Jaro Kesänen. At exercise closure, a total of 290 hours had been flown on 156 missions with 3 participating Member States (Finland and Germany, as well as Sweden which sent observers) and 10 European helicopters: seven NH-90, one MD500 and two CH-53GA. Italian attendees participated in the survival training. This cold weather exercise was operated from Ivalo airbase in Finland. The challenging winter scenario in Lapland allowed Finland and Germany to train and adapt their aircrew to winter conditions. Besides the focus on flying in demanding white-out conditions, the exercise was used to test the helicopters, test the aircrew and to teach and learn Technics, Tactics and Procedures in a cold and snowy environment. During the first week, Finland and Germany executed individual trainings, qualifying helicopter pilots and loadmasters in white-out landings and navigation skills in an area with barely any houses or roads. During day and night missions all training aims were met and, even with Night Vision Goggles, the nights were very dark in northern Finland. During the second week, formation flights with German CH-53GA and Finnish NH-90 helicopters were flown at night. While aircrew from Germany and Finland were flying, Italian militaries attended the survival course and learned how to survive in Lapland. The German Detachment commander praised the unique nature of the exercise and stressed that the added value of cooperating with other nations and practicing winter operations in combined missions just could not have been achieved by working alone. The skills developed during the exercise are precisely those needed to conduct successful operations in the future. These types of exercises truly enhance helicopter capabilities in Europe which also reflects the objective of EDA’s Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP). Since the first exercise in France in 2009, trainings have increased in scale, environmental challenges and complexity. Participants not only came from different nations but also from different branches with air force and army all working together. In exercise Cold Blade 2016, German Army NH-90 mechanics executed tests and exchanged information with their Finnish counterparts concerning winter maintenance, use of tools and NH-90 helicopter documentation. This was the first EDA exercise hosted by Finland.

EDA_NEWS_0466	2016-03-04	NEWS	Countering Hybrid Threats: “Capabilities need to be used in a more coherent and comprehensive manner” (Jorge Domecq)	 Speaking before the European Parliament’s security and defence subcommittee (SEDE) on Thursday March 3rd, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq stressed the need for a more coordinated European approach to effectively tackle hybrid threats. At a time when hybrid warfare tactics - a combination of conventional and unconventional, military and non-military, overt and covert actions - are increasingly employed by state- and non-state actors in conflicts close to the EU’s southern and eastern borders (Ukraine, Syria, Libya), “it is essential to focus on the ability and agility of Member States and the EU to anticipate and react in a swift and coordinated manner” to these threats, Mr Domecq said.  Most individual Member States have adequate capabilities in place to counter hybrid threats, “but they must learn to deploy those resources in a more coherent, comprehensive way”, he stressed. The European External Action Service (EEAS), supported by EDA and the Commission, is currently preparing a joint framework on hybrid warfare which will form the basis of the future work in this field. In the meantime, the EDA continues its work of assessing the extent to which hybrid threats will affect capability development in Europe in the broadest possible context, Mr Domecq told MEPs. To this end, EDA will conduct a table top exercise from 9-11 March which will involve relevant actors, such as the EEAS, the European Commission, NATO, Member States and academics. The results will be presented to Ministers of Defence in April. Enhanced EU-NATO cooperation Referring to the potential of enhanced EU-NATO cooperation in countering hybrid threats, Mr Domecq expressed the view that progress in this particular field could take EU-NATO relations “to a new level”. In the current context of rapidly spreading hybrid warfare, to intensify cooperation with NATO “is not an option, but an absolute necessity”, the EDA Chief Executive stated in the presence of NATO Assistant Secretary General Heinrich Brauss who also attended the SEDE meeting. “Our collective reply to hybrid is a major opportunity (…) The comparative advantages of the EU and NATO should be used to the maximum extent. The deterrence effect of NATO and the complementarity of our (EU) tools and instruments, are more than enough reason to enhance our cooperation”, he said.  Global Strategy, R&T In his speech, Mr Domecq also touched upon the upcoming EU Global Strategy telling MEPs that the EDA would use its full expertise to help translate the Global Strategy into EU military capabilities required to deal with current and future security risks, including hybrid threats. He also highlighted the need for increased investments in defence-related research and technologies (R&T) with a particular focus on dual-use technologies and civilian-military synergies. By pushing forward the Preparatory Action on CSDP-related research project which is scheduled to be launched in 2017, the EDA and the European Commission “recognise that investing today in future-oriented defence research programmes is crucial to developing the capabilities that are required tomorrow”, Mr Domecq stated. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/03/04/countering-hybrid-threats-capabilities-need-to-be-used-in-a-more-coherent-and-comprehensive-manner-(jorge-domecq)
EDA_NEWS_0467	2016-03-02	NEWS	An enhanced Maltese participation in the EDA	 “Malta needs to have an enhanced presence in the European Defence Agency,” said Minister for Home Affairs and National Security, Carmelo Abela, during a meeting with Mr Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the EDA which discussed ways to enhance defence cooperation on a European level. Malta’s involvement in EDA projects and activities, the upcoming EU Global Strategy and preparations for next year’s Maltese Presidency of the Council of the European Union were discussed during this meeting.  EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq very much welcomed  the Minister’s commitment and underlined the Agency’s flexible, à la carte, approach. Member States can choose areas of interest according to national defence priorities. Mr Domecq encouraged Minister Abela to actively consider participation in EDA’s projects according to Malta’s areas of interest and participation. He also assured Minister Abela of the Agency’s support in preparation of and during the Maltese Presidency of the Council of the European Union in the first half of 2017. Minister Abela reiterated Malta’s commitment to actively contribute to European defence while taking into account its limited resources - Malta’s defence budget amounts to €53 million or 0.6% of the GDP. The Armed Forces of Malta will also continue strengthening their capabilities in both air and maritime surveillance to protect Malta and EU’s borders through EU funds. The Minister for Home Affairs pointed out that the issue of the Mediterranean will be on top of the agenda during Malta’s Presidency of the Council of the European Union next year. This will be in line with its established priorities, which include the migration and maritime aspects. He also expressed his hope for a functional unity government to be established in Libya, as this will have a direct impact on the stability of the whole region. Minister Abela noted positively Mr Domecq’s remarks that for the EDA, all Member States have the same weight as stakeholders, irrespective of their size. The meeting in Valletta was part of a series of visits by Mr Domecq to all EDA Member States, underlining the Agency’s commitment to work closely with and support all Member States. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/03/02/an-enhanced-maltese-participation-in-the-eda
EDA_NEWS_0468	2016-02-24	NEWS	JDEAL: ready for deployment	 The Joint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory (JDEAL) was delivered to Soesterberg, the Netherlands at end of last week. The deployable laboratory was financed through the European Defence Agency and is now ready for deployment to operations to counter-IED threats on the request of the JDEAL Contributing Members. JDEAL was facilitated by the European Defence Agency (EDA) and the lead nation The Netherlands. The JDEAL programme is now counted as a fully operational training facility and a deployable capability. Moreover, JDEAL is now seeking to acquire a second deployable capability. JDEAL also makes use of equipment and knowledge gained from the EDA-developed Counter-IED Technical Exploitation Laboratory (MNTEL) which was previously deployed with ISAF in Kabul. The laboratory works across the entire spectrum of technical IED exploitation. This includes detailed visual examination and high quality image capture; technical exploitation reporting; biometric analysis (latent finger print recovery); electrical circuitry (primarily radio parts); document and media recovery (focused on the mobile phones often used as IED triggering devices); chemical analysis; mechanical exploitation as well as other materiel exploitation. Major Geert-Jan Verkoeijen, JDEAL Manager in Soesterberg, and his team received the deployable facility on 10 February. Major Verkoeijen answers to three questions on the laboratory and possible future deployment here below.   What does the Joint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory (JDEAL) mean for C-IED capability in Europe? JDEAL is an EDA Cat B project that started in September 2014 for the duration of three years. After the opening ceremony, on 4 November 2014, JDEAL has proven to be a good example for how cooperation between European nations can be arranged. The gained experience so far shows that it takes time to change, adapt current approaches, doctrines and even processes on (C-IED) technical exploitation. In some cases we see and experience that we don’t  have this time. In my opinion the JDEAL concept can be seen as an example in current European political-military discussions: the current review of the ‘C-IED concept in EU-led military operations’ could benefit of the lessons identified and learned or even the cooperation approach as a whole. The JDEAL concept is already used in other cooperation developments, thus, this is a huge compliment for what we have achieved so far. In case the JDEAL concept is used for future cooperation plans, the main and most important issue is commitment. With commitment and willingness it’s ‘easy’ to start in a short time. This JDEAL concept approach (could) benefit future decision making processes and eases supporting but ‘mandatory’ issues like budget, equipment and personnel. After executing several JDEAL basic courses we enter now the ‘next’ stage in the project. On 10 February we received our deployable laboratory in Soesterberg. JDEAL is now in the position to fulfill and execute its main tasks: (1) execute trainings, (2) deploy the laboratory and (3) maintain knowledge & research developments. JDEAL can contribute to trainings, operations and discussions related to our specific C-IED technical exploitation work field.  Either way JDEAL demonstrates that ‘pooling and sharing’ of capabilities and capacities are beneficial for contributing countries. This knowledge will be used for the discussion, the continuation of JDEAL after 2017.   How do you see the readiness of the staff and laboratory for deployment? The challenge is to create a pool of experts that fulfills continuation in future deployment(s). This pool must consist of military staff who are able to use the available equipment, material and procedures. Importantly, the staff has to work in a team. Right now we don’t have a deployment or mission and it’s difficult to anticipate needs and consequences. In my opinion JDEAL is flexible and modular enough to adapt and fulfill  future needs. From this perspective JDEAL is in the position  to influence the decision making process. Before the actual deployment JDEAL analyses with the lead-nation how to support the deployment. JDEAL is able to prepare and execute the necessary means for deployment and make sure that the assigned crew is trained by the JDEAL permanent staff. The delivery of the first deployable laboratory JDEAL allows us to focus on the possible operational consequences of getting deployed in the upcoming months.  We are now preparing for the C-IED training exercise ‘Bison Counter’ in Sweden (August 2016). The Bison Counter ’16  exercise will also be a test for the technical exploitation ‘chain’ and JDEAL will benefit also from the knowledge/ procedures  of operational units and collection / level 1 tactical exploitation. This exercise will connect the several technical exploitation steps.    When do you see the first opportunity for the laboratory for deployment? As stated in the JDEAL Programme Arrangement the contributing members states can claim the deployable facility. Now we have the deployable laboratory I can imagine (my assumption) that nations are considering JDEAL deployment. The JDEAL permanent staff has the challenge to make sure that when the time comes, we are ready to support the lead nation.   More information: Counter IED project page 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/02/24/jdeal-ready-for-deployment

EDA_NEWS_0470	2016-02-25	NEWS	Group of Personalities publishes report on the Preparatory Action for CSDP-related research	 This week, the Group of Personalities issued its report on the Preparatory Action for CSDP-related research. Convened by Commissioner Elżbieta Bieńkowska, the group consists of key personalities from European industry, government, the European Parliament and academia. In its report, the group now made recommendations for a long-term vision for EU-funded CSDP-related research which can boost European defence cooperation.  These recommendations address the overall scope and governance of future EU-funded CSDP research and highlight possible collaboration and coordination mechanisms. The overarching goal of the Preparatory Action and CSDP-related research is to create a framework that would facilitate a collaborative approach to defence among the Member States. Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency (EDA) and an alternate to High Representative, Vice President and Head of the Agency Federica Mogherini, in the group, underlines, “The Preparatory Action on CSDP-related research is a pivotal instrument in support of Europe’s strategic autonomy: it will reinforce our collective military freedom of action by fostering defence cooperation. The establishment of such a European instrument can contribute to translating our level of ambition into action. The Preparatory Action can become a catalyst for European cooperation in key capability areas by breaking down the barriers and overcoming the disincentives to cooperation that exist today.” Against the background of shrinking defence R&T budgets with negative long-term effects on capability development and industrial outlook, the report acknowledges that an EU-funded Defence Research Programme (EDRP), complementary to national R&D, may help fostering cooperation, ensuring European security and supporting the European defence technological and industrial base.  In the report, the Group of Personalities highlight the importance of close cooperation between governments (as sole customers), industries (as main suppliers) and R&T organisations for the success of the Preparatory Action. At the same time, the report describes the EDA as “the only EU body with the mandate to define collective defence capability and research priorities and support defence cooperation”. It is “therefore the most logical and appropriate vehicle to identify and review priorities in this domain”.  Commenting on this last point, Jorge Domecq says, “The Preparatory Action combined with the active role of EDA upstream, meaning in its preparation, and downstream, in its implementation, could lead to a more systematic cooperation in Europe.”   More information Download the report here (EUISS website) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/02/25/group-of-personalities-publishes-report-on-the-preparatory-action-for-csdp-related-research
EDA_NEWS_0471	2016-02-16	NEWS	Airlift tactics training with focus on night flying	 The first European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course (EAATTC) of 2016 is taking place in Zaragoza Airbase, Spain, from 14 to 26 February. Aircraft and crews from Belgium, Spain, Germany and Poland, together with instructors from the European Air Transport Command (EATC), Italy and the staff of the European Defence Agency (EDA) are engaged in an intelligence driven programme that will see the crews complete complex multi-threat missions in a challenging winter mountain environment.  Additionally, for the first time, a selection of crews will operate in the same high threat conditions, but with the added burden of operating at night with sole reference to Night Vision Goggle (NVG) technology and the natural light of moon and stars.    The training starts with academics sessions, followed by a challenging low level navigation exercise that allows a brief familiarisation of the area and the rough landing grounds before. Crews are faced with a seemingly familiar but fictitious scenario progressing from a surface-to-air to an air-to-air threats environment. As this edition of the EAATTC is also dedicated to the new advanced NVG course, the night crews are confronted with the same insurgent scenario as the daylight crews. Eight flights are planned for the NVG course.    Background  The European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course aims to provide air transport crews with a robust airlift tactics training syllabus in order to enhance interoperability between European air forces. It takes crews into a theatre-deployment mindset, exposing them to airland and airdrop missions in a tactically challenging environment. Emphasis is put on aircraft operations and on application of procedures in a changing environment. The EAATTC training series is an integral component of the wider 20-nation European Air Transport Fleet Partnership.

EDA_NEWS_0479	2016-02-11	NEWS	New project to facilitate integration of RPAS into European airspace	 The European Defence Agency (EDA) and an industrial consortium led by Airbus Defence and Space have launched today a new project to contribute to the integration of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) into common airspace in Europe. New standards for RPAS A contract for the Enhanced RPAS Automation (ERA) project was signed between the EDA and a multinational industrial consortium in mid-December 2015. The project will support the widespread use of both civil and military RPAS in non-segregated airspace in Europe in general and their integration in airport operations in particular, addressing several capability gaps identified in the European RPAS Steering Group (ERSG) Roadmap for RPAS air traffic insertion. The project will contribute to setting the European standards that will provide the technical grounds for the certification of the Automatic Take-off and Landing, Autotaxi and Automation and Emergency Recovery functionalities, in the frame of the regulatory framework currently being produced. To achieve these goals, technical and procedural solutions will be developed, and demonstrated by simulations and flight trials. Additionally, the project includes the development of draft standards in cooperation with the European Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment (EUROCAE). The project also relies on active collaboration with other important stakeholders, such as the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and Eurocontrol. Roland Van Reybroeck, EDA Director Cooperation Planning & Support explains: ”ERA complements the air traffic integration efforts of other related EDA projects, such as MIDCAS (MID-air Collision Avoidance System) covering en-route Detect & Avoid and DESIRE (Demonstration of Satellites enabling the Insertion of RPAS in Europe) covering satellite command and control data links. These projects, strongly driven by military requirements, have achieved tangible results but there is a need to proceed with further investments, also in view of establishing dual-use standards and meeting civil regulation requirements.”   ERA as ad-hoc EDA project ERA is an EDA ad-hoc project launched by five Member States: France, Italy, Poland, Sweden and Germany as the lead nation. The planned duration of the project is 42 months with an overall budget of around €31 million (excl. VAT). The ERA industrial consortium is led by Airbus Defence and Space, and composed of sixteen partners from five EDA Member States: Airbus Defence and Space and ESG Elektroniksystem- und Logistik-GmbH  from Germany; Sagem, Thales and ONERA from France; Saab from Sweden; Finmeccanica from Italy; and nine partners from Poland: Air Force Institute of Technology (leadership Polish consortium), Institute of Aviation, Hertz Systems Ltd., EUROTECH, PIAP (Przemysłowy Instytut Automatyki i Pomiarów), Eskadra Grzegorz Trzeciak, Politechnika Rzeszowska (Rzeszow University of Technology - RUT), WB Electronics S.A., Asseco Poland S.A.   Background RPAS have demonstrated their importance in recent military operations, particularly for surveillance and information gathering. However RPAS can also offer a wide range of civil applications such as infrastructure surveillance, firefighting, disaster or environmental monitoring, as well as border control and management. RPAS have been earmarked as one of four capability development priorities by the December 2013 European Council. The European Defence Agency has divided its work in the field of RPAS into five main areas: (1) Integration of military RPAS in non-segregated civilian airspace; (2) Certification of future military RPAS; (3) Development of cutting-edge technologies for future European RPAS; (4) Establishment of a community of military RPAS users in Europe; (5) Support to the development of a European medium-altitude long endurance (Male) RPAS to be operational by 2025.   More information: RPAS project page 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/02/11/new-project-to-facilitate-integration-of-rpas-into-european-airspace
EDA_NEWS_0480	2016-01-19	NEWS	European Defence Agency supports CSDP operations	" In the framework of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), the European Defence Agency (EDA) supports EU-led military operations and missions offering a wide scope of services, ranging from managing contracts for satellite communication, through training in cyber defence, ending up with providing HR management software to operational commands. Especially developing a model of ready-to-use framework contracts will give the EDA the possibility to broaden its service to more comprehensively support the establishment and running of CSDP operations and missions.  Introduction Support to CSDP Operations is one of the key task for the European Defence Agency, which was highlighted in the recent revision of the statute, seat and operational rules of the Agency. “We are proud to support EU-led military operations: to see our projects being used and to know that our expertise is being appreciated. Continuous service is what makes the Agency valid,” says Jorge Domecq, the EDA Chief Executive.  The EDA offers its existing projects as well as ready-to-use contracted solutions that will replicate the successful framework contract model for satellite communications. Consequently, the EDA support to operations is cost-effective and efficient, as it does not generate any additional costs for the Member States or the Agency.  The range of EDA services to support CSDP operations In more detail, the EDA delivered a Human Resources management software for Headquarters (J1FAS) to the EU military operation in the Central African Republic in 2014. Commander Paschalis Gkounidis, the HQ Assistant Chief of Staff for Human Resources said that “the installation of this new system represents a big step forward in managing our personnel and will provide useful lessons for the improvement of the system in the future.” A similar support is also provided for the operational command of the military operation in the Southern Central Mediterranean (Operation Sophia). Additionally, the EDA conducted cyber awareness training events in Larissa and Rome Operational Headquarters for the operations in the Central African Republic and in Southern Central Mediterranean respectively. In the case of Operation Sophia, the EDA also offered the MARSUR networking system, which may contribute to increasing the maritime situational awareness.  Following several successful test cases, e.g. contracting Air-to-Ground Surveillance Services for the EU military operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (EUFOR Althea) in 2014, the EDA signed an arrangement with the Athena Mechanism (February 2015) to facilitate ad-hoc support for contracting for CSDP operations. Under this arrangement, the Agency has already supported the EU training mission in Mali for procurement of medical equipment as well as the EUFOR Althea for benchmarking current camp management services. The signature of the arrangement also provided a new impetus for the usage of the already existing EDA Contractor Support to Operations (CSO) platform as a powerful tool for interaction between economic operators and EU-led operations. The platform has successfully been used to assist in fulfilling tailored needs for the EU training missions in Mali and Somalia.  With the Athena Mechanism having joined the EU SatCom Market project in June 2015, the cooperation has gone one step further. CSDP operations and missions can now rely on a ready pre-mission contracted solution for satellite communication. The EDA framework contracts offer high quality service with less administrative burden. The EU training mission in Somalia has successfully been using such solution since October 2015 for Fixed Satellite Services. “Thanks to the excellent cooperation between the EUTM J6 team, the EDA and the contractor, EUTM Somalia benefits from a reliable and secure connection with Europe for its Command and Control chain,” said Brigadier General Antonio Maggi, the Operation Commander. The EU Training Mission in Mali is also relying now on the EU SatCom Market for Mobile Satellite Services. Potential projects in the future  “I have no doubts that our support to CSDP operations will increase in the future, and will provide more opportunities to deliver civil-military synergies in the contractor support context,” says Jorge Domecq. The EDA, together with the Athena Mechanism and EU Military Staff, is currently exploring possibilities to implement additional ready-to-use solutions for other services, to include medical services with helicopter medevac as the first priority, infrastructure and camp management as well as strategic transportation services. The overall aim is to provide comprehensive contracted support covering all major areas pertaining to operations: from deployment and redeployment of troops, through the establishment and maintenance of camps, satellite communications services to end up with medical service. There is also a number of EDA-led projects which be might relevant for CSDP operations as they mature in the future. The list includes: smart energy camps to manage renewable energies, Countering Improvised Explosive Devices (C-IED) awareness and training, cyber situational awareness packages for headquarters to enhance cyber defence planning, a platform to share and analyse geospatial information (GISMO 2), a C-IED joint deployable exploitation analysis laboratory, and an electronic on-line gov-to-gov market platform eQuip to sell or transfer surplus defence equipment.  More information Project page on Operations Support  Brochure on Contractor Support to Operations (CSO) platform News ""JDEAL deployable capability: final trainings before delivery"" (24 November 2015) News ""EDA provides satellite communications services for EUTM Somalia"" (13 October 2015) News ""EDA installs energy management equipment at EUTM Mali camp"" (13 October 2015)  News ""EDA supports EUTM Mali to enhance medical facilities"" (8 September 2015) "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/01/19/european-defence-agency-supports-csdp-operations

Opened today by EU Commissioner for Energy and Climate Action Miguel Arias Cañete, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq and European Commission's Director-General for Energy Dominique Ristori, the Consultation Forum will examine how energy efficiency measures and renewable energy sources could be better used and implemented within the European defence sector. The consultation will take place through a series of meetings between experts from national administrations, armed forces, industry and academia.  ""Some of the world’s most efficient militaries are progressively replacing expensive fossil fuels with power generated by solar panels, wind turbines and rechargeable batteries. This is not only about more reliable on-site energy generation. It's also about making it safer and cheaper for troops to complete their missions"", said Commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete. “Sustainable energy use starts at home. This is true for individuals as well as for the armed forces. The energy bill for Europe’s armed forces amounts to billions of euros. The EU legislation in place for energy efficiency, renewable energy and energy performance in buildings can certainly improve the armed forces’ energy output. Ultimately this will not only benefit their environmental footprint but will also result in considerable savings”, said Jorge Domecq during the opening of the first plenary session.    Consultation Forum The Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector is a European Commission initiative managed by the EDA. It brings together experts from the defence and energy sectors to share information and best practice on improving energy management, efficiency and the use of renewable energy in the civil uses of the military. The focus will be on facilitating the sharing of good practice and expertise by assessing the existing EU energy legislation, in particular the Energy Efficiency Directive, the Energy Performance in Buildings Directive and the Renewable Energy Directive in order to see how different measures could be implemented in the defence sector thus contributing to on-going decarbonisation efforts.The Forum will also be a place to stimulate projects in key areas as well as identifying possible funding streams. Depending on the findings, the Forum might also develop recommendations on how to further develop directives or amending policy in relation to European funding mechanisms for defence. The Consultation Forum will take place in a series of five plenary meetings over two years. The work will be carried out in three parallel working groups each with a particular focus: (1) Energy management, (2) Energy efficiency & 3) Renewable energy. Energy and the military Defence is one of the largest energy consumers in Europe. One of the key challenges is to quantify the extent of this energy usage and to assess how projects stimulated through this Consultation Forum can impact on overall EU energy usage.

EDA_NEWS_0487	2015-12-15	NEWS	Personnel Recovery Course hosted by European Personnel Recovery Centre	" The fifth edition of the Personnel Recovery Controller and Planner Course (PRCPC), a project initiated and supported by the European Defence Agency (EDA), was organised and hosted for the first time by the newly established European Personnel Recovery Centre (EPRC). The course was successfully conducted from 23 November to 4 December 2015 in Poggio Renatico Air Base, Italy. It was organised by the European Personnel Recovery Centre (EPRC) at the request of six Member States contributing to the project. All in all, nineteen students from eleven countries including Austria, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States benefitted from the knowledge and experience of a cadre of instructors from Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United States.  The main focus of the course was to train staff officers in supporting their commanders in Personnel Recovery related issues. The course is designed for personnel who man personnel recovery positions in tactical operation centres (TOCs), personnel recovery coordination cells (PRCCs) or joint personnel recovery cells (JPRCs).  Personnel Recovery (PR) is a vital element of modern operational planning as it provides a security net for deployed personnel. Most importantly, it boosts morale and acknowledges national as well as European Union responsibilities to effect the recovery and reintegration of isolated personnel deployed in the context of Crisis Management Operations under the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).  The next EU PRCPC will take place in Karlsborg, Sweden, from 29 February to 11 March 2016 and will be organised by the Swedish Armed Forces.  Background The EDA PRCPC project was established on 30 May 2013 as an EDA Category B project under the lead of Sweden. As of today, it includes six contributing EU Member States (cMS): Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands and Sweden. On 31 May 2015, the cMS agreed to extend the PRCPC Cat B project until 30 May 2017. The EPRC is a potential candidate for the continuation of the project.  The EPRC closely cooperates with the European Defence Agency. It was created on 8 July 2015 by seven nations (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom) with the aim of improving the four phases of Personnel Recovery (Preparation, Planning, Execution and Adaptation) by developing/harmonising the Personnel Recovery Policy, Doctrine and Standards through clear lines of communications with partners/stakeholders (nations and international organisations), and providing assistance in support of education and training, exercises and operations.

EDA_NEWS_0488	2015-12-16	NEWS	Searching for CBRNe ID threats	" From 23 November to 11 December 2015, the European Defence Agency (EDA) in cooperation with Austria as host nation, organised the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear explosives Improvised Devices Search Pilot Course (CBRNe ID Search Course), to enhance pMS’ knowledge on all aspects of C-IED.     The event took place at the “AbwehrSchule” CBRN School in Korneuburg, Austria. A total of sixteen students attended the course which included a mixture of military and police Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), CBRN and Search specialists from the following countries: Austria, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Latvia, Czech Republic and Spain. A mixture of military and civilian CBRNe Search expertise ensured a wide range of operational experience was available during the course. Practical training provided the most effective means of learning for this course and students were able to participate in immersive scenarios as commanders, searchers, EOD and Sampling and Identification of Biological, Chemical and Radiological Agents (SIBCRA) specialists in a joint CBRN response team. A variety of instructional methods were employed to achieve this learning: demonstrations, individual skills practice, group mini-tasks and full tactical tasks for teams provided a structured approach to learning. Differentiation was applied where required to compensate for language difficulties or adaptation of existing skills from SIBCRA to Search. All practical exercises were recorded using photos and videos; this enabled every day to be concluded with a video debrief to ensure students understood the details of each phase even if they were involved in a separate aspect of the task.  The various scenarios provided a range of operational complexities which highlighted the different operational capabilities, policies and procedures each pMS had. As a result, the course provided much opportunity for sharing best practice, and  a seminar was held to facilitate discussion about the range of capabilities. A Distinguished Visitors Day was hosted by Austria on 10 December 2015. Several Defence Attaches and other visitors participated in the event and took the opportunity to visit the CBRN School for briefings on the course design and contents. Visitors also had the chance to visit a live “vessel search” demonstration in the Danube river. The EDA intends to hold a CBRNe ID Search seminar during 2016 to define and exploit concepts on this area of expertise.

EDA_NEWS_0489	2015-12-03	NEWS	EDA project to reduce vulnerability of lightweight UAV structures	" The BaToLUS project, Battle Damage Tolerance for Lightweight Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Structures, brought about a successful development of new rapid prototype modelling capabilities. The BaToLUS project involved major European aeronautical industries, top-rated European research institutes and also small European enterprises. The European Defence Agency (EDA) led cooperation brought together a ""critical mass"" for an effective scientific dialogue, thus allowing the Nations to benefit from synergies in their respective industrial capabilities. Compared to more conventional combat aircraft designs, extremely lightweight structures exhibit different distributions of strength and stiffness. Within the BaToLUS project, cost-efficient alternatives to a well-defined baseline configuration have been developed by improved structural design, aiming to offer increased tolerance against battle damage, whilst supporting the original requirements and keeping potential penalties small.  Thanks to BaToLUS, new rapid prototype modelling capabilities have been developed. Also, a generic design process, which includes “Vulnerability Load Cases"", and novel high-fidelity simulation methods have been demonstrated. A large number of structural concepts for vulnerability reductions have been identified, assessed and – for two of them – implemented and tested. Operational evaluation with respect to impacts on cost, weight and capabilities were considered at an overall platform level, together with vulnerability analysis taking into account the demonstrated structural performance and aerodynamic damage characterisation. The main objectives of the project have been: (i) defining a UAV design and development process for vulnerability reduction to be integrated in the design process, (ii) demonstrating an improvement of the current UAV modelling, simulation and design capabilities, and (iii) providing a guideline on the costs associated with the development of a vulnerability-improved UAV. The BaToLUS project was managed and funded by Germany, France, Sweden, and the UK in the frame of the European Defence Agency, and carried out by Airbus Defence & Space Germany (project leader), Airbus Group Innovations France, BAE Systems, CEA Gramat, Dynamec Research AB, Fraunhofer-Institut für Kurzzeitdynamik - Ernst-Mach-Institut (EMI), Industrieanlagen-Betriebsgesellschaft mbH (IABG), ONERA – The French Aerospace Lab, and SAAB Aerosystems.

The Joint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory (JDEAL) programme will conduct two courses specifically designed for the set up and technical management of a new deployable capability (JDC) and its equipment. These courses are being conducted under the framework of the JDEAL programme and are taking place ahead of final delivery to Soesterberg (The Netherlands) in mid December 2015. The courses will be hosted by Spain at the International Demining Centre facilities near Madrid from 23 November until 4 December 2015 and are particularly significant because they represent the first opportunity for Member States to familiarise themselves with the full laboratory and its capabilities. Firstly, trainees from the thirteen participating Member States contributing to the programme will be instructed by the manufacturer, the Spanish company Indra Sistemas on the process needed to set up the facility. A comprehensive training package on the design, set up, maintenance and dismantling in all operational modes of the JDEAL system is envisaged. Secondly, practical activities will be conducted for JDEAL related experts on the specific electronics items, tools and adequate skills to manage and operate complex laboratory equipment – providing them with a full insight into the capability. After the execution of these courses, the laboratory will be packed up and moved to Soesterberg, at which point this deployable capability will be definitely considered to have reached Full Operational Capability (FOC) – after approximately only one year from the start of the initiative.   More information: Counter-IED project page 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/11/24/jdeal-deployable-capability-final-trainings-before-delivery
EDA_NEWS_0492	2015-11-26	NEWS	Seminar on metamaterials for defence applications	" On 29 September 2015, thirty experts from Ministries of Defence, European Commission, NATO staff, industry and academia participated in an European Defence Agency (EDA) seminar to address the future impact of metamaterials technologies on defence capabilities. The seminar was co-organised by the Capability Technology groups (CapTechs) on Materials & Structures, Technologies for Components and Modules, Radiofrequency Sensors Technologies, and Electro-Optical Sensors Technologies. Metamaterials are engineered structured materials used principally to control and manipulate electromagnetic fields and acoustic waves. Their properties come both from those of the materials they are made of, as well as from their geometrical arrangements.  High level experts on metamaterials and defence technologies gathered to discuss on the potentials of metamaterials for different defence applications and related future challenges. In order to raise the awareness for these technologies, background information was provided on current work regarding metamaterials at EU level, on relevant activities in various CapTechs, on defence capability needs and on areas were further research is needed. The discussion focused on metamaterials defence applications, such as metamaterials to enhance the performance of radar antennas, their use as radar absorbers and cloaking, both regarding acoustics and microwave signals. Also the challenges and the way ahead regarding measurements, fabrication or modelling were addressed during the meeting. The main outcome of the seminar is the identification of radar antennas and absorbers as the most promising defence applications. On the other hand, wide-band tunable surfaces are the most wanted applications of metamaterials, although they are far to be achieved. However, with a view to developing different applications, SMEs and academia need military requirements to better align their research to defence needs. Moreover, industry requires understanding of manufacturing tolerances and their performance in real conditions. These issues, together with the fact that metamaterials technologies are mainly civil driven, make the identification of the right area and right moment to start investing in a major challenge for defence actors.  For further information, please contact CapTech.Materials@eda.europa.eu  More information:  Project page on METamaterials for Active ELEctronically Scanned Arrays (METALESA) News ""EDA project shows how metamaterials can boost the performance of antennas (MIMICRA)"" (15 September 2014) "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/11/26/seminar-on-metamaterials-for-defence-applications

EDA_NEWS_0494	2015-11-26	NEWS	EDA hosts the meeting of MCDC Executives	" On 20 November 2015, the European Defence Agency (EDA) hosted the Executive Steering Group of the Multinational Capability Development Campaign (MCDC) 2015-16. MCDC is a US-led fellowship of twenty-four nations and international organisations; its aim is to develop defence capabilities for effective and interoperable global coalition operations. The meeting focused on subjects of particular interest to the MCDC members, such as countering hybrid warfare, multinational defensive cyberspace operations, federated mission networks, maritime operations, countering unmanned autonomous systems and social media. The executives recognised that some of these could add real value to countering emergent threats within Europe. They also confirmed their commitment for a more structured dialogue in order to develop valuable military capabilities together. The EDA joined MCDC in 2013 with the twofold objective of sharing the principles of defence capability development in a global context, and ensuring the Common Security and Defence Policy is considered in the group’s discussions.   More information:  News ""EDA Symposium on Social Media in Security and Defence"" (21 August 2014) "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/11/26/eda-hosts-the-meeting-of-mcdc-executives
EDA_NEWS_0495	2015-11-26	NEWS	Expert Level Course on European Armament Cooperation	" From 23 to 27 November 2015, an Expert Level Course on European Armament Cooperation (EAC) takes place in Warsaw, Poland, to further increase knowledge on armament cooperation, and to foster ties among the community.   The course is organised by the European Defence Agency (EDA), the European Security and Defence College (ESDC) and the Austrian Ministry of Defence (MOD) and Sports, and hosted by the Polish Ministry of Defence. It aims at bringing forward various aspects of armaments cooperation at the EU level. Beyond knowledge development, the course serves as a useful networking platform to foster and to harmonise armaments cooperation among the Member States.  The Expert Level Course constitutes a follow-on to an Awareness Level Module held at the EDA premises from 27 to 29 October 2015. Additionally, in order to attend the courses, it is mandatory to complete an Internet-based Distant Learning (IDL) module offered by the ESDC.  “The EDA is fully committed in supporting Member States with education and training initiatives. The high number of participants to this edition of the course confirms that we are going in the right direction. This course represents an important tool for the European cooperation in the armaments domain”, says Massimo Guasoni, the EDA Head of Education, Training & Exercise Unit. The topics brought on the course agenda include e.g. various aspects of cooperative programmes, research & development in cooperative programmes, harmonisation of the European Military Airworthiness, intercultural aspects in international cooperation and others. Several EDA subject matter experts will share their knowledge and experiences with the course participants.    Background  The European Defence Agency has been working towards establishing a proper training frame in response to the growing needs for harmonised education in the armament acquisition field since 2006. In 2009, the Czech Republic’s EU Presidency supported the creation of a new European armaments cooperation course, providing an EU-wide training platform where a common understanding of a European approach to armaments cooperation could be promoted. The EDA Member States welcomed the initiative and later that year the EDA Steering Board, in the National Armaments Directors configuration, approved the top-level European Armaments Cooperation (EAC) Framework, under which the current course was established. In 2013, thanks to the initiative of Austria and other like-minded countries, including the Czech Republic, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, the course took its current form. It followed the success of the pilot European Armaments Cooperation Course organised in Brussels and Stadtschlaining in 2012.

EDA_NEWS_0496	2015-11-19	NEWS	Maritime Security Conference	" A high level conference to discuss maritime security issues explored challenges arising from the European Union’s Maritime Security Strategy (EUMSS) and its associated Action Plan. The benefits and opportunities for further cooperation also provoked much discussion between the stakeholders and national subject experts who attended. The Maritime Security Conference, conducted by the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Cyprus and the European Defence Agency (EDA), in the framework of the Luxembourg Presidency of the EU Council, was held in Cyprus from 11-13 November. The need for a rapid and coherent EU response to the migrant crisis brought added emphasis to the discussions – only reinforced by the symbolism of hosting the event in a Mediterranean venue. Furthermore, the focus of the topics addressed, such as implementation of the EUMSS, the protection of strategic maritime infrastructure and sea-lines of communication, and the protection and development of ocean wealth, were of high interest to attendees. “For the EDA, the EUMSS was the platform to plug-in its ongoing activities and, where appropriate, to adapt existing initiatives or develop new ones. In the revised Capability Development Plan, ‘Maritime Patrolling and Escorting’ and ‘Maritime Surveillance’ are two priority actions,” said Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency, who was one of the key speakers at the conference and a participant in a panel discussion on the EU Maritime Security Strategy. Peter Round, EDA Capability, Armaments and Technology Director, moderated three panel talks and chaired a round table discussion in which high level stakeholders shared their maritime security challenges and opportunities. “European prosperity, like any economic centre in our global economy, is based on successful exploitation of the sea and, at times, the ability to exert control through the use of force. A reduction in our level of ambition from Open Seas to the Littoral could bring about ‘sea blindness’, shrinking Europe’s sea-going vision to what could be termed a ‘coast guard function’. I’d far rather see us aspire to a ‘sea guard function’ to ensure our ongoing freedom of manoeuvre on the High Seas – i.e.: Sea Power,” he said.  Additionally, the conference included a session dedicated to research and technological aspects of the EUMSS which encompassed the local academic and research communities.    More information:  News ""EDA Continues Mine Counter Measures Activities - Two Maritime Conferences on the Way"" (19 October 2015)  "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/11/19/maritime-security-conference
EDA_NEWS_0497	2015-11-20	NEWS	Unmanned Maritime Systems Conference	 The European Defence Agency together with EuroDefense Deutschland co-organised a conference entitled “Unmanned Maritime Systems – A Key Enabling Technology for the 21st Century Navy”, held at the Representation of Schleswig-Holstein in Berlin.   The conference featured participants from thirteen different nations and had ninety attendees. The conference consisted of three different panels which addressed the pertinent and topical questions in relation to the development and adoption of Unmanned Maritime Systems (UMS). In his opening remarks, Rini Goos, the Deputy Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency (EDA), highlighted the role the EDA plays in the development of capabilities and that the EDA “is the place to go for Member States who are keen to develop defence capabilities through cooperation”. Rear Admiral Kähler, the Chief of Staff at the German Naval Command, provided an opening keynote speech. His address set the tone for the conference, as it outlined the importance of UMS and the need for European cooperation, but, additionally, it contained a word of caution, in that we must not neglect the need for internal and external investments in a time of shrinking budgets. In the broader Unmanned Systems environment, he asserted that many of the technological developments are dual-use in nature, and there are many complimentary features between the civil and military sides.  The conference panels proceeded to address three broad areas relating to UMS, namely the operational concerns on the adoption of UMS, the need for multinational cooperation in overcoming complexity and, finally, a focus on the challenges facing the wider adoption of UMS in terms of classification, safety and regulations.  An interesting theme consistent throughout the conference related to the next steps on the use of UMS. It was emphasised that the current focus of UMS in the area of mine countermeasures is very much a first step and not the end point in itself. Navies must continue to innovate and accept new technologies and this often requires a cultural shift. As Dr Heiko Borchett outlined in his presentation, innovation requires a level of risk tolerance and acceptance, and that it is only by the wider adoption of UMS that we can ensure confidence and reliability in these systems and shift the debate from men vs machine, but rather focus on the men-machine and machine-machine collaborative aspects that will open the door on future uses.  This lead into the second panel discussion, moderated by the EDA Project Officer for Naval Systems, Paul O’Brien. This panel focussed upon some of the areas addressed in the EDA Unmanned Maritime Systems programme, which consists of fifteen coordinated projects and has a monetary value of €56 million. The conference participants were informed of the ongoing efforts to develop technologies to meet the capability requirement for Maritime Mine Countermeasures.  The Capability Armament and Technology Director, Peter Round, moderated the third panel, which focused on the challenges facing the wider adoption of the UMS. This had a particular focus on regulatory aspects and legal classifications.  The conference concluded with a speech from the Cypriot Minister of Defence, Mr Fokaides who provided an overview of the security considerations in the Eastern Mediterranean. In particular, he outlined the importance of the recent discovery of natural resources in the area and stated that these could act as a catalyst for political solutions. He further asserted that UMS technologies and the civil-military dimension have an important role to play.   More information: Unmanned Maritime Systems (UMS) research 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/11/20/unmanned-maritime-systems-conference
EDA_NEWS_0498	2015-11-23	NEWS	EDA-Egmont PhD Prize awarded	" Andrea Gilli received the EDA-Egmont PhD Prize during the European Defence Agency’s (EDA) Annual Conference held on 16 November 2015. The award was handed over by Prof Sven Biscop, Director of “Europe in the World Programme” at the Egmont Institute, and Rini Goos, EDA Deputy Chief Executive.  The biannual EDA-Egmont PhD prize is awarded by the European Defence Agency and the Egmont Institute to academic scholars to stimulate research in the field of European defence, security and strategy. This year’s winner, Andrea Gilli, is a post-doctoral fellow at the Centre for Security Studies, Metropolitan University Prague, and his research on armaments cooperation has received recognition. The awarded thesis is titled “Unipolarity, Technological Change and Arms Manufacturing: Industrial Alliances in the European Defense Industry”. Before handing over the award, Rini Goos, EDA Deputy Chief Executive, raised the issue of the future visions which often combine the practitioner’s and academic perspectives: “The practitioner’s view comes from accumulated experience, realism, pragmatism and an understanding of the practical mechanics of defence and diplomacy. The academic view on the other hand is blessed by being outside the system and provides objectivity, independence, innovation and analysis in a global context. Together, these perspectives provide a complete picture.”  Prof Sven Biscot pointed out that the winner of the prize delivered a very courageous thesis based on an extensive and empirical material, and that it presents very concrete ideas for defence policies.  “It is an honour to be here today to receive this prize and to share the contents of my research with you,” said Andrea Gilli. “In the age of fast technological change and budgetary constraints, we often hear that European countries have to increase their cooperation on future military technologies,” he said and added that such cooperation may be extremely difficult because of “the process of technological disruption”. In his thesis, Gilli dwells upon, among other things, various aspects of cooperation in armaments production, technological advancement as well as implications for the European defence industrial base.   Background EDA-Egmont PhD prize was created in 2013 to stimulate research in the field of European defence, security and strategy. The unique partnership enables Egmont to ensure academic substance while the EDA exposes the research to the heart of the European policy making.

EDA_NEWS_0499	2015-11-18	NEWS	EC and EDA sign agreement on defence-related research	" Investment in research and innovation is at the heart of ensuring a competitive and efficient European defence and technological industrial base. An important step has been taken today with the agreement the European Commission and the European Defence Agency (EDA) signed to dedicate €1.4m to finance a limited number of concrete projects on emerging technologies in defence as well as activities linked to certification for military and civil uses. Jorge Domecq, EDA Chief Executive, said: “Research and Technology is key for defence. The Pilot Project should add value to the ongoing collaboration in research of the Member States. It prepares for bigger initiatives such as the Preparatory Action for Defence Research that will focus on European priorities and address areas where the Member States can no longer act alone and where critical mass needs to be maintained. As such the Pilot Project is an important step towards Europe’s future defence capabilities and a strong and competitive Industrial base.”   This agreement follows an initiative of the European Parliament and is a first agreement between the European Commission and the European Defence Agency.  The European Defence Agency will provide its expertise and will run the projects on behalf, and in close cooperation, with the Commission.  The EDA Steering Board tasked the Agency to support Member States in the setting up of the Commission’s Preparatory Action and recently adopted the modalities of implementation by EDA for the Pilot Project.

EDA_NEWS_0500	2015-11-18	NEWS	Third Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course successfully accomplished	" During the third Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC), aircrew members from across Europe were working hard to master their skills. With successful delivery of the ground and simulator phase at RAF Linton-on-Ouse in the UK, and the phase at Vidsel test range near Lulea in northern Sweden, twelve student instructors from Austria, Germany, Sweden and the UK graduated from the course with Bronze or Silver HTI qualifications, corresponding to their experience and skills level. It was the first case that the HTIC was delivered under an EDA Category B Programme with its own approved Programme Arrangement signed in March 2015 by Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The HTIC as a multinational tactical training course involved four helicopter types: Austrian Kiowa, Swedish Air Force Blackhawk and NH90, Chinook from the UK. It engaged more than one hundred military and civilian staff, and included more than two hundred hours of live flying. The aim of HTIC is to teach experienced helicopter aircrew how to instruct tactics in the air and on the ground. It covers topics such as fighter jets evasion, electronic warfare against surface to air radar threats, convoy escort, vehicle check points and operating in the low-tech threat environment.   A wide range of assets to provide the correct learning environment were required. The excellent support was provided by the Swedish Armed Forces with their Gripen fighter jets from 211 and 212 Squadron, the SK60 trainer aircraft and the ground-based radar defence systems as well as by the UK with their Hawk aircraft from 100 Squadron. For the first time, the Staff Instructors included graduates from the previous courses. The two returning Swedish Instructors prove that the course can be self-sustaining and is able to achieve its aim of developing an internationally recognised cadre of tactics instructors who, in turn, can continue to deliver courses in the future.  The HTIC is a high-value, intensive course that forges close links between all participants, creating a tight-knit community. Experience and knowledge are shared openly and honestly, and working on the principle of adopting best practices, continual improvement and standardisation serve as a constant theme. Everyone works together, harmonising tactics, techniques and procedures, with ever closer interoperability being the final goal. Through this international training, crews prepare for the coalition operations for the future. They train the way they fight so that they can fight the way they have trained – together!  More information:  Helicopter Initiatives project page News ""Third helicopter tactics instructor course launched"" (2 September 2015)  The EAATTC15-3 factsheet is available here More information on the EATF is available here  "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/11/18/third-helicopter-tactics-instructors-course-successfully-accomplished

EDA_NEWS_0502	2015-11-17	NEWS	Outcome EDA Steering Board	 Ministers of Defence today met in the European Defence Agency (EDA) Steering Board, under the chairmanship of Federica Mogherini as the Head of the Agency. The EDA presented progress on the four capability programmes and initial roadmaps for potential future cooperative programmes: Biological Joint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory (Bio-JDEAL), medical evacuation and anti-tank weapons. Minister of Defence also discussed the three year planning framework detailing the Agency’s work plan and priorities for 2016-2018 as well as the resources required to support this.   Three Year Planning Framework and 2016 General Budget Federica Mogherini in her capacity as Head of Agency invited the Steering Board to approve the 2016 EDA General Budget of €33.5m.  Approval of the EDA budget requires unanimity. Despite very positive feedback by Member States on the work and support by the Agency, there was no unanimity on the increased budget. Instead, the budget will remain at this year’s level – €30.5m (zero growth).   Implementation of Key Taskings and Next Steps Ministers of Defence welcomed the progress achieved in the four capability programmes: Air-to-Air Refuelling, cyber defence, governmental satellite communications, Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems. Given the increasingly volatile and challenging security environment in and around Europe it is equally important that other critical capability priorities as identified in the Capability Development Plan also be addressed. Potential future cooperative activities require guidance to avoid fragmentation, focus future investment and give clarity to defence industry. Ministers of Defence have today adopted the initial roadmaps for potential future cooperative programmes as proposed by the Agency: Biological Joint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory (Bio-JDEAL), Medevac and Anti-Tank Weapons. Bio-JDEAL: The proliferation of biological agents means the biological threat to Member States’ forces employed on operations remains real. Furthermore, the use of biological weapons or devices, particularly by non-state actors, can have a disproportionate effect on morale. Enhancing CBRN capabilities in operations has been outlined in the Agency’s Capability Development Plan as a priority action. In order to counter these threats and assess the risk of exposure, a biological laboratory which could be deployed at short notice by a Member State would be able to: Conduct unambiguous in-theatre biological threat identification; Provide threat information to Command, enhancing the protection of EU forces and local populations and thus limiting casualties; Maintain Member States’ freedom of movement and action. Following today’s approval, the roadmap foresees start of the expert group’s work still this year with a view to producing a Common Staff Target by the end of 2016 and a possible project launch by the end of 2017. So far, eight Member States (Luxembourg, Slovakia, Romania, Germany, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Spain, Italy) and Norway have expressed interest in this project.   Medevac: Effective medical evacuation is a fundamental requirement for any military operation. Cooperation, interoperability, as well as common training, is paramount for Member States to constitute reliable MEDEVAC capabilities. As with the previous proposal, enhancing this capability is a priority action of the Capability Development Plan which was endorsed by Member States. Following Minister’s endorsement, the work will start with a study on “Interoperability in Forward Aeromedical Evacuation with Rotary Wing” which will be launched this year. Based on the outcome of the study, the Agency will make proposals on possible interoperability activities and training. This work builds on interest shown by seven Member States (Luxembourg, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Austria, Finland, Germany, the Czech Republic and Italy).   Anti-tank weapons: Anti-Tank capabilities are still of fundamental importance in the context of National security strategies. Some Member States still have in service equipment designed in the late 1970s which will become obsolete in the near future; they will need to consider upgrade or replacement of their systems. Others are willing to address the anti-tank weapon gap by developing new capability requirements potentially through joint procurement programmes. To move ahead quickly, the Agency will together with Member States evaluate possible urgent requirements for commercial off-the-shelf solutions still in 2015. This project represents also a quick win opportunity for Pooling & Sharing. Anti-tank is a domain where work will build on interest shown by nine Member States (Estonia, Romania, Finland, Sweden, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, Greece, Latvia) and Norway.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/11/17/outcome-eda-steering-board
EDA_NEWS_0503	2015-11-16	NEWS	EDA Annual Conference: the second part	" The second part of the European Defence Agency (EDA) Annual Conference held on 16 November 2015 was built around a question on research opportunities at the EU level. Prior to the fruitful discussions on various aspects of research and the “dual-use” concept, the floor was taken by Mr Conrad Bruch, Director of Defence at the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs of Luxembourg, who represented Etienne Schneider, Vice-Minister, Minister of Economy & Minister of Minister of Defence: “We welcome work on a global strategy that will encompass all the tools at our disposal to create a stronger and more secure Europe,” he said and continued: “We need to become more effective in facing crisis, we have the right tools and structures at our disposal,” he said, also mentioning the role of the European Defence Agency. Special addresses Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary General, and Federica Mogherini, Head of the European Defence Agency, High Representative and Vice-President of the European Commission, marked their presence during the conference and delivered special addresses. “We cannot afford to act without a rational strategy and a vision what we want to achieve and how we want to get there,” said Federica Mogherini about the upcoming global strategy, stating that defence and security will be part of each chapter. High Representative also emphasised the European Defence Agency’s achievements in terms of capability development. A common element of speeches of both Federica Mogherini and Jens Stoltenberg was the focus placed on the EU-NATO complementarity and partnership in facing common challenges. As NATO Secretary General stated: “European security is interconnected”. He also emphasised that determination for closer cooperation is on both sides: “it is not something we should do but something we must do.” Roundtable 2 „New research opportunities at EU level: a game changer for the industry?” The discussions of the second roundtable were steered by Michel Barnier, Special Adviser to the European Commission President on defence matters, Antoine Bouvier, President & Chief Executive Officer of MBDA Millie Systems, Ana Gomes, Member of the European Parliament and Tassos Rozolis, Chief Executive Officer of AKMON and Chairman of the Hellenic Manufacturers of Defence and Security Material Association. The speakers were especially referring to the reduced  funding of European defence research as well as the Preparatory Action, which is expected to include financing defence research by the EU budget for the first time in history. “No Member State has the means to ensure the full capability spectrum,” admitted Michel Barnier. Antoine Bouvier drew attention to the need of identifying the level of ambition and “set a new dynamics in Research & Technology”. Also Ana Gomes stated there is a need for political will that will be translated into concrete programmes. Tassos Rozolis called for an industrial strategy so that “the industry knows where it should go” and underlined the importance of practical implications of the programmes that shall lead to procurements.

EDA_NEWS_0504	2015-11-17	NEWS	“European Defence Matters”: EDA annual rendez-vous	" On 16 November 2015, the European Defence Agency (EDA) conduced its Annual Conference to address most up-to-date questions on the condition of European defence, and to propose a way ahead in various defence-related areas.   Hosted at the Brussels’ Albert Hall, the conference gathered about 400 frontline leader and decision-makers in European defence from the worlds of military, politics, industry and academics. The conference began with one minute of silence to pay tribute to the victims of terror attacks in Paris on 13 November 2015.  Welcome speeches  Jorge Domecq, the EDA Chief Executive urged for more cooperation in defence: “it needs to be part of our DNA,” and the necessity to underpin a political will by actions: “We will only be able to adequately respond if the Union’s foreign policy ambitions are backed by the right defence capabilities at the right time, supplied by a globally competitive and technologically advanced industrial base in Europe.” Elżbieta Bieńkowska, the European Commissioner for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and Small Medium Sized Enterprises (SME), a keynote speaker, stressed that Europe is able to provide security and contribute to international peace and stability. She underlined the importance of synergies between defence and industry. She also presented the EU Commission’s  approach to defence, the work plan to follow as well as some ideas for stimulating defence research. Among other things, she insisted on reversing declines in spending to stimulate research: “European funding of research priorities can be a strong tool to bring all relevant actors together.” Roundtable talks on defence capabilities  During the first roundtable discussions Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, Minister of Defence of the Netherlands, General Mikhail Kostarakos, (designate) Chairman of the EU Military Committee, Giovanni Soccodato,  Executive Vice President Strategy of the Markets and Business Development at Finmeccanica and Daniel Koštoval, Deputy Minister for Armaments and Acquisition of the Czech Republic, shared their ideas on how to improve EU defence capabilities.  Among the conclusions of the vivid discussions, there was a need formulated to noticeably increase defence cooperation and restrain from spending in national isolation on defence capabilities. The lack of a proper political guidance as well as too much of a national focus were recognised as prime reasons for a too slow-paced progress in terms of cooperative capabilities development. A financial aspect and a popular phrase “doing more with less” was considered outdated by the speakers who underlined the gravity of European defence capabilities. In this context, a new financial instrument, the VAT exemption for EDA-led programmes and projects, was accessed positively. Second part of the conference The second part of the conference initiated Conrad Bruch, Director of Defence at the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs of Luxembourg, who took the floor on behalf of Etienne Schneider, Vice-Minister, Minister of Economy & Minister of Minister of Defence: “We welcome work on a global strategy that will encompass all the tools at our disposal to create a stronger and more secure Europe,” he said. He also emphasised that closer cooperation is necessary to avoid threats and challenges to “come closer”, and gave examples of  Luxembourg’s involvement in cooperative projects and missions.  Special addresses  The highlight of the annual conference were two special addresses delivered by Federica Mogherini, Head of the European Defence Agency, High Representative and Vice-President of the European Commission, and Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary General. Both prominent guests emphasised solidarity, partnership of the EU and NATO as well as the need to stand united to face the current threats. The both condemned the terrorist attacks conducted on 13 November 2015 in Paris. “We will strengthen our resolve,” Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary General, stated.  “We cannot afford to act without a rational strategy and a vision what we want to achieve and how we want to get there,” said Federica Mogherini about a global strategy for Europe that is currently being prepared. As she admitted, defence and security will be part of each chapter. Federica Mogherini also stated that the EU is a security provider for many and it is ready to mobilise all the instruments, including the military ones. She reassured the need to cooperate with the EU neighbours and emphasised the relations with NATO.  “There is no security without defence, there is no defence without capabilities and no capabilities without industry,” said Federica Mogherini addressing the capability dimension of defence and stressed the important role of the European Defence Agency when it comes to deepening cooperation and capability development.  Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary General stated that “security is interconnected” and reassured that both organisations are determined to develop closer cooperation. He also listed possible areas for stronger partnership, including countering hybrid threats or helping partners in neighbourhood. “We share the same values and commitment to freedom, democracy and human rights. Those valued are under threat; this is what we saw in Paris on Friday. Those values must be defended by us. That is why we work together and that is why we will take our cooperation to the next level: not just side by side but also hand in hand,” said Jens Stoltenberg about the EU-NATO partnership.   Roundtable talks on defence research The second and also the last panel discussion of the Annual Conference brought defence research on the agenda. Recognised as a key factor for capability development, defence research funding has experienced a significant decrease in the recent years. Along with the Preparatory Action, the EU might finance defence research for the first time in history, which may steer research development.  The experts – Michel Barnier, Special Adviser to the European Commission President on defence matters, Antoine Bouvier, President & Chief Executive Officer of MBDA Millie Systems, Ana Gomes, Member of the European Parliament and Tassos Rozolis, Chief Executive Officer of AKMON and Chairman of the Hellenic Manufacturers of Defence and Security Material Association – discussed the requirements to set the level of ambition in Research & Technology and to define a way ahead. They also stressed the need to translate political will into concrete programmes and procurements in order to help a strong European defence industry base to develop. Ideas of balancing the co-existence of Small Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) and big players as well as the implications of dual-use technologies were also widely discussed.  A final word ""There is no alternative to defence cooperation,"" said Jorge Domecq, the EDA Chief Executive, in a summary for this year’s Annual Conference. He also underlined the necessity of better spending of available resources and supporting industry in order to develop a strong European industry base.   More information  EDA website on Annual Conference 2015  "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/11/17/-european-defence-matters-eda-annual-rendez-vous
EDA_NEWS_0505	2015-11-16	NEWS	The first part of EDA Annual Conference	" The first part of this year’s European Defence Agency's (EDA) Annual Conference “European Defence Matters” has been accomplished. Prominent decision-makers and frontline leaders in European defence from the worlds of military, politics, industry and academics met on 16 November 2015 to discuss European defence. The conference participants observed one minute of silence to pay tribute to the victims of terror attacks in Paris on 13 November 2015. In the light of these tragic events, the discussion on European defence has been given a very realistic dimension, proving that European defence does matter. “Crisis situations are not reducing; they are on the increase. The demand for the EU to act as a security provider will continue to increase. We will only be able to adequately respond to this if the Union’s foreign policy ambitions are backed by the right defence capabilities at the right time, supplied by a globally competitive and technologically advanced industrial base in Europe,” said Jorge Domecq, the EDA Chief Executive. He also underlined the necessity to underpin political will by actions, and to translate it into military objectives. Jorge Domecq stressed that “Cooperation in defence is not a natural reflex. It needs to become so: to be part of our DNA.” Keynote Speech A keynote speech was delivered by Elżbieta Bieńkowska, the European Commissioner for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and Small Medium Sized Enterprises (SME). She underlined the importance of synergies between defence and industry. She also presented the Commission’s approach to defence, the work plan to follow as well as some ideas for stimulating defence research. Elżbieta Bieńkowska stressed that Europe is able to provide security and contribute to international peace and stability. Regarding research, she insisted on reversing declines in spending to stimulate research: “European funding of research priorities can be a strong tool to bring all relevant actors together.” ""We will only be successful if we are work together: the Commission, the European Parliament, the European Defence Agency, the European External Action Service and the Member States and industry,” she concluded. Roundtable 1: „European defence capabilities: what’s next?” The first roundtable discussions on the European defence cooperation and capabilities were led by prominent guests: Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, Minister of Defence of the Netherlands, General Mikhail Kostarakos, (designate) Chairman of the EU Military Committee, Giovanni Soccodato,  Executive Vice President Strategy of the Markets and Business Development at Finmeccanica and Daniel Koštoval, Deputy Minister for Armaments and Acquisition of the Czech Republic. The panel discussion raised the question of the future of European defence capabilities. Moreover, defence cooperation was analysed from a political, military and industrial viewpoint. Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert assessed that “we do not need more wake-up calls” and insisted that the only way to protect national sovereignty through military means is by defence cooperation. She also called for sharing plans for capability development plans among the Member States. General Mikhail Kostarakos drew attention to the defence spending stating that “to do more with less” is no longer a good solution as it may lead to loosing combat capabilities. Daniel Koštoval emphasised that “a political will is required to allocate more money to defence and formulate where we are going”. He also identified the need to maintain “balanced armies” taking into consideration the whole spectrum, the light and heavy equipment.  Giovanni Soccodato stressed the need for a common European market and a proper environment  for defence industry to consolidate. The speakers recognised an important role of the European Defence Agency to play in terms of capability development.

EDA_NEWS_0507	2015-11-04	NEWS	VAT Exemption: New Incentive for Defence Cooperation	" Member States can as of now profit from VAT exemption for projects run by the European Defence Agency (EDA). The recently adopted revised Council Decision defining the statute, seat and operational rules of the EDA includes the clause that cooperative defence projects and programmes are exempt from VAT as long as the Agency adds value to the initiative.  “The VAT exemption is a strong incentive to European defence cooperation: it generates an attractive business case for cooperative projects and programmes in the framework of the EDA. We will soon propose roadmaps for potential future cooperative programmes for which Member States will be able to benefit from the VAT exemption and thus achieve considerable savings”, comments Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency. With the entering into force of the revised Council Decision on 13 October, the new provision can be applied immediately for any new EDA initiative meeting the Decision’s conditions. VAT exemption is not linked to the nature of the activity. It can thus be applied to any project and programme where the Agency adds value ranging from technical expertise, pooling demand, building a multinational capability or synergies with EU wider policies, promoting interoperability to full administrative and contractual management of a cooperative initiative. Member States are and remain the end-users of the capability.    Concrete savings “While the VAT exemption should not be the driver for defence cooperation, tight defence budgets limit investment in research, innovation and capabilities. Any breathing space is appreciated. By incentivising defence cooperation financially, we will be able to do more and better together”, says Jorge Domecq. One of the projects the VAT exemption will be immediately applied to is the EU SatCom Market, an EDA project where the Agency provides for satellite communication services for currently eleven Member States and the Athena mechanism. The EDA is responsible for procurement and contract tasks, manages orders as well as payments and provides technical advice as needed and thus adds clear technical and administrative value to the project. As a consequence, each order – which comes from Member States individually or by groups – benefits from VAT exemption.  One Member State has for example recently submitted an order of about 1.3 million Euros for one year of services. Due to the VAT exemption, this Member State will not have to pay VAT for a corresponding value of 273 thousand Euros which represents about three months of free services. Legal basis The Council Decision defining the statute, seat and operational rules of the EDA (Council Decision (CFSP) 2015/1835) was adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council on 12 October 2015. It foresees that VAT exemption applies to activities where the role of the Agency in administering projects or programmes in support of Member States brings an added value.  The legal basis for VAT exemption are Protocol No 7 of the EU Treaties on the privileges and immunities of the European Union and Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax. The VAT exemption is compliant with EU law; and is not market distorting.   Background The European Defence Agency was set-up in 2004 to support the Council and the Member States in their effort to improve the European Union’s defence capabilities for the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). This means running and supporting cooperative European defence projects; supporting research and technology development; boosting the European defence technological and industrial base; and working on wider EU policies.   More information: News ""Guide to VAT exemption now available!""

EDA_NEWS_0508	2015-10-20	NEWS	Consultation for sustainable energy in defence and security launched	" The European Commission and the European Defence Agency (EDA) launched the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector today. The Consultation Forum highlights the importance of energy and energy security as a defence capability. Its aim is to examine how energy efficiency measures and renewable energy sources might be better implemented within the European defence sector.  “Europe’s armed forces are continuously working towards improving their energy efficiency as well as energy security. The consultation now offers an opportunity to explore important areas of energy policy implementation which will be of benefit to the armed forces as well as the EU as a whole. It also confirms the Agency’s unique position as interface between armed forces, European institutions as well as the expert community“, said Jorge Domecq, EDA Chief Executive, at the occasion of the consultation’s launch.  ""The Consultation Forum is part of a wider EU action to bring energy efficiency in all areas, including in the defence and security sector, allowing the sector to be a more competitive and efficient and to reap the full benefit of single market. The sector has a strong interest in reducing its energy footprint and could thus make an important contribution to the Union’s energy targets"", said Paul Hodson, Head of Energy Efficiency Unit in the Energy Directorate General in the European Commission.  The Consultation Forum brings together European experts from the energy and the defence sectors with the aim to deliver benefits in support of the European Commission’s energy efficiency and renewable policies.  The Consultation Forum is divided into three working groups. The first examines the management and behavioural aspects of energy efficiency. The second tackles energy efficiency in relation to infrastructure primarily, but also in wider defence estate and – on request of Member States – in deployed camps within Europe and EU operations as well as other military platforms. The third addresses the use and production of renewable energy sources.  All in all, it is estimated that 120 defence policy and planning as well as engineering and logistics experts plus representatives from academia, industry and national ministries will contribute to the work. The first plenary session of the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector will take place on 14-15 January  2016 in Brussels.      Background  The work is conducted under the umbrella of EDA’s Energy and Environment programme. The programme is designed to identify areas of common interest for European armed forces as well as to create and understand the framework for a comprehensive approach to energy management for military forces. The programme also aims to identify fully integrated solutions where both energy reduction and environmental impact are assessed together. The EDA Energy and Environment Working Group was established in June 2014 and has so far worked on a number of projects including the Strategic Research Agenda, a Demand Management (Smart Camp) Technical Demonstrator which has recently been deployed to Mali and Power Purchase Agreements (Go Green).    More information: Energy & Environment project page Dedicated website on the Consultation Forum "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/10/20/consultation-for-sustainable-energy-in-defence-and-security-launched
EDA_NEWS_0509	2015-10-27	NEWS	Increasing awareness of European Armament Cooperation	" From 27 to 29 October 2015, an Awareness Level Module of the European Armament Cooperation Course (EAC) is taking place at the European Defence Agency’s premises. Organised by the European Defence Agency (EDA), the European Security and Defence College (ESDC) and the Austrian Ministry of Defence (MOD) and Sports, the course has attracted the highest number of attendees in its four-year history. Forty-six enrolled students represent thirteen EDA Member States, the European Commission, European External Action Service (EEAS) and Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR).  The aim of the EAC course is to enhance mutual understanding of the armaments cooperation issues and to serve as a useful networking platform to foster and harmonise armaments cooperation among the Member States. Most of all, it addresses junior personnel who need to gain knowledge and experience in international acquisition and project management. The course also complements the curriculums of available national courses. “We believe that the practitioners who work in national and international armament cooperation can highly profit from the course. We are able to provide them with practical knowledge and understanding of the armament sector along with its frameworks, the stakeholders’ tools and processes as well as challenges and benefits available at the EU level,” says Massimo Guasoni, the EDA Head of Unit Education, Training & Exercise. Towards Europe’s strategic autonomy  Rini Goos, the EDA Deputy Chief Executive, welcomed the course participants and, in his speech, he pointed out the key elements for European strategic autonomy and freedom of action: “Apart from working on capabilities, first of all, we must strive to enhance investment in traditional defence research, particularly in collaborative Research & Technology. Secondly, we need a sound European industrial policy. Thirdly, I would like to mention standardisation: a pan-European standardisation approach is the key to increase European competiveness on a global scale and to strengthen the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base Strategy; it is also the main driver for interoperability. And last but not least, civil-military ‘dual-use’ synergies need to be better exploited. It is only if we move ahead along these four strands of work that Europe will be able to attain strategic autonomy and become a security provider rather than a security consumer”.   Dr Wolfgang Sagmeister from the Austrian MOD being the Course Director will make sure that all the course objectives will have been met. The topics on the agenda are much varied and include the presentations of the EDA and the ESDC; military dimension of the Common Security and Defence Policy; EU military capability development along with the EDA Capability Development Plan, current trends in military defence capability development; intercultural aspects in international cooperation; EU Defence policies in a wider context, and other.   The EAC course traditionally comprises two parts: an Awareness Level Module taking place in Brussels, and an Expert Level Course, which will be held from 23 to 27 November 2015 in Warsaw, Poland. However, in order to attend the course, it is mandatory to complete an Internet-based Distant Learning (IDL) module offered by the ESDC.  Shaping an educational platform Since 2006, the EDA had been working towards establishing a proper training frame in response to the growing needs for harmonised education in the armament acquisition field. In 2009, the Czech Republic’s EU Presidency supported the creation of a new European armaments cooperation course, providing an EU-wide training platform where a common understanding of a European approach to armaments cooperation could be promoted. The EDA Member States welcomed the initiative and later that year the EDA Steering Board, in the National Armaments Directors configuration, approved the top-level European Armaments Cooperation (EAC) Framework, under which the current course was established. In 2013, thanks to the initiative of Austria and other like-minded countries, including the Czech Republic, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, the course took its current form. It followed the success of the pilot European Armaments Cooperation Course organised in Brussels and Stadtschlaining in 2012.

EDA_NEWS_0510	2015-10-19	NEWS	Practical training in Test & Evaluation Collaboration	 On 13-14 October 2015, the European Defence Agency (EDA) organised the Test & Evaluation (T&E) Collaboration Workshop to bring the concept of T&E Collaboration support closer to the Member States and, for the first time, to provide practical training in cooperation mechanisms and available tools.  Representatives of six Member States participated in the training event, i.e. Cyprus, Greece, Germany, Ireland, Romania, and the United Kingdom. The workshop was directed to national test centres, project managers and coordinators who may request the EDA T&E Collaboration support.  The workshop’s agenda covered the whole package of available tools, not only the Defence Test and Evaluation Base (DTEB). Additionally, it offered practical training opportunities with exercises and tests to improve the understanding of the T&E Collaboration operation.  The workshop started with the theory part, during which the participants were presented with how the EDA T&E Collaboration works, along with some way ahead for the future. The practical part of the training included live exercises with the use of dedicated support tools. In particular, the Defence Test and Evaluation Base (DTEB) was used for initiating cooperation, the Collaboration Database (CODOBA) tool for the management of the cooperation, and the Capability Development Plan (CDP)  for capability implications. Additionally, the training touched upon the standardisation aspects in accordance with the European Defence Standards Reference System (EDSTAR).  The workshop participants discussed the utility of support tools and the practical ways of cooperation under the different schemes, e.g. test arrangements, Category A/B projects, working groups and EDSTAR expert groups. “The  constructive feedback from the participants will enable us to further optimise the tools and make them as user-friendly as possible,” said Thomas Honke, an EDA project officer on T&E, Qualification and Standardisation. The T&E Collaboration Workshop ended with an official hand-over ceremony of certificates.  The EDA plans to offer further annual T&E collaboration training events using this format. Background The European Defence Agency has taken up the initiative of supporting European Test and Evaluation (T&E) Collaboration in 2013 in a systematic approach. Since that time, the DTEB database has been created enabling enhanced networking amongst T&E facilities and capabilities in Europe. The database is additionally linked to the EDSTAR, CODABA and CDP tools in order to allow swift identification of potential cooperation opportunities and future T&E capability requirements for common staff targets. Moreover, the EDA has initiated a crosscutting T&E expert group in EDSTAR to identify best practice T&E standardisation and to further stimulate T&E cooperation.

EDA_NEWS_0511	2015-10-13	NEWS	EDA provides satellite communications services for EUTM Somalia	" As of 1 October, the European Defence Agency (EDA) has taken over the provision of Satellite Communications (SatCom) services for the EU Training Mission (EUTM) in Somalia. EUTM Somalia is the first CSDP military mission to draw on the option of the Agency to cover its requirement for SatCom services. Earlier this year, Athena - the mechanism established to finance CSDP military operations - joined the Agency’s EU SatCom Market as part of its efforts to improve the procurement process of the different operations.  Through the Agency, the mission benefits from a strategic link between Somalia and Europe. The services include rental, shipping and installation of a C-band remote terminal in Mogadishu International Airport as well as a high data rate unclassified satellite link with anchoring in Europe. The services include also 24/7 technical support and on site-intervention if required. In the coming months, the Agency will also take over the provision of Mobile Satellite Services for the operations EUNAVFOR Atalanta, EUTM Mali and EUTM Somalia as well as ATHENA Central. Speaking about the cooperation, Brigadier General Antonio Maggi, EUTM Somalia Operation Commander said: “Thanks to the excellent cooperation between the EUTM J6 team, EDA and the contractor, EUTM Somalia will benefit from a reliable and secure connection with Europe for its Command and Control chain.” EDA’s Chief Executive, Jorge Domecq added: “Supporting CSDP operations is one of the core missions of the EDA. I am confident this first example will pave the way for other CSDP military operations to make extensive use of all the support the Agency can provide.” EUTM Somalia On 10 April 2010, the European Union launched a military training mission in Somalia (EUTM Somalia) in order to contribute to strengthening the Federal Government and the institutions of Somalia. This support is part of the EU's comprehensive engagement in Somalia, which aims to support stabilising the country and to respond to the needs of the Somali people. Since 2010, EUTM Somalia has contributed to the training of approximately 3,600 Somali soldiers with a focus on the training of Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs), Junior Officers, specialists and trainers.  EU SatCom Market Within the EU SatCom Market project, EDA acts as the central purchasing body on behalf of the contributing members. It purchases the services from a commercial provider. The project uses a ‘pay-per-use’ model, so members do not have to contribute with regular fees, instead they only pay for what they order. Since May 2013, 24 orders have been passed for a total value of around €4 million. Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxemburg, Portugal, Romania, the United Kingdom and the Athena Mechanism are members of the project. Further participation is open to all EDA participating Member States as well as all entities entitled to take part in Agency activities. The Athena Mechanism Athena is the mechanism established to administer the financing of the common costs of European Union operations having military or defence implications governed by Council Decision 2015/528/CFSP. The Council Decision allows for arrangements to be signed with union bodies to facilitate procurement in operations in the most cost-effective manner.   More information News ""EDA supports EUTM Mali to enhance medical facilities"" (8 September 2015) News ""Athena joins EU Satcom Market"" (18 June 2015) News: ""EDA signs cooperation arrangement with Athena"" (2 March 2015) EU SatCom Market project page Operations Support project page  "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/10/13/eda-provides-satellite-communications-services-for-eutm-somalia
EDA_NEWS_0512	2015-10-19	NEWS	EDA Continues Mine Counter Measures Activities - Two Maritime Conferences on the Way	 The European Defence Agency (EDA) is continuing to promote maritime affairs and to develop, with Member States, the next generation of mine counter measure solutions via the successful delivery of Unmanned Maritime Systems projects.  The latest of the fifteen coordinated projects to be successfully delivered, that comprise the Unmanned Maritime Systems (UMS) Programme, one of the largest in the Agency, is the SIRAMIS project. This Dutch-led project, consisted of seven Contributing Members and addressed the knowledge gap of ship signatures with the overall aim of understanding ship signature interaction with multi-influence mines at a close range. This project presented a considerable challenge for the consortium, which comprised of industry, national research centres and academia, both in terms of signature measurement and signature analysis. It also placed an emphasis on cooperation and mutual support, which are the hallmarks of the EDA projects.  With the successful delivery of this project, plans are at an advanced stage for a follow-on project that will build on the advancements already made and will further address the modelling and simulation dimensions. A feature of the UMS programme is the coordination between projects, and the developments and gains made have positive implications for the follow-on Modular Lightweight Mine Sweeping project that will be launched shortly.  Maritime Conferences The EDA is co-organising two conferences on maritime topics. These conferences present an opportunity to engage with key stakeholders and to fully explore and address the pertinent issues relating to the maritime domain.  The first conference will be held on 29th October 2015 in Berlin and is co-organised with EuroDefense Deutschland. The conference will focus on key questions that relate to UMS and principally address the operational perspective of the introduction of UMS, collaborative efforts resulting in technological advancements and, lastly, the area of legislation, safety and regulation will be explored.   The second conference will take place on the 12/13 November 2015 in Nicosia and is co-organised with the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Cyprus. The conference will be  conducted within the framework of the Luxembourg Presidency of the European Council. The focus of the conference will be on the Maritime Security Strategy and it will explore the challenges and potential benefits of the implementation of the strategy via its action plan. In particular, the conference will address Europe’s sea lines of communication and the challenges facing European navies. It will also examine the potential of the strategy to be considered as a catalyst for Civilian Military coordination.

EDA_NEWS_0517	2015-10-01	NEWS	European Air Transport Symposium unites experts in Vienna	" From 1 to 2 October, the 2015 European Air Transport Symposium will take place in Vienna. Hosted by the Austrian Ministry of Defence and Sport and ran by the European Defence Agency (EDA), the symposium will bring together around 80 participants from the European Member States’ air transport community. The focus of the event is on improving operations and training from the operator’s perspective. The delegates will discuss several operational and training challenges with a single objective of tangibly improving European air transport interoperability. “The 2015 Symposium is the sixth to be organised by EDA in support of the European Air Transport Fleet Programme and builds on the success of the other air transport training events we have ran over 2015 in France, Italy, Portugal and Spain.  My thanks go to the Austrian Ministry of Defence and Sport for hosting what I am sure will be another excellent event”, said Roland Van Reybroeck, EDA’s Director for Cooperation Planning and Support Brigadier General Karl Gruber, Austria’s Air Chief, said, “It is a very honourable task for the Austrian Armed Forces to host the 2015 Symposium in our capital Vienna. In times of limited resources, but permanently growing mission challenges, cooperation will play a decisive role to maintain our operational freedom of action. One of the most important cooperation fields is military air transport, enabling us to project our forces and to sustain operations, even when civil transport and ATC systems are no longer available. The Symposium offers an excellent opportunity, to discuss our common challenges and concerns.""   EDA continues to build strong links with the Europe’s air power experts across a range of capabilities. The air transport programme remains vibrant with plans to further expand a range of training opportunities over 2015 and to establish a European Air Transport Training Centre in Zaragoza Spain by the end of 2016.   Background The European Air Transport Fleet project (EATF) is designed to improve airlift provision within the European Union. EATF provides a flexible and inclusive partnership for national and multinational military air transport fleets and organisations in Europe. It addresses the way different air transport assets are acquired, operated, supported, and managed to ensure this is done in the most efficient way possible. The long term vision of the EATF is to establish a robust network linking various European air transport entities aiming at the efficient employment of all present and future air transport capabilities made available by the participating Member States for military needs, regardless of type or origin.  Deliverables of the EATF are among others yearly training events (European Air Transport Training) and life airlift courses (European Airlift Tactics Training Course) as well as the European Air Transport Symposium.   More information  More information on the EATF is available here.

EDA_NEWS_0518	2015-10-02	NEWS	Last contract of CBRN Joint Investment Programme signed	" On 2 October 2015, the last out of fourteen chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) protection projects within the Joint Investment Programme CBRN (JIP CBRN) was signed by Henk Geveke, Director TNO Defence and Security, on behalf of the consortium, and Rini Goos, Deputy Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency (EDA). The signatures give way to the project “RACED”, which aims at enhancement of decontamination (DECON) procedures of material or equipment exposed to chemical or biological warfare agents. It will focus on a scientific and technological consideration of the complex question of “how clean is clean enough?” The “RACED"" project will assess DECON procedures and, finally, will result in a prototype of a tool that shall assist operational commanders in minimizing the after-decontamination exposure risk, and assist them in making decisions on the assessment of the sufficient level of DECON, remaining hazards in terms of exposure to human beings and necessity of taking additional steps.  “RACED” will be conducted by a consortium led by TNO from the Netherlands with partners coming from four more Member States and Norway: FFI (Norway), ITQB (Portugal) LBDB (Portugal), ACMIT (Austria), ADL (Austria), RMA (Belgium) and SUJCHBO (Czech Republic). The project is one of fourteen projects under the EDA Joint Investment Programme CBRN protection (JIP-CBRN), set up as Category A programme and funded by twelve Member States plus Norway with almost 12 million euro budget. It serves as an EDA contribution for the European Framework Cooperation, a joint effort of the European Commission and the EDA on maximising synergies between civilian and defence-related research activities. The JIP-CBRN Programme Arrangement was signed in March 2012 on the ministerial level and two calls for proposals were conducted in 2012 and 2013, covering various Research &Technology projects within the CBRN area, such as: stand-off detection for chemical agents, point detection of biological agents, unknown samples handling, modelling & simulation of CBRN architectures, decontamination, protection equipment and sensor networking. With seven projects initiated within the first call frame, one has already been accomplished. This year, the “Biotype” project successfully ended with a demonstrator device with an integrated biosensor for point detection of airborne bio-threats based on anti-body lab on a chip technology.

EDA_NEWS_0519	2015-10-07	NEWS	Towards an open architecture for military land vehicles	" Thirty two participants representing eleven countries and twenty-four industrial and governmental organisations met for the second edition of the European Reference Open Architecture Standard for a Modern Integrated Electronic Mission System in Military Land Vehicles (LAVOSAR II) workshop, held at the European Defence Agency (EDA) on 9 July 2015.  Very positive comments after the first LAVOSAR workshop organised in 2014 resulted in the continuation of an initiative to promote and develop an open architecture standard for military land vehicles. It is important to underline the fact that previously involved industry unanimously supported the idea and joined in for the second session. Whilst LAVOSAR I focused mainly on mission systems of land vehicles of participating member states, LAVOSAR II went one step further to specify in more detail areas not covered before, e.g. selected aspects of maintenance and logistics. Several work packages which are currently under investigation in the ongoing LAVOSAR II study were incorporated in the workshop agenda. These included elements such as Architectural Domain Analysis and Requirements, Workflow and Procedure Update, Through Live Capability, Open Reference Architecture Standards Update, Alignment with NATO General Vehicle Architecture (NGVA) and Architecture Contribution to the EDA Repository. An important aspect of the LAVOSAR project is how it dovetails with NATO General Vehicle Architecture (NGVA) standardization efforts. As highlighted by Member States at the CapTech Ground Systems meetings, the LAVOSAR work should  complement other international organisations’ efforts regarding the construction of an efficient open architecture Marek Kalbarczyk, EDA moderator of the CapTech stressed the importance of the initiative: “Implementation of open architecture to mission systems for land vehicles would bring not only whole life cost savings of between 10 - 25% to Member States, but would also simplify logistics and increase operational functionalities.” Lively and fruitful discussions held throughout the workshop added substantial value to the ongoing LAVOSAR II study and will be integrated in the study results to advance work in the open architecture domain.

EDA_NEWS_0520	2015-09-25	NEWS	Exploring hybrid threats	 The European External Action Service (EEAS), in the framework of the Luxembourg Presidency and in cooperation with the European Military Staff and Crisis Management and Planning Directorate, organised a conference on Countering Hybrid Threats, held on 24 September 2015. Jorge Domecq, the European Defence Agency (EDA) Chief Executive was among the keynote speakers to present the EDA work and priorities regarding tackling hybrid threats.  The opening remarks were delivered by HE Ambassador Stephan Müller, the Luxembourg Representative to the Political and Security Committee (PSC), whereas the keynote speeches were presented by Mr Maciej Popowski, the EEAS Deputy Secretary General, Jorge Domecq, the EDA Chief Executive, and a representative of the Space, Policy, Copernicus and Defence Diractorate of the European Commission. “One thing is certain, hybrid warfare poses a significant challenge to the EU, its citizens and its interests, and time is of the essence to develop a joint approach to effectively tackle hybrid threats,” said Jorge Domecq and presented three main areas the EDA activities are currently focused on. In particular, Jorge Domecq indicated capability development, civil-military synergies and EU-NATO relations. The EDA Chief Executive announced the upcoming EDA-led war-gaming exercise in February 2016 that shall stress-test available defence capabilities against hybrid threats. “The aim is not to re-invent and come up with a set of new capabilities, instead, the exercise will allow us to see where extra attention is needed and how the capability that exists should be used,” he explained. Moreover, Jorge Domecq underlined the necessity of dual use within Research & Technology domain to avoid “spending twice”, thus to enhance civil-military synergy. Additionally, he emphasised the EU-NATO complementary approach in both directions regarding countering hybrid threats, claiming that this is “not an option, but an absolute need”. Jorge Domecq’s speech, along with the two other keynote presentations, provided solid grounds for fruitful discussions continued in three panels, which were devoted to various aspects of facing hybrid threats. Among a number of topics raised, the conference participants dwelled upon identifying vulnerabilities hybrid warfare makes use of, shaping awareness of hybrid threats, resilience and deterrence against possible threats, aspects of information sharing  or EU-NATO cooperation. As a matter of fact, Roland van Reybroeck, the EDA Director Cooperation Planning and Support was a speaker of the third panel discussion and talked about building resilience. Beyond achieving better understanding on hybrid threats, the discussions held at the conference will contribute to the ongoing works on the Joint Framework on Hybrid Warfare that shall be prepared by EEAS by the end of December, together with the Commission and EDA. “If Europe succeeds in offering a credible answer to hybrid treats, it will certainly enable us to make a very meaningful contribution to the security view, becoming a relevant partner and a security provider rather than a security consumer,” said Jorge Domecq, the EDA Chief Executive.

EDA_NEWS_0523	2015-09-16	NEWS	Complex cyber crisis management exercise in Vienna	" The third Strategic Decision Making Course & Exercise on Cyber Crisis Management within the framework of the European Defence Agency (EDA) takes place in Vienna from the 14th to 16th September 2015. The event is a joint initiative of the EDA, the European Cyber Security Initiative (Estonia), the Austrian Ministry of Defence and the Austrian Ministry of Interior. Forty representatives from the Austrian Federal Chancellery, the Ministries of Interior, Justice, European and International Affairs, Defence and Sports as well as from seven private companies participate in the exercise which is hosted at the Austrian Defence College. The exercise is also observed by 40 national and international cyber security experts. The main aim of the exercise is to prepare strategic leaders to deal with cyberspace crisis management processes in complex situations and to promote a cyber security and cyber defence strategic culture. It also concentrates on stimulating national synergies and to foster EU member states cooperation.  The exercise set-up includes presentations as well as a decision-making exercise and an in-depth feedback session. The exercise audience is confronted with a customised fictional political scenario where a crisis situation outside  EU boundaries spills back to an EU member state, here Austria. Manifestations of this spill over are an escalating sequence of targeted cyber-attacks of different degree of severity which are affecting both Austrian public and private sector entities, including national critical infrastructures such as telecommunications and Internet service providers, the energy sector, water supply and the public health care sector;all of this has had an impact on the public up to the level of casualties. The exercise audience is asked to apply the existing Austrian legal and political framework to the escalating scenario. At the same time participants must react to the population’s perception of the situation and to maintain public order. The exercise is following a playbook of more than 200 pages.  Cyber defence – a key capability The previous two cyber defence exercises for decision-makers were organised in Portugal in May 2014 and Prague in June 2015. The initiative is part of the EDA’s cyber defence work strand which among others aims at improving training, education and exercises opportunities as highlighted in the ""Cyber Defence Policy Framework"" which was adopted by the European Council in November 2014.  ""The 2013 EDA landscaping study on cyber defence capabilities among EDA member states revealed a need for harmonised cyber training for decision makers. The present course and exercise are the direct result of this study. The courses are constantly being improved according to participant’s feedback to ensure that our offer corresponds with Member State’s needs"", said Peter Round, Director Capability, Armament & Technology at the European Defence Agency. Background Cyber defence is the military dimension of cyber security. The military requirements are to prepare for, prevent, detect, respond to, recover from and learn lessons from attacks, damage or un-authorized access originated from cyber space affecting systems and services that support and enable military tasks and operations.  In the EDA’s capability development plan, cyber defence is one of the priority actions. A project team of EDA and its participating Member States' representatives is responsible for jointly developing cyber defence capabilities within the EU common security and defence policy (CSDP). A network of EDA and Member States research & technology experts support this work by collaborative activities delivering the required technologies at the right time. All of this is positioned next to existing and planned efforts by civil communities (national and EU institutions) and NATO. Given that threats are multifaceted, a comprehensive approach is taken, seeking to enhance synergies between the civilian and military domains in protecting critical cyber assets.   More information News ""Cyber defence exercise for decision makers"" (22 June 2015) Cyber defence project page "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/09/16/complex-cyber-crisis-management-exercise-in-vienna
EDA_NEWS_0524	2015-09-15	NEWS	"""European Guardian 2015"" welcomes distinguished guests"	 Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) continue to cause significant casualties in operations as well as in civil surroundings. Therefore, countering them remains a priority for all participating Member States. There are situations where the use of normal explosives ordnance disposal procedures is inappropriate due to the operational situation, and Manual Neutralisation Techniques – a last resort of Commanders - might be required to counter the threat. On 8 September, Austria and the European Defence Agency organised the second Distinguished Visitors day during the margins of Exercise “European Guardian 2015” at the Austrian Logistics School facilities of Vienna, Austria. Forty participants from Austria, Colombia, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Republic of Serbia, Sweden, and UK, attended the Distinguished Visitors’ Day of the European Guardian 2015 Manual Neutralisation Techniques Courses & Exercises programme. Representatives from EUROPOL and the C-IED Centre of Excellence also took part in the event.  The day was presided over by the Austrian Armed Forces Capabilities Director Brigadier General Peter Resch and the EDA Capability, Armament & Technology Director, Peter Round. Both recognised the relevance of the programme and insisted on the need to continue to develop it in the future.  A live demonstration, executed by an MNT specialists team, was staged in the margins of the meeting. The demonstration consisted of the disposal of an IED which held a chemical payload and several complex initiation systems. Attendees not only had the opportunity to witness all MNT teams immersed in their tasks but also to discuss their activity and the latest innovations in MNT kits.  Attendees discussed their expectations of the programme during their visit to the specific “urban” simulated training area. It was generally agreed that one of the most relevant take away points was that MNT operators are highly trained and few in number, and that given the high degree of specialisation needed, frequent refresher training of MNT operators was considered crucial. To that end, the Manual Neutralisation Techniques Courses & Exercises programme is extremely valuable. The next milestone within the programme will be the first one week MNT refresher course to be held in November 2015 at the Austrian Logistics School.   More information: Manual Neutralisation Techniques Courses and Exercises (MNTCE) project page 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/09/15/-european-guardian-2015-welcomes-distinguished-guests
EDA_NEWS_0525	2015-09-25	NEWS	EDA hosts SES/SESAR Military Implementation Forum	" On 22 September, the European Defence Agency (EDA) hosted the 7th edition of the SES/SESAR Military Implementation Forum, bringing together the top management of the European Commission, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), Eurocontrol, the SESAR Joint Undertaking, the SESAR Deployment Manager, NATO and of the defence community. They addressed the following challenges: What is the foreseeable evolution of military aviation and airspace usage over the next two decades? How to accommodate the military vision in the aviation regulatory and operational environment? How are military interests taken into account in SESAR?  Jorge Domecq, the Chief Executive of the EDA, underlined that SES/SESAR is one of his top priorities: “EDA’s role is twofold: first, bridging the military with the Commission and EASA; second, developing incentives and solutions to engage the military. Let me also insist on the close cooperation with NATO on this issue.”  The following issues have been in particular highlighted during the discussion: on the regulatory part, EASA would actively interact with the military. Given there is a clear trend towards digitalisation and connectivity, cyber-security should be at the heart of the community's attention.  Through a total aviation approach, aviation related issues should be embraced in a systematic and consistent manner.

EDA_NEWS_0529	2015-08-17	NEWS	Industry consultation on the European Transfers Directive	 An evaluation of the implementation of the Directive on intra-EU-transfers of defence-related products has been launched by the European Commission. The European Defence Agency, under its role as an interface to wider EU policies impacting defence, is coordinating with the Commission in order to raise awareness and increase the input of Member States Ministries of Defence as well as defence industry, on issues related to the implementation of Directive 2009/43/EC. Also known as the Directive on intra-EU-transfers of defence-related products, it aims to simplify terms and conditions of transfers of defence-related products within the Community. The Directive entered into force in 2009 and was transposed into national legislation across all Member States and EEA countries by 2012. The Commission has recently launched an evaluation of the implementation of the ICT Directive, in view of preparing a report to the European Parliament and Council by June 2016. It has contracted the independent consultancy Technopolis Group to evaluate the implementation, uptake and impact of the Directive, and to provide recommendations to address any identified problems, in view of supporting the Commission in the preparation of its report. A central aspect of the evaluation is a survey-based consultation with European defence industry. The online survey can be accessed at this link. The consultation is due to close on Friday 18th September 2015. According to Technopolis, all responses obtained through the consultation will be treated in the strictest confidence, in line with EU legislation on data protection, and access to the data will be restricted to a small team within Technopolis.

EDA_NEWS_0530	2015-08-03	NEWS	Sharing European skies	" The implementation of the Single European Sky is a topic of utmost importance for all airspace users in Europe. Coordination between the military and civil communities is a critical enabler in that process, as we explain in this interview with subject matter experts. (This article first appeared in the latest issue of the EDA's official magazine, European Defence Matters) ""A bridge between two worlds""with Roland van Reybroeck ""Airspace is a single resource"" with Florian Guillermet ""SESAR... is a powerful catalyst"" with Massimo Garbini ""Much greater focus on performance"" with Philippe Merlo ""Higher civil /military interoperability"" with Luc Lalouette   A bridge between two worlds What is the EDA’s added value when it comes to gathering military views on SESAR? Roland Van Reybroeck European Defence Agency Cooperation, Planning & Support Director Since 2010, the European Defence Agency has been tasked to support Member States’ armed forces in the identification of the operational and financial risks associated with the implementation of the Single European Sky air trafficmanagement research programme (SESAR). This is no small feat: as is often pointed out, military fleets with some 9,500 diverse aircraft form the single biggest ‘airline’ operating in European airspace,with more than 150,000 flights each year. The unique structure of the EDA,whose experts interact on a daily basis with Ministries of Defence, allows us to gather inputs and requirements very early on. A dedicated ‘SESAR Cell’ set up within the EDA early last year provides us with a strong platform for interaction with all parties involved in the implementation of SESAR.  As an Agency of the European Union, we’re also in the best position to ensure smooth interactions with other EU actors, especially the Commission which needs a consolidated view of the defence community's specific needs regarding the Single European Sky.  But the EDA is also closely coordinating with the EU Military Committee and EU Military Staff, especially with regard to operational implications and requirements, aswell as training aspects. This is all the more important now that SESAR has entered its Deployment Phase and newair traffic management functionalities will be introduced, some of whichmight have an adverse impact onmilitary operations. What process will you put in place to ensure a smooth interaction with Member States? Civil and military general air traffic (GAT) flights in 2013 Jpeg file (363Kb) The EDA is facilitating the coordination of military views on SES and SESAR. The idea is to analyse the technological projects submitted by other Single European Sky stakeholders ahead of their actual implementation, and to identify those who can impact the military community, from a financial or operational point of view.  In support of this process a three step consultation mechanism was established with the aim of involving NATO and EUROCONTROL, who include military airspace users and navigation service providers beyond those of the European Union. The mechanism entails staff-to staff coordination and access to relevant expertise available in all three organisations, in order to develop joint military impact assessments of the SESAR deployment programme. These assessments are subsequently submitted to States for comments. The outcome of the mechanism is a consolidated opinion exported by the EDA as a collective view of the military. We have used this process for several initiatives: the adoption of EU Regulations, the development of the ATM Master Plan and now SESAR deployment. The work with Member States also involves identifying potential mitigation actions as and when required. This involves avoiding duplication of effort and reducing potential investment burdens, by recognizing that certain military systems are sufficient and robust enough to face SESAR requirements, based on equivalent level of performance. On the other hand it may include effectively ensuring the incorporation of military requirements in future SES development and SESAR deployment and ensuring access to EU-funding for related military projects which are already part of defence ministry investment plans or newly planned. In the regulatory domain it may include obtaining exemptions for the military, but only when absolutely necessary. The military indeed strive to be ‘as civil as possible’ but also need to remain ‘as military as required’. In which areas do EU air forces have specific requirements that need to be addressed? The defence community has always emphasized the prerequisite for air forces to have free and safe access to European airspace for training purposes, air-policing and air defence missions. There is also the need to safeguard their ability to deploy to external operation theatres from within the European airspace, as and when required. Let me clarify that by elaborating on a few examples.  “The unique structure of the EDA, whose experts interact on a daily basis with Ministries of Defence, allows us to gather inputs and requirements very early on” Preserving the capacity of the military to train properly means that military pilots need to reach dedicated manoeuvring areas that are often contiguous with airspace used by civil traffic. Access to these areas needs to be ensured in the context of a new SESAR environment which might induce some changes to current procedures or routes for military pilots.  Safely operating across national and European airspace, including in the most dense and complex areas involves both operational and general air traffic, and ranges from logistic air transport to urgent military interventions in case of contingency situations. And, in the not so distant future, it may also involve safe and efficient integration of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), on a routine basis.  The specific needs of state actors flying public-service missions such as search and rescue, airborne surveillance or firefighting also have to be taken into account.  With all these requirements in mind, adverse impacts on both military and civil stakeholders should be avoided through systematic and enhanced civil-military dialogue at the earliest possible stage, first at national levels and then at a European level. Both parties should, side-by side, willingly engage in the cooperative development of harmonised solutions and common mitigation actions. Looking ahead, what do you expect will be the longterm benefits of this approach? The European Defence Agency clearly recognizes and acknowledges the crucial importance of the Single European Sky initiative of the European Commission, which aims at achieving, in the foreseeable future, improved efficiency, increased capacity, enhanced aviation safety, diminished environmental impact of flights and reduced costs of air traffic services. It is after all in themutual interest of all airspace users, private and public, commercial and governmental, civil and military, to reach these objectives which will contribute to increased efficiency, flexibility and safety, for all. It is a shared vision The highest priority for all stakeholders is clearly the safe operation of aircraft. The military fully support this objective and anything that can be done to make the airspace safer should be duly considered. Another major benefit shall be the harmonization of procedures and interoperability of systems across Member States to ensure appropriate access to airspace for all, civil and military alike. This implies the development of harmonised and coordinated civilmilitary implementation roadmaps governing the introduction of new technology or organisational and structural change, to ensure sustained compatibility if not interoperability. Furthermore, developing air traffic insertion solutions for RPAS, with a view to exploiting all potential synergies and developing common standards. But also, considering common education and training solutions for basic RPAS operations in non-segregated airspace, relying on existing experience and expertise from various operational environments. The EDA is ideally placed to facilitate cooperation in all of these areaswith relevantmilitary stakeholders and to provide access to a number of existing cooperation platforms for the development of harmonised civil/military solutions. The Military Airworthiness Authorities Forum, the Material Standardisation Group and the Defence Test and Evaluation Base are just a few examples of such cooperation platforms. The necessity to put into practice the legislative framework for the Single European Sky in a coherent and consistent way is fully shared, taking full account of economic necessities, but also of the requirements resulting from common and national security and defence policies. The shared vision of a Single European Airspace, delivering the benefits which are envisaged, can be achieved through constructive cooperation between civil and military stakeholders, based on the collective willingness to achieve the SES performance objectives, while at the same time enhancing military mission effectiveness. This endeavour should start at national levels between civil andmilitary airspace users, service providers and operators, through joint deployment projects that concretely will help building the Single European Sky piece by piece. It is clear that aviation industry as well can play a key contributing role in this perspective. The European Defence Agency is reaching out and ramping-up its coordination with all relevant stakeholders, in order to be a strong and reliable partner for civil-military cooperation and harmonisation, with a view to jointly building a Single European Sky in which the views and needs of the defence community are duly taken into account.   ""Airspace is a single resource"" What is the timeline for the implementation of SESAR? Florian Guillermet SESAR JU Executive Director www.sesarju.eu Thanks to a strong collaboration between its members, the SESAR Joint Undertaking is already delivering the needed operational and technological improvements (‘SESAR Solutions’) for industrialisation and deployment. Over the course of 2015 and 2016, our goal is to add many more to this catalogue of SESAR Solutions. In parallel, an extended programme (SESAR 2020) will address new challenges and evolutions in ATM and aviation necessary to reach the next level of performance. These activities will be fully aligned with the next edition of the ATM Master Plan, which will be finalised by the end of 2015. What are the specific requirements of the armed forces and how are they taken into account? SESAR is founded on the principle that European airspace is a single resource shared by all airspace users, whose diverse needs are fully recognised and answered. Thanks to a very sound cooperation with our military partners from States and military organisations, we have been able to integrate and respond to the needs of the armed forces through a number of dedicated projects. One area of focus has been the exchange of air-ground data messages between military aircraft and ATM systems. In response to concerns that SESAR Solutions could bring into the cockpit an assembly of costly avionics, SESAR members recently demonstrated how civil-military interoperability is possible on the principle of equivalence, using existing military capabilities thereby reducing implementation costs. What have been the most recent deliverables of the SESAR JU? A number of recently-delivered SESAR Solutions have already been implemented, such as the world’s first Remote Tower Services (RTS) in Sweden supporting mobility and thereby economic sustainability for remote regions in Europe. Another significant milestone is the world’s first 4D flights, which allows for more efficient flight paths and traffic flows, and ultimately more predictable flights. But perhaps, the most convincing proof of SESAR’s readiness is the EU decision to deploy the first set of SESAR Solutions into the Pilot Common Project (PCP). This will allow for the crucial synchronised deployment across Europe (2015-2020).   ""SESAR... is a powerful catalyst"" What is the role of the deployment manager? Massimo Garbini Managing Director SESAR Deployment Manager www.sesardeployment manager.eu The SESAR project is a powerful catalyst to transforming Europe’s ATM network into a modern, cohesive and performance-based operational system. Proof of the readiness of SESAR research is the decision by the European Commission (EC) to package a first set of SESAR solutions into a Pilot Common Project (PCP), that are considered mature enough for synchronised deployment across Europe (2015-2020). This will be managed by the recently established SESAR Deployment Manager (SDM), an alliance of European ATM actors collaborating under a framework partnership agreement with the EC, who will ensure that new technologies and solutions that have already been tested and validated through the SESAR JU are delivered into everyday operations across Europe, delivering significant benefits to airspace users and the environment. This means that Europe now has all the blocks necessary to build the ATM system that it needs to increase the performance and sustainability of its aviation sector.  How is the coordination of military and civil views organised in that context? The military is a very important stakeholders of the SESAR Deployment Manager (SDM). SDM will conclude a cooperative arrangement with EDA to formalise the exchange of information crucial for drawing up the Deployment Programme (DP).Also input from the operational military stakeholders shall be taken into account, through representation by the EDA, in the Stakeholder Consultation Platform.  What will be the main milestones of the SESAR deployment programme? The Deployment Programme (DP) is not just another plan. The DP is direct input for the subsequent INEA-calls (Innovation & Networks Executive Agency) aimed at investing the CEF-funds (Connection Europe Facility). So there will be a sequence between the INEA-calls and the versions of the Deployment Programme. For now the first version of the DP should be delivered to DG Move by end of June 2015, as input for INEA-call expected by the end of 2015. Another INEA-call is expected by end 2016, so a second version (DP v2) is expected by mid-2016.    ""Much greater focus on performance"" What impact does the military community have on European ATM – and vice versa? Philippe Merlo Director ATM, EUROCONTROL www.eurocontrol.int Europe has a single airspace shared between civilian and military airspace users. The military have a vital role to play, with specific needs for reserved airspace as certain times. They also have to be able to transit through airspace that is also being used by civilian traffic. There is today a much greater focus on performance – safety, capacity, cost efficiency and the environment. At the same time, civilian traffic is starting to increase again, with the latest forecast showing that 2021 will see nearly 1.8 million more flights than in 2014 – an increase of over 18%. So ATM has to evolve in order to maintain and even improve its performance. This will have implications both for how airspace is shared and also or for military aircraft flying in civilian-controlled airspace. How does EUROCONTROL take the specific needs of the armed forces into account? EUROCONTROL is a civil-military organisation and has a long and unique record of fostering civil-military and even military-military cooperation. One good example of this is the fact that one of the first of our new Centralised Services (CS4) is the Advanced Flexible Use of Airspace service, which is being developed to help ensure that military missions can be carried out effectively while maximising the availability of airspace for civil users. Just as important is the work done to ensure that the needs of the armed forces are considered when developing new ATM technologies and procedures. Here we can see the focus on developing ground infrastructure, rather than more aircraft equipage and on performance-based regulation. So rather than specifying what equipment aircraft should carry, the emphasis is more on what that equipment should be able to do. How do you interact with SESAR in that domain? We are a founding member of the SESAR Joint Undertaking, as well as being involved in a significant number of the SESAR projects including, in particular, the European ATM Master Plan. We are also developing our working relationship with bodies such as the European Commission, EASA, the new SESAR Deployment Manager as well as, of course, the EDA with whom we have a joint work programme.   ""Higher civil /military interoperability"" How are the industry’s interests represented within the SESAR endeavour? Luc Lalouette Head of SESAR Task Force with the ASD  www.asd-europe.org “All of us have to keep in mind that the European Air Forces are the biggest fleet operators and airports owners and as such have a key role to play in the SES developments” The industry’s interests are both directly and indirectly represented within the SESAR endeavour. Directly, through the pro-active contribution of the key air traffic management (ATM) industrial stakeholders in the SESAR Joint Undertaking structure on the ground and in the air, more than 30% of the funding of the SESAR JU is provided by industry. Indirectly, and in a larger manner than the SESAR JU members, the industry’s interests are represented through its active involvement in SESAR deployment preparation in support of discussions with European bodies and, as recognized by the European bodies, at a later stage through the support of the Deployment Manager. The AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe is involved in the SESAR deployment phase in governance and financing and in the synchronization and interoperability between SESAR and NextGen deployment. What is the technological spillover effect of SESAR on the global ATC/ATM industry? As the technical evolutions in the ATM market are strongly dependent on standardization and norms, SESAR is, in Europe, the key driver to facilitate and accelerate such evolutions due to its large scope and its consensus approach to functional and technical contents. Potential benefits also exist outside Europe, pending SESAR capabilities to disseminate its outcomes and to be synchronized - both in term of planning and content – with NextGen. SESAR coordinates ATM research and development (R&D) activities in Europe, however the human and financial resources that SESAR asks of companies leads to questions about its remaining capability to create technological differentiators amongst them. Do you see potential specific developments linked to the military needs regarding the Single European Sky? The Single European Sky, due to its nature, calls for higher ATM civil/military coordination and interoperability in order to increase the ATM performance while maintaining the military’s freedom to operate its various missions assigned by its national authorities. The degree of coordination will depend of the situation (peace/war), the nature of the fleet (transport/combat fighter/rotorcraft) and the operational concepts in place within European nations.  However, we can already foresee the need for specific developments – both at the technical and procedural level – in the following areas: Command and control (C2) and military ATC systems to allow interoperability with civilian ATC systems (trajectory management, airspace management, etc) Non-radar surveillance due to its impact on military and governmental flight security (automatic dependent surveillance – broadcast [ADS-B], multilateration [MLAT] etc) Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) integration into non-segregated airspace (sense and avoid capability) Military fleet equipment to limit the need for exemptions Those needs require fast progress in military cooperation within the framework of the SES. This could be achieved through a deep analysis of potential achievements through performance equivalence and experiments to validate the technological and procedural enhancements needed to fill the gaps. All of us have to keep in mind that Europe’s air forces operate the largest fleets of aircraft and own the largest number of airport so they have a key role to play in SES developments. SES benefits for Europe’s citizens will not be achieved without the active role of Europe’s air forces.     A"	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/08/03/sharing-european-skies
EDA_NEWS_0531	2015-07-15	NEWS	Protecting marine mammals	 Three Member States gathered under the framework of the European Defence Agency to launch a project aimed at developing European navies’ knowledge of marine mammals activity while mitigating the adverse effect of military operations on these species. The formal signature of a technical agreement is expected for the 2nd semester of 2015. With a planned total budget of €1,5 million, the project is led by Germany with participation from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The main objective of the PoMM2 (Protection of Marine Mammals 2) project is to establish a common risk assessment methodology and evaluate mitigation procedures regarding the potential adverse effect of naval operations on marine mammals. For instance, the use of active sonars or underwater explosions in anti-submarine warfare operations has previously been linked with strandings of whales. Developing knowledge-based risk-mitigation measures and precautionary restrictions on the use of certain military systems could help reduce this adverse effect while developing European navies’ knowledge of marine mammals. This new project is a follow-up to the original PoMM study carried out between 2010 and 2013 under an EDA framework. It helped establish an initial marine mammal database of 126 different species which will serve as a basis for the common risk-assessment methodology to be developed as part of PoMM2.  Picture credit: Patrick Hawks / Wikimedia Commons More information Maritime Mine Counter Measures  Unmanned Maritime Systems 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/07/15/protecting-marine-mammals

EDA_NEWS_0535	2015-07-22	NEWS	Interview: the hybrid warfare challenge	 The recent European Council acknowledged the importance of hybrid warfare for EU Member States. In this interview we address the topic with EDA project officer Axel Butenschoen. Axel  Butenschoen is Project Officer for Capability Development Plan within the European Defence Agency. How does hybrid warfare differ from “conventional” warfare? Is it really something new? From an academic point of view we have to state that a broadly accepted definition of “hybrid warfare” does not exist yet. One reason could be that by nature the characteristics of this new type of threat is evolving nearly on a daily basis. However, amongst analysts there are common elements describing this phenomenon of new threats by “violent threats that are simultaneously carried out by state- and non-state actors along all conventional and unconventional lines of operation within a not exclusively military but also diplomatic, information and economic dimensions of conflict in order to achieve a political goal”. From my perspective all the individual elements, for example information warfare, cyber-attacks, conventional military aggressions and destabilisation operations are individually well known but the synchronized, combined approach adds a new dimension to our understanding of aggression. Why does hybrid warfare matter to EU Member States? During the past years Europe’s security has been challenged significantly by this new dimension of conflicts at its eastern and southern borders. The paramount question now is how to counter these so called hybrid threats? Are EU Member States prepared for this challenge and do we have the adequate set of tools in our toolbox? How can EU instruments also support Member States? During the recent European Council, Heads of States and Governments acknowledged the importance of the subject and it can be expected that the EU global strategy on foreign and security policy, to be delivered in 2016, will address the hybrid dimension accordingly.     What role could the Agency play in supporting its Member States’ counter hybrid capabilities ? First of all I believe that exclusive counter-hybrid  capabilities do not exist. As explained earlier the new character posed by Hybrid threats is the coordinated combination of more or less existing capabilities by potential adversaries. Consequently, any kind of response also requires a comprehensive but effective approach. In this regard the EDA will not enter into an academic discussion but focus on the military capability dimension.  Together with Member States and other relevant stakeholders we will conduct a series of subsequent assessments in order to identify the implications of Hybrid warfare for defence capability development in Europe. The results will be presented to Ministers and Capability directors for their consideration; it will support Member States’ efforts in countering Hybrid threats. At the same time the objective is to stress test existing Priorities and identify possible need for amendments.  This EDA activity will also supplement other initiatives carried out in this context,  for example within the European External Action Service, in charge of preparing a joint communication on hybrid warfare.  At this stage one cannot anticipate the results but the key question: “Are European Member States prepared to counter hybrid threats?” may be answered with findings in line with  “We have adequate capabilities in place but we need to rethink the way we deploy in a more coherent, comprehensive way”. Also such possible outcomes would be of added value and could trigger effective follow-on activities so that Europe stands ready for these new threats.   More information Hybrid warfare project page 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/07/22/interview-the-hybrid-warfare-challenge
EDA_NEWS_0536	2015-07-09	NEWS	Support to operations: new opportunities	" The European Defence Agency (EDA) recently published two calls for tender from operation EUFOR ALTHEA on its Contractor Support to Operations (CSO) platform. The signature of the cooperation arrangement with the ATHENA mechanism in March 2015 provides new impetus for the usage of the CSO platform. Procuring customised assets such as armored vehicles or specific services (e.g. air to ground surveillance) can be challenging especially on short notice. EDA assists EU military operations in fulfilling their complex goods or services needs through the CSO platform, a powerful tool of interaction. The CSO platform connects economic operators and EU-led operations by for example actively promoting business opportunities. Economic operators are invited to subscribe to the platform database to receive information on business opportunities advertised by governmental and institutional authorities. Currently operation EUFOR ALTHEA is looking for the provision of jet fuel distribution services and food, water and catering supply. Full description of the contract notice can be found at http://cso.eda.europa.eu/Pages/BusinessOpportunities.aspx.   Support to operations Since the creation of the European Defence Agency in 2004, support to the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and to EU operations has been one of EDA's core missions. Several activities are now ongoing to develop the role of the Agency in support of CSDP military and civilian operations or missions as well as EU Battlegroups at the request of Member States. Procurement of contracted solutions has become increasingly relevant for EU military operations not only to fill capability gaps in the force generation process, but also as a general planned support for ongoing operations. The arrangement with ATHENA opens the option for the Athena Administrator or any Operation/Mission Commanders as Contracting Authorities to call upon EDA to provide, upon its expertise and available means and capabilities, technical and overall administrative support for procurement of infrastructure works, as well as a variety of services or supplies, through direct contracts or pre-mission solutions, e.g. through framework contracts. The Agency plans to further upgrade the CSO platform to respond to new requirements and to turn the platform into an one-stop solution for procurement by operations. Regular updates for industry including a workshop are planned.  (c) Picture: EUFOR ALTHEA/Herbert PENDL More information: Support to operations project page News: ""EDA signs cooperation arrangement with Athena"" (2 March 2015) CSO platform (password required) "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/07/09/support-to-operations-new-opportunities
EDA_NEWS_0537	2015-07-09	NEWS	Graphene impact on defence capabilities	 Graphene is a new material with a wide range of extraordinary properties (lightweight, high strength, thermal and electrical conductivity, etc.). It is widely expected to lead to new and improved applications for defence. On 2 June, 25 experts from Ministries of Defence, European entities, industry and academia participated in an EDA workshop to discuss current and future areas of application of graphene in defence at the Swedish Defence Research Agency FOI in Linköping. Graphene has a wide number of potential applications interesting for defence such as advance camouflage systems and lighter or stronger protections. The objective of the workshop was to gather experts in related fields to discuss possible future defence applications and areas of applicability of graphene technologies. The discussion was focused on how to enhance composites and coatings by including graphene and on its possible use in adaptive camouflage, due to its thermal and electrical conductivity properties, and protection systems, based on its strength and low weight. The outcomes of the workshop will be further analysed to identify how graphene technology can support the EDA Capability Development Plan (CDP), taking into account the Materials & Structures CapTech Strategic Research Agenda (SRA), and if possible, to create a technology roadmap towards achieving the required maturity of graphene based applications for defence.

EDA_NEWS_0538	2015-07-07	NEWS	Final results of Italian Blade 2015	 The latest flying event organised as part of the Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP) was successfully conducted from 22 June to 3 July in Viterbo, Italy. More than 1000 personnel and 30 helicopters from seven countries attended this multinational training, the largest of its kind organised in Europe this year. Over the course of Italian Blade 2015, 201 missions and 445 sorties were flown by the participants, accounting for a total of 618 flight hours. Missions of increasing complexity were conducted, with scenarios including air assault, close air support, combat search & rescue or medical evacuation.  “Italy has provided great support to this year’s HEP exercise as host nation”, Andrew Gray, EDA Helicopter Programme Manager, underlines. “Next year the HEP will move to Finland for exercise Cold Blade, which will provide participants with a totally different yet very relevant training environment”, he adds. To date, more than 350 crews and 200 helicopters have taken part in EDA-developed HEP exercises. The overall HEP project was endorsed at a Ministerial Steering Board in November 2009, and a formal programme arrangement was signed in November 2012 by 13 contributing Member States: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Finland, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, the United Kingdom; as well as Norway.

EDA_NEWS_0539	2015-07-13	NEWS	Military requirements for cyber ranges agreed	 The official endorsement of the military requirements by the EDA Steering Board in Capability Directors composition end of June, marks the start of the cyber ranges project. Its scope is to improve the usage of existing and future cyber ranges for conducting cyber defence training, exercises & testing. This should improve cyber resilience and raise the levels of awareness, insight and expertise of national and EU personnel. The EU Cyber Security Strategy recognises cyber defence as one of its strategic priorities. The military requirements on cyber defence capabilities are inter alia to prepare for, prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from cyber-attacks. In June 2012, the EDA made an initial proposal for cooperative cyber defence training, exercises and testing under the Pooling & Sharing agenda. Interoperability of cyber ranges will have a positive effect on cooperation among operational cyber defence systems, organisations and processes, thereby improving the effectiveness and efficiency of CSDP operations and multinational exercises. The project will be carried out under the EU Pooling & Sharing agenda and aims at: Increasing availability of existing cyber range facilities; Increasing occupation rate and efficiency of existing cyber ranges and platforms; Mainstreaming and improving cyber defence training, exercises & testing at European level. The military requirements approved now describe the way ahead through an EDA ad hoc project on cyber ranges in a spiral approach until 2018 (full operational capability). The concrete project arrangements are expected to be agreed by the working group by late 2015.

EDA_NEWS_0540	2015-07-07	NEWS	Austria hosts Military Working Dogs meeting	 Military working dogs (MWDs) are of great value in Counter-IED operations, and the pooling and sharing of this capability at the European level has long been a subject of discussion among C-IED experts. Late last month, the European Defence Agency organised the first Ad Hoc Working Group on MWDs at the Austrian Military Working Dogs School facilities of Kaisersteinbruch, in Austria. Twenty-two participants from Austrian, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden gathered for three days  to discuss national capabilities and their respective level of ambition. The C-IED Centre of Excellence and representatives from academia also took part in the event. Several training opportunities were also staged on the margins of the meeting. Four MWD teams (each comprising a dog and its handler) from Hungary and the Netherlands attended the event, as well as teams from host nation Austria. Capabilities of Labrador dogs were also demonstrated, while a full day was dedicated to training at the Austrian MWD school. Attendees took the opportunity to train teams with specific innovative explosive conditioning materials in a pure multi-national environment. The Working Group also had the opportunity to receive lectures on innovative solutions for MWDs preparation as well as on previous operational deployment experiences and lessons learned. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) experts from the Austrian Armed Forces provided support by preparing specific scenarios for military search performance by the teams. Big interest was showed by all participants and planning for the next Ad Hoc Working group meeting is currently on-going. It is envisaged that MWDs teams will participate in further multi-national C-IED related exercises in 2016. Thus, such a capability will be fully included within the planning process and subsequent execution of C-IED related tasks at the mentioned events.

EDA_NEWS_0541	2015-06-26	NEWS	EDA launches Govsatcom feasibility study	" The European Defence Agency has just launched a €1 million, 18-month feasibility study to prepare a future cooperative governmental satellite communications (Govsatcom) programme. The study will be delivered by a consortium led by Euroconsult with Airbus Defence & Space, CGI, Istituto Affari Internazionali, Hisdesat and SpaceTec Partners working as subcontractors. This work is expected to be complemented by other studies funded by the European Space Agency (ESA). Some synergies are also expected with the work currently performed by the European Commission. “This study will help us to find new ways to cooperate in a complex institutional setting”, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq stated upon signing the study contract. “Considering that Govsatcom capabilities are inherently dual-use, one of the main objectives will be to identify an efficient, innovative and sustainable cooperation model in particular by implementing synergies with the Commission. This will certainly be reflected by a genuine governance of the system”, he added.  “Government satellite communications are evolving, due to changes in operational requirements and to the availability of innovative and cost effective solutions serving these,” stated Euroconsult CEO Pacome Revillon. ”The international consortium combines expertise across the full satellite communications value chain, while the project governance will guarantee the independence and neutrality of the results. All partners are fully committed to delivering a study that lays the groundwork for future European capability,” he added.  Govsatcom was identified in December 2013 by EU Heads of State and Government as one of four priorities for capability development, along with air-to-air refuelling, remotely piloted aircraft systems and cyber defence.  Under the lead of Spain, a common staff target harmonising the needs of military users was adopted by all EDA Member States in 2014. Based on this commonly-agreed document, a preparation phase started ahead of the launch of a full-scale cooperative project. By the end of 2016, a business case including more detailed technical requirements as well as a through-life management plan should allow Member States to assess various options in terms of cooperation models and system architectures. These findings will be to a large extent supported by the outcome of the feasibility study.   More information: EDA Govsatcom capability programme  ""Filling the gap in space capabilities"", article in European Defence Matters, issue 8, p. 30 "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/06/26/eda-launches-govsatcom-feasibility-study
EDA_NEWS_0542	2015-07-02	NEWS	Jorge Domecq visits Counter-IED centre of excellence	 EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq travelled to Spain yesterday to visit the Counter Improvised Explosive Devices Centre of Excellence (C-IED CoE), a multinational organisation with which the European Defence Agency is cooperating closely. During the visit, Jorge Domecq received briefings from commander Colonel José Zamorano González as well as other C-IED CoE staff. Together they discussed the Centre’s missions and projects  as well as its current priorities in the field of information sharing, technology & development, and training.

EDA_NEWS_0543	2015-06-25	NEWS	EDA Chief Executive attends EATT 15 training in Portugal	 EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq travelled to Portugal yesterday to attend a Distinguished Visitors Day held during this year’s edition of the European Air Transport Training (EATT), a multinational training event gathering 15 military transport aircraft from 11 different European nations: Belgium, Germany, Finland, France, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Initiated by EDA, run by the European Air Transport Command and hosted by Portugal, EATT 15 takes place in Beja from 14 to 26 June. The EATT series of events aims to pool resources and share knowledge in order to develop comprehensive airlift training opportunities in Europe. Activities are based on national requirements and are designed to make the best use of multinational training opportunities. “Exercises organised under the framework of the European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) keep proving their value over the years, with an increasing number of Member States and aircraft types taking part – for instance, we have six of the eight European military air transport aircraft types participating in EATT 15”, Jorge Domecq stressed during the DV Day. “Since 2011, more than 70 crews have benefitted from the training delivered during EATF live-flying events, effectively increasing interoperability between European armed forces”, he added. “I also wish to underline the good cooperation between EDA, the European Air Transport Command as well as host nations – Portugal in this case – who all work very hard to enhance airlift capabilities in Europe and to make these events possible”, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq stated. The EATT series of training events form part of a wider ecosystem of EATF events that all converge towards the same objective of increasing the European Union’s airlift capabilities. In 2015, two editions of the European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course, or EAATTC, have already taken place in Bulgaria and France, with a third one planned for September in Spain. In the meantime, four European Advanced Tactical Instructor Courses (EATIC) will be organised in Italy this year.

EDA_NEWS_0544	2015-06-30	NEWS	EDA and SESAR Deployment Manager seal cooperation	 Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency (EDA), and Massimo Garbini, Managing Director of the SESAR Deployment Manager (SDM) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Its purpose is to establish efficient cooperation and support between the two organisations with regard to SESAR deployment. “Europe’s military fleets include some 9,500 diverse aircraft accounting for more than 150,000 flights each year. In other words, they form the single biggest ‘airline’ operating in Europe today. The challenges of the Single European Sky programme and the modernisation of European air traffic management are manifold. However, it is the role of the EDA to ensure that the European air forces will continue to have free and safe access to European airspace for training purposes, air-policing, as well as air defence missions. The financial and technological impacts of the programme need to be mitigated to ensure that they do not adversely affect European defence capabilities. Only through constructive cooperation between military and civil stakeholders, our shared vision of an efficient, safe and flexible European airspace can be realised. It is in this spirit that we sign the Memorandum of Understanding today”, said Jorge Domecq at the signature ceremony.  Massimo Garbini, “This MoU reflects the kind of relationship we aim for with all stakeholders. Only through efficient cooperation and mutual support between both civil and military stakeholders, we can deliver the modernisation of European Air Traffic Management technology together.” Memorandum of Understanding The scope of the MoU covers the SESAR deployment of sets of functionalities in accordance with the relevant regulations1. The EDA and SDM will work together to support the Member States in translating the regulation into projects to be deployed nationally with financial support from the EU. The EDA will ensure that military viewpoints and needs are captured in the SESAR Deployment Programme and support the bidding and execution processes of the projects. At the same time, the Deployment Manager will coordinate with the military through the EDA to avoid any adverse impact on national and collective defence capabilities. This involves inter alia enabling and exploiting military contributions as well as optimising the use of expertise and avoiding duplications. The EDA and SDM also agree to put in place effective coordination procedures to ensure efficient synchronisation and the timely exchange of relevant information. A Steering Committee will be set up to ensure the effective functioning of the Memorandum.   Single European Sky ATM Research The Single European Sky (SES) aims at realising the optimisation of the airspace organisation and management in Europe through a combination of technological, economic, and regulatory efforts. SESAR (Single European Sky ATM Research) is the technical pillar of this. SESAR involves developing a new ATM system to handle more traffic with greater safety and at a lower cost. Its new technologies and procedures will also seek to reduce the environmental impact of flying. The resulting efforts will be deployed in a synchronised manner involving all stakeholders, civil and military.   About SESAR Deployment Manager SESAR Deployment Manager (SDM) is the industrial partnership that synchronises and coordinates the modernisation of Europe’s air traffic management system under the political oversight of the European Commission. The main task of the SESAR Deployment Manager is to develop, submit to the European Commission for its approval and execute the Deployment Programme, a project view strictly drawn from the Pilot Common Project (PCP) set by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 716/2014, as well as any subsequent Common Projects in future regulations. Through the Deployment Programme, the SESAR Deployment Manager will ensure efficient synchronisation and coordination of implementation projects required to implement the PCP, as well as the related investments. The tasks of the Deployment Manager are described in Article 9 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 409/2013.   Role of the EDA In order to ensure that the effects on military aviation are understood and taken into account, Member States entrusted EDA with the task of facilitating the coordination of military views from and in support of Member States and relevant military organisations and to inform military planning mechanisms of the requirements stemming from SESAR deployment. In 2014, EDA established a dedicated SESAR Cell to ensure that the military views and requirements are taken into account in the implementation of SESAR.   More information Single European Sky project page SESAR Deployment Manager website ----------------------------------------------  1 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 409/2013 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 716/2014 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/06/30/eda-and-sesar-deployment-manager-seal-cooperation

EDA_NEWS_0546	2015-06-24	NEWS	EDA tests Sharing of Spare Parts project during multinational exercise	 Earlier this month, at the Bakony Combat Training Centre in Hungary, the European Defence Agency attended exercise Capable Logistician 15. The event was coordinated by the Multinational Logistic Coordination Centre (MLCC) and supported by Hungary as host nation. Capable Logistician 15 provided the EDA with an opportunity to test its Sharing of Spare Parts (SoSP) mechanism and to prove the effectiveness of its operational procedures. Sharing of Spare Parts (SoSP) is an initiative aimed at establishing a multinational framework for the request and provision of Mutual Logistic Support (MLS) in peacetime and during the execution of operations. MLS focuses on unforeseen and temporary shortages of common supplies as well as on in-service support for standard or specific equipment. In this respect, Capable Logistician 15 offered a realistic scenario in which to simulate the lack of an appropriate level of logistic support - which in turn may have affected the operational effectiveness of a unit in the field. The unavailability of spare parts (in this simulated event, a transmission gear for land vehicles) has often caused serious problems in operations, especially where there is a particularly long logistic chain, where there are security considerations, or where similar collaborative solutions are not feasible or convenient. The simulated application of the SoSP scheme allowed the exchange of spare parts between two units in the field which were using the same land vehicles.

EDA_NEWS_0547	2015-06-23	NEWS	Italy hosts multinational helicopter exercise	 More than 30 helicopters and 1000 military personnel have gathered 80 kilometers north of Rome for Italian Blade 2015, this year’s largest military rotary-wing exercise in Europe. Crews from seven different countries have started training together yesterday using joint procedures and tactics during missions of increasing complexity. After three successful live-flying events hosted by Portugal from 2012 to 2014, the EDA-developed Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP) has moved to Italy this year. More than 1000 military personnel and 30 helicopters coming from seven nations are taking part in Italian Blade 2015. The exercise is delivered by the Italian Army Aviation in Viterbo, about 80 km north of Rome.  During two weeks, helicopter crews as well as ground forces will take part in joint missions during which efforts will be made to maximise interoperability between all assets involved. They will fly and operate in conditions likely to be faced in future operations, while promoting cooperation in helicopter training through the integration of multinational elements in the air and on the ground. Mentor team A mentor team of six instructors from Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom will support multinational crews in the preparation and execution of complex missions. The team will be managed by an EDA Chief Instructor, serving officer of the UK Royal Air Force, who will ensure consistency of the output as well as proper exchange of lessons learned during other EDA-organised training events, namely the Helicopter Tactics Course (HTC) and the Helicopter Tactics Instructor Course (HTIC), which also contribute to increasing the overall availability of European military helicopters.   More information Pictures of the exercise are available on our Flickr gallery Helicopter initiatives project page EDA exercises & training Italian Blade 2015 factsheet 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/06/23/italy-hosts-multinational-helicopter-exercise
EDA_NEWS_0548	2015-06-23	NEWS	Member States implement Code of Conduct on REACH	 With the exception of Poland, all EDA participating Member States as well as Norway have decided to subscribe to and therefore participate in the implementation of the Code of Conduct on REACH Defence Exemptions which was adopted in March 2015. This new milestone highlights the importance of harmonising national defence exemption procedures. Poland is still conducting an internal analysis towards a final decision regarding its subscription to the Code of Conduct. A harmonised approach towards national REACH defence exemptions will contribute to a level playing field for European defence industries, reducing their administrative burden and related costs. It will also support the creation of an open and transparent European Defence Equipment Market and a capable and capability-driven European Defence Technological and Industrial Base, providing armed forces with the right defence equipment to meet their operational requirements. In coming years the EDA will act as a facilitator to support national implementation and application of the CoC in practice, by the Member States.   More information EDA's project page on REACH EDA Code of Conduct (CoC) on REACH Defence Exemptions Annex to CoC - Framework for Applying for a Defence Exemption from a Requirement of REACH 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/06/23/member-states-implement-code-of-conduct-on-reach

EDA_NEWS_0550	2015-06-18	NEWS	Athena Mechanism joins EU SatCom Market	" Athena Administrator Hans-Werner Grenzhäuser today signed the declaration to join the EU SatCom Market, an ad hoc project of the European Defence Agency. Speaking about the cooperation, Hans-Werner Grenzhäuser said: “As part of the ongoing efforts to improve the procurement process of the different operations, I am convinced that Athena will benefit from its participation in this already existing mechanism with several other EU Member States being able to pool the purchase of satellite communications and related services through the European Defence Agency.” EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq added: “With Athena now part of the EU SatCom Market project, CSDP military operations will benefit from an easier procurement process thanks to the framework already in place, instead of using ad hoc outsourcing. The foreseen additional use of this pooled procurement initiative will increase the pooling and sharing effect, while making the project more attractive to the service providers.” EU SatCom Market Within the EU SatCom Market project, EDA acts as the central purchasing body on behalf of the contributing members. It purchases the services from a commercial provider. Airbus Defence & Space holds the current contract. Since May 2013, more than 20 orders have been placed for a total value of almost €4 million. So far, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Romania, and the United Kingdom are part of the EU SatCom Market. The project uses a ‘pay-per-use’ model, so members do not have to contribute with a regular fee, instead they only pay for what they order. Under the arrangement with Athena all present and future EU-led military operations will be able to draw this option to cover their SatCom requirements. The Athena Mechanism Athena is the mechanism established to administer the financing of the common costs of European Union operations having military or defence implications governed by Council Decision 2015/528/CFSP. The Council Decision allows for arrangements to be signed with union bodies to facilitate procurement in operations in the most cost-effective manner.

EDA_NEWS_0554	2015-06-11	NEWS	EDA places first order for Carl-Gustaf ammunition	" The European Defence Agency (EDA) today placed the first order of Carl-Gustaf ammunition on behalf of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Czech Republic and Poland. The order is the first since EDA signed a framework contract with Saab on behalf of the participating Member States in 2014. The order amounts to € 13.6 million and deliveries will take place during 2015-2016.  “By pooling resources through this multinational agreement, participating Member States ensure they get the capabilities they need in the most efficient way possible. It also allows participating countries to purchase ammunition according to their national needs despite having different budget cycles”, says Peter Round, EDA Capability, Armament & Technology Director.  “This unique and very flexible way of providing Carl-Gustaf ammunition ensures that our customers can maintain highly capable and deployment-ready defence forces. The proven and reliable Carl-Gustaf system offers soldiers unique flexibility and capability through its high accuracy, light weight and built-in compatibility with future innovations,” says Görgen Johansson, head of Saab business area Dynamics.  On 30 June 2014, the EDA and Saab Dynamics AB signed a multi-annual framework agreement for the provision of different types of ammunition for the ‘Carl-Gustaf’ recoilless anti-tank weapon. The framework agreement lasts five years and includes a possible renewal of two more years, with an estimated value of up to € 50 million.  It comes under a procurement arrangement between EDA and Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Czech Republic, and Poland, agreed on 23 April 2013. Under this arrangement EDA acts as the central purchasing body, taking the leading role in the procurement procedure for Carl-Gustaf ammunition in the framework of EDA’s Effective Procurement Methods (EPM) initiative. EDA will also be in charge of managing the framework contract to fully exploit the effects of pooling demand.    More information:  News ""EDA signs a framework agreement to provide Carl-Gustaf ammunition for its Member States"" (08 July 2014) News ""Pooled Ammunition Procurement: EDA Supports Baltic States"" (12 March 2013)  Factsheet Effective Procurement Methods "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/06/11/eda-places-first-order-for-carl-gustaf-ammunition
EDA_NEWS_0555	2015-06-18	NEWS	High-level Group of Personalities on defence research issues statement	" The European Commission has recently set up a high level group of politicians, academics, think tankers and CEOs from research technology organisations and defence industry to advise on how the EU can support defence research programmes relevant to the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). Working on a tasking from the December 2013 European Council, the European Defence Agency is bringing its expertise to this work strand through the organisation of workshops with the Commission and the discussion of modalities related to the future Pilot Project on CSDP Research. The High-level Group is chaired by Commissioner Elżbieta Bieńkowska and supported by the High Representative, Commission Vice-President and Head of the European Defence Agency Federica Mogherini – who has been represented by EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq in the Group of Personalities. It is expected to make recommendations for a long-term vision for EU-funded CSDP-related defence research in support of European defence cooperation. While the Group will report in full in early 2016, it offers now the following considerations as a preliminary contribution in the run up to the June 2015 European Council. Official Statement by the Group of Personalities on defence research   The EU's security role and the need for a strong EDTIB To ensure its long-term security, the EU and its Member States need political will and determination underpinned by a broad set of relevant instruments, including strong and modern military capabilities. These will enable the EU to live up to its responsibilities as a security provider and to be a relevant and reliable partner at global level. Investing today in future-oriented defence research programmes is crucial to developing the capabilities that will be required tomorrow. It is widely recognised that Europe needs to retain robust military capabilities in its Member States, which, however, can no longer afford to sustain a full range of defence industrial assets on a purely national basis. Years of defence spending cuts by EU countries risk producing a net loss of combined military and industrial capabilities. And while defence-related research is pivotal in maintaining the technological edge that ensures military advantage, European investment in defence R&D has declined by more than 29 % since 2006 – and by more than 27 % in R&T. The European defence industry needs therefore to become more integrated and more sustainable in order to maintain critical mass and global competitiveness, to remain an equal and attractive partner internationally, and to generate the key defence technologies needed to ensure Europe’s long-term operational autonomy. A common understanding of the capability-driven research areas that should be developed cooperatively - and of the ways to identify and select them - will be required, taking into account all existing processes at EU level. The role of future collaborative programmes in addressing capability gaps Cooperative defence research programmes will clearly be essential for sustaining and fostering key military capabilities in Europe and addressing well-known shortfalls. Currently, however, only 8% of national defence budgets are spent on collaborative projects. The Preparatory Action and its follow-on programme can contribute significantly to the development of crucial military capabilities for Europe and help ensure the sustainability and competitiveness of the European defence industrial sector - from prime contractor level through to SMEs - thus also underpinning the Union’s long-term security. The Preparatory Action should therefore pave the way to a substantial and ambitious CSDP-related defence research programme in the next EU multi-annual funding framework, thus making a quantitative and qualitative difference to the current situation and demonstrating the added value of a permanent EU scheme. Key principles for EU-funded CSDP-related defence research The future research programme must be clearly defence-oriented, coherent with and complementary to existing national defence research efforts, and must take fully into account the unique aspects of the defence sector in its governance principles and modalities. It must help address specific capability needs stemming from the evolving security environment, avoid duplications, and catalyse collaborative research efforts. The Preparatory Action needs to properly test the effectiveness and relevance of EU-funded defence research and the appropriateness of the proposed governance model. As such, it should be endowed with appropriate and credible means – preferably up to the maximum budget allowed by the legal framework.

EDA_NEWS_0560	2015-06-04	NEWS	Exchange of views with Slovak Minister of Defence	" Jorge Domecq, EDA Chief Executive, today met with Martin Glváč, Minister of Defence of the Slovak Republic, to exchange views on the preparation of the European Council in June 2015 and Slovakia’s participation in EDA projects. The Slovak Chief of Defence stated that Slovakia and the Ministry of Defence were ready to support EDA’s intentions and reinforce present cooperation. „We will support your initiatives. I think we should begin with smaller projects and then move to the bigger ones,“ said Minister of Defence Martin Glváč. He also noted that in V4 countries one of the problems with closer cooperation is that V4 countries were for too long aiming in different directions. „This is the main problem why we sometimes have difficulties to unite our development programmes“, he stated. He also informed the EDA Chief Executive about current defence modernisation projects, which until now covered mainly air forces. „Our task now is to continue with modernisation of land forces, where we would like to focus on 4x4 and 8x8 vehicles“, he said. He also noted that Slovak defence companies are awakening. „A good example are our military repair facilities, which we leased to our strategic partners so they can offer their products further“, said Minister of Defence Martin Glváč. “The Agency’s main tasks are to support Member States in their efforts to improve defence capabilities, to encourage cooperative R&T, to support the national defence industries and to ensure that military views are taken into account in wider EU policies. The Agency clearly is at the service of Member States and our support corresponds to their level of ambitions. We welcome the active participation of the Slovak Republic in countering improvised explosive devices; the harmonisation of the Single European Sky and works on airworthiness and standardisation topics. We hope this engagement will increase in the near future”, said Jorge Domecq during the visit in Bratislava. The discussion is part of a series of visits by Mr. Domecq to all EDA Member States following his appointment as EDA Chief Executive. So far, Mr. Domecq visited Spain, Lithuania, Latvia, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany, Portugal, the Netherlands, Ireland, France, Romania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Croatia, Estonia, Poland, Hungary, Greece, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Finland, Sweden and Italy.

EDA_NEWS_0562	2015-05-19	NEWS	Initiative to mitigate human-related risks in cyber space signed	 On 18 May, the Ministers of Defence of Austria, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and the Netherlands as well as the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Head of Agency on behalf of the European External Action Service, EU Military Committee and European Defence Agency, signed a pledge to mitigate human-related risks in cyber space by launching the Cyber Hygiene initiative. The initiative is an important contribution to the implementation of the EU Cyber Defence Policy Framework, notably on awareness raising for CSDP structures, missions and operations. By joining the pledge, the signatory Member States promise to adopt and implement internal guidelines for best behavioural principles for cyber hygiene by the end of 2016. This includes, for example, introducing a mandatory e-learning platform. Initiated by the Latvian Presidency of the Council of the EU and the Estonian Ministry of Defence, the initiative calls to strengthen cyber security culture as low awareness and human-related risks are a common cause of cyber incidents. A large number of cyber incidents can be avoided, or their effects greatly mitigated, if certain behavioural cyber security procedures and implementation measures are applied. It is part of a wider project, which aims to educate the members of defence sector institutions on secure behaviour while using online resources.  Beyond its commitment to implement internal guidelines, the Agency will contribute to expanding this initiative to other interested EU Member States. EDA activities The December 2013 European Council identified cyber defence as one of the priority areas to take forward in the European Union. Furthermore, in November 2014 the Council adopted the EU Cyber Defence Policy Framework. Cyber defence has also been identified as a priority area in the EDA’s Capability Development Plan.  The armed forces are reliant on cyberspace both as a user and as a domain to achieve defence and security missions. The Agency is active in the fields of cyber defence capabilities and in the research & technology domain. In the last three years, the Agency has completed ten cyber defence related projects with a financial volume of about two million euros. This equals to approximately 10% of EDA’s operational budget. Among these ten projects are a stocktaking study of cyber defence capabilities among all EDA Member States and EU institutions, the establishment of a cyber defence research agenda and cyber defence training courses for senior military decision makers as well as the assessment of the feasibility of a EU Cyber Defence Centre for CSDP.  Copyright picture: European Union, 2015.  From left to right: Ms. Jeanine HENNIS-PLASSCHAERT, Dutch Minister of Defence; Mr Gerald KLUG, Austrian Federal Minister for Defence and Sport; Mr Sven MIKSER, Estonian Minister of Defence; Ms. Federica MOGHERINI, High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy; Mr Raimonds VEJONIS, Latvian Minister for Defence; Mr Juozas OLEKAS, Lithuanian Minister for National Defence; Ms. Piritta ASUNMAA, PSC Ambassador of Finland More information: EDA factsheet on cyber defence News item Latvian Ministry of Defence  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/05/19/initiative-to-mitigate-human-related-risks-in-cyber-space-signed
EDA_NEWS_0563	2015-05-20	NEWS	2015 EDA-Egmont PhD prize awarded	 The European Defence Agency and the Egmont Institute are proud to announce that the 2015 EDA-Egmont PhD prize has been awarded to Mr. Andrea Gilli for his research work on armaments cooperation. The EDA-Egmont PhD prize was created in 2013 to stimulate research in the field of European defence, security and strategy. The prize rewards research work undertaken as part of a PhD thesis carried out at a recognised academic institution. The 2015 was awarded to Andrea Gilli, Post-doctoral Fellow, Center for Security Studies, Metropolitan University Prague, for his thesis entitled “Unipolarity, Technological Change and Arms Manufacturing: Industrial Alliances in the European Defense Industry”. “Tackling the issue of armaments cooperation, which is not just highly political but also very technical, takes daring on the part of a young PhD candidate – Andrea Gilli has succeeded brilliantly”, Prof Sven Biscop of Egmont, Jury Chair, underlines. “His dissertation is most enlightening and very readable, for academics and practitioners alike. Unlike many dissertations about European topics, Gilli does not attempt to bring a good news show. Instead he demonstrates why armaments cooperation is most difficult where intuitively one would expect it to be most evident. From that dour lesson, policy implications can be drawn and a way for the future charted. A well-earned doctorate, to which the jury unanimously added the 2nd EDA-Egmont Prize”. Eight thesis were submitted for the EDA-Egmont Prize. The award jury, chaired by Prof Sven Biscop, was composed of Mr. Jorge Domecq, EDA Chief Executive; General Patrick de Rousiers, EU Military Committee Chairman; Dr Antonio Missiroli, EUISS Director; Prof Jolyon Howorth, University of Bath / Yale University; Dr Hilmar Linnenkamp, Adviser SWP; and Prof Richard Whitman, University of Kent. “The EDA-Egmont PhD prize is meant to boost innovative research in the field of European defence and security”, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq stresses. “This year’s winner will not only be awarded a €2000 grant but will also have the opportunity to share his views with high-level executives during the upcoming EDA Annual Conference on 16 November, effectively bridging the gap between research and European policy-making mechanisms”, he adds.   More information European Defence Agency eric.platteau@eda.europa.eu / +32 (0)2 504 2823 Egmont Institute s.biscop@egmontinstitute.be / +32 (0)2 213 40 23 Andrea Gilli's PhD Executive Summary  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/05/20/2015-eda-egmont-phd-prize-awarded
EDA_NEWS_0564	2015-05-18	NEWS	Outcome of the EDA Steering Board	 Defence Ministers today formalised their contribution in view of the European Council at the Steering Board of the European Defence Agency (EDA). It complements the contributions from the High Representative /Head of Agency Federica Mogherini and Commissioner Bieńkowska. Among others, Ministers agreed on analysing the implications of hybrid warfare for European defence capability development, on further incentivising defence cooperation including the Preparatory Action on CSDP-related research, on a SME Action Plan, on potential basic principles, objectives and actions for a Security of Supply regime as well as future priorities of the Agency.  Capability development During today’s meeting, Defence Ministers welcomed the progress achieved in the implementation of the 2013 European Council Conclusions. The four capability programmes on Air-to-Air Refuelling, Cyber Defence, Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems and Governmental Satellite Communications endorsed by the European Council in 2013 are making good progress in line with their roadmaps.  Cooperative programmes are important for enhancing capabilities in Europe, but also for clarifying priorities for industry. Defence Ministers agreed that potential additional priority capability areas could be investigated using the Agency’s Capability Development Plan, an assessment of cooperative opportunities derived from the Collaborative Database (CODABA) and EU wider policies.  The Agency was also tasked to conduct an analysis of the implications of hybrid warfare for European defence capability development in light of the changed security environment to the East and South. The analysis might form part of wider efforts, co-ordinated by the External Action Service and also including the Commission, to analyse the impact of hybrid warfare on the European security environment and to identify, and recommend improvements to existing EU tools and instruments that are best suited to counter this threat.   Incentives for defence cooperation While Member States spent 26% of their defence equipment budget in collaborative procurement in 2011, this ratio was 16% in 2013. There is a need to spend better on defence, and to do more together.  Defence Ministers today confirmed the need for  EDA to work on  non-market distorting fiscal and financial measures to further incentivise defence cooperation. Tangible progress has been achieved on VAT exemption for ad hoc projects in EDA, with the support of the Commission and the Belgian authorities. Three pilot cases currently benefit from VAT exemption. Formalisation of this VAT exemption is pending the currently ongoing review of the EDA Council Decision. EDA is investigating with Member States financial engineering mechanisms in support of defence cooperation, including a potential European investment fund for defence, for example to improve the availability of funds and the synchronisation of budgets allocated to cooperative programmes. This fund could be part of the pooled procurement mechanism. In addition, EDA has initiated contacts with the European Investment Bank to investigate potential financial support to the industrial sector and cooperative programmes of a dual-use nature. In November 2014 the EDA proposed and Member States approved a Policy Framework for long-term and systematic cooperation. Its objective is to provide a coherent basis for defence cooperation in Europe, from priority-setting through in-service support to disposal/decommissioning.   Preparatory Action on CSDP-related research There is a need to halt the continuing decline in investment of defence R&T and maintain competence in areas of critical technologies. The Preparatory Action on CSDP-related research, and its potential follow-on action in the next Multiannual Financial Framework, could provide fresh impetus. Ministers of Defence supported the progress achieved towards the development of the Preparatory Action by the European Defence Agency and the European Commission in close cooperation with the Member States.  They endorsed consolidated views pushing for a defence-oriented and CSDP-related Preparatory Action. The European Council in June 2015 is expected to provide further guidance.  SME Action Plan Defence Ministers furthermore agreed on revised guidelines for facilitating access to the defence market for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), supporting the implementation of the  Agency’s SME Action Plan. SMEs are considered to be the backbone of the EU economy in terms of jobs creation, growth and innovation. The role of SMEs in the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) has gradually increased over time, partly as a result of greater outsourcing. The non-binding guidelines were prepared in close cooperation with the Member States and the European Commission. They contain recommendations dedicated to access to supply chain, access to finance, support to innovation, competitiveness and industrial performance, and security of supply aspects.  Security of Supply Security of Supply arrangements are indispensable for the sustainment of operations, the development of long-term planning and cooperation, and the functioning of the internal market for defence. The December 2013 European Council called on the Commission to develop with Member States and in cooperation with the High Representative and the EDA a roadmap for a comprehensive EU-wide Security of Supply regime, which takes account of the globalised nature of critical supply chains. Due to the significance and multi-dimensional nature of the Security of Supply and taking into account experience gained from its work and activities, the EDA has together with its Member States identified potential basic principles and objectives of such a  regime as well as actions that could be taken at the intergovernmental level. Proposed actions include establishing specific measures to ensure access  to critical capabilities and technologies, e.g. through an early-warning or prioritisation mechanism, developing a mechanism to address concrete short term shortfalls, promoting cross-border cooperation, and bringing the supply and demand side closer together, for example through user-clubs.   Future priorities of EDA  Ministers of Defence today endorsed the future priorities of the EDA including three core activities to further strengthen defence cooperation: support the development of capabilities and military cooperation; stimulate defence R&T to prepare the capabilities of tomorrow and support the EDTIB; and ensure that the interests and specificities of defence are taken into account in wider EU policies. Under the authority of Federica Mogherini, the Head of the Agency, EDA is a key instrument for supporting and facilitating defence cooperation in Europe. EDA’s strength is that it is Member State-owned and -driven. To date, EDA has managed around 150 R&T projects with a total aggregate budget of almost €500m.    More information: The Council Conclusions on CSDP are available here.  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/05/18/outcome-of-the-eda-steering-board

EDA_NEWS_0566	2015-05-18	NEWS	EDA and ESA launch DeSIRE II demonstration project	 The European Defence Agency (EDA) and the European Space Agency (ESA) agreed to kick-off on 9 April 2015 a new project in accordance with their demonstration roadmap to support the development of governmental, institutional and commercial services provided by Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) flying in non-segregated airspace. The DeSIRE II demonstration is expected to run for 18 months with a total budget of €2,6 million. An industrial consortium led by Telespazio, one of the world’s leading company in space applications and end-to-end satellite communications services, will act as prime contractor and system integrator. The main results and recommendations coming out of the project will be disseminated to support European standardisation and regulatory activities, especially for the definition of future satellite-based command & control datalinks. During DeSIRE II, a Piaggio Aero P.1HH HammerHead will be used as a flying testbed for the development, integration and testing of a set of capabilities designed to allow safe RPAS operation in civilian airspace in support of missions such as environment monitoring, maritime surveillance or crisis management. The joint EDA-ESA project will also aim at characterising Satcom command and control datalinks in different frequency bands through simulation, emulation and flight demonstration campaigns. Meanwhile, DeSIRE II will be also be supported by end users (Italian Coast Guard, Italian Civil Protection Department, Guardia di Finanza, European Fisheries Control Agency, Ceren and Armasuisse) who will consolidate their operational and regulatory requirements to operate RPAS in non-segregated airspace.  This new project is a follow-on to the first DeSIRE demonstration, an EDA-ESA project led by Spanish company Indra which ran from 2011 to 2013. It culminated with a series of successful test flights demonstrating the ability of a RPAS using a satellite link to safely share the sky with other airspace users.  Out of the €2,6 million project budget, €1,2 million will be invested by ESA, €600.000 by the EDA on its operational budget and €800.000 by the industrial consortium composed of Telespazio, e-GEOS, Selex ES, Piaggio Aero, ViaSat, Skyguide and Ædel Aerospace GmbH.  More information EDA and ESA sign DeSIRE II project arrangement DeSIRE project page on ESA website  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/05/18/eda-and-esa-launch-desire-ii-demonstration-project

EDA_NEWS_0572	2015-04-28	NEWS	Member States adopt Code of Conduct on REACH	 To further harmonise national practices, a voluntary Code of Conduct (CoC) on REACH Defence Exemptions was adopted last month by EDA Member States, as well as an associated technical Framework for Applying for a Defence Exemption from a Requirement of REACH. The Code of Conduct is now open for subscription to EDA participating Member States as well as third states having an Administrative Arrangement with the Agency. The REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) regulation was adopted by the European Union in 2006 to improve the protection of human health and the environment from the risks that can be posed by chemicals, while enhancing the competitiveness of the EU chemicals industry. The Code of Conduct on REACH defence exemptions adopted last month sets as a common goal that Member States will fully support the objectives of REACH and provide for the highest safety and traceability standards possible when granting REACH defence exemptions.  In parallel, Member States agree to establish on a voluntary basis suitable measures to acknowledge other Member States' exemption decisions in accordance with national law, as well as to make information on national procedures publicly available. The technical Framework aims to standardise, as far as reasonably practicable, national defence exemption procedures and provide an agreed set of minimum standards in order to guarantee a safety equivalent with the REACH requirements. Harmonised approach A harmonised approach towards national REACH defence exemptions will level the playing field for European defence industries by reducing their administrative burden and related costs. It will support the creation of an open and transparent European Defence Equipment Market and a capable European Defence Technological and Industrial Base, providing Armed Forces with the right defence equipment to meet their operational requirements.   More information EDA's project page on REACH EDA Code of Conduct (CoC) on REACH Defence Exemptions Annex to CoC - Framework for Applying for a Defence Exemption from a Requirement of REACH 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/04/28/member-states-adopt-code-of-conduct-on-reach

The Luxembourg GovSat will be operated by a joint-venture company in Luxembourg, which brings together the government and the world-leading satellite operator SES established in the Grand-Duchy to launch a communication satellite with military frequency bands for the use of the Luxembourg government and its defence. This public-private partnership is one example illustrating how defence spending can benefit even a small economy without a significant armaments or specific defence industry of its own. As the EDA does, we promote working closely together with the private sector and looking whenever possible for economic opportunities for local companies, even SMEs, when planning for defence projects”, said Etienne Schneider, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defence and Minister of the Economy. Full support ”Luxembourg will take over the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union in the second half of 2015 - right after the June European Council on defence. Based on the excellent cooperation between the Agency and the Luxembourg Ministry of Defence, I have today assured Minister Schneider of our support in any defence related Presidency initiative.

During the visit Cyprus confirmed its participation in the Agency’s EU Satcom Market pooled procurement initiative for commercial satellite communications. Mr. Domecq also held discussions with the Cypriot Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Ioannis Kasoulides.  “I would like to underline my satisfaction for the productive meeting we had today with the Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency. I had the opportunity to reiterate our firm will to further enhance our contribution and support to the common initiatives and efforts of the Agency. The signing today of the Satcom Market Joint Procurement Arrangement is just an indication of this. In addition, we have also agreed today to co-organise an important Maritime Security Conference here in Cyprus next November which reflects the emphasis that we want to attribute in this field but also the role that Cyprus can play”, stressed Minister Fokaides. “Satellite communications are a scarce and investment-intensive capability. The Agency’s approach to pool Member State’s demand of commercially available satellite communications aims to reduce costs, ease access, and improve operational efficiency. There are only advantages for Member States, since they only pay what they use at the best price and when needed. This is why I welcome Cyprus’ decision”, stressed Jorge Domecq during his visit in Cyprus.  EU Satcom Market Commercial satellite communications are used by all nations to provide extra capacity on top of their own military and governmental satellite communications. The EU Satcom Market provides a flexible and cost-effective way of doing this, with the European Defence Agency acting as the central purchasing body for all participating countries. So far, Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxemburg, Poland, Romania, and the United Kingdom take part in the project. Since the launch of the project, 20 orders have been processed through this procurement cell, for a total value of about 2.5 million euros. Member States are already forwarding their requirements for 2015 and it is expected that their interest and usage will increase significantly. Visit to Member States The visit in Cyprus also allowed for meetings with other high-ranking officials of the Ministry of Defence, as well as briefings about the armed forces of Cyprus and research initiatives.

EDA_NEWS_0575	2015-04-30	NEWS	MIDCAS demonstrates progress for RPAS integration into civil airspace	 The MIDCAS (Mid Air Collision Avoidance System) consortium together with the European Defence Agency (EDA) announce the completion of successful flight-test and simulation campaigns conducted as part of the MIDCAS project. Major milestones included fully automatic avoidance manoeuvres of a Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) relying on fusion of non-cooperative sensors. Successful completion of flight tests Flights with a demonstrator Detect & Avoid (D&A) system integrated in the Sky-Y RPAS test bed have been conducted since December 2014 at Grazzanise Air Force Base, Italy. First fully automatic coupled avoidance manoeuvres were performed by the RPAS based on combined cooperative and non-cooperative detection as well as non-cooperative detection only and put on collision course with a manned aircraft. The MIDCAS system had full authority over the RPAS flight control system.  The formal flight test permit to perform the automatic manoeuvre was obtained using results from earlier flight tests demonstrating the readiness to safely perform such critical manoeuvres. Flight tests have covered numerous scenarios and sensor combinations bringing RPAS traffic integration a significant step closer to reality. The Detect and Avoid system tested, performs collision avoidance and traffic avoidance using data fusion for various combinations of the included detection technologies, i.e. the cooperative IFF and ADS-B equipment and the non-cooperative electro-optical, infrared and radar sensors. Important simulations Several types of simulations (including Monte Carlo simulations and real-time simulations) have been completed which will allow the project teams to demonstrate that the functional design of MIDCAS can be compliant with the safety levels for manned aviation. Simulations in Air Traffic Management (ATM) environment have also been performed to validate the system requirements in an operational context. “We are pleased with the outcome of the simulations where the involved air traffic controllers concluded that they were confident to control RPAS within their airspace and did not get any additional workload from the RPAS, whose behavior was fully in line with manned aviation”, MIDCAS project leader Johan Pellebergs explains. MIDCAS is the European Detect & Avoid project The MIDCAS project is laying the groundwork for future developments in the field of RPAS air traffic integration. The project has gathered European industries within the field of D&A with the purpose to achieve jointly agreed results with European and global standardisation stakeholders.The MIDCAS project was launched in 2009 by five contributing Member States (France, Germany, Italy and Spain under the lead of Sweden) under the framework of the European Defence Agency, with a total budget of €50 million.  “The project has produced tangible results in the field of air traffic integration, which is a critical enabler for the use of RPAS in European skies”, Peter Round, EDA Capability, Armament & Technology Director, says. “In order to improve Member States’ RPAS capabilities, technological and regulatory issues need to be taken into account as early as possible”, he adds.  MIDCAS has been carried out by an industrial consortium composed of 11 partners: Saab (project leader) from Sweden, Sagem and Thales from France, Airbus D&S, Diehl BGT Defence, DLR and ESG from Germany, Alenia Aermacchi, Selex ES, CIRA from Italy and Indra from Spain. Throughout the project, external stakeholders such as EASA, EUROCONTROL, EUROCAE or JARUS, were involved in the process. “The only way to achieve a high level of acceptance and reach a common European agreement on how to resolve the D&A issue is through close cooperation”, Johan Pellebergs concludes.

EDA_NEWS_0576	2015-04-23	NEWS	European air-to-air refuelling training delivers results	 The 2015 edition of the European Air-to-Air Refuelling Training (EART), which was hosted by the Netherlands from 13 to 24 April in Eindhoven airbase, has allowed tanker crews from four European nations to benefit from a dedicated training event in a realistic environment. Initiated by the European Defence Agency and run by the European Air Transport Command (EATC), EART15 gathered air-to-air refuelling (AAR) aircraft from France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Over the course of the event, 56 sorties were flown by the tankers which conducted over 240 contacts with receiver aircraft. These included F-16s, F/A-18s, F-15Cs and Eurofighters – all involved in the multinational fighter exercise “Frisian Flag” on the back of which EART15 had been set up. “This exercise is about increasing interoperability by working together”, Peter Round, EDA Capabilities, Armament and Technology Director, stressed during a Distinguished Visitors (DV) Day organised on 23 April in Eindhoven. “AAR is a critical enabler for all operations, and only through cooperation will we be able to increase European capabilities in this domain”, he added. Fruitful cooperation Brigadier General Pascal Chiffoleau, EATC Chief of Staff and Deputy Commander, also provided comments on the successful event: “EART15 is the result of a fruitful cooperation between EDA and EATC working together to develop common knowledge”, he said. “We must continue staging exercises such as this one to further develop AAR but also air transport capabilities in Europe”, he added. Other activities are ongoing to increase European AAR capabilities, such as the Multinational MRTT Fleet (MMF) initiative led by the Netherlands and supported by the EDA and EATC. Late last year, the Netherlands, Poland and Norway agreed to enter negotiations with Airbus for the purchase of four A330 MRTT multirole tanker/transport aircraft which will be commonly owned, operated and supported. “This initiative will provide access to a cost-effective MRTT capability in support of EU, NATO and national operations”, Johan Van Soest, Eindhoven airbase commander and Chairman of the MMF Steering Group, explained during the DV Day.  More information EART15 Factsheet EDA Air-to-Air Refuelling project page European Air Transport Command website  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/04/23/european-air-to-air-refuelling-training-delivers-results

They also discussed Poland’s participation in EDA projects and ways to support the Polish defence industry with an emphasis on small and medium sized enterprises. “Poland is a driving force of defence cooperation within the European Defence Agency.

EDA_NEWS_0580	2015-04-20	NEWS	Jorge Domecq meets Estonian Minister of Defence	" EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq travelled to Tallinn on 17 April for discussions with the Estonian Minister of Defence, Sven Mikser, on preparations of the June 2015 European Council and Estonia’s participation in EDA projects. Jorge Domecq also met with the Head of the Estonian Defence Forces, Lieutenant General Riho Terras and visited the Cooperative Cyber Defence Center of Excellence. “The European Defence Agency is crucial for driving defence cooperation in the EU”, Estonian Minister of Defence Sven Mikser said at Friday’s meeting with EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq. “The task has been difficult during a period of heavy cuts in defence spending but we can give a positive assessment regardless.” “We are quite pleased with many projects that we have worked on together such as joint procurement for Carl Gustav ammunition, and we are looking forward to the results of EDA’s cyber projects”, the Minister added. “The cyber-attacks on European media in recent weeks illustrate that cyberspace has become a key challenge of our current security environment as well as the fifth domain of warfare, equally critical to military operations as land, sea, air, and space. The European Defence Agency supports Member States in improving their cyber defence capabilities. Our cyber defence programme with the active involvement of Estonia contains projects aimed at research, training and exercises, cyber situational awareness in CSDP operations, detection and protection”, Jorge Domecq said during his visit in Tallinn. Mr. Domecq also exchanged views with other high-level officials of the Estonian Ministry of Defence as well as the Head of the Estonian Defence Forces Lieutenant General Riho Terras. During a visit at the Cooperative Cyber Defence Center of Excellence, ways to further enhance cooperation with EDA were discussed. Cyber defence In the European Defence Agency capability development plan, cyber defence is one of the priority actions. A project team of EDA and its participating Member States’ representatives is responsible for jointly developing cyber defence capabilities within the EU common security and defence policy (CSDP). A network of EDA and Member States research & technology experts support this work through collaborative activities delivering the required technologies at the right time. All of this is positioned next to existing and planned efforts by civil communities (national and EU institutions) and NATO. Given that threats are multifaceted, a comprehensive approach is taken, seeking to enhance synergies between the civilian and military domains in protecting critical cyber assets. The visit in Tallinn is part of a series of visits by Mr. Domecq to all EDA Member States following his appointment as EDA Chief Executive and ahead of the Ministerial Steering Board on 18 May 2015. So far, Mr. Domecq visited Spain, Lithuania, Latvia, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany, Portugal, the Netherlands, Ireland, France, Romania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Croatia.

Priority should be on development of capabilities, including niche capabilities, in accordance with the operational requirements at the national, EU and NATO levels. “Slovenia appreciates the efforts of the EDA and welcomes the discussions ahead of the next 2015 European Council on defence. It is of vital importance that smaller industries and entities have better access to the European defence market. Inclusion of small and medium-sized enterprises in the market will help reduce fragmentation, increase competitiveness and provide opportunities for joint access and performance on the market”, said State Secretary Miloš Bizjak. “The current security environment requires Europe to send strong signals confirming its commitment to defence. What European defence needs today is political will and a strong, innovative and competitive defence industry to secure our strategic autonomy. The further development of the defence industry requires among others common capability programmes and investment in research and technology.  In this respect, the European Defence Agency remains a strong instrument at the disposal of Member States. One way we can support Slovenia, its defence industry and especially small and medium sized enterprises is for example in facilitating access to markets in Europe through EU funding and market information The discussions by Heads of States and Government in June should give an important boost and top-level guidance”, said Jorge Domecq during his visit in Ljubljana. The visit included meetings with other high-level officials of the Slovenian Ministry of Defence as well as the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia.

EDA_NEWS_0584	2015-04-13	NEWS	EDA Chief Executive visits Czech Republic	" EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq travelled to the Czech Republic on 10 April to exchange views with Deputy Minister of Defence Daniel Kostoval ahead of the June 2015 European Council. Together they discussed Czech Republic’s participation in EDA activities as well as the country’s priorities in terms of capability development, regional cooperation and support to the defence industry. The Deputy Minister of Defence stressed the pivotal role of the European Defence Agency in facilitating and managing cooperative defence projects. ""The participating Member States should more engage in harmonization of demand and synchronization of procurement using the incentives offered by the EDA. To achieve more tangible results in the development of European defence capabilities, we must address the issue of defence spending during the June Council. We should also empower the EDA and support an increase in EDA´s budget for 2016”, Daniel Kostoval underlined during the meeting.   The European approach “The Czech Republic is already involved in many activities carried out by the European Defence Agency, such as education & training, field hospitals or pooled procurement through the multinational Carl-Gustaf ammunition contract. Major issues such as security of supply or support to the European defence technological and industrial base (EDTIB), including efforts in favor of a balanced EDTIB, can also be tackled through the EDA’s framework. To this specific end the EDA will dedicate a roundtable to the defence industries of Central and Eastern European countries during the IDET defence exhibition which will take place next month in Brno. During my visit here, I also had the chance to get a glimpse at some of Czech Republic’s industrial capabilities and I am convinced that the European approach can be greatly beneficial to local actors. Our flexible structure allows us to meet a wide spectrum of demands from our Member States, including through regional cooperation”, Jorge Domecq said during his visit.  The visit is part of a series of visits by Mr. Domecq to all EDA Member States following his appointment as EDA Chief Executive and ahead of the Ministerial Steering Board on 18 May 2015.

Mr. Domecq also met with Minister of Economy Bojidar Loukarsky for discussions on access to EU funding instruments for dual-use research and technology development, as well as the support of SMEs with economic activities in the interest of security and defence. The Bulgarian Minister of Defence stated that “Bulgaria values greatly the significant role of the EDA for the development of EU Member States’ defence capabilities, the latter’s importance for EU’s role as a provider of security and stability. We encourage the proactive approach of the Agency in its successful cooperation with the European Commission in pursuit of better opportunities to stimulate Member States’ capabilities development and the strengthening of the European defence industry. We highly appreciate the will of the EDA to facilitate Member States’ access to European Structural and Investment Funds in support of their defence and security-related research activities and dual-use capabilities development.  We expect the Agency’s advice and support at all stages in the realisation of Member States’ capability goals for a stronger and more secure Europe.” A strong and competitive defence industry “Europe needs a strong and competitive defence industry. Not only for security and economic reasons but also to keep our strategic autonomy. One way to support the industry is by consolidating military requirements, by pooling the demand side. Strategic autonomy is also important to keep prime contractors in the European Union in the long run, as one of their main functions is to supply the armed forces. But the European Defence Agency also advises small and medium sized enterprises how to gain better access to the markets in Europe, i.e. through EU funding and market information. Hence, Bulgaria’s defence sector, taking into account the specifities of its defence industry as is the case for several Central Eastern European countries, could gain access to other supply chains in Europe”, said Jorge Domecq during the visit in Sofia. During the visit, Mr. Domecq also had the opportunity to meet with the Minister of Economy, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Councillor to the Prime Minister on defence matters, as well as other senior officials within the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Finance and the Council of Ministers.

We fully support the Agency’s activity carried out in preparation of the upcoming European Council on security and defence and we commend the EDA for its efforts to connect the defence realm with the other EU institutions and policies that have an impact on this domain. I cannot emphasise enough the importance we attach to EDA’s activities aimed at facilitating a deeper involvement of Small and Medium Enterprises in European armament programs, which should lead to a balanced, modern and competitive European Defence Technological and Industrial Base/EDTIB, to the  benefit of all Member States. Small and Medium Enterprises and their integration in the supply chain remain a constant preoccupation for us, for they represent the engine for economic growth and a key driver for innovation” highlighted Mircea Duşa, Romanian Defence Minister. Romania is taking a firm European approach to defence cooperation and it is involved in several EDA projects. The Agency’s flexibility proves an asset for Romania’s national requirements as the EDA can also support regional cooperation, such as cooperation around the Black Sea region. A strong European perspective “The European Defence Agency advises European defence industry, i.e. in accessing EU funding for dual-use research. Our efforts are multiplied by the active support of the Romanian Ministry of Defence. These efforts have a strong European perspective. The competitiveness of the European defence industry as a whole is of utmost importance for our security, our economies as well as our strategic autonomy. The European Defence Agency is keen on taking the specificities of the Central Eastern European’s defence industry into account and to further enhance measures to facilitate their  access to supply chains throughout the EU”, said European Defence Agency Chief Executive Jorge Domecq in Bucharest. During the visit, Mr. Domecq had the opportunity to meet with senior officials of the Ministry of National Defence, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and representatives of the Romanian defence industry.  The visit in Romania is part of a series of visits by Mr. Domecq to all EDA Member States following his appointment as EDA Chief Executive and ahead of the Ministerial Steering Board on 18 May 2015.

EDA_NEWS_0589	2015-04-02	NEWS	Demand grows for non-lethal capabilities	 This article initially appeared in the 7th issue of European Defence Matters, the magazine of the European Defence Agency. Click here to access the full digital edition Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq… The Cold War aftermath has seen European armed forces engaged in a wide variety of operational commitments around the globe, vastly expanding the set of missions they have to conduct. “Nowadays, soldiers often operate among civilian populations in a set of missions ranging from emergency humanitarian relief to crowd and riot control, counter-insurgency and interposition between warring factions”, Jean Michelin, detached to the EDA as an intern from France and acting as Project Officer Engage, points out. But in these complex and demanding situations, the soldier on the ground can no longer rely on the sole use of his weapon if he wants to avoid a catastrophic escalation of violence; somewhere in the broad range of requirements that have fallen on the shoulders of modern armed forces, the need for non-lethal capabilities (NLC) has emerged. Lessons from Kosovo For western armed forces, the Kosovo conflict acted as an eye-opening experience in that regard. “In 1999/2000, we had to resort to using non-lethal capabilities during our mission in the city of Mitrovica, where Austrian units were deployed within German, British and French troops in order to prevent the escalation of riots”, Colonel Erich Weissenböck, Deputy Head of the Force Development Division in the Austrian Ministry of Defence, explains. “As soldiers were attacked with stones and explosives, they used wire barriers and other tactics to try and contain the threat. But eventually they had to use tear gas, shotguns and even snipers to stop the demonstrators”, he adds. With today’s military experience from various theaters of operation around the globe, non-lethal capabilities could be regarded as a logical step forward for military expeditionary forces, especially when operating under the UN flag and the blue helmet – and yet, somehow, their development has been very slow. Currently, apart from the notable crowd and riot control era experienced by NATO forces in Kosovo, they are virtually non-existent in land forces across the globe, despite an identified shortfall.  “To ensure that a potential threat doesn’t enter a protected perimeter, or to deter an angry crowd from approaching a compound, it often boils down to the use of the warning shot, which is most of the time impractical and dangerous, let alone can lead to collateral damage”, stresses Jean Michelin, who is also a French Army officer with significant operational experience. “Moreover, using conventional weapons in a non-lethal manner will usually deter a potential hostile action by an individual, but its impact on a crowd is less reliable, especially when there is a threat of violence escalation”, he adds. Maritime domain But land forces are not the only ones who might benefit from the development of NLC. The EU-led counter-piracy operation Atalanta conducted off the Somali coast has demonstrated the need for naval forces to neutralise potential pirates before they can attack nearby commercial ships. “In combination with audible or visual warnings, non-lethal weapons provide a stand-off with regards to the threat, thus allowing to identify the real intentions of a potential adversary”, Colonel Weissenböck details.  With an identified capability gap on one hand and a proven operational need on the other, ten Member States (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden) expressed in October 2007 their will to set up a dedicated NLC project team under the framework of the European Defence Agency. Over the last seven years, and under a proactive chairmanship from Austria, the project team focussed on four main strands of work, starting with a development of a NLC concept by the EU Military Staff (EUMS), in synergy with similar efforts previously conducted under a NATO framework. The project team also dealt with information exchange between Member States, so as to provide them with a forum to remain aware of national initiatives in terms of procurements, cooperation potential, interoperability as well as research and technology (R&T). The effects of non-lethal capabilities were also explored, with a specific attention on legal issues and the medical impact of NLCs. Future systems © Austrian MOD Perhaps the most visible output of the project team’s work in the field of NLCs, two R&T studies are conducted in order to assess technologies available for future non-lethal weapon systems. “Based on operational experience, a need for longer-range capabilities has already been identified”, explains Colonel Erich Weissenböck, who also happens to be the Chairman of EDA’s NLC project team. “Additional applications, such as the protection of vehicles and convoys, also need to be explored”, he points out. While one of the studies focuses on microwave-based NLC systems, the other explores optical and acoustic solutions. These two studies help to provide a comprehensive picture of the current state-of-play regarding NLC technology development, as well as of the challenges arising in research. “For example, the technology to direct a non-lethal energy beam at a hostile individual already exists”, Jean Michelin underlines. “However, it is still far from the technology-readiness level needed to integrate it into a portable, easily deployable, autonomous and ruggedized device that would match basic operational requirements”, he adds.  Equipment opportunities Although it is still being discussed, the project team’s next step could be the identification of NLC equipment opportunities for Member States, as well as the definition of a set of common requirements based on the available technology and an agreed concept of operation. “This in turn could lead to the establishment of a common project whose exact scope will have to be decided by the Member States”, Jean Michelin underlines.  The end objective is to provide European soldiers with a common tactical doctrine and even a common set of tools when it comes to NLC operations, thus greatly increasing their effectiveness and interoperability. But this will not be a quick win. “In contemporary operations like in cooperative capability development, the only lasting achievements require commitment, caution, time and effort”, the French army officer points out. “It is through small victories and determination that we will succeed in reaching our objective, however far it may seem.”  More information Non-lethal capabilities Non-Lethal Micro-Wave State-of-the-Art (HPM) Non-Lethal Optical and Acoustic Systems (NLOAS)  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/04/02/demand-grows-for-non-lethal-capabilities
EDA_NEWS_0590	2015-03-31	NEWS	Member States sign Helicopter Tactics Instructor Course agreement	 Today, in a signing ceremony held as part of the EDA Steering Board, Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the European Defence Agency brought into force an agreement to work together to deliver the European Helicopter Tactics Instructor Course (HTIC).  This course is designed to give selected European helicopter crews an enhanced awareness of helicopter tactics, operational employment and multi-national integration.  At the end of the course, which is divided into three phases (ground-school, simulator and live flying), graduates will be qualified to delivering tactical instruction during home-based training; multinational courses and exercises; and on operations. They will also be capable of providing helicopter tactical advice at 1 Star level, as well as leading multi-platform complex Composite Air Operations (COMAOs).   A proven concept The concept of creating the HTIC was approved by the EDA Steering Board on 9 March 2011. The EDA in partnership with the UK Joint Helicopter Command and the Armed Forces of Sweden developed the concept during 2011/12 and the first course, jointly funded by Sweden and the UK was delivered at RAF Linton-on-Ouse and FMV Test Range, Vidsel in Northern Sweden in April-May 2013. The course consisted of 14 Students from Germany and Sweden and 14 instructors from the UK and received unanimous praise from all participants.  Consequently, a year later, a second course was delivered.  Enlarged and with additional financial support from the Multinational Helicopter Initiative, the 2nd course graduated students from Austria, Czech Republic, German, Sweden and the UK.  Swedish graduates for the first course became staff instructors on the second – beginning the process of creating a self-sustaining cadre.  Nineteen students graduated from six helicopter types: Kiowa, Mi-171, CH-53, UH-1, AS330, and NH90. The course also involved eight fast-jets (Alca 159, Hawk, Gripen) from the Czech Republic, Sweden and the UK. These were used as “red air” both in the academic sorties teaching fighter evasion and also in a free role, trying to prevent the helicopters completing their “mission”. Upcoming events The next course, No3 HTIC, will be the first organised under the new arrangements. It will take place in August-September 2015. Once again, the simulator phase will be delivered at the EDA simulator facility at Royal Air Force Linton-on-Ouse and the flying phase will be hosted by Sweden at Vidsel.  The graduate instructors will go on to teach on future HTIC and also become mentors on the EDA Helicopter Exercise Programme.

" EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq travelled to Ireland today for a meeting with Irish Minister for Defence Simon Coveney T.D. as well as discussions with senior officials of the Irish Department of Defence. The visit is part of a series of visits by Mr. Domecq to all EDA Member States following his appointment as EDA Chief Executive and ahead of the Ministerial Steering Board on 18 May 2015. The discussions with the Minister and senior officials of the Irish Department of Defence focused on the progress on taskings stemming from the European Council of December 2013, ongoing work in preparation of the upcoming European Council discussion on defence in June 2015 as well as Ireland’s participation in EDA projects.  Minister Coveney thanked Mr. Domecq for his active engagement with Member States and stated that ”Ireland has been a strong supporter of the EDA since it was established during Ireland’s Presidency of the European Council in 2004.  Cooperation among participating Member States in the areas of capability development, procurement, training and similar such initiatives, within the framework of the EDA, can be hugely beneficial particularly for smaller Member States, like Ireland, which do not have the scale to develop these capabilities organically. I look forward to working with the Chief Executive of the EDA and my Ministerial colleagues in preparing the agenda for the European Council in June where defence will be on the agenda.” During the meeting with Minister Simon Coveney T.D. Jorge Domecq emphasised, “The Agency’s cooperative projects are designed to fill pressing capability gaps. These capabilities are owned by the Member States. I very much welcome Ireland’s active involvement in several EDA projects including countering improvised explosive devices, cyber defence and energy and environment, as well as its commitment as lead nation to naval training.”  More information News ""EDA Chief Executive visits The Netherlands"" (23 March 2015) News ""Discussions on European defence in Portugal"" (19 March 2015) News ""Jorge Domecq meets German Secretary of State"" (19 March 2015) News ""Belgium and EDA discuss future defence cooperation"" (18 March 2015) News ""Jorge Domecq in the UK for cooperation talks"" (25 Feb 2015) News ""Latvia and EDA discuss cooperation opportunities"" (19 Feb 2015) News ""EDA Chief Executive visits Lithuania"" (17 Feb 2015)  "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/03/25/jorge-domecq-exchanges-views-with-irish-minister-of-defence-simon-coveney-t.d-

EDA_NEWS_0594	2015-03-27	NEWS	Interview with VADM Matthieu Borsboom, Defensie Materieel Organisatie Director	 This article first appeared in the 7th issue of European Defence Matters, the magazine of the European Defence Agency. Click here to access the full digital edition What are the most important lessons learned from defence cooperation in the Netherlands so far? What should be the way forward in that regard? Often, when we talk about cooperation, we tend to focus on specific areas such as training or procurement. In my view as Director of the Defense Materiel Organisation (DMO), I think that when considering cooperation on new capabilities, we have to look at it from the widest angle possible: maintenance, life-cycle support, doctrine, simulators… Everything must be taken into account if we want to yield significant benefits. When we look at potential new programs, we seek partners that share this same vision. The partnership we have built over the years with Belgium in the naval domain is a great example of this. Our navies have set an integrated force sharing tasks, people as well as capabilities. What we did more than 30 years ago with France and Belgium as part of the Tripartite-class minehunter program is one of the oldest examples of European defence cooperation. Building on this equipment program, we have established a common training and exercise facility, and today the Belgian and Dutch navies are working in an entirely integrated fashion, for example to clear the North Sea of maritime mines. And in the future, we will look together at future plans for the acquisition of next-generation mine countermeasures capability. The F-35 has been selected as the Netherlands’ next-generation combat aircraft. What will be the benefits of this program for the Dutch defence industrial and technological base? The program is now in good shape, and two aircraft are already participating fully in the Operation Test & Evaluation program in the United States, as well as Dutch pilots. A parliamentary debate is planned for late February, during which we will propose to sign the first low-rate initial production (LRIP) contract. Meanwhile, preparations are ongoing for the transition from the current F-16 fleet to the future F-35. The objective is to reach an Initial Operating Capability (IOC) in 2021. In terms of cooperation, it seems important to us to align with other future European F-35 users – something that we already take into account in our decisions. It would be a missed opportunity not to cooperate on the whole lifecycle of this capability. At the same time, we are also looking at the future logistic footprint of the aircraft in Europe. The Netherlands were recently selected to be one of three maintenance shops for F-35 engines in Europe. The Netherlands are leading a European effort to develop a new-generation MRTT fleet. How important is that project to your country’s armed forces? This is an extremely important capability which is used every day by our armed forces. There is a clear need to replace it in order to field a new aircraft as early as 2019, while avoiding a capability gap. We have looked at cooperation in that domain since the very beginning. In 2007, I was personally involved in the SAC C-17 project and I witnessed firsthand the benefits of pooling and sharing when it comes to strategic capabilities. The new MRTT (multirole tanker transport) project is building on previous experiences such as this one, and we were pleased by the role the European Defence Agency played in project, bringing nations together and harmonising requirements between them. At the end of the day, what matters most is to have the capability available wherever and whenever we need it, no matter the flag on the aircraft or the location of its main operating base. Together with Poland and Norway, and maybe other partners in the future, we will share the costs of this common fleet and in the end we will benefit from an increased capability.  A new Defence Cyber Command was recently established in the NL. What are your priorities in terms of developing new cyber capabilities? Vice admiral Matthieu Borsboom, former Commander of the Royal Netherlands Navy and Admiral Benelux, has taken office as DMO Director in 2014.  The DMO is responsible for the whole Information Technology (IT) domain, with around 3.000 staff focusing on this issue. Part of them are working on cyber defence issues, under several work strands such as the protection of essential defence networks or the detection of anomalies. As part of our official defence cyber strategy, our first priority is to have an integrated approach in order to put all capabilities of the Cyber command available to the government agencies that might need them. We also look at improving our digital responsiveness as part of a “defensive cyber” approach, while exploring potential offensive capabilities. We have regular exchanges on these issues with our EU and NATO partners. Our overarching objective is to build a comprehensive knowledge base, then to deliver this expertise to the armed forces. . Is interoperability with other EU allies now a top priority for the Dutch armed forces when it comes to capability development? I would almost say that this is our number one priority. If you don’t have a built-in interoperability in your equipment, you can join a NATO, EU or coalition mission but if you’re not able to connect with other partners, you’re simply useless. You might have sensors, effectors, command-and-control systems – but if we cannot plug into the global network, we’re out of the game. Interoperability is very difficult. It has always been important in the NATO framework, but now with the changing geometry of ad-hoc coalitions it gets more and more complicated. Hybrid connectivity between civil and military systems also has to be taken into account and this is no easy feat, considering the pace at which new commercial standards are emerging. All this seems to be well understood by the defence community, but we need to increase our efforts if we want it to be as effective as possible. In the short to mid-term, which capabilities could benefit most from an increased cooperation at EU-level? The opportunities are widespread. I should not exclude any capability from the cooperative approach, which should in fact be the default approach. Of course, when we start talking about completely new capabilities, the complexity lies in the industrial strategy and the alignment of defence industries at a European level. In my experience, the desynchronisation of national budget cycles can be overcome. What matters is that we have to tackle issues as early as possible, be it for the identification or requirements or the procurement strategy. Part of the reason why we need to cooperate is also to maintain the knowledge base – something we might not be able to afford on a national basis anymore. Eventually, we need to look at an increased interdependence with our EU allies. What do you expect from an Agency like EDA to boost defence cooperation in Europe? I have known the European Defence Agency from the capability side for several years now, thanks to my previous postings within the Dutch MoD. I think what EDA does best is bringing together countries at the earliest stage possible, thus making it easier for Member States to get going with new cooperative programmes. I see more and more countries that just cannot do it on their own anymore; we need to cooperate, but we must not wait until it’s too late. One of the reasons why we chose to take the lead on the MRTT project is to send a clear signal to other nations, trying to convince them that cooperation is the way forward. For the Agency to keep proving its added value, it needs to make it as easy as possible for Member States to join such initiatives. Every time EDA succeeds in reducing their workload, this a clear victory for European defence cooperation.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/03/27/interview-with-vadm-matthieu-borsboom-defensie-materieel-organisatie-director
EDA_NEWS_0595	2015-03-31	NEWS	Latest defence data published	 The European Defence Agency (EDA) today published the aggregated defence data for 2013 of the 27 EDA participating Member States.  2013 was no exception to the recent years’ trend across EDA Member States to cut defence spending. Despite the fact that EDA increased from 26 to 271 Member States in 2013, the total defence expenditure of its Member States decreased by EUR 1.7 billion or 0.9%, compared to 2012, to EUR 186 billion. In real terms², the total defence expenditure has been declining since 2006, dropping by over EUR 32 billion or about 15% from 2006 to 2013. Both as a share of GDP and as a share of the total government spending, defence expenditure has decreased for the seventh year in a row to its lowest value since 2006, 1.45% and 2.97%, respectively. Defence expenditure breakdown (billion EUR and % change on previous year) Operation and maintenance and R&D/R&T expenditure increase slightly In terms of the distribution of defence expenditure, there were some shifts in 2013. Personnel-related expenditure decreased by over 4%, from EUR 95.7 billion in 2012 to EUR 91.8 billion in 2013, and for the first time since 2006, its share in the total defence expenditure dropped below 50%, to 49.3%. Personnel expenditure expressed per person employed in defence (military and civilian) has been increasing since 2006 to reach its highest value of EUR 51,475 in 2011, and started to decrease the year after. It decreased further from 2012 to 2013 (-2.6%), to EUR 49,836. With a share of 25.1% - the biggest since 2006 - operation and maintenance expenditure remained the second largest component of the total defence spending in 2013, and, despite minor annual fluctuations, it appears to be on an upward trajectory. From 2012 to 2013, it increased by EUR 2 billion or 4.4%, to EUR 46.8 billion, and almost reached its highest level of EUR 46.9 billion recorded in 2007. By contrast, defence investment, comprising equipment procurement and R&D (including R&T) expenditure, following a sharp decrease in 2011 (-10.5%), increased slightly in 2012, but decreased again in 2013 below the level it was in 2006, to EUR 37.5 billion or 20.1% of the total defence expenditure. This resulted from a decrease in one of its components - equipment procurement - which reduced by EUR 1.5 billion or 4.9%, to EUR 30 billion (16.1% of the total expenditure). The second component - defence R&D expenditure - increased slightly to EUR 7.5 billion (4% of the total expenditure), breaking a downward trend observed since 2006 (with the exception of 2010, when it marginally increased). R&T expenditure - a subset of R&D - followed a similar path. Being on a decline since 2006 (except 2011), it increased by just over 3% from 2012 to 2013, to reach EUR 2.1 billion. In real terms, defence investment decreased by EUR 4.8 billion or 11.3% from 2006 to 2013, whereas its components – equipment procurement and R&D - decreased by EUR 1.7 billion (-5.3%) and EUR 3.1 billion (-29.1%), respectively. Defence expenditure in current and constant1 prices (billion EUR) Collaboration3: a sharp decrease in procurement and a marginal increase in R&T Since 2012, it has not been possible to have a comprehensive picture of the total EDA Member States’ expenditure on collaborative (including European collaboration) defence equipment procurement and R&T projects or programmes, as several Member States were not able to provide this data. A glimpse into the partial 2012-2013 data reveals a worrisome trend, particularly for defence equipment procurement. Between 2012 and 2013, reported collaborative equipment procurement expenditure decreased by 20.7% to the lowest level since 2006 of EUR 4.75 billion. In relation to the total defence equipment procurement, collaborative expenditure accounted for 15.9%, suggesting that over 84% was spent nationally. European collaborative equipment procurement experienced an even sharper decrease of 21.6%, and in 2013, amounted to EUR 4.5 billion, accounting for 94.6% of the total collaborative equipment procurement. The total collaborative defence R&T expenditure of the EDA Member States that provided the data also shrank, though less dramatically (-0.9%), to EUR 203 million. Its share in the total defence R&T was 9.7%, the remaining 90.3% being regarded as national expenditure. Although the reported European collaborative defence R&T expenditure increased by 21.4% between 2012 and 2013, with a total of EUR 168 million, accounting for 82.5% of the total collaborative defence R&T, it nevertheless remained record-low.   Defence expenditure and investment per military decrease despite reduced personnel numbers 2013 saw the seventh consecutive reduction in the number of personnel working in defence (both military and civilian), caused mainly by internal restructuring processes. The total personnel decreased by almost 600,000 or 24% between 2006 and 2013, while the number of military and civilian personnel decreased by over 500,000 (-26%) and almost 80,000 (-16%), respectively, during the same period. In 2013, there was a total of 1,435,693 military and 407,245 civilian personnel in EDA Member States - a decrease of 0.9% and 3.6%, compared to 2012. A share of military in the total personnel has also been decreasing from the highest of 80.6% in 2008 and 2010 to the lowest of 77.4% in 2012. In 2013, it was 77.9%. For the first time since 2006, defence expenditure expressed per military decreased by 0.05%, from EUR 129,878 in 2012 to EUR 129,814 in 2013. So did defence investment per military, which has been on an overall increasing trend since 2006 due to declining military personnel, rather than increasing Member States’ investment. In 2013, defence investment per military was EUR 26,122 - a 2.9% reduction on the 2012 figure of EUR 26,906.   Increasing numbers of troops available for deployment and actual deployments Between 2012 and 2013, the average number of troops deployed outside the EU territory increased for the first time since 2008, both in absolute terms (+17.2%) and as a share of military personnel (from 3.4% to 4%). EDA Member States together deployed on average 58,086 troops on a continuous basis throughout 2013, which constituted 4% of the overall strength of their military personnel. In 2013, there was also an increase in the total number of deployable (land) forces (+7%) and that of sustainable (land) forces (+1.5%). The 27 EDA Member States had in total 481,001 deployable (the highest number since 2006) and 110,433 sustainable (land) forces. The ratio between sustainable and a pool of deployable (land) forces remained stable at 1:4.4. Meanwhile, after a five-year-long upward trend, the costs related to deployed operations4 decreased for the second time in a row, both in absolute terms - from EUR 9 billion to EUR 7.4 billion (-17.1%) – and as a share of the total expenditure - from 4.8% to 4% - between 2012 and 2013. Operations costs per military deployed decreased by 29.3% and stood at EUR 127,989 in 2013.   Background The European Defence Agency (EDA) collects defence data on an annual basis. The Ministries of Defence of the Agency’s 27 Member States (MS) provide the data. EDA acts as the custodian of the data and publishes the aggregated figures in a yearly defence data booklet.   Defence investment breakdown (billion EUR and % change on previous year) More information The booklet is available for download here.  A summary article is published in the latest issue of the EDA magazine, European Defence Matters   --------------------------------- 1 Data does not include Denmark which is not an EDA Member State. 2006-2012 data does not include Croatia which became the 27th EDA Member State on 1 July 2013. 2 In order to measure real growth and ensure a “real” comparison between years, inflation needs to be taken into account. Thus, data from 2006 to 2012 has been inflated to 2013 economic conditions (Source of deflator: European Commission ECFIN - based on weight of EU-28). 3 All 2012 and 2013 figures on collaboration are partial, as several Member States were not able to provide data. 4 2013 figure is an estimate, as several Member States were not able to provide accurate data, therefore sound comparisons with the previous years are limited.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/03/31/latest-defence-data-published
EDA_NEWS_0596	2015-03-19	NEWS	Discussions on European defence in Portugal	" Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency and José Pedro Aguiar-Branco, Minister of Defence of Portugal met today to discuss preparations of the European Council on defence issues in June 2015 as well as the implementation of the EU Maritime Security Strategy Action Plan.  The Portuguese Minister of Defence stressed the importance of the European Defence Agency, especially in the context of EU’s financial constraints. José Pedro Aguiar-Branco underlined the importance of R&T programmes as a way of developing defence and dual-use technologies. He also mentioned the importance of supporting the role of small and medium enterprises, since they are the backbone of the European Technological and Industrial Base. Finally, he underlined the need to work towards the full implementation of the December 2013 European Council conclusions in accordance with the agreed roadmap. “The European Defence Agency witnessed Portugal’s hospitality and commitment to European defence corporation during the last three editions of Hot Blade which is part of our successful Helicopter Exercise Programme. To date, 174 helicopters, 329 crews and over 12.000 personnel have participated in seven live exercises organised as part of this programme. Portugal will also host the European Air Transport Training in June this year. By training together, our armed forces can be best prepared for their deployment in multinational operations”, Jorge Domecq said at the meeting in Lisbon.

EDA_NEWS_0598	2015-03-19	NEWS	Critical space technologies for European strategic non-dependence	 The European Space Agency (ESA), the European Commission (EC) and the European Defence Agency (EDA) agreed on a list of actions for strategic non-dependence in the area of critical space technologies. The list was elaborated in a joint task force together with the relevant Member States organisations, industry and academia and contains 39 non-dependence actions in technology domains such as materials, electronic or photonic components, green propellants or complex structures. © ESA / European Commission One of the key objectives of the European Space Policy is to ensure non-dependence on critical technologies. This requires significant efforts in a large array of domains such as skills, sustainable European industrial capabilities, appropriate public policies and regulations as well as forward-looking research and technology. Europe’s ability to get access to  key enabling technologies is crucial to both space and defence capabilities. Considering the similarities between the defence and space domains, since 2009, ESA, EC and EDA have run the European non-dependence process through a joint task force for critical technologies. Its objective is to map key technology needs and to identify priority actions to be implemented within European or national programmes.  On 13 February 2015, the 3rd European non-dependence process results were presented to Member States and industry. The final list of urgent actions for the time frame 2015-2017 was finalised on 18 March 2015. From October 2014 to February 2015 the joint task force together with the relevant Member States organisations, industry and academia conducted a consultation process to find consensus on the most urgent research actions. The current action list contains 39 non-dependence actions in technology domains such as materials, electronic or photonic components, green propellants or complex structures. It promotes synergies between ESA, EC and EDA activities and serves as input for the upcoming H2020 Space workplan. This succesful joint process illustrates the commitment of both Member States and European institutional actors in securing those key technologies that reinforce Europe’s supply chain and thus its strategic independence and security.

EDA_NEWS_0600	2015-03-18	NEWS	Belgium and EDA discuss future defence cooperation	" Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency, met today with Steven Vandeput, Belgian Minister of Defence, in Brussels to discuss preparations of the European Council on defence issues in June 2015 as well as future defence cooperation opportunities.  Following his meeting with Mr. Domecq, Minister Vandeput said: “I fully appreciate the role of the EDA as a facilitator between the political and military actors in defence cooperation. The increased demand for operational output motivates us towards more and closer cooperation between Member States in order to create leverage and enhance efficiency. In any case, Belgium is and will remain a strong supporter of defence cooperation. For example, I would like to refer to the “Ghent Initiative” in 2010, which gave a strong political impulse to the “Pooling & Sharing” ideas and projects within the EU.” “Belgium is of double importance for the European Defence Agency. As a member it has a long tradition in defence cooperation at regional and European levels. In the framework of the European Defence Agency, Belgium is particularly active in projects covering cyber defence and countering improvised explosive devices. As our host nation, Belgium grants VAT exemption to EDA’s projects on an ad-hoc basis. This VAT exemption gives a real bonus to defence cooperation among Member States”, Jorge Domecq underlined after the meeting in Brussels. Before the discussion with Minister Vandeput, Jorge Domecq also met with the Belgian Chief of Defence, General Gérard Van Caelenberge. The main topics addressed during both meetings were the preparation of the Heads of State and Government discussion on defence in June 2015 as well as cooperation opportunities on European level in view of future national policy choices.  The meetings in Brussels are part of a tour to all EDA Member States by Jorge Domecq following his appointment as EDA Chief Executive and ahead of the European Council in June Picture © BE Defense / Malek AZOUG More information: Website Belgian Ministry of Defence News ""Jorge Domecq in the UK for cooperation talks"" (25 Feb 2015) News ""Latvia and EDA discuss cooperation opportunities"" (19 Feb 2015) News ""EDA Chief Executive visits Lithuania"" (17 Feb 2015) "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/03/18/belgium-and-eda-discuss-future-defence-cooperation
EDA_NEWS_0601	2015-03-11	NEWS	More effective European defence industry cooperation	 On March 9-10, the European Defence Agency (EDA) National Armaments Directors discussed ways to enhance European defence and security capabilities to prepare for the June 2015 European Council discussion on defence. National Armaments Directors discussed how to promote cooperation of European states in the area of joint procurement, project planning and implementation, support for EDA capability programmes and ways to strengthen the European defence industry. National Armaments Directors concluded that the involvement of small and medium sized companies in supply chains is beneficial for the European economy and long-term defence capabilities and should be enhanced. Evaluating the current security challenges, Member States agreed that cooperation is paramount; therefore, it is crucial to strengthen the cooperation with partners, such as NATO and the U.S. “This is a significant forum because it tackles the European capabilities at their core and allows our countries to cooperate in the area of procurement, armaments and assistance to our defence industries”, stressed Raimonds Vējonis, the Minister of Defence of the Republic of Latvia, welcoming the participants of the meeting. “In the light of recent developments in the European security architecture, cooperation within the EU and our partners is essential, therefore the back-to-back event with the NATO and the U.S. gave an opportunity to discuss issues of mutual interest and standardization, government to government sales and Single European Skies”, said R.Vējonis regarding the back-to-back event with the NATO and the U.S. that took place during the informal meeting and was hosted by the Latvian EU Presidency. ”EDA’s role is to support Member States in their efforts to develop capabilities. In light of new security challenges paired with budgetary constraints, the case for cooperation becomes ever more compelling. The meeting of National Armaments Directors in Riga was an important opportunity towards the preparation of the European Council discussion on defence in June since they are responsible for delivering the capabilities our armed forces need today and in the future”, said Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the EDA  after the meeting. During the meeting an exhibition of Latvian defence industry products was available for the participants.

EDA_NEWS_0603	2015-03-18	NEWS	European Parliament exchange of views on cyber defence	 The European Parliament Subcommittee on Security and Defence (SEDE) held an exchange of views on cybersecurity and defence with ENISA, EEAS and EDA representatives on 16 March 2015. Peter Round, EDA Director Capability, Armament & Technology was invited to brief member of the subcommittee on EDA activities in the area of cyber defence. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), emphasised in his presentation on cyber security the increasing number of security incidents. Rudolf Roy, Head of Security Policy Division, Conflict Prevention and Security Policy Directorate (EEAS) highlighted among other topics the importance of secure cyberspace for CSDP missions and operations equally important to other domains of warfare (land, sea, air and space). In his presentation, Peter Round concentrated first on successful EDA projects in the area of cyber defence, on the EU cyber defence policy framework, EDA support to operations and preparations for the European Council discussion on defence in June.  In the last three years, the Agency has completed ten cyber defence related projects with a financial volume of about 2 million euros. This equals to approximately 10% of EDA’s operational budget. Among these ten projects are a stocktaking study of cyber defence capabilities among all EDA Member States and EU institutions, the establishment of a cyber defence research agenda and cyber defence training courses for senior military decision makers as well as the assessment of the feasibility of a EU Cyber Defence Centre for CSDP.  “The Agency continues to give high priority to providing cyber domain support to ongoing operations and missions”, Peter Round highlighted. So far, the Agency has delivered three cyber awareness seminars for the staff in charge of the EUFOR RCA operation. The finalisation of the feasibility assessment for an EU Cyber Defence Centre provides several options on the set-up for such a centre for CSDP operations and missions. EDA’s project team cyber defence with experts from 24 EDA Member States and EU institutions is currently evaluating these proposals. A consolidated report will be introduced to the political decision-making process by the end of the semester.  Finally, Peter Round emphasised the limited resources dedicated to cyber defence within the EU institutions. He underlined the need for increased civil-military cooperation in the field to maximise synergies.  Members of the European Parliament congratulated the speakers on the progress made in the domain of cybersecurity and defence following the taskings of the European Council in December 2013. Questions related mostly to cyber defence capabilities available to Member States, critical infrastructures for cyber defence and EU-NATO cooperation in the field.  Picture © European Parliament, 2015 More information: You can watch the video of the SEDE meeting on the European Parliament website.  EDA factsheet on cyber defence  ​   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/03/18/european-parliament-exchange-of-views-on-cyber-defence
EDA_NEWS_0604	2015-03-06	NEWS	Successful personnel recovery course held in Sweden	 The third edition of the EU Personnel Recovery Controller and Planner Course (PRCPC), a project initiated by EDA, was held from 23 February to 6 March 2015. Organised and hosted by Sweden in Karlsborg, the exercise gathered 23 students from 12 countries. Instructors from France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden as well as Canada shared their knowledge and experience of personnel recovery (PR) matters with a group of students coming from Belgium, Canada, Finland, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland. PR is usually defined as the sum of efforts needed to recover isolated civilian or military personnel. The main focus of the course was to train staff officers to support their commanders on PR-related issues. It is intended for personnel who will be manning a personnel recovery position in a tactical operation centre (TOC), a personnel recovery coordination cell (PRCC) or a joint personnel recovery cell (JPRC). This may be within an EU, NATO or national staff as part of exercises or deployed operations.  During the first week of the course, students were briefed on the four main elements of the PR system (preparation, planning, execution and adaptation) and learned how to control and oversee PR operations. Most of the students also attended the second week of the course to learn how to properly plan PR operations and to develop a PR annex to an operations plan. Training involved classroom lessons as well as work in study groups where participants faced a variety of PR challenges. Next stop: Hungary The next EU PRCPC will take place from 25 May to 5 June 2015 in Hungary. The newly-developed Personnel Recovery Functional Area Service Advanced Technology Demonstrator (PR FAS ATD) will be tested. This system is designed to provide headquarters-level PR staff with a planning tool to manage PR missions in a PRCC or JPRC. It has been developed as part of EDA’s work to improve interoperability amongst European armed forces in the field of personnel recovery. The EU PRCPC project was established on 30 May 2013 as an EDA Category B project, under the lead of Sweden. As of today, it gathers six contributing EU Member States: Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands and Sweden. EDA has already initiated a process to extend the project and allow a smooth handover of the course to a suitable entity. The European Personnel Recovery Centre (EPRC), established in Italy, is a potential candidate.

EDA_NEWS_0605	2015-03-11	NEWS	Experts meet on materials modelling and simulation	 Materials modelling and simulation are cross-cutting technologies with potential benefits for defence capabilities. 35 experts from national ministries, European institutions, industry and academia participated in an EDA workshop to discuss current and future areas of application in defence on 27 January 2015. Materials modelling is becoming well-established in the civil and military domains. As conducting experiments is costly and often difficult owing to environmental constraints (high strain rate, high temperature, hazardous environments), integrating materials modelling with experimental programmes yields benefits.  The main objective of the workshop on Materials & Structures Modelling & Simulation (M&S2)  was to identify the potential impact of these technologies on defence. The workshop concentrated on discussing active and future directions on materials modelling around four key topics: new materials, new structures, new processes and defence specific phenomena. Generally speaking, two main topics related to polymer composites and ceramic materials came out of the discussions:  There is a need to provide diagnostic and prognostic methods for structures and also relevant characterisation of defence and dual-use specific phenomena, such as ageing, fatigue stress, impact damage, etc.; and  In order to improve the materials performance under extreme conditions, a better understanding of their behaviour at atomic and molecular level is needed. Therefore, there is a need to further develop modelling at nanoscale level which could be integrated in mesoscale models, described in the microscale until reaching current macroscale. These ideas will be used by the EDA Materials & Structures expert groups in order to provide inputs for different initiatives, and also for building a roadmap for the achievement of the identified research & technology goals, and future update of the Strategic Research Agenda on materials & structures.  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/03/11/experts-meet-on-materials-modelling-and-simulation

EDA_NEWS_0607	2015-03-02	NEWS	EDA signs Cooperation Arrangement with Athena	 EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq and Athena Administrator Hans-Werner Grenzhäuser signed an arrangement establishing the framework for future cooperation between EDA and Athena. This arrangement builds upon a successful pilot case conducted in 2014 in which the European Defence Agency (EDA) supported the acquisition of Air to Ground Surveillance and Reconnaissance Services for Operation EUFOR Althea. Procurement of contracted solutions has become increasingly relevant for EU military operations not only to fill capability gaps in the force generation process, but also as a general planned support for ongoing operations. This broader arrangement opens the option for the Athena Administrator or any Operation/Mission Commanders as Contracting Authorities to call upon EDA to provide, upon its expertise and available means and capabilities, technical and overall administrative support for procurement of infrastructure works, as well as a variety of services or supplies, through direct contracts or pre-mission solutions, e.g. through framework contracts. Greater flexibility Speaking about the cooperation, Hans-Werner Grenzhäuser said:  “I am convinced that our cooperation would be of huge benefit for supporting EU-led military operations. The European Defence Agency can play a significant role. It holds a considerable knowledge of the industry, as well as in-house technical expertise and experience in contracting. The cooperation with EDA will therefore increase flexibility, optimise procurement procedures and save scarce resources by providing contractor support solutions to operations and Athena central.”   Talking about the arrangement, Jorge Domecq added: “The ultimate goal of any EDA project is to support operations. Today’s arrangement allows us to do this by providing a procurement service directly to the Administrator or an EU mission. I am sure this will prove particularly useful to develop upstream more ready-to-use solutions available from the shelf at the start of an operation in fields such as medical services, real-life support, satellite communication or strategic transport.” The Athena Mechanism Athena is the mechanism established to administer the financing of the common costs of European Union operations having military or defence implications governed by Council Decision 2011/871/CFSP. The Council Decision allows for arrangements to be signed with Union bodies to facilitate procurement in operations in the most cost-effective manner.

EDA_NEWS_0612	2015-02-09	NEWS	Latvia signs Diplomatic Clearances Arrangement	 Latvia joined the Diplomatic Clearances Technical Arrangement as 14th member on 1st January 2015. Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Slovakia, Sweden already signed the arrangement to simplify and harmonise military air transport in Europe.  The aim of EDA’s Diplomatic Clearances Technical Arrangement is to harmonise procedures for overflights and landings of EU nations military registered or operated transport aircraft. The arrangement enables signatory member states to operate without the need to submit diplomatic requests for each flight since an annual diplomatic clearance number is issued.  This common mechanism increases efficiency and effectiveness of European airlift as there is more flexibility during mission preparation and mission execution. Furthermore it saves human and financial resources of the member states with a significantly reduced number of required requests and notifications. A dedicated online portal provides basic transparency on national policies and procedures for granting diplomatic clearances for military transport aircraft according to the technical arrangement.  Background The disparate requirements to obtain diplomatic clearances to land in or to fly over EU member states cause unnecessary delays and hamper swift airlift operations. The legacy diplomatic clearances mechanism needs to be tailored to the 21st century’s requirements, especially looking at the future implementation of the Single European Sky (SES) where a route driven system will evolve into a trajectory driven system.

EDA_NEWS_0613	2015-02-06	NEWS	EDA's Pete Round discusses Counter-IED challenges	 Homemade bombs are threats that are not going to go away, and ever closer civil-military cooperation is needed to neutralise them, as EDA Capability, Armament and Technology Director Pete Round explains in this opinion piece originally published by Security Europe. Improvised explosive devices remain the single largest killer of coalition soldiers in the war in Afghanistan – and a favoured weapon of Europe’s home-grown terrorists as well. This has put the devices at the forefront of public debate, with the acronym ‘IED’ now used and widely understood well beyond just military circles. However, even if they have gained a lot of public attention in the last few years, IEDs are nothing new. With their low cost and ability to cause significant damage they have been the weapon of choice for insurgents fighting technologically superior forces for decades. Counter-IED training © EDA Biggest threat With this asymmetric warfare likely to remain the norm, IEDs will continue to be the biggest single threat to our soldiers on the ground – as well as being a growing threat to civilian populations. It is vital that the experience and knowledge gained in fighting IEDs in Afghanistan is not lost. Moreover, we need to ensure the best possible collaboration between military and civilian law enforcement entities. The European Defence Agency (EDA) has played an important role in ensuring that skills and knowledge in tackling IEDs are maintained. One important element of its counter-IED work is technical exploitation. This refers to the recording and analysing of information related to events, scenes, technical components and the materials used in an IED attack. The objective of counter-IED exploitation is to gather the technical and tactical data about the attack whilst at the same time identifying the IED “supply chain” in order to gather intelligence about those involved in IED production and use. Exploitation allows bomb disposal experts to better understand the threat they are dealing with, helping them to predict future activity and allowing them to attack the network involved in producing the devices. A number of the EU’s civil security research projects financed by the European Commission aim for similar goals, for example. Counter-IED exploitation was the rationale behind the 2011-2014 deployment of a multi-national theatre exploitation laboratory in Afghanistan, where it helped disrupt networks making and using IEDs. In parallel to that effort, a new programme, called the “Joint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory” (JDEAL) was begun in May 2013. Under Dutch lead, its aim was to establish a permanent IED exploitation training facility in the Netherlands, staffed by a permanent multinational team. Under the project, a further two deployable laboratories could be procured for use in future operations. Pooling and sharing Initiatives such as JDEAL aim to ensure that the knowledge gained at a considerable price in wartime is not lost to other defence actors, but also made available to the bomb disposal community as a whole, whether military or civil. Indeed, IEDs are not only a threat to our soldiers overseas: for decades, they have also been used against civilians in Europe often with lethal results. They will continue as the weapon of choice for individuals planning terror attacks against Europe’s homeland. In order to ensure an efficient “spillover” of know-how between these two interconnected worlds, dedicated events have recently been jointly organised by the EDA and Europol. These have brought together experts from as many as 16 different European countries. The overarching idea is really quite simple: participants take part in realistic training scenarios that involve homemade explosives based on situations experienced in the real world. By doing so, they share best practices and improve their skills through multinational and civil-military cooperation. Even the United States has showed interest in the initiative by sending experts from the FBI and US Department of Justice. Winning the IED war This combined approach ought to be extended to the whole spectrum of C-IED activities – and not just for the disposal of homemade explosives. Other critical skills, such as exploitation techniques currently tackled via the JDEAL project, are needed to win the IED war. If we want to effectively predict and prevent further IED-related incidents on the battlefield or the homeland – and develop the means to safely neutralise them in a variety of conditions – then we need to push this civil-military cooperation as far as we can. The lives of European soldiers and citizens might very well depend on it.

EDA_NEWS_0614	2015-02-16	NEWS	New funding opportunity for dual-use research	 The European Defence Agency is launching a new Request for Projects (RFP) on dual-use technologies which could be supported by EDA to benefit from European Structural and Investment Funds. The initiative aims to identify innovative dual-use research and technology projects which could be funded by European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). These projects, to be submitted to the national Ministries of Defence (MoD), will be selected by MoDs and EDA based on eligibility and performance criteria. Small & medium-sized entreprises, large companies, research centres, academia as well as public bodies can assume the role of a project holder. Selected projects will benefit from free and tailored technical assistance provided by an international consulting firm, specifically contracted by EDA to support this initiative. This technical support aims to fully develop the project folder (to be ultimately submitted to ESIF managing authorities) and, therefore, maximise its chance to access ESIF co-funding.  New procedure This new procedure builds on a successful EDA pilot call launched in 2013. It led to the selection of project “Turtle” as part of which a Portuguese consortium was granted access to an ESIF financial support in order to develop key enabling technologies for sustainable and long-term presence in the deep ocean. The total budget was over €1 million, 60% of which was provided through ESIF. Originally created to implement EU policy by reducing economic disparities at regional level, structural funds have an important role to play in the development of dual-use technologies. Over the current programming period that runs from 2014 to 2020, around €200 billion have been earmarked as part of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), one of the ESI funds under which research and innovation activities can be supported. Dual-use research aims at developing technologies that could benefit both the civil and the defence sectors, for instance in the field of electronics, nanotechnologies, materials, sensors, or propulsion.

EDA_NEWS_0616	2015-01-26	NEWS	Increased cooperation to counter hybrid threats	" Against the background of changes to the global security environment, Latvian Minister of Defence Raimonds Vējonis emphasised the importance of working together to guarantee Europe’s security and prosperity. Opening a high-level seminar organised in the framework of the Latvian EU Presidency on 19 January, he argued that the European Council in June presented a significant opportunity to address common threats and challenges. During his speech, Minister Vējonis outlined a review of strategic defence documents as one of Latvia’s priorities for the European Council. In particular, an update of the European Security Strategy should be assigned. Secondly, cooperation and coordination between EU bodies active in the field of CSDP should be enhanced. Minister Vējonis mentioned the four capability programmes on air-to-air refuelling, remotely piloted aircraft systems, satellite communications, and cyber defence, the European Defence Agency was entrusted with as successful examples of increased cooperation. He emphasised that the EU’s comprehensive approach including cooperation between military and civilian actors should be bolstered to address hybrid threats. Finally, cyber defence and the EU’s maritime security are two areas Latvia will put special emphasis on during its presidency. The seminar ""Building consensus towards the June 2015 European Council - next steps?"" was attended by representatives from the EU Ministries of Defence, European institutions as well as representatives of the academic community. The European Defence Agency participated in a panel discussion on strengthening Europe’s defence industry. Tarja Jaakkola, Deputy Director & Head of Unit Market and Industry Policy presented the Agency’s work in the fields of research and dual-use. Further discussions included ways of enhancing the development of EU capabilities as well as the role of the EU CSDP in the global security environment.

EDA_NEWS_0617	2015-01-30	NEWS	EDA discusses synergies at EU Space Policy Conference	 EDA European Synergies & Innovation Director Denis Roger provided the audience of the 7th EU Space Policy Conference with an overview of the Agency’s work in the field of Governmental satellite communications.  The 7th Annual Conference on European Union Space Policy took place 27-28 January in Brussels. For this year’s edition, this event of major importance for the space community focused on the rising demand for space services and applications in Europe and on ways to reinforce the EU’s position in that domain. It gathered high-level speakers from governments, industry and EU institutions. Govsatcom Speaking as part of the sixth session dedicated to the increasing civil and security & defence synergies of space services, EDA European Synergies & Innovation (ESI) Director Denis Roger put the focus on the Agency’s role in the cooperative Govsatcom (Governmental Satellite Communications) programme. “A common set of requirements has been approved by participating Member States in 2014”, he pointed out. “The European Defence Agency is now preparing the technical studies that will allow us to offer options to Member States by late 2016, early 2017”, he added. From the outset, this future Govsatcom programme will need to benefit from a dual approach, taking into account military and civil needs. “Not taking advantage of such synergies will be a waste of efficiency and taxpayer’s money”, Denis Roger stressed. He also discussed the topic of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS), another capability priority supported by the December 2013 European Council with an important space dimension:  “The DESIRE program, ran jointly by EDA and the European Space Agency, will investigate if satellite communications are compatible with safety and navigability requirements for the air traffic insertion of RPAS”.   Dual-use approach Denis Roger stressed again the benefits of a dual-use approach on these topics. He also mentioned cyber defence as a field where close coordination between civil and military users is needed and should be taken into account at the very beginning of any new programmatic initiative. He concluded on the fact that the progress made to better exploit civil-military synergies did not diminish the need for specific defence research and had to be pursued through the full use of EU funding instruments to support them as well as other dual-use initiatives in the space domain.

EDA_NEWS_0619	2015-01-19	NEWS	European Air Transport Fleet enters new phase	 Launched four years ago by 20 participating nations, the European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) partnership has now entered its second phase. The initiative is expected to grow based on the building blocks that have already been put in place. With an objective to address the airlift shortfall in the European Union, the European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) partnership – initiated in 2011 as a European Defence Agency (EDA) programme – aims at developing cost-effective solutions to optimise the use of existing and future national fleets of military transport aircraft in Europe. A three-phase strategy has been agreed upon to achieve that ambitious objective. “The first phase of the EATF strategy, which ran from 2012 to 2014, has now effectively come to an end”, Laurent Donnet, EDA Project Manager Airlift & Air-to-Air Refuelling, explains. “This allowed us to lay out the partnership’s foundations with a number of tangible deliverables and activities such as the harmonisation of diplomatic clearances mechanisms and procedures, but also live exercises and training events”, he adds. Growing interest A testimony to this successful first phase, the European Air Transport Training (EATT) events organised in Europe keep gathering more and more participants, with 14 aircraft and 30 crews expected to join the next edition in June 2015. This year, three editions of the European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course (EAATTC) will also take place, as well as three European Air Transport Instructor Courses and the annual European Air Transport Symposium (see below).   EATF Phase 2, expected to run for three years, will see a strengthening of these activities through several initiatives, such as the development of a permanent multinational training centre in Zaragoza (Spain) expected to reach its initial operational capability by mid-2016. Meanwhile, harmonisation of rules, regulations, tactics, techniques and procedures will continue. User groups developed around aircraft such as the A400M, A330 MRTT, CN295 or KC-390 will also be explored, based on a model currently being tested with the European C-27J Spartan community of users. All these efforts will be pursued in close cooperation with the European Air Transport Command (EATC) in Eindhoven, which has become the major centre of airlift expertise in Europe. “The EATF partnership hit the nail on the head”, Laurent Donnet stresses. “European airlift is being trained like never before and interoperability between Member States keeps growing”, he adds. Ultimately, a third EATF phase is expected to run from 2017 to 2021. It will seek deeper cooperation between participating nations with regards to new capabilities, as well as increased support for the creation and implementation of innovative and tangible solutions.

EDA_NEWS_0620	2015-01-09	NEWS	Three ways to reindustrialise Europe with dual-use technologies	 Widely used in everything from tennis rackets to Formula 1 cars, carbon fibre was originally developed by the UK Ministry of Defence in the early 1960s for military applications. Back then an esoteric and expensive material, it’s become price-competitive with its intense strength and durability for its weight. Similarly, head-up displays were developed to enable fast jet pilots to have key information presented in their view of the outside world, rather than having to frequently look down into the cockpit. This technology has progressively spread into civil aviation and more recently into cars, with the advantage of always keeping one’s eyes on the road. These are only two of many examples illustrating how defence research can benefit the global economy and power Europe’s re-industrialisation. Reciprocally, the fast development of technologies in the civilian world can be essential to the emergence of cutting-edge defence systems. The difficult times our economies are facing today mean that Europe is losing ground to its faster-growing Asian and American counterparts. This concern of the defence community is shared by Heads of State and Government: in this context, it is of paramount importance to invest in all the technologies and production capabilities that are essential to maintain Europe’s competitiveness. However, Europe still suffers from legal and psychological barriers between civilian and military research – barriers that our competitors do not have. These limitations seriously hamper our capability to “cross-fertilise” developments from both worlds. The issue has been acknowledged at the highest level: in December 2013, the European Council itself tasked the European Defence Agency and other bodies to better exploit civil-military synergies. This issue should be tackled in three ways: 1/ Desegmentation of civil and military research If we want the civilian and defence worlds to effectively cross-feed each other, then it is necessary to proceed with the desegmentation of civil and military research. By allowing funding to flow from one side to the other, major spin-offs between defence and civil research could be achieved. It is worth remembering that few technologies are military or civil by nature, especially at low technological readiness. Only when applied and used in a given system does a specific technology become military or commercial. Today, this cross-fertilisation is limited by several factors, such as the legitimate confidentiality surrounding sensitive defence applications, but also the competitive advantage that might result from a cutting-edge civil technology. However, security regulations and intellectual property rights are here to address this issue. The main barrier is the lack of a comprehensive policy approach for all parties involved. 2/ Optimisation and prioritisation of technology-based production capabilities The application of innovative technologies often requires considerable investments to move from the lab to serial production. And very often, such investments are only viable if this production is designed to address all potential markets: civil, defence and space. The European Defence Agency, in close cooperation with the Commission and industry, is investigating which key enabling technologies need a priority and focused investment effort to sustain the European supply chain. These are technologies such as components (silicum, gallium arsenide, infrared detectors), carbon fibre or optical devices. Europeans need to invest in these domains to levelthe playing field then to define priorities on related key industrial capabilities. Meanwhile, it is essential to optimise available resources. The civil, space and defence domains need to be addressed together by a comprehensive business plan to yield cost savings while boosting innovation capabilities. This is the only way forward if we want to see Europe re-industrialise. 3/ Increase funding for defence research Claude-France Arnould is the Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency Defence research budgets have been cut by 20% over the last six years. The risk is real to lose the ability to reach critical mass in a number of technology areas. This would not only jeopardise Europe’s strategic autonomy, but would also impede the long-term competitiveness of its high-tech commercial industry. It has been said that defence and space are to aviation what Formula One is to the automotive industry: a formidable cradle of innovation and technological breakthroughs. The situation is all the more worrying since, according to a study commissioned by the European Defence Agency, the multiplier effect on GDP growth for an investment in defence research & technology is 12 to 20 times higher than in other areas of public spending. Therefore, investment in defence R&T must be a logical component of any comprehensive growth policy. The Agency is also supporting Member States by contributing to the Commission’s work on an R&T Preparatory Action related to the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), as called for by the December 2013 European Council. If successful, this Preparatory Action could give birth to a wider defence research programme at European level, the impact of which will be all more the important since cross-fertilisation with other European research and innovation initiatives will be maximised. The benefits can be enormous, both for the civilian and defence sectors.

EDA_NEWS_0621	2014-12-19	NEWS	Defence experts meet to discuss implications of Additive Manufacturing	 More than 50 experts from Ministries of Defence, industry and academia have met in an EDA workshop held in ONERA to discuss the implications of additive manufacturing for defence capabilities. Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing as it is more commonly known, has received widespread media attention in the past few years. From prototypes for car manufacturers through to a fully 3D printed house in the Netherlands, the technology has the potential to radically change manufacturing across a host of industries, defence industries. As such Additive Manufacturing has been recognised as a key cross-cutting technology that could enhance defence capabilities in the EDA’s group working on Materials and Structures. 3D printing has particular benefits for the defence industry – where the need for tailored or adapted components is important. The technology will enable the manufacturing of pieces on demand, reducing the logistics of deploying spare parts and also making possible to develop tailored parts for a damage system in operations. Connecting European experts The main objective of the EDA workshop was to identify the potential impact of these technologies in Defence. Twenty-two speakers from eight different MS provided an exhaustive overview of the technology. The workshop gave background information on the state of the art of different additive manufacturing technologies, on-going work at EU level, and provided an overview of related projects, their synergies and future activities. The needs of the air, maritime, energy industry for defence applications were presented, highlighting the capability gaps and the need for research & technology. In addition, presentations on specific technologies and steps in the value chain were included, such as: High strength steel by SLM, protection and highly dynamic behaviour, functional integration and weight reduction, novel materials and structural repairing, process modelling, qualification, certification, international standards development, metal powder processes, and the road to production. The information gathered during the workshop will help to identify the areas were further research is needed for the application of this technologies in the Defence sector. Furthermore, the synergies created during the event will create a network of experts on Additive Manufacturing within the EDA framework.

EDA_NEWS_0622	2014-12-19	NEWS	European multirole tanker transport fleet takes shape	 The Netherlands, Poland and Norway have decided to prepare negotiations with Airbus Defence & Space for the acquisition of a fleet of A330 MRTT multirole transport and air-to-air refuelling aircraft. The participating nations would welcome other nations to join the initiative either before an actual procurement or subsequently. This initiative, facilitated by the European Defence Agency, consists of the pooled acquisition and operation of a common fleet of aircraft by the three nations. Other nations will also be able to contribute to the overall programme through joining the acquisition phase and/or in-service phase. An initial operating capability is expected for 2019.  After market research supported by a targeted request for information, the three nations have identified that only one military off-the-shelf solution met their key requirements in terms of capabilities and timeframe. The nations therefore agreed to create a NATO Support Agency (NSPA) partnership which tasked the Organisation Conjointe de Coopération en matière d’ARmement (OCCAR) to prepare negotiations with Airbus Defence and Space for a possible acquisition of a fleet of A330 MRTT. This engagement in further negotiations does not constitute a commitment by EDA, NSPA, OCCAR or the Participating nations to place an order either as a result of this dialogue or at a subsequent stage. A single configuration has been selected for this common fleet of multirole tanker transport aircraft, which should all be equipped with a rigid boom as well as underwing pods, thus allowing to refuel a large variety of receivers. They will also meet the users’ requirements in terms of passenger transport, strategic airlift, and medical evacuation. By developing synergies with similar fleets, the nations will further contribute to a reduced fragmentation and increased interoperability of air-to-air refuelling aircraft in Europe. Background This decision is in accordance with the 22 March 2012 declaration of Defence Ministers to further develop European air-to-air refuelling capabilities, as well as with the letter of intent signed in November 2012 by ten nations. The December 2013 European Council also endorsed air-to-air refuelling as one of four key capability programmes to be developed by European Member States.

EDA_NEWS_0623	2015-01-09	NEWS	"""Go Green"": EDA brings solar energy to airbase in Cyprus"	 The European Defence Agency has signed a contract with a European energy consortium to install and operate a solar facility at Paphos Airbase, in Cyprus. It will provide clean energy to this military site for the next 20 years. With as many as 11,5 hours of sunlight per day during the summer, the island of Cyprus is a paradise for European tourists in need of their annual dose of sunshine. But, for the next 20 years, the energy of the sun will also be harnessed for an entirely different purpose: the National Guard airbase of Paphos will now be powered by a state-of-the-art solar facility, designed to generate peak power of about 5 MW for the next two decades. Industry consortium The European Defence Agency (EDA) finalised a contract with a European energy consortium composed of Gamma Solutions (Spain), Schneider Electric (France) and Hanwha Q Cells (Germany) in order to supply, install, operate and maintain this solar facility until 2034. “This initiative is part of “Go Green”, the first collaborative defence energy project to go live in Europe”, Tom Bennington, co-chair of the Project’s Management Group at EDA, stresses. “It marks the beginning of a journey that will see increased use of renewable energy by the military, with a long-term objective of reducing fossil fuels dependency by as much as 80% by 2050”. Four countries are currently involved in this project: Cyprus, Czech Republic, Greece and Luxembourg. This contract effectively brings to an end the pilot phase of an EDA “Category B” project launched in March 2012. The concept sought to capitalize on the spare capacity of defence estates, including land and buildings, for solar power generation. The basic concept was then brought to market through the Competitive Dialogue procurement model, which allowed various solutions to be tested and refined by MoD and industry experts working in close cooperation.  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/01/09/-go-green-eda-brings-solar-energy-to-airbase-in-cyprus

EDA_NEWS_0625	2014-12-18	NEWS	EDA marks 10th anniversary with special academic session	 Claude-France Arnould, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency, with former Chief Executive Nick Witney The European Defence Agency (EDA) and the European Security and Defence College (ESDC) held a special joint academic session yesterday at EDA premises to mark the Agency’s 10-year anniversary. The event gathered over 150 participants. “We decided to have an academic session because we wanted not only to celebrate, but also to debate about how we see the role EDA and the development of European defence capabilities in the future”, EDA Chief Executive Claude-France Arnould underlined in her opening remarks. This was echoed by Hans-Bernhard Weisserth, Head of ESDC: “Celebrating anniversaries is a great opportunity to look back, but we also need to think about the way ahead”, he stressed. Food for thought Moderated by Sven Biscop, Director of the Egmont Institute, two panel discussions were held. The first one was dedicated to the geopolitical and economic context of European defence cooperation. “The EDA was founded in an era of extraordinary optimism for EU cooperation”, recalled Nick Witney, Senior Fellow at the European Council for Foreign Relations and former EDA Chief Executive (2004-2007). “But now more than ever, in these times of budget austerity, we need to make the maximum use of the Common Security and Defence Policy”, he added.  “We need a collective approach to crisis management”, underlined Jamie Shea, NATO Deputy Assistant Secretary General for Emerging Security Challenges. “EDA and NATO can really work on synergies thank to the good cooperation we have in place”, he said. Meanwhile, Joylon Howorth from Yale University pointed out that Europe needs “a credible and autonomous military deterrent”  if it wants to fully play its role of regional power. Capability development The second session focused on capability development. Tim Rowntree, OCCAR Director, provided examples of tangible cooperation programs at EU-level and pointed out that the Organisation stood “ready to bring to support the collaborative programs of tomorrow”. Meanwhile, Claude-France Arnould made the case for increased cooperation through the European Defence Agency: “Cooperation through EDA is not a threat to sovereignty”, she stressed, “and the Agency has been specifically designed to allow cooperation from two Member States upwards”.  Brooks Tigner, Security Europe editor and EU/NATO Affairs Analyst for IHS Jane’s Defence Weekly, suggested that “the upcoming Preparatory Action for CSDP-related research could have a real effect in boosting EU defence capabilities”.  A unique book The event also gave Claude-France Arnould an opportunity to roll-out the special book published by the Agency to commemorate EDA’s 10-year anniversary. “This is the result of several months of archive research, interviews with key actors from inside and outside the Agency, as well as external contributions from various high-level European defence experts”, she underlined.  Titled “10 Years of Working Together”, the book is divided into three main sections covering the history of the Agency, its main success stories and independent viewpoints from key government, military and industry leaders.

EDA_NEWS_0630	2014-12-10	NEWS	EDA holds first C-27J pooled maintenance and training meeting	" The European Defence Agency recently held a meeting with European C-27J Spartan operators in order to identify potential solutions to support this user community. Representatives from the community of European C-27J users attended this meeting which was held last month at the European Defence Agency (EDA) premises in Brussels. Bulgaria, Italy, Romania as well as Greece and Lithuania currently operate the C-27J Spartan twin-engine tactical transport aircraft. “EDA is an ideal forum to harmonise requirements of the European C-27J community”, Pete Round, EDA Capability, Armament and Technology Director, stresses. “Together with Member States, we can identify ways to enhance the global C-27J capability through a variety of pooling & sharing initiatives”, he adds. ""It also fits perfectly in the EATF partnership signed in 2011 by 20 Member States."" Cooperation opportunities Over the course of the meeting, EDA put forward three main domains in which cooperation could yield significant benefits for the European C-27J user community: training, logistics and operations. Various ideas were put on the table, such as the pooling of C-27J simulators, the sharing of spare parts or the optimisation of the different mission kits currently used by Member States for their aircraft (fire-fighting, command and control, medical evacuation, etc.) Participants agreed to meet again early in 2015 to discuss the way forward and assess the potential for joining existing EDA Pooling & Sharing mechanisms, such as the “Sharing of Spare Parts” project. Meanwhile, EDA stands ready to facilitate the establishment of relevant ad hoc projects in accordance with the “à la carte“ mindset of the Agency. Synergies European C-27J users have already been involved in other EDA initiatives, such as the EATT (European Air Transport Training) series of exercises. Earlier this year, Lithuania and Bulgaria deployed C-27Js as part of EATT14, which was held in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. This EDA initiative aims to complement existing cooperative efforts such as the European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) partnership, the Spartan User Group, which also gathers non-European C-27J users, and the European Air Transport Command (EATC) which was recently joined by Italy who offered to “pool” some of its C-27Js through this operational command.    More information C-27J Pooled Maintenance and Training project page European Air Transport Fleet partnership EATT14: Final Results and Plans for 2015 "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/12/10/eda-holds-first-c-27j-pooled-maintenance-and-training-meeting

EDA_NEWS_0632	2014-11-20	NEWS	Second joint law enforcement and military course on homemade explosives finishes in Ireland	 Experts from 16 EU Member States have completed the second Homemade Explosives Training for EU experts at the Curragh Camp at the Irish Department of Defence Ordnance School. The course, run jointly by the European Defence Agency and Europol, was attended by 32 participants from across Europe.  The course focused on identifying, processing, and disposing of homemade explosives that can be found in improvised laboratories used by criminals or terrorists. It built on the experiences of the first course, which was held in June this year. The cooperation between EDA and Europol reflects the need for a combined civil-military approach to the threat not only of homemade explosives but the whole C-IED spectrum. This approach helps to ensure that there are clear lines of communication between the two and the need to share skills and experiences among military and civilian law enforcement agencies. As part of the course a distinguished visitors day was help on November 13. Participants from a total of 21 Member States have taken part in Home Made Explosives courses in 2014. The course allows students to share expertise and knowledge amongst students, and highlight the added value that a  Civil/Military approach can bring. Working with the United States The course also showed the increasingly close ties between EU and US actors in the field of explosives security and safety issues with participation and support from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), National Center For Explosives Training And Research (NCETR) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). EDA maintains a rounded approach to tackling Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). This includes work on Manual Neutralisation, disposing of devices manually when the situation is too dangerous or device too complicated to defuse with robots, with training courses being run in Austria. EDA is also working on exploitation of explosive devices, analysing the events and materials from an IED attack, to help reveal and target the makers of the explosives. In order to support this work a Joint Deployable Exploitation Analysis Laboratory, known as JDEAL, has been set up in the Netherlands.

EDA_NEWS_0634	2014-11-27	NEWS	Debating dual-use technologies and smart clustering at EU level	 More than 120 attendees gathered on 25 November in Brussels to exchange views and offer ways forward on an important issue for the European defence industry: dual-use and smart clustering. The workshop was organised jointly by the European Commission, the European Defence Agency (EDA) and the European association of development agencies (EURADA). The event was divided into three successive panels, the first one focusing on the European Union’s existing policies and tools to support dual-use research and clustering. “The EU is working to support clusters as a good breeding ground for innovative small & medium-sized enterprises”, a Commission representative pointed out. “This is all the more important as 38% of European jobs are based in clusters”, he added. Actions and tools Presentations were given on the COSME, Horizon 2020 programme, European Structural and Investment Funds as well as EDA actions and tools in support of defence-related SMEs, clusters and the defence supply chain. An EDA official underlined that “those SMEs and clusters that participate in defence markets are typically involved in dual-use activities and the increasing convergence of defence and security creates even greater emphasis on dual-use”. A second panel offered stakeholders from defence-related clusters an opportunity to share their experiences and the associated challenges. Clusters from Estonia, France, Poland and Portugal were represented. They emphasised the need for greater cooperation at EU level in order to develop their dual-use activities. “Dual-use is in our DNA”, stated Jean-Luc Logel, president of the French EDEN cluster. Opportunities After a networking session held over lunch, a third and final panel focused on ways to develop dual-use opportunities at European level and saw interventions from the ECSEL Joint Undertaking, the European Commission and EDA. Reinhard Marak, from the Austrian National Defence Industry Association, provided industrial views on the subject: “We have to identify new funding schemes to alleviate the decline in defence spending and investment, but dual-use is no cure for all: if you want to access those funds you first need national buy-in”, he stressed. In their concluding remarks, Tarja Jaakkola (EDA) and Sylvia Kainz-Huber (European Commission) underlined that this event provided a good opportunity for European policy-makers and representatives of the defence-related clusters and industry to exchange views on current and on-coming policies and tools with impact on clusters and dual-use activities. They encouraged participants to take advantage of such tools and stressed the need for more cooperation and networking between defence-related actors at European level.     Participants then had the opportunity to engage with other attendees during a networking session of pre-arranged one-on-one meetings. About 60 of those pre-arranged meetings were held and most of the attendees expressed a wish to see more similar opportunities in the future.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/11/27/debating-dual-use-technologies-and-smart-clustering-at-eu-level
EDA_NEWS_0635	2014-11-25	NEWS	First EDA-Commission workshop on the preparatory action for CSDP-related research	 Almost 100 representatives from Member States, the European Commission and the European Defence Agency (EDA) gathered on 21 November at the Agency premises. As tasked by the December 2013 European Council, they initiated a debate on research related to the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and the Preparatory Action in this field, which is expected to be launched in 2017. Philippe Brunet is the Director of Aerospace, Maritime, Security and Defence Industries within the European Commission’s Directorate General Enterprise and Industry. This workshop allowed Member States to discuss the overall objective and scope of this future programme. It was co-organised by the Commission, responsible and financially accountable for the launch of the Preparatory Action, and EDA,  bringing its skills and experience in setting up and implementing defence research. “We need to prove that we are able to launch research on a new subject, to build procedures together and to set a common goal”, Philippe Brunet, Director of Aerospace, Maritime, Security and Defence Industries within the European Commission’s Directorate General Enterprise and Industry, explained.  A first step On 1 May 2014, Brigadier General (Engineer) Denis Roger was appointed as Director, European Synergies  and Innovation (ESI) of the European Defence Agency.   “Why is it so important to get the Preparatory Action right? Because it is the first step towards a much bigger challenge: the setting-up of a CSDP-related research programme at EU- level” stressed Denis Roger, EDA European Synergies and Innovation director. “What is at stake is the development of a European technological and industrial base with a critical mass on areas we consider important for the development of CSDP-related capabilities”, he added.  The meeting offered an insight into the lessons learned from an end-user perspective. Commander Ben Falk, in charge of strategic analysis at the EU Military Staff, reminded the audience of the important links that should be maintained between the operational lessons learned at EU-level, the Capability Development Plan – recent update of which was presented by Axel Butenschoen from EDA – and future research initiatives.   Consensus emerged on the fact that, in order to bring something new, this preparatory action needs to be defence-oriented and to focus on CSDP capabilities, while promoting innovation and European defence industry competitiveness.  Bringing added value Bryan Wells, from the UK Ministry of Defence, discussed the need to complement national research programmes and to bring a European added-value, while Carmen Rodriguez Augustin, from Spain, underlined that “interests of governments and industry have to be respected and properly covered because the defence sector needs specific rules and provisions”.  During a keynote intervention, Jan-Olof Lind, chairman of EDA’s research & technology Steering Board, underlined the added value of a programme benefitting from a centralised budget, while insisting on the great innovation potential of a CSDP-focussed initiative. After a full day of thorough debate on this topic of critical importance for the future of European defence, participants agreed to meet again in February for a new round  of discussions.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/11/25/first-eda-commission-workshop-on-the-preparatory-action-for-csdp-related-research
EDA_NEWS_0636	2014-11-19	NEWS	EUROCONTROL and European Defence Agency agree joint work programme	 EUROCONTROL and the European Defence Agency (EDA) have taken an important step to strengthen their cooperation by signing a joint work programme covering the coming two years. The work programme puts in place a close cooperation between the two organisations in the domain of the Single European Sky ATM research programme (SESAR). It provides a more detailed view on the contributions from both organisations and outcomes to be achieved within this framework with a first key step being to ensure that military views are fully taken into account in related work on SESAR development.

EDA_NEWS_0638	2014-11-19	NEWS	EDA outlines key priorities of the revised Capability Development Plan	 The European Defence Agency has just published a brochure outlining the main features of the revised Capability Development Plan (CDP) endorsed by Member States earlier this year. It reflects current defence and security trends and proposes a list of priority actions. Since 2008, the European Defence Agency (EDA) has been producing a Capability Development Plan (CDP) to address long-term security and defence challenges. It looks at future security scenarios and makes recommendations about the capabilities European militaries will need to react to a variety of potential developments.   The CDP is a comprehensive planning method providing a picture of European military capabilities over time. It can be used by Member States’ defence planners when identifying priorities and opportunities for cooperation. The European Defence Agency is coordinating this work done in close conjunction with Member States and other stakeholders such as the EU Military Committee. The CDP benefits from several inputs such as the Headline Goal Process, studies on long-term trends, lessons from operations and information on current plans and programs.

EDA_NEWS_0639	2014-11-18	NEWS	Defence Ministers assess EDA progress during the Agency's Steering Board	 The Steering Board of 18 November was chaired for the first time by Federica Mogherini, the new Head of the European Defence Agency. It was an important opportunity for Defence Ministers to assess the progress achieved since December 2013. It was also an ideal forum for the new High Representative and Vice-President of the European Commission to discuss cooperation on military capabilities with European ministers and to prepare for the June 2015 European Council. Progress on the four key programmes Four projects have been endorsed by the 2013 European Council: Air-to-Air Refuelling (AAR), Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), Governmental Satellite Communications (GovSatcom) and Cyber Defence. In line with their respective roadmaps, the progress made in each of these four key capability areas has been welcomed by Defence Ministers during the Steering Board: Air-to-Air Refuelling: under the lead of the Netherlands, work is progressing towards the establishment of a European strategic tanker capability by 2020. A contract for new air-to-air refuelling aircraft is expected to be placed by the end of 2015. RPAS: EDA supports the development of a European Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) RPAS through a number of projects focusing on certification, air traffic insertion, airworthiness and harmonisation of flight crew training. The Agency is facilitating efforts to develop a new MALE RPAS capability for the next decade by supporting Member States willing to join such an initiative. EDA is also backing a “European MALE RPAS community” for systems that are already in service. GovSatcom: the requirements of European military users (Common Staff Target) for the next generation of Governmental Satellite Communications have been formally endorsed by Member States. This paves the way to the preparation phase of a future cooperative programme, to be completed by the end of 2016 under Spanish lead. Cyber Defence: in line with the EU Cyber Security Strategy, EDA is working on specific projects to increase its Member States’ capabilities in this domain. The Agency has already supported the operational headquarters of Operation EUFOR RCA by providing cyber awareness training. Work is underway to develop deployable “Cyber Defence situational awareness kits” by 2015. Incentives for cooperation As tasked by the European Council, the Agency has developed proposals to incentivise cooperation, mainly through non-market distorting fiscal measures and pooled procurement. During the Steering Board, Defence ministers welcomed this progress as a basis for further work. Fiscal measures: in March 2014, the Belgian Ministry of Finance granted VAT exemption to EDA’s ad hoc projects and activities. Three projects have already benefitted from that exemption: JDEAL, C-IED Manual Neutralisation Techniques and EU Satcom Market. This VAT exemption gives a real bonus to defence cooperation among Member States. Pooled procurement: Proposals were discussed for the establishment of a pooled procurement mechanism to facilitate cooperative acquisition and support of defence equipment, while improving interoperability. This mechanism, whose creation still requires deeper discussion among Member States, would address priorities defined by them. Strategic outlook As requested by the December 2013 European Council, Defence Ministers have adopted a Policy Framework to foster more systematic and long-term defence cooperation. This document aims to provide a coherent basis for defence cooperation in Europe, from priority setting through to in-service support, disposal and decommissioning. It offers tangible support to national defence reviews and provides a platform for greater convergence in defence planning. Complementing this Policy Framework, the revised Capability Development Plan (CDP) endorsed by Member States earlier this year will be an essential element for the setting of cooperative capability development priorities. It provides a list of priority actions based on lessons learned from European operations, future security scenarios and long-term trends. It addresses the Member States’ priorities for their armed forces and, as such, will form the basis of future European collaborative programmes.

EDA_NEWS_0640	2014-11-04	NEWS	New facility to help in fight against IEDs opens in the Netherlands	" A new facility designed to help in the fight against Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) was officially opened today in the Netherlands. The Joint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory (JDEAL) provides a permanent technical exploitation training capability in the Dutch town of Soesterberg. Under the project a further two deployable laboratories could be procured for use in future operations. JDEAL, which was facilitated by the European Defence Agency (EDA) and lead nation the Netherlands, focuses on training the full range of skills needed for technical exploitation. This involves the recording and analysing of information related to events, scenes, technical components, and material used in IED attacks. The project makes use of equipment and knowledge gained from the EDA developed Counter-IED Technical Exploitation Laboratory previously deployed with ISAF in Kabul. Alongside the Netherlands, ten other EDA Member States – Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden – plus Norway have joined the project. Denmark, the United Kingdom, the United States and the NATO Counter-IED Centre of Excellence have also sent observers. Warrant Officer Bert Westers, from the Dutch armed forces, was previously stationed at the laboratory in Afghanistan and will now act as a trainer at JDEAL. He commented: “This new facility allows us to maintain and build on the skills and experiences that we gained in Kabul. It also helps to improve our forces’ ability to deal with threats from IEDs in the future.” Education, research, and deployable capabilities The training facility will host both national and multina­tional training events, tailored to the needs of the Member States involved. Alongside the training aspect, JDEAL is intended to be a platform for research and development and is specifically designed for subprojects to be launched under its framework. It will also work closely with other actors and cooperative bodies working in the counter-IED field. In a second step the establish­ment of two deployable laboratories is planned, in order to have at least one available for upcoming operations/missions by the second half of 2015. Background The JDEAL project will work across the entire scope of IED exploitation. This includes detailed visual examination and high quality image capture; technical exploitation report­ing; biometric analysis (latent finger print recovery); elec­trical circuitry (primarily radio parts); document and me­dia recovery (focused on the mobile phones often used as IED triggering devices); chemical analysis; mechanical exploitation as well as other material exploitation. This is done in close cooperation with intelligence services, which can use the results to attack the networks involved in manufacturing the IEDs. The JDEAL project was born out of the EDA developed mul­tinational counter-IED Exploitation Laboratory (MNTEL), which was deployed in Kabul under French management. During the laboratory’s three year deployment in Af­ghanistan more than 6 000 IEDs were forensically ex­amined, providing invaluable support to law enforce­ment and leading to numerous terrorist prosecutions.

EDA_NEWS_0642	2014-10-28	NEWS	New European Maritime Mine Counter Measures project launched	 Five Member States as well as Norway signed a new project arrangement earlier this month to start work on future Maritime Mine Counter Measures (MMCM) capabilities. Called MMCM-NG (New Generation), the project will run until 2017 and prepare the next generation of mine countermeasures ships.  Belgium, Estonia, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden as well as Norway agreed on 8 October 2014 to launch a new research project regarding future Maritime Mine Counter Measures (MMCM) capabilities. Dubbed MMCM-NG (New Generation), the project arrangement was signed at the European Defence Agency’s premises during a Steering Board of the Capabilities Directors. Germany is the project’s lead nation.  Easy to deploy and cheap to acquire, maritime mines and other underwater improvised explosive devices pose a real threat to naval forces and civilian ships by restricting freedom of movement in shallow waters, harbours and strategic choke points. Being able to detect, avoid, and defuse these weapons is therefore a key requirement for European navies. Preparing the next generation The MMCM-NG project has a planned duration of 36 months during which contributing Member States, based on an agreed operational concept, will work on a set of common requirements to prepare the future generation of mine countermeasures ships and systems that could become operational in the 2030 timeframe. At the end of this 3-year project, Member States will have gathered enough information to decide on the potential launch of a procurement phase for these new systems. Compared to existing solutions, future MMCM capabilities are expected to bring increased flexibility through a modular “toolbox” comprising a range of systems adaptable to different platforms, environmental, or operational conditions. The use of unmanned vehicles will also be developed and new detection techniques could be introduced. Future MMCM operations are also expected to be conducted with state-of-the-art sensors and effectors carried and deployed from dedicated or hybrid platforms as well as from stationary or mobile shore installations. Based on the different national requirements, several technical solutions will be assessed as part of the project. Standards, protocols and interfaces will be described and agreed upon commonly in order to ensure future interoperability and to enable synergies in the fields of training, logistics, and maintenance. Background The European Defence Agency conducts several activities in the maritime domain. One of the Agency’s largest programmes, called UMS (Unmanned Maritime Systems), brings together all EDA Member States under a single programme arrangement and 15 different coordinated projects that can be joined by any number of countries. EDA is also involved in the Marsur (Maritime Surveillance) project, which has been joined by 17 Member States as well as Norway to date. It has led to the development of a technical solution that connects European navies’ surveillance systems to improve global maritime awareness and enhance interoperability.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/10/28/new-european-maritime-mine-counter-measures-project-launched

EDA_NEWS_0644	2014-10-28	NEWS	EDA organises joint course with European Security and Defence College	 A three-day European Armaments Cooperation Course started today at the European Defence Agency (EDA) in Brussels. More than 40 participants from sixteen EDA Member States and Serbia, as well as the European Commission, the European Parliament, the EU Military Staff (EUMS) and the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR), started a three-day European Armaments Cooperation Course. This course, the third of its kind, is organised jointly by EDA and the European Security and Defence College (ESDC). It is divided into two parts: the Awareness Level, now ongoing in Brussels, and the Expert Level, which will take place from 24 to 28 November in Prague, Czech Republic. The course is intended primarily for practitioners working in national and international armament cooperation who need to gain knowledge and experience in European acquisition and project management. It aims to provide them with a better understanding of frameworks, stakeholders, tools, and processes of European armaments cooperation, as well as its many benefits and challenges. Learning from each other As the EDA Deputy Chief Executive, Rini Goos, said today: “We, in Europe, need to be clear on how we work together, learning from each other and tackling co-operation from a European perspective. This is essential and in the long-term I would like to see a common understanding and approach emerge, supported where required through training and education courses like this one. This is where I see the EDA adding the most value and impact; improving the delivery of future European military capabilities to make the Common Security and Defence Policy more credible in line with the 2013 European Council conclusions.” EDA's work in this domain started in 2006 when the Agency commissioned a study on cooperative lessons learned. Best practice and education were shortlisted among key enablers for cooperative programmes. The topic received widespread support from Member States and in 2007 the EDA Steering Board, in National Armaments Directors configuration, directed the Agency to focus in particular on education in European armaments acquisitions. Education and training platform In 2009, the Czech Republic’s EU Presidency supported the creation of a new European armaments cooperation course; providing an EU-wide education and/or training platform where a common understanding of a European approach to armaments cooperation can be promoted and nurtured. EDA Member States welcomed the initiative and later that year the EDA Steering Board, in National Armaments Directors configuration, approved the top-level European Armaments Co-operation (EAC) Framework, under which the current course has been established. In 2013, thanks to the initiative of Austria and other like-minded countries, including the Czech Republic, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, the course took its current form. It followed the success of the pilot European Armaments Cooperation Course organised in Brussels and Stadtschlaining in 2012. A real and urgent need Giampaolo Lillo, EDA Cooperation Planning and Support Director, said: “The technical, legal and administrative complexities of cooperation programmes – and the lack of expertise on how to tackle them – appear to be part of the reason why the potential of European armament cooperation remains largely untapped. This is why I think this course aims at the right target, responding to a real and urgent need. Apart from the obvious interest to practitioners, it is also very useful for anybody involved in the legislative process at EU level.” EDA, in its effort to offer Member States the most effective and tailored support to enhance their interoperability, upon its restructuring created in the Cooperation Planning and Support Directorate a dedicated Education, Training and Exercises Unit to address education and training activities in an harmonised way. This course is one of its outcomes.

EDA_NEWS_0645	2014-10-27	NEWS	European maritime surveillance network reaches operational status	 Developed under the auspices of the European Defence Agency since 2006, the Maritime Surveillance (Marsur) project has now reached an operational level of maturity. A demonstration will be conducted during the Euronaval defence exhibition taking place 27-31 October in Le Bourget, north of Paris. One of the longest-running projects undertaken by the European Defence Agency (EDA), Marsur is a technical solution that allows dialog between European maritime information systems. Containing 17 Member States plus Norway, the project aims to improve the common “recognised maritime picture” by facilitating exchange of operational maritime information and services such as ship positions, tracks, identification data, chat or images. The Marsur network The interface is installed in each participating Navy’s operational headquarters. A key characteristic of the Marsur network is that there is no central EU component that collects and distributes information. Each Member State is responsible for correlating its own data with the data received from other countries and for boosting the services within the community. Reflecting on this important milestone, Claude-France Arnould, EDA Chief Executive, said: “Marsur is a great example of efficient Pooling & Sharing of existing capabilities. The project has now reached the point where it is ready to be used by European navies”. Marsur is designed to become the potential “military layer” of the wider Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE) project led by the European Commission. Marsur could work in conjunction with other “systems of systems” to ensure efficient interaction with other European maritime security stakeholders and also in support of CSDP missions.  During Euronaval, an event will be held on 28 October at 1430 (Paris time) to mark the beginning of Marsur’s operational phase and the symbolic handover of the system. The Marsur demonstration will be available throughout the show at the CSC booth (B46). Background The Marsur project was formally launched in September 2006 by 15 Member States. It was first tested in June 2011 when six countries successfully conducted an initial networking demonstration in Brussels. Seventeen Member States (as well as Norway) are now involved in the Marsur initiative: Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Germany, Spain, Greece, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.   More information Further step taken in Marsur network development EDA Marsur networking project page Official Marsur website 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/10/27/european-maritime-surveillance-network-reaches-operational-status
EDA_NEWS_0646	2014-10-21	NEWS	Views from the ground: five questions to Lt Col Alison Farmer EUTM Mali Medical Planner	 Lt Col Alison Farmer was one of 75+ people attending a symposium in Brussels organised by the European Defence Agency (EDA) and EU Military Staff (EUMS) to discuss medical support for EU operations. Lt Col Farmer is the medical planner for the EU Military Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali).  She has been a nurse within the British Army for almost 30 years, being deployed to Afghanistan, the Balkans, and a range of other countries. Alison, what does EUTM Mali do and what is your role within it? Lt Col Farmer is the medical planner for the EU Military Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali). The aim of EUTM Mali is to contribute to the training and advice of the Malian Armed Forces (MaAF). The Mission began in February 2013, following the request of the Malian authorities (and UNSCR 2071), to help Malian troops overcome the insurgency in northern Mali.  More than 23 EU Member States have contributed military personnel to the mission to date. As the Joint Medical Planner for the Mission, I am responsible for all aspects of medical support and advice in the Mission Area. Within my team of 3, we conduct planning to ensure all our medical assets (medical treatment facilities including Ground and Air MEDEVAC), can deliver continuous 24 hour care for EUTM MALI personnel. We also undertake health surveillance of our Population at Risk and health threats from the local environment. What challenges do you face in Mali? What do you need to take into account when formulating medical plans? The main one is that of logistics; the training of the MaAF takes place at different locations in southern Mali – so we implement a medical plan to mitigate against any possible incident at the sites. Our plan has to be robust to make sure we can medically evacuate a seriously injured casualty from the point of incident to our Role 2 within the 10-1-2 medical planning guidelines. This can be challenging considering the distances that we need to cover, and the infrastructure within Mali. We test all our plans through recces and by monthly medical exercises before the plans are agreed by the Mission Commander. How does your team work? Do you work in separate national teams within the mission? No, my team is multinational, and medical planning is conducted for the whole of the mission, not for a single nation; so for all French, German, Belgian, Spanish etc.; whichever Member State personnel are part of EUTM MALI. What are the advantages and challenges of this multinational environment? It’s a great opportunity to share our knowledge and experience with each other.  I see it as overwhelmingly positive; we all have different backgrounds and skills. We may have different approaches to the challenges we face, but our common goal in making the mission a success, gels our methods. Much of that is about information sharing and finding the best way to manage situations. Lastly why are you here at the EU medical symposium? And have you found it a useful experience? The EUMS medical advisor told me about the symposium. The event and the programme drew my attention, as the topics were broad and varied.  It’s also a great way of meeting those at strategic level and fellow planners from other missions to have a broader understanding of what else is going on. I’ve really enjoyed the two days and have learnt a lot.  I have spoken to lots of people during the symposium which has opened up new information exchange areas. I’m looking forward to bring the information back and sharing it with my colleagues in EUTM MALI.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/10/21/views-from-the-ground-five-questions-to-lt-col-alison-farmer-eutm-mali-medical-planner
EDA_NEWS_0647	2014-10-17	NEWS	EDA supports EU operation with new software	 The European Defence Agency (EDA) has provided a new form of HR management software to the EU operation in Central African Republic (EUFOR RCA). The system, known as the Human Resource Management Functional Area System Demonstrator (J1-FAS), was deployed to the mission’s headquarters in Larissa, Greece on 6 October 2014. EDA developed the system and also provided assistance with installation, training, and transfer of personnel data into the system’s data base. The tool, available free of charge, collects all information needed within an HQ, including data that can be used in a Personnel Recovery situation. Speaking about the event, Commander Paschalis Gkounidis, the HQ Assistant Chief of Staff for Human Resources said “the installation of this new system represents a big step forward in managing our personnel and will provide useful lessons for the improvement of the system in the future.” The software will significantly accelerate the whole process of activating an EU HQ with augmented personnel including personnel rotations. This is the first time that this new capability has been used in an operation, following testing during exercises “European Endeavour 2012” and “Multi-Layer 12”. The EDA Officer in charge of the project, Udo Lang, commented “this is just one example of how we are supporting EU missions and operations, it is a real success story and hopefully we can build on this collaboration in the future.” More information EDA provides cyber defence support to operation EUFOR RCA 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/10/17/eda-supports-eu-operation-with-new-software

EDA_NEWS_0649	2014-10-16	NEWS	Symposium on medical support to EU Operations held in Brussels	 A symposium, organised jointly by the European Defence Agency (EDA) and the European Union Military Staff (EUMS),  has taken place in Brussels to discuss medical support for EU operations. “We are here because of our soldiers,” started EDA Capability Director Peter Round’s opening remarks to the symposium. Ensuring that soldiers have access to adequate medical facilities is a prerequisite for any military operation. However, delivering this requires the involvement of a wide range of actors – from those involved in developing new military medical capabilities through to the doctors and nurses implementing the medical plans on the ground. This was the purpose behind the symposium – bringing together this diverse group involved in medical support to EU operations, create synergies, and find new and better ways to support European soldiers. Providing more effective support for European troops The conference brings together 75 experts from the EU institutions, Member States, industry, and EU missions. It began with high-level figures from EDA, EUMS, and the European External Action Service (EEAS) outlining their respective roles in medical support with each stressing the importance of close coordination, to avoid duplication and to ensure the best possible medical support was developed.   Providing a view from the ground,  Alison Farmer, Joint-Medical Planner for the EU Training Mission (EUTM) in Mali, reiterated the importance of medical support . “The morale of the soldiers is of key importance to us - making sure we have the medical capabilities we need in the right place, at the right time, gives our soldiers the confidence to get on and do their jobs effectively.” She went on to explain how the operational planning for medical support works in practice and what challenges and difficulties they faced in the field.  The conference will run until 16 October and will include panel debates,  open discussions, and informal networking opportunities. EDA and Medical Support Initiated by EDA in 2011 and led by Italy, the Multinational Modular Medical Units project aims to develop a state-of-the-art deployable field hospital that should become available to CSDP operations. It is designed to be used in a wide a range of missions, from peacekeeping to humanitarian relief and coercive operations. So far 16 Member States have joined the project.

EDA_NEWS_0650	2014-10-13	NEWS	Put your questions to EDA Capability Director Peter Round	 European Defence Agency (EDA) Capability Director Peter Round will be taking part in an online debate on the future of defence capabilities as part of  Security Jam 2014. Do you want to know more about EDA projects? Do you have ideas about how we should develop new defence capabilities in Europe? How can we ensure Europe has the capabilities it needs to match its ambitions on the global stage? Peter Round, Director Capability, Armament & Technology, will be online to answer all your questions regarding European defence capabilities tomorrow, 14 October at 15.00 CET. The debate takes place as part of Security Jam 2014, a week-long online conference on European security and defence, that brings together high level figures from EDA, NATO, national militaries, and academia. Air Commodore Peter Round is highly experienced officer, originally joining the RAF in 1979. After qualifying as a pilot, he flew Buccaneers in the maritime strike attack role, before holding a series of high-level international roles. He was appointed Director at EDA in July 2012. EDA Capability development EDA works across a wide range of different areas within capability development.

EDA_NEWS_0651	2014-10-02	NEWS	First aircrews graduate from European training course	" After almost two weeks of intensive training, six crews coming from five different Member States have graduated from the first-ever edition of the European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course (EAATTC) which took place in Spain from 21 September to 3 October. In total, 29 students from Spain, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands completed the course. Over the course of the exercise, 56 sorties were flown accounting for about 100 flight hours, 31 drops were conducted as well as 92 tactical approaches and 15 landing on unprepared airstrips. A combination of academic lessons and actual flights, this first edition of EAATTC was hosted by the Spanish air force on Zaragoza airbase. “Spain provided great support to the event”, Michele Rega, EDA Project Officer Fixed-Wing Aircraft and EAATTC14 exercise director, points out. “We were able to deliver high-level training to our first class of crews and this successful first edition paves the way towards future EAATTC events”, he adds. Three  additional courses, including single-ship, multiple-ship, and night vision goggles (NVG) training, are expected to take place in 2015 in Bulgaria, France, and Spain.  Designed at the request of Member States to provide European air transport crews with an advanced academic and flying training syllabus, EAATTC was initiated by the European Defence Agency in close cooperation with the European Air Transport Command (EATC), which brought major support to the course in terms of human resources and expertise.  The course is intended to become a European alternative to the American AATTC initiative, a rendezvous that has been attended for decades by airlift crews from the US and allied nations. However, European Member States are now seeking different ways to provide their crews with this much-needed training. EAATTC is the perfect answer to that ever-growing challenge, with European air forces now able to benefit from a high-level training closer to their home bases, thus saving the cost of a return trip across the Atlantic.  Background EAATTC is one of the tangible outputs of the wider European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) partnership launched in 2011 and now gathering 19 Member States plus Norway (AT, BE, BG, CZ, DE, EL, ES, FI, FR, IT, LT, LU, NL, PL, PT, RO, SK, SE and HU). A perfect example of pooling resources and sharing knowledge and expertise, this initiative aims to achieve a higher level of interoperability between airlift crews from different nations and to increase harmonisation of advanced tactical training. Other activities undertaken as part of EATF include the European Air Transport Training (EATT) series of events as well as the European Air Transport Symposium, both organised once a year by the European Defence Agency; the further development and management of the diplomatic clearances technical arrangement; and the development of a common maintenance and training project for operators of the C-27J Spartan transport aircraft.

EDA_NEWS_0652	2014-10-01	NEWS	Germany joins the EU Satcom Market	 Germany has become the tenth member of the EU Satcom Market.  It joins Belgium, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, Luxemburg, Poland, Romania, and the United Kingdom, in the European Defence Agency (EDA) led project designed to provide flexible commercial satellite communication (Comsatcom) solutions. Germany has its own satellites and has good coverage with Comsatcom. However, the EU Satcom Market adds a flexible option on top of this portfolio. It offers a ‘pay per use’ model, so Member States do not have to pay a regular fee and instead only pay for the services that they use. As Germany offers an Operational Headquarters to EU Operations, it could draw on this option to cover multinational requirements. Giampaolo Lillo, EDA Director for Cooperation Planning and Support said: “It is a big step to see Germany join the EU Satcom Market. This is another sign that the pooling and sharing initiatives offered by EDA are of real value for participating Member States. The more countries we have on board, the better prices the EU Satcom Market will be able to offer.” EU Satcom Market In the EU Satcom Market, EDA acts as the central purchasing body on behalf of the Contributing Members. It purchases bandwidth from a commercial Satcom provider (Airbus Defence & Space holds the current contract until 2015). Since May 2013, a total of 18 orders have been placed for a total value of around two million Euros. EDA is working on enlarging the services offered through the project, as well as attracting additional Members to increase the pooling effect.

EDA_NEWS_0655	2014-09-23	NEWS	"EAATTC14 interview: ""A robust training syllabus to enhance interoperability"""	 The first-ever edition of the European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course (EAATTC) has started on 21 September in Zaragoza, Spain. Michele Rega, EDA Project Officer Fixed-Wing Aircraft and EAATTC14 exercise director, discusses the objectives and the program of the event. What is the scope of EAATTC14, and what are its main expected outcomes? Considering the success of previous European Air Transport Training (EATT) events delivered since 2012 under the auspices of EDA, Member States from the European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) partnership decided that besides offering combined training on a recurrent basis, a tactics course should also be established in Europe. The main objective of EAATTC is therefore to provide a robust airlift tactics training syllabus to enhance interoperability between aircrews. We take qualified crews into a theatre deployment mindset and we make them fly airland and airdrop missions in a tactically-challenging environment, including surface-to-air and air-to-air threats. What will be the program of the coming days? The first week of EAATTC is a combination of academic lessons and flights, in accordance with the agreed syllabus. Twelve hours of classroom time are planned: these academics will rely upon the EAATT Tactics Techniques and Procedures (ETTP) and will be delivered by a cadre of instructors provided by the European Air Transport Command (EATC). Nine flights will also take place as part of the course, for a total of 18 hours. The flight schedule will be based on single-ship missions, with all but one sortie being flown in a single wave. Crew training will of course include the mission planning phase as well. And at the end of the course on 2 October, a certificate will be delivered to the graduating students. What are the synergies with other European efforts in the air transport domain? Michele Rega is EDA Project Officer Fixed-Wing Aircraft and EAATTC14 exercise director  First, I think it is worth keeping in mind that all the Agency’s activities in the field of air transport are initiated out of the EATF partnership, signed in 2011 by 19 EU Member States as well as Norway. The EATC in Eindhoven is also a major partner and provides outstanding support to the planning and execution of those activities. As far as EAATTC is concerned, we are currently working on the establishment of a permanent European advanced airlift training centre whose location should be decided by the end of 2014. Originally, it was envisioned that the EAATTC would replace the EATT events, but Member States expressed an interest in keeping both in order to keep practicing national training objectives. This is why in 2015, we will see one EATT and three EAATTC events taking place around Europe. Topics of interest to the air transport community are also discussed thoroughly during the European Air Transport Symposium (EATS) organised each year by EDA. Background EAATTC is one of the tangible outputs of the wider European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) partnership, launched in 2011 and now gathering 19 Member States plus NO (AT, BE, BG, CZ, DE, EL, ES, FI, FR, IT, LT, LU, NL, PL, PT, RO, SK, SE and HU). The initiative aims to achieve a higher level of interoperability between airlift crews from different nations and to increase harmonisation of advanced tactical training. Other activities undertaken as part of EATF include the European Air Transport Training (EATT) series of events as well as the European Air Transport Symposium, both organised once a year by the European Defence Agency; the further development and management of the diplomatic clearances technical arrangement; and the development of a common maintenance and training project for operators of the C-27J Spartan transport aircraft.

EDA_NEWS_0656	2014-09-15	NEWS	EDA project shows how metamaterials can boost the performance of antennas	 The MIMICRA (Metamaterial Inspired Microwave Conformal Radar Antenna) project, which came to an end last month, shows how new materials and design techniques can improve the performance of antennas. Metamaterials are artificially engineered materials that have been altered to exhibit properties not found in nature. Research and development of metamaterials is a rapidly growing field, which could eventually result in a huge range of new applications for both the civilian and military domains. An important area of research is concerned with new antennas for applications, such as communications, EW (Electronic Warfare), or even multifunctional sensing. This purpose behind the MIMCRA project was to show how antennas developed using metamerials can provide significantly higher levels of performance than conventionally developed antennas. The project perfomed a study which established a robust set of requirements for three different types of antennas. These requirements outlined the limitations of current antennas and considered possible applications of new materials and designs, focusing particularly on benefits for aeronautical platforms. Building on this study, demonstrator structures were developed (see picture above) that pushed the boundaries of material design and illustrated how using metamaterials could produce antennas with performance levels significantly greater than those using conventionial design methods and materials.   The research performed highlighted the enhancements that these new approaches can bring, however more work is needed before these technologies can produce commercially viable solutions. The project was managed and funded by France and the UK, within the framework of the European Defence Agency. The work was carried out by a wide consortium of different companies and universities: Airbus, Dassault Aviation, Thales, Telecom ParisTech, Institut d’Électronique Fondamentale, BAE Systems, MBDA (UK), Queen Mary College London, and Oxford University.

EDA_NEWS_0657	2014-09-17	NEWS	New EDA-designed air transport training course to launch next week	 Eight aircraft, eight crews and more than 170 military personnel will gather next week in Zaragoza, Spain, for a true European first. From 21 September to 3 October, the European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course (EAATTC) will be joined by seven Member States and hosted by the Spanish Air Force. Initiated by the European Defence Agency in close cooperation with the European Air Transport Command (EATC), this first-of-its-kind initiative is a perfect example of pooling and sharing. Its aim is to provide air transport crews with academic as well as flying training tactics and procedures through three main courses: single-ship, multiple-ships, and night-vision goggles (NVG). A dedicated tactics techniques and procedures manual will form the basis of this syllabus. The EATC is an important contributor to the EAATTC initiative, providing major support to the course in terms of human resources while also leading the cadre of instructors that will deliver the syllabus to the students. This course was designed by the EDA as a European alternative to the American AATTC initiative, a rendezvous that has been attended for decades by airlift crews from the US and allied nations. However, European Member States are now seeking different ways to provide their crews with this much-needed training. EAATTC is the perfect answer to that rising challenge, with European air forces now able to benefit from a high-level training closer to their home bases, thus saving the cost of a return trip across the Atlantic. At the end of EAATTC 14, an initial class of students will be the very first to graduate from this European-led course. Background EAATTC is one of the tangible outputs of the wider European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) partnership, launched in 2011 and now gathering 19 Member States plus NO (AT, BE, BG, CZ, DE, EL, ES, FI, FR, IT, LT, LU, NL, PL, PT, RO, SK, SE and HU).

EDA_NEWS_0658	2014-09-16	NEWS	Counter-IED experts complete “European Guardian” exercise in Vienna	 A two-week European exercise focused on manual neutralisation of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) has finished in Vienna. From 1 to 12 September 2014, fourteen Counter-IED experts from Austria, Germany, Italy, Ireland, and Sweden took part in an intensive Manual Neutralisation Exercise at the Austrian Army’s Logistics School in Vienna. The exercise was organised by Austria as lead nation in close cooperation with the European Defence Agency (EDA). Manual neutralisation refers to situations where a trained operator has to manually defuse an improvised explosive device. This occurs when it is not possible to tackle the device remotely, for example when the device is attached to a hostage or with chemical or even radiological material. It is one of the most mentally and technically challenging jobs performed by anyone in the armed forces, requiring high-level skills and training. The aim of the exercise was to give participants the chance to use and develop  these skills in a highly demanding, multinational environment. Over the two-week period, they were given a series of different and increasingly complex scenarios and devices to deal with. One operator from Ireland, who participated in the exercise, commented, “for most of us, this is only one element of our jobs, thankfully we do not encounter devices like this every day. Training like this is vital, to ensure that we are as sharp and up-to-date as possible when we do encounter a complex device or hostage situation.” The Austrian officer in charge, explained the advantages of running the course at a European level, “obviously one important element is cost. By pooling demand from different countries with similar needs, we can afford to do more than we would be able to do individually. However, another important part is bringing together operatives from across Europe, learning from each other, and developing a European network of manual neutralisation experts”, he said. Manual Neutralisation Techniques Courses and Exercises The course is part of the EDA’s Manual Neutralisation Techniques Courses and Exercises programme. It is the second event to be held under the programme in Austria this year, after the completion of the first European Manual Neutralisation Training Course in May. Both the course and exercise made use of specially designed manual neutralisation kits for defusing improvised explosive devices. These kits were purchased by EDA and given to the Austrian Armed Forces to be stored at the logistics school, however they are available on request for operational use by all participating EDA Member States.

EDA_NEWS_0659	2014-09-12	NEWS	EDA provides cyber defence support to operation EUFOR RCA	 The European Defence Agency (EDA) has supported operation EUFOR RCA by organising three seminars on Cyber Awareness in the Headquarters facilities of Larissa, Greece. This is the first time EDA has provided this type of support to an EU mission. In July and September 2014, the EDA provided Cyber Awareness training to a total of 150 EUFOR RCA staff from the Operations headquarters in Larissa, Greece. The seminars were designed to raise the situational awareness, in terms of Cyber operations, of each staff member of the Operation Headquarters as well as to inform about the development and establishment of EU capabilities. The seminars also provided the opportunity to exchange views on the next steps to be taken to enhance the Cyber Defence capabilities of operation EUFOR RCA and other EU-led military operations. Speaking about the cooperation Brigadier General Christos Drivas, EUFOR RCA Chief of Staff added,  “Cyber Defence is high on our agenda. The decision to use the expertise from EDA is, of course, based on EDA’s technical knowledge in this field. Another advantage will be to benefit from the lessons learned in conducting such a training for other EU operations in the future.” The seminars were conducted with support from the EU Military Staff and Tallinn Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence. Observers from the Greek General staff(as representatives for the OHQ parent nation) and from the Italian EU OHQ core staff also participated. The fifth domain of warfare Cyberspace today is often described as the fifth domain of warfare equally critical to military operations as land, sea, air, and space. Success of military operations in the physical domains is increasingly dependent on the availability of, and access to, cyberspace. The armed forces are reliant on cyberspace both as a user and as a domain to achieve defence and security missions. Cyber defence is one of the ten priorities in the EDA capability development plan (CDP). Given that threats are multifaceted, a comprehensive approach is taken, seeking to enhance synergies between the civilian and military domains in protecting critical cyber assets. At the EU Summit of December 2013, Heads of State and Government endorsed the Agency’s cyber defence roadmap for strengthening - in close coordination with Member States, EEAS, and the European Commission – European cyber defence capabilities. Its main elements are training, improving cyber situational awareness, improving civil/military cooperation, the protection of EU assets during missions, and operations and technological aspects. EUFOR RCA The Council established on 10 February 2014 an EU military operation to contribute to a secure environment in the Central African Republic, as authorized by the UN Security Council in resolution 2134 (2014). EUFOR RCA is to provide support in achieving a safe and secure environment in the Bangui area, with a view to handing over to the UN incoming operation. The force will thereby contribute to international efforts to protect the populations most at risk, creating the conditions for providing humanitarian aid.

EDA_NEWS_0661	2014-07-31	NEWS	Hot Blade 2014 meets all training objectives	 Hot Blade 2014, the seventh helicopter exercise organised by the European Defence Agency, was formally closed on 30 July in Ovar airbase, Portugal. All training aims were met and the event was praised by senior national representatives. At exercise close, a total of 827 hours had been flown on 362 aircraft sorties. Twenty-five helicopters from six different nations took part in Hot Blade 2014 from 16-30 July. “All training aims were met with the assistance of a small team of highly qualified tactics instructors coming from the sister HTIC programme”, Andy Gray, EDA Helicopters Programme Manager, points out.   The largest helicopter exercise organised this year in Europe, Hot Blade 2014 has allowed participating crews to qualify as COMAO (Combined Air Operations) lead and conduct joint and combined air assault missions (with Portuguese, German and Dutch ground troops operating together in mixed units), while at the same time providing individual training with nations qualifying their pilots in dust landings, night vision operations and fighter evasion. Positive feedback. Expressed in a “hot wash-up” meeting, the immediate feedback from the exercise was extremely positive. Senior national representatives confirmed that the experience of working together with other nations and practicing large-scale joint and combined missions just could not have been achieved by working alone. They agreed that these exercises are truly enhancing the helicopter capability within Europe. “Over the last three years, the professionalism, enthusiasm and friendliness of our hosts has allowed the exercise to develop and grow”, adds Andy Gray, reflecting on Portugal’s major contribution to the success of EDA's Helicopter Exercise Programme. Next year’s event, called “Italian Blade”, will take place in June 2015 in Viterbo airbase, about 80 kilometres north of Rome. Background The European Defence Agency’s efforts in the field of helicopter capabilities also include the Helicopters Tactics Course (HTC), the Helicopter Tactics Instructor Course (HTIC), the OELC (Operational English Language Course) and the Basic Helicopter Flying Training (BHFT) initiative.   The first EDA-supported multinational helicopter exercise took place in Gap (France) in March 2009. It has since been followed by six subsequent exercises of various scope and size, held in Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Spain. The Helicopter Exercise Programme arrangement has been signed by twelve Member States in November 2012 for a period of ten years. Future editions are expected to take place in Italy and Finland.

EDA_NEWS_0662	2014-08-21	NEWS	EDA Symposium on Social Media in Security and Defence	 On 16 and 17 July, the European Defence Agency (EDA) hosted a symposium to discuss the current and potential role for social media in security and defence. Social Media is an increasingly pervasive part of global communication with increasing security and defence relevance.  However,  MoD staff and international organization are struggling to fully understand how social media can be used within the broad spectrum of security and defence activities. The two day symposium hosted by EDA gathered experts Member States, industry, the European External Action Service (EEAS), and NATO, to discuss how analysing social media activities can help enhance situational awareness. This was based partially on the analysis of the results of an EDA study on social media for defence. Enhancing situation awareness in operational circumstances The symposium, as well as EDA’s other work on social media, contributed to the Multinational Capability Development Campaign (MCDC), of which EDA is a participating member. MCDC is designed to develop and introduce new capabilities to enhance multinational and coalition operations. One strand of MCDC is on how social media can be used as a form of open source intelligence to help enhance armed forces’ situation awareness in operational circumstances.    The conclusion of the symposium was that social media has great potential to increase the effectiveness of OSINT, Command and Control and StratCom/ Information Ops. However work is needed to manage the risk associated with using social media platforms and to demonstrate how it can effectively enhance information capabilities. Another outcome of the symposium was demand for the reinvigoration of open source intelligence training,  something that was previously advocated and delivered by EDA. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/08/21/eda-symposium-on-social-media-in-security-and-defence
EDA_NEWS_0663	2014-09-10	NEWS	Symposium on Medical Support to CSDP operations to be held next month in Brussels	 Organised by the European Defence Agency and the EU Military Staff, the event will gather representatives from capability and planning units and subject-matter experts to promote future developments in this domain. Being able to provide medical support to EU personnel deployed around the world as part of Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions is critical to the success of those operations. But the challenges are plentiful: how to finance this medical support?  How to implement it in a EU framework? What are the best ways to provide emergency response in a difficult environment? Which emerging diseases need to be watched and what should be done to efficiently tackle them in the field?  How to implement a static organism at EU level to deal with the capability development for medical support? Those issues and many others will be addressed over the course of a two-day symposium organised jointly by the European Defence Agency and the EU Military Staff (EUMS), to be held at the Belgian Royal Military Academy in Brussels on 15-16 October 2014. It will be attended by subject-matter experts from EDA, EUMS as well as many other key actors of CSDP medical support, and it is open to all professionals and industry representatives working on the topic.   EDA’s involvement The European Defence Agency is already active in the medical support field, mainly through an ongoing initiative that has been joined by 16 Member States so far. Initiated in 2011 and led by Italy, the Multinational Modular Medical Units project aims to develop a state-of-the-art deployable field hospital that should become available to CSDP operations. It is designed to be used in a wide a range of missions, from peacekeeping to humanitarian relief and coercive operations.  The detailed programme of the Symposium is available here.

The exercise, which runs from 1- 12 September, brings together explosive disposal experts from five countries, the lead nation Austria, Germany, Italy, Ireland, and Sweden. Improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, present a challenge to Explosive Ordnance Disposal operators. This is particularly true when there is little time to render the  device safe or when the circumstances make it impossible to use different means but the operator’s skills to safely defuse the device. In order to tackle these highly dangerous situations, and to deal with complex devices, operators need to have a high level of experience and training. European Guardian 2014 is designed to provide the specialist training that experts from EDA Member States require. European Guardian is part of the EDA’s Manual Neutralisation Training Courses & Exercise (MNT C&E) Programme. MNT C&E is designed to provide exercises and training courses to experienced Improvised  Explosives Devises Disposal (IEDD) operators in order to accomplish proper threat assessments and course action planning as well to analyse complex IED’s in different circumstances.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/09/05/improvised-explosive-devices-disposal-exercise-kicks-off-in-vienna

EDA_NEWS_0667	2014-07-24	NEWS	Building cooperation at Hot Blade 2014	" Ovar, July 24 2014. A distinguished visitors (DV) day is taking place today at Ovar airbase, Portugal, as part of the European helicopter exercise Hot Blade 2014 held 16-30 July. The EDA-supported event again delivered tangible results by allowing cooperative training and improving interoperability between the six participating Member States. As of July 23, 163 sorties had been flown by the participants in support of Hot Blade 2014, amounting to a total of 345 flight hours. Missions have been designed specifically to maximize integration between national detachments and to enhance interoperability. The exercise addresses the ability to lead large-scale multinational missions, as well as fulfilling some national training objectives. Organised as part of the European Defence Agency’s Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP), Hot Blade 2014 is hosted by the Portuguese Air Force for the third time since 2012. Ovar airbase, located 40 kilometers south of Porto, has been home of 25 helicopters and their crews since July 16, with a total of 3.000 military personnel directly involved in the event. Cooperative training ""One can only be impressed by the outstanding contribution of the Portuguese Armed Forces and the other participating Member States to today’s event. This once again underscores the wide interest shown for EDA’s training and exercise initiative,"" stressed Rini Goos, Deputy Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency, during the DV Day. Six European countries have brought their rotary-wing aircraft to Ovar: Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal and the United Kingdom. Observers from Italy, Sweden, Hungary, Brazil and NATO Special Operation Forces Headquarters (NSHQ) are also attending. Training together The aim of Hot Blade 2014 is to increase interoperability between participating Member States while at the same time allowing crews to train in a hot, high and dusty environment similar to the one they might encounter on the battlefield. Multiple sorties have been flown each day with increasingly complex tactical scenarios and missions, including large-scale Composite Air Operations led by each national detachment. Hot Blade 2014 is the seventh exercise supported by EDA under the umbrella of the Helicopter Exercise Programme. The fact that these events are now integrated into the nations’ training syllabus is a testimony to their success and relevance for European operators. The Agency is conducting similar efforts in the field of tactical air transport and air-to-air refueling, respectively with the EATT (European Air Transport Training) and EART (European Air Refueling Training) series of exercises. “The European Defence Agency is an output and capability-driven organization. We focus on supporting our Member States with concrete programs and projects”, Rini Goos added. “This is why, upon its restructuring, the Agency established a dedicated Education, Training & Exercise Unit.” Background The European Defence Agency’s Helicopter Exercise Programme is part of the wider Helicopter Training Programme (HTP) initiative. This also includes the Helicopters Tactics Course (HTC), the Helicopter Tactics Instructor Course (HTIC), the OELC (Operational English Language Course), the DisSim CCD (Distributed Simulation Capability Concept Demonstrator) and the Basic Helicopter Flying Training (BHFT) initiative. The first EDA-supported multinational helicopter exercise took place in Gap (France) in March 2009. It has since been followed by six subsequent exercises of various scope and size, held in Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Future editions are expected to take place in Italy and Finland.

EDA_NEWS_0668	2014-07-22	NEWS	"Hot Blade 2014 Interview: ""We know we should train the way we fight"""	" One week into exercise ""Hot Blade 2014"" launched July 16 in Portugal, EDA Programme Manager Andy Gray discusses the main objectives and operational benefits of the event. What are the main objectives of Hot Blade 2014 ? Since we started work on the multinational helicopter exercises in 2009, we’ve always tried to achieve the same basic set of objectives. First, we’re trying to improve interoperability between our Member States’ helicopter crews, because there is a very good chance that they will have to work together on the same battlefield in the years to come – and we truly mean working together, integrating national capabilities into a multination coalition, not the just the deconfliction that has been used in the past.  We’re also working on improving individual skills, and in order to achieve that we need a training environment that replicates as closely as possible the conditions that we might find in a given theatre of operations.  Here in Portugal, we naturally focus on “hot, high & dusty” conditions, not unlike the ones you could find in Afghanistan or in some parts of Africa, but we also intend to practice in other environments, for instance extreme cold.  The overarching objective is really quite simple. Future operations will be coalition operations and we know we should train the way we fight, so we must train together. We need to learn how to work together today, in a controlled environment, not tomorrow, when we have already been deployed and have hostile forces to worry about.    Are there specific outputs expected from this year’s event ? We have to be careful not to increase the complexity of each exercise too much as each time it is a new set of crews and you need to build the exercise to suit them. My main output will always be to see the crews experience and competency improve. For Hot Blade, this specifically addresses the ability to lead a large-scale multinational mission – this is very hard for them to organise at home and so the exercise is designed to give them that opportunity.  Within that we also have specific individual training objectives: for instance, the Netherlands use Hot Blade for its low visibility landing training – its “dust landing” training.  This is particularly important to them, as these are the conditions they are encountering in Mali – the Dutch Detachment Commander here deploys to Mali in September. We are always aware that the exercise should have a direct link to the operational needs of the participants and again this is at the heart of the exercise design.   A particularly pleasing aspect of this year’s exercises is the participation of infantry from Netherlands and Germany.  One of the reasons I am so focussed on aircrew training is that on operations we place our soldiers in each other’s aircraft.  We need to make sure that all crews on a coalition, no matter what flag they have on their uniform, are capable of completing the mission safely and competently.  We have recognised standards for the aircraft, but not for the pilots that fly them.  I think this is necessary and that we owe it to our troops to understand the capabilities of our coalition partners. There is no high level agreement in place, so we are trying to build this understanding from the bottom up.    Could you describe some of the missions that have been conducted in Ovar so far in a little more detail? We have already launched two large scale Composite Air Operations (COMAOs).   Each detachment takes a turn in leading the mission; the first was led by Portugal and the latest one by the UK.  Today’s main mission is CSAR (Combat Search and Rescue) extraction, but there are sub-missions, which have been planned to pull the “enemy” focus away from the main event.  These include suppression of a mortar position and a potential seizure of a high value target, possible through a vehicle interdiction. The scenario and the mission are complex and are conducted in a fluid, ill-defined context – very much like real life. The main mission package today shows how integrated the forces are as it involves four Portuguese F-16, providing over-watch and Close Air Support; two Belgian A109 providing escort to a Portuguese EH -101, which will do the CSAR pick up. The diversionary attacks will be carried out by two British Pumas, two Dutch CH-47 Chinooks, three Austrian AB212 and five German UH1-Ds carrying infantry from Portugal, Germany and the Netherlands.

The laboratory will now form part of a new EDA-supported initiative, the Joint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory (JDEAL), providing a permanent technical exploitation training facility in the Netherlands to support counter-IED (Improvised Explosive Devices) efforts. JDEAL will also provide up to two deployable Level 2 technical exploitation labs which will be available for international missions and operations involving the Member States participating in the project.   Building on the experiences of Afghanistan The MNTEL (D) has been located in Kabul since November 2011, initially at Camp Warehouse at the operations centre for the multinational International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), and then at Kabul International Airport since March 2013. In the Afghanistan Theatre of Operations it was under French management, which assumed lead nation responsibility for the project. During its deployment more than 6,000 exhibits were forensically examined.   From MNTEL to JDEAL The equipment from the MNTEL will now be moved to Soesterberg, Netherlands where the new JDEAL training facility will be located. The Netherlands will act as lead nation for the new project, which will officially launch in September 2014. This redeployment has been carried out according to the detailed exit strategy planned and has been completed ahead of the fixed deadlines.   Continuing the fight against IEDs Improvised Explosive Devices have been the single largest killer of coalition soldiers by a significant margin, and have also killed and injured thousands of the local Afghan population. The MNTEL (D) has proved an effective tool in the fight against IEDs, and the follow on JDEAL initiative will ensure that the capability, and that the lessons learned and experience gained in Afghanistan, will continue to be used for this purpose.    More Information Counter IED Lab Saves Lives in Afghanistan EDA Counter-IED Project Page Afghanistan : fermeture du laboratoire européen contre-IED de KAIA (French MoD website) 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/07/29/counter-ied-lab-arrives-in-the-netherlands
EDA_NEWS_0670	2014-07-28	NEWS	Spending that matters: the economic case for investing in Europe’s Defence Industry	 Defence plays a pivotal role in promoting internal and external security, maintaining peace, stability and prosperity, and protecting personal freedom and our way of life.  However, defence spending also has several macroeconomic benefits.  A recent study commissioned by the European Defence Agency (EDA) outlines the advantages of investing in the European defence industry in terms of economic benefits, employment and sustainment of research and development capabilities. What is the real effect of today’s pressure on national defence budgets?  A recent Agency study sought to answer this precise question. Some of its conclusions are revealing: for example, for each €100m cut in EU defence expenditure, there is a €150m fall in EU gross domestic product (GDP), and a €40m fall in EU tax revenues. However, the consequences of such cuts extend far beyond the pure economical realm. The study, which was conducted by British consultancy firm Europe Economics, also highlighted that a similar €100m cut in defence spending would translate into the loss of about 3.000 jobs, 800 of which would be high-skilled.    Greater impact. In some key dimensions, the overall macroeconomic benefit of investing in the defence sector may exceed that of investing in other domains. For instance, the study confirmed that defence investments have a far great impact on highly-skilled employment and research and development, hence potentially leading to a long-term GDP growth rate. The results of the study estimated that the impact is 12 to 20 times greater than that generated by other forms of public spending. Of equal importance is the fact that defence R&D creates a “spillover” of technologies to the civil sector.  This often significant “spillover”, means that investing in defence R&D is essential to the emergence of breakthrough technologies which has a knock on benefit in other areas eg civil aircraft market. More generally, the study demonstrated that the macroeconomic impact of investment in the defence sector is greater at EU level than at the national level, because of the inherent “Europeanised” nature of the defence industry.    Case studies. The study also reviewed a number of case studies to try and quantify the micro-economic impact of several acquisition programs in the EU, like fighter aircraft. It confirms, for instance, that programmes such as Eurofighter or Rafale helped EU companies to acquire the competitiveness they enjoy today on the commercial aircraft market.  Another example is the Leopard 2 main battle tank programme which was launched in the last years of the Cold War.  It enabled the German Army to equip its cavalry regiments with a highly capable system, at a cost that was 45 per cent lower than the next best alternative.  This was the first study which looked at the EU as a whole; previous efforts were focused only at national level.  It demonstrates tangible rationale to support investment in the European defence industry, confirming that there are considerable opportunities to increase the efficiency of European collaborative programmes and at the same time European economic prosperity.  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/07/28/spending-that-matters-the-economic-case-for-investing-in-europe-s-defence-industry

EDA_NEWS_0676	2014-07-01	NEWS	EDA Launches Security of Information Portal	 The EDA launched today a public web-portal containing information on participating Member States’ Security of Information (SoI) related agreements and arrangements, policies, practices, as well as on relevant European and other multinational agreements and arrangements. Rules protecting classified information have to be adequately transparent and non-discriminative to enable suppliers from different European Member States to participate in defence procurement procedures across the European Union. Therefore, Security of Information is a precondition for a more open and transparent European Defence Equipment Market (EDEM) and underpins successful defence procurement and European collaboration. The mapping and sharing of information on different national, international and institutional regulations, arrangements and agreements on processing, storing and circulating classified information, will contribute towards removing Security of Information barriers in defence procurement among Member States. The launch of the EDA SoI Portal is considered as a significant step in this process.

EDA_NEWS_0677	2014-06-30	NEWS	EDA helps establish an independent European supply chain for advanced Gallium Nitride technologies	 New developments for the production of electronic components based on the efficient semiconductor gallium nitride help to move the European defence industry towards independence. A multinational research and development project under the leadership of the European Defence Agency (EDA) has succeeded in implementing the entire supply chain for the realization of power electronics components based on gallium nitride within Europe. With the optimisation of development and manufacturing techniques for power electronics based on gallium nitride (GaN), researchers and industry partners from five European countries pursue the aim of producing high quality GaN-based electronic devices in Europe, without relying on international suppliers. Due to the high efficiency and robustness of the semiconductor, GaN-based power electronic components already replace established technologies, mainly in the fields of radar and broadband amplifiers.  With respect to the increasing application of the efficient components in electronic defense and combat systems, the European defence industry is facing an increasing demand for the reliable supply of power electronic components. The technology is critical and will provide key enabling capabilities to a broad spectrum of Defence applications, reaching from advanced radar and communication  antennas to electronic warfare.   An independent supply chain in Europe Guided by the European Defence Agency (EDA), leading research institutions, universities, as well as defence related companies from Germany, France, Italy, Sweden and the United Kingdom worked together during the past four years in the project MANGA (Manufacturable GaN-SiC-substrates and GaN epitaxial  wafers supply chain) in order to optimize gallium nitride technologies in Europe. To facilitate an independent production of GaN-based electronic devices for military applications, it is necessary to implement the entire supply chain within Europe – reaching from the availability of Silicon Carbide (SiC) substrates for the epitaxial growth of gallium nitride, to the industrial manufacturing of High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMT). In the scope of the project, GaN-based transistor layers were grown epitaxially on newly developed, high quality SiC-substrates. Applying established foundry processing, these transistor layers were finally used to produce fully European state-of-the-art High Electron Mobility Transistors. Both the quality of the SiC-substrates and the performance of the HEMT are comparable to equivalent benchmark-setting components produced in the United States.   Systems with increased reliability Also in future projects, it will remain the goal of the EDA to further reduce the European defense industry’s dependence on international trade regulations. After having successfully realized the independent development and production of state-of-the-art transistors suitable for military applications, the project partners want to focus on the improvement of the reliability and material quality of the transistors. Results from universities participating in the project MANGA, where scientists studied the impact of variations in layer structures on the devices’ performance, will help to further optimize the HEMT-technology. In a follow-on project, the project partners want to achieve the qualification of an industrial European wafer supplier for state-of-the-art HEMT structures. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/06/30/eda-helps-establish-an-independent-european-supply-chain-for-advanced-gallium-nitride-technologies
EDA_NEWS_0678	2014-07-07	NEWS	Successful Completion of Second EU Personnel Recovery Course in Hungary	 A total of 22 participants from ten nations (Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Slovakia, United Kingdom and Sweden plus Norway and the United States) attended the 2nd Personnel Recovery Controller and Planner Course (PRCPC) from 23 June to 4 July 2014 in Veszprém, Hungary. This intensive two-week course - held for the first time at the Hungarian Air Force Air Command and Control Centre (ACCC) - aims at enabling participants to prepare, plan and execute Personnel Recovery Operations. Previous course participants and indeed all of the instructors have gained operational Personnel Recovery experience in various operations such as in ISAF in Afghanistan, Operation Unified Protector (OUP) in Libya and Operation SERVAL in Mali. “This course is indeed very helpful for our operational planning. The instructors are very experienced and motivated”, said course participant Captain Gábor Krenács from the Hungarian Air Force. As well as the Hungarian staff instructors, a multi-national instruction team from Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, France, Sweden and the United States deployed to Veszprém in order to support the training and to evaluate the 2nd PRCPC. Staff were also sent from NATO associated entities and the European Personnel Recovery Centre (EPRC). Major Tor Cavalli-Björkman, a Swedish instructor and the main initiator of this European project, is convinced: “Since we started, first with a series of four pilot courses in 2011 and then with the establishment of a CAT B project in 2013, we have all benefited tremendously from this multi-national training and information exchange.” The contributing Member States at the moment are Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands under the lead of Sweden. The first course under the Cat B arrangement was conducted in February/March this year in Karlsborg, Sweden. Major Cavalli-Björkman also stressed that “this initiative increases the number of trained personnel available to support on-going operations as well as the EU Battle Group and national staffs.” Standardise Personnel Recovery Training in Europe The initiative to standardise Personnel Recovery training emerged from the Project Team Personnel Recovery (PT PR) in EDA at the end of November 2010. Peter Round, Capability, Armament & Technology Director at EDA, stated: “I am most grateful that Hungary agreed to offer this opportunity and hosted it so successfully at its Air Command and Control Centre’s facilities. This initiative has made a significant contribution to Personnel Recovery capabilities in Europe.” Major Konrad Ertl from the German Air Operations Command in Kalkar and Chairman of the PT PR said “We all, students as well as instructors, are deeply impressed of the tremendous effort the HDF and the Hungarian Air Force has put in to setting-up this course. The facilities at the ACCC in Veszprém are very suitable for this course. Also the professionalism and the very high dedication of the Hungarian Hosts to this course was amazing. Finally, we all benefitted from an outstanding learning experience while enjoying the great hospitality in Hungary. Overall this made it very easy for us to do what we do, so ‘that others may live – and return with honour’. ‘Köszönöm szépen’ (many Thanks) to the Host nation!” An officer from the ACCC said: “It was not an easy job to organise and run the course, but with the unselfish help of our colleagues and with one of the best instructor teams I have ever seen we accomplished the mission.” Mitigating the risk of isolation, capture, and exploitation Personnel Recovery is aimed at mitigating and reacting to the risk of isolation, capture, and exploitation of military or civilian personnel for instance during a Crisis Management Operation (CMO). The Personnel Recovery Course, held regularly by various host nations, is one of several results of the respective Project Team at EDA. Other initiatives include a Personnel Recovery Concept, a Personnel Recovery Functional Area Service to be connected to command & control systems in tactical and operational Headquarters for planners and controllers, a personnel registration tool and the preparation of a Personnel Recovery Baseline Training Tool.

EDA_NEWS_0679	2014-07-02	NEWS	Law Enforcement and Military Combine Efforts at the First European Homemade Explosives Course	 Experts from the civilian law enforcement and the military have taken part in the first European Homemade Explosives Training course which took place between 2 and 6 June in the Curragh Camp at the IE Department of Defence Ordnance School. The course, run jointly by the European Defence Agency and Europol, brought together 28 experts from 16 different countries.  The participants took part in highly realistic training scenarios involving homemade explosives, in order to improve skills and to share best practices. The training consisted of identifying, processing, and disposing of different types of  homemade explosives that can be found in improvised laboratories, such as those of criminals and/or terrorists. The cooperation between EDA and Europol reflects the need for a combined civil-military approach to the threat not only of homemade explosives but the whole C-IED spectrum. This approach helps to ensure that there are clear lines of communication between the two and the need to share skills and experiences among military and civilian law enforcement agencies. EU-US Cooperation The course also showed the increasingly close ties between EU and US actors in the field of explosives security and safety issues with participation and support from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The course received very positive feedback from participants, with organisers looking at the possibility of arranging a second course to meet the high level of demand.  The course forms part of EDA’s comprehensive approach to tackling improvised explosive devices (IEDs). These efforts include areas such as  the counter-IED Technical exploitation lab Level 2 Multinational Technical Exploitation Laboratory, MNTEL (D) which  has been stationed in Afghanistan since 2011, a Manual Neutralisation Techniques Category B programme, for which the first exercise will be held in September in Vienna (1 to 12 September), the Joint Deployable Exploitation Analysis laboratory (JDEAL) initiative, which its operational life is intended to start in November 2014 as well as another ongoing C IED related activities and projects.

EDA_NEWS_0680	2014-06-26	NEWS	European Air Transport Training delivers first results	" A Distinguished Visitors (DV) Day is being held today as part of the European Air Transport Training (EATT14) in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. The two-week event, coordinated by the European Defence Agency (EDA) in close cooperation with hosts Bulgaria and the European Air Transport Command (EATC), aims to increase interoperability in the air transport area. EATT14 takes place between 15 - 27 June and is the only European multinational air transport training of its kind. It brings together 460+ participants, 19 crews, and 10 transport aircraft from 10 different countries.  EATT14: results so far As of 24 June, more than 80 missions have taken place with over 130 flying hours. 100 paratroopers have been dropped alongside more the 32,000 KGs of cargo. The training objectives have been tailored to the needs of the different participating countries, with the missions developing on an increasing complexity basis.  Training objectives include airdrops, low level flying, and night operations – with around 10 hours of night flights having already taken place. The overall objective of the training is to achieve a far reaching level of interoperability between tactical airlift users in the area of operations and training. Challenging Conditions The first week of training was disrupted by severe weather conditions, which made flying conditions difficult and which caused serious and even fatal flooding in other areas of Bulgaria. Laurent Donnet, the Deputy Director of the Exercise, commented: ""The flying conditions in the first week presented significant challenges for training, I would like to thank the Bulgarian authorities for the flexibility and support they have provided under these circumstances. However, in operations we need to be able to react to challenging conditions and we need to be able to do so together, that is why training events like this are so important. It allows us to pool resources and share knowledge, meaning ultimately that we can work more effecitvely and more efficiently together.” Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Spain, and Norway have all sent transport aircraft, with Bulgaria and Greece supporting the event with fighters and a Greek AEW&C aircraft. As well as the participating countries, observers from Austria, Finland, Hungary, Portugal, Sweden, UK, USA, and the Heavy Airlift Wing based in Hungary also followed the training, with some of them indicating their intention of joining the exercise next year.   Background The exercise takes places within the framework of the European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) partnership, which has been signed by 20 European countries in 2011. It aims to alleviate the existing airlift shortfall in the EU as well as to identify potential projects to optimise cooperation and coordination amongst air forces in the area of operations and training. EATT is just one event held within the EATF framework, it runs alongside an annual symposium - held in Athens this year - and the European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course (EAATTC), which will take place in Zaragoza for the first time in September 2014.  More information Download high-resolution pictures in our Flickr Gallery  EATT14 Factsheet European Air Transport Command (EATC) European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/06/26/european-air-transport-training-delivers-first-results

EDA_NEWS_0683	2014-06-24	NEWS	EDA presents its roadmap on Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems at international conference	 The 16th UVS Annual Conference is organized within the framework of the European Remotely Piloted Air Systems (RPAS) roadmap. They have proven essential in modern-day operations around the world : Remotely Piloted Air Systems, or RPAS, are now a key priority for the European Defence Agency whose teams are working on several ways to improve Member States’ capabilities in that domain. Speaking today during the 16th UVS (Unmanned Vehicle Systems) Annual Conference held 23-26 June at the Royal Military Academy in Brussels, and which drew over 200 participants from 30 countries, Jean-Youri Marty, RPAS program manager at EDA, stressed that this domain was recognized a major priority by Heads of States and Government at the last European Council in December 2013. “We know we have the skills and industries in Europe not only to do this but also to become a first class player in the field”, he added. Five pillars EDA’s work on RPAS in channeled into five main workstrands. The first one focuses on the preparation of a future European Male RPAS programme, based on a Common Staff Target endorsed by Member States in November 2013. Outputs of this ongoing preparation phase are now expected around 2016. Another area aims at optimizing the operational use of Male (Medium Altitude Long Endurance) RPAS currently in service in Europe. Seven EDA Member States have already decided to set up a dedicated Male RPAS community. EDA also helps its Member States harmonizing airworthiness certification processes, in collaboration with the European Aviation Safety Agency. In the meantime, the Agency conducts several studies on the critical issue of military RPAS integration insertion in the general air traffic, again in close cooperation with the EASA but also with the European Commission, the Sesar Joint Undertaking and Eurocontrol. Finally, EDA supports its Members states in developing new technological solutions to prepare future RPAS.   More information Learn more about EDA's RPAS efforts with our dedicated factsheet   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/06/24/eda-presents-its-roadmap-on-remotely-piloted-aircraft-systems-at-international-conference
EDA_NEWS_0684	2014-06-19	NEWS	Coming Soon: Military Airworthiness Conference 2014	 The annual MAWA Military Airworthiness Conference will be held this year in Rome on 24 and 25 September. The MAWA Forum oversees the development of European Military Airworthiness Requirements and promotes ways of achieving the harmonisation of military airworthiness regulation and certification processes across Europe.  The annual conference brings together important stakeholders, from national authorities through to industry and European agencies, so that each groups input is ensured. Gaining the benefits of harmonisation Whereas civil aviation falls under the auspices of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), Military aircraft are exclusively subject to national legislation. To counter this the EDA was entrusted with establishing the Military Airworthiness Authorities (MAWA) Forum to increase cooperation and harmonisation between Member States authorities. This approach offers many benefits, including enhancing Military aviation safety, improving Military-military and civil-military cooperation, reducing the time and cost for new aircraft development and optimising interoperability during joint air operations. Harmonised national airworthiness regulations are also a key enabler to unlock the benefits for all aviation related ‘pooling and sharing’ initiatives. Advantages of mutual recognition This year’s conference will be the sixth time the event has been held. In that time significant progress has already been made, with three European Military Airworthiness Requirements being approved and published on the EDA website. The adoption of these and other requirements into national  regulations will enable mutual recognition of certificates and approvals issued by each Member State’s Military Airworthiness Authority, helping to reduce costs and improve safety.

EDA_NEWS_0685	2014-06-25	NEWS	EATT14: Final week begins in Plovdiv	" The second and final week of the European Air Transport Transport Training (EATT14) got under way in Plovdiv, Bulgaria on Monday. With 460+ participants, 19 crews, and 10 transport aircraft of 5 different types, coming from 10 different countries, EATT 14 is the only multinational European airlift training. The training is organised by EDA in close cooperation with the EATC, the host nation Bulgaria, and with support from the other participating countries. The training is helping the member countries to achieve a far reaching level of interoperability between their tactical airlift users in the area of operations and training. Day and night missions will continue until 27 June, with countries tailoring the training to meet their needs and requirements. Eleven participating countries  Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, The Netherlands, Spain, Norway are all participating in the training with transport aircraft. Meanwhile, Greece is supporting the exercise with F-16’s and an AEW&C aircraft. Additionally, Austria, Finland, Hungary, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, UK, and USA are sending observers, with strong signals that more will join the exercise next year.  Helping to fill an important gap The airlift training takes place within the framework of the European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) partnership. The aim of the EATF is to alleviate the existing airlift shortfall in the EU as well as to identify potential projects to optimise cooperation and coordination amongst air forces in the area of operations and training. EATT 14 works along side other EDA supported training initiatives such as the European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course (EAATTC), which will take place in Zaragoza for the first time in September 2014. It also aims to boost an important enabler for multinational missions and operations, as does the European Air-to-Air Refuelling Training (EART), which was held in Eindhoven for the first time earlier this year. These initiatives form one aspect of EDA’s work to help Member States to fill important capability gaps in a cooperative way. This work focuses on helping countries pool their resources, raise skill levels and share best practices between participating countries, and improve interoperability for multinational operations. This is particularly important with an ever-increasing number of operations being carried out jointly. In order to better support training activities within EU, with its recent restructuring EDA established a dedicated Education, Training & Exercise Unit in the Cooperation Planning & Support Directorate.

EDA_NEWS_0686	2014-06-16	NEWS	LAVOSAR Study Delivers Results	 The Land Vehicle with Open System  Architecture (LAVOSAR) dissemination workshop took place on 03 June 2014 at the EDA. Thirty participants from 10 countries and 25 organizations (industry, research centers and government) attended and discussed the results of the LAVOSAR study funded by the EDA in the frame of CapTech Ground Systems. The objectives of LAVOSAR study were to analyse standards and best practices, create a framework containing agreed definitions of context and terminology as a basis for more detailed studies, study and develop a functional and technical Mission System architecture, and study and develop a Business Case supporting an Open Architecture approach. Concrete results The topic generated substantial interest and is regarded as key for a comprehensive implementation of information technology in military vehicles resulting in drastic increase in performance and flexibility whilst, at the same time, achieving cost savings for procurement and especially for maintenance and logistics. One recommendation arising from the discussion was that the LAVOSAR current and future activities should  support NATO General Vehicle Architecture (NGVA) standardization efforts and not to proceed to develop a separate standard. At the workshop, the LAVOSAR team presented the results of the  study. In summary: This study provides an architecture which covers overarching concepts and methods. The architecture consists of a number of views covering aspects of Military Land Vehicle Mission Systems. However, an additional layer is needed for the architecture to be directly applicable to target applications. A modular approach could then be taken with additional, replacement or upgraded sub-systems. Logistics are simplified – including exchange of spare subsystems. Qualitative advantages such as situational awareness, operational efficiency and effectiveness in a networked environment are the most important drivers for this approach. Qualitative advantages are achieved without significant cost increase Overall cost savings were estimated at 10% to 25%  of the Mission System cost Recommendations include development of Data Models; of Validation, Verification and Accreditation organization and procedures; and of a demonstrator for the App Store The full results presented at the work shop are available below.

EDA_NEWS_0691	2014-05-21	NEWS	EDA Sign Procurement Arrangement with EUFOR Althea	" On 20 May, Claude-France Arnould Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency (EDA) met with General Sir Adrian Bradshaw the Operation Commander of EUFOR Althea and Deputy SACEUR. They signed a Procurement Arrangement concerning the acquisition of Air to Ground Surveillance services to operation ALTHEA. This is the first time EDA has signed a procurement arrangement directly with an EU mission. Under this arrangement, EDA will assume the lead role in administering the procurement procedure of Air to Ground Surveillance services (including day/night actual Infra-red / electro-optical surveillance with near-real time downlink and the ability to re-task in flight) on behalf of the ALTHEA Operation Commander. As the procurement regards common costs, the Operation Commander has been authorised by the Athena administrator to sign the arrangement on behalf of Athena. The cooperation between EDA and Operation ALTHEA will conclude with a recommendation to the Operation Commander to award the contract to one company selected in competition. Talking about the arrangement, Claude-France Arnould said, “The ultimate goal of any EDA project is to ensure that troops in the field have the capabilities they need, as was demonstrated clearly by our Counter-IED laboratory in Afghanistan. I am delighted that today’s arrangement allows us to do this by providing a procurement service directly to an EU mission for the first time. This cooperation will help highlight the expertise and added value EDA can bring in the field of procurement.” Supporting CSDP Missions and Operations As part of the restructuring conducted in January 2014, the Agency aims to play a greater role in supporting CSDP operations and missions. Speaking about the cooperation General Bradshaw added, “The decision to use the expertise from EDA in this procurement for Air to Ground Surveillance services for Op ALTHEA is, of course, based on EDA’s technical knowledge in this field. Another advantage will be to benefit from the lessons learned in conducting such an arrangement between the operation and the EDA directly, in order to establish the necessary procedures which will potentially enable closer cooperation between our organisations in the future.” This meeting was also an opportunity for Claude-France Arnould to introduce General Bradshaw, who took his functions in March 2014, to the mission and tasks of EDA. EUFOR ALTHEA The EU military operation ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina was launched on 2 December 2004 and has contributed to the maintenance of the safe and secure environment in BiH ever since. Operation ALTHEA is carried out with recourse to NATO assets and capabilities, under the ""Berlin Plus"" arrangements. After a review in 2012 the main objective is to provide capacity building and training for their armed forces whilst retaining the capability to support the BiH efforts to maintain a safe and secure environment.  The Athena Mechanism ATHENA is the mechanism established to administer the financing of the common costs of European Union operations having military or defence implications governed by Council Decision 2011/871/CFSP. The Council Decision allows for arrangements to be signed with Union bodies to facilitate procurement in operations in the most cost-effective manner."	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/05/21/eda-sign-procurement-arrangement-with-eufor-althea
EDA_NEWS_0692	2014-06-04	NEWS	EDA Framework Arrangement for Security of Supply – Implementation progressing	 To enhance their mutual support and assistance on Security of Supply the EDA Member States adopted on 19 November 2013 an updated “Framework Arrangement for Security of Supply”. The updated Framework Arrangement has broad applicability, covering both peacetime and times of crisis and all kinds of acquisitions. Hence, differing from its predecessor it is not limited any more to operational urgency nor to acquisitions conducted under Article 346 TFEU. The Framework Arrangement is also fully adapted to the new legal framework of the Defence and Security Procurement Directive 2009/81/EC and the Intra-Community Transfers Directive 2009/43/EC. All 27 EDA participating Member States, as well as Norway, have now decided to subscribe to and therefore participate in the implementation of the Framework Arrangement, highlighting the importance of Security of Supply. In coming years the EDA will act as a facilitator to support national implementation and application of the Framework Arrangement. In addition, the May 2014 Steering Board adopted a voluntary Code of Conduct on Prioritisation, associated with the Framework Arrangement, as a means to involve industry in the EDA Security of Supply framework, by establishing a way for industry to demonstrate its commitment to meet Member States enhanced Security of Supply requirements in defence procurement. The Code of Conduct is now open for subscription to the states participating in the Framework Arrangement.  Subject to the national subscription to the Code of Conduct, defence industry can sign up to this voluntary Code on a case-by-case basis. Whilst doing so industry will accept a set of principles to ensure delivery and provision of defence equipment and services to the Member States. Both the Framework Arrangement and the Code of Conduct on Prioritisation are considered as substantial steps contributing towards the establishment of a comprehensive EU-wide Security of Supply Regime, as requested in the December 2013 European Council conclusions.

EDA_NEWS_0694	2014-05-27	NEWS	EDA Achieves New Source of Dual Use Research Funding	 The EDA has successfully supported Member States in accessing European Structural Funds (ESF) for dual-use research and development technologies. In February 2014 “Project Turtle” – a proposal from a consortium of Portuguese small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs), research institutes and universities to research ascent and descent energy-efficient technologies for robotic underwater vehicles – became the first of seven dual-use research initiatives supported by the EDA to access European Structural Funds (ESF). ESF are financial instruments that provide for “the implementation of EU Cohesion Policy to reinforce economic and social cohesion within the EU”. The potential benefits for Europe’s defence industry is considerable from accessing this  source of finance are considerable .The new programming period, 2014-2020, contains more than €379 billion in European Regional Development Funds (ERDF), one of the ESF funds under which research and innovation ac­tivities can be supported. According to Vassilis Tsiamis, who manages the ESF project within EDA nobody had, until recently, seriously considered the application of this type of funding for dual-use research and technology (R&T). “The real issue was to challenge the perception of eligibility,” he said. “It wasn’t just a question of ‘can do’ – but much more a question of can we do it, and what, precisely, is it that we can do?”   Vassilis Tsiamis, Project Officer, EDA Increasingly dual nature of technology The starting point has been recognition of the increasingly dual nature of technology and the significant potential that exists for synergies between civil and defence research. Energy, telecommunications, information technology, automotive and materials technologies, space, aeronautics and the chemicals industry provide examples of the potential benefits accruing to a wide variety of defence and civil applications. So why not use the facility afforded by ESF to recognise some of these benefits, the EDA asked? A new EU innovation policy concept called the Research and Innovation Smart Specialisation Strategy (RIS3) has been developed to promote the more effective use of public investment in research at a regional EU level.  Regional - and in a few cases national - authorities have been asked to identify the unique characteristics, assets and capabilities of their respective regions to focus policy support and investment channelled through ESF. Supporting the regions Including Croatia, there are some 273 identified EU regions, with almost 500 managing authorities directing the use of ESF.  When the EDA put out a call for proposals for the use of ESF in development of dual-use technologies in 2013, it received 72 proposals from 12 Member States. Of these, the Agency decided to support seven as initial pilot cases. From Bulgaria came a proposal for the improvement of urban security and defence applications through use of advanced sensor systems, while from Poland an intruder-detection and collision avoidance system for aircraft has been proposed. A French consortium has offered a Europe-wide icing testing platform for aeronautics, while an industry proposal in the United Kingdom has put forward a project in Epitaxial Microwave technology – a critical capability for improving radar performance in both civil and military applications. From Spain came a proposal for the development of an underwater signature monitoring and analysis centre, while from Germany an adaptation of short wave infrared (SWIR) technology for high resolution hyper-spectral and imaging applications has been suggested. The seventh proposal, from Portugal, became the first of these pilot cases to reach a sufficiently mature level to win. It is important to recognise the fact these proposals have come from project holders in the various nations, and are not official ‘national’ project proposals. Ensuring we have the expertise “The first priority has been to acquire the expertise within the Agency and share it with the managers in the Ministries of Defence and then to arrange for in-depth knowledge transfer and capacity building with industry,” said Tsiamis. Four seminars have already been held – in Bulgaria, Ireland, Poland and Portugal – aimed at increasing awareness of the opportunity and the methodology of successfully applying for supportive funding. Engaging the community – both governmental and industrial – and building capacity within that community to be able to benefit from this innovative approach to stemming the decreasing investment in defence-related R&T has been a key priority for Tsiamis and his colleagues throughout the process. Benefits for SMEs “It’s important to recognise we are not creating process and we are not looking for more structural funds. What we are doing is helping defence actors to address these projects and to develop the application folders, ensuring the responsible authorities (in each region or nation) recognise the benefits SMEs can bring to the process and ensuring that the projects selected to move forward reflect the larger priorities of the EU,” said Tsiamis. “The way forward is for more pilot projects and more seminars, offering pragmatic advice and support, not simply explaining theoretical policies. We are now training EDA project officers – approximately 15 of them – and are looking at possibilities in key EDA prioritised areas such as space, the cyber domain, maritime security, energy efficiency and remote piloted aerial systems (RPAS)  - as examples of what we can do from a positive and concrete results perspective,” said Tsiamis. “Industry follows the money, and we are convinced there are enough significant opportunities for industry to recognise that engaging in this programme will have tangible and measurable results on its R&T activities,” said Tsiamis. He said that one of the new actions the Agency will be following during 2014 is to assess the degree to which European Territorial Cooperation on dual-use technology projects can be part of cross-border programmes financed by the European Regional Development Fund  (ERDF), to create an even larger pot of financial resources on which to draw. EDA’s programme commitment to exploiting these opportunities currently has a three year timescale. “Looked at from all directions, we are in a win/win situation here – we’re supporting SMEs, we’re supporting regional research and technology development while simultaneously stimulating dual-use research, we’re supporting EU policy and most importantly, we’re conforming with the EU Common Security and Defence  Policy (CSDP) key priorities, as adopted by December 2013 EU Council conclusions ,” said Tsiamis. The Agency’s role in this can be seen as one of being a facilitator, encouraging SMEs in particular to come forward with innovative proposals and providing assistance and support in the process of applying for funding that will see those proposals come to fruition.  “The message is simple,” said Tsiamis. “We’re here to help – we can reduce hesitations – come talk to us!” More Information Your Guide to European Structural Funds for Dual Use Technologies 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/05/27/eda-achieves-new-source-of-dual-use-research-funding

EDA_NEWS_0698	2014-05-19	NEWS	Building Effective Command and Control for Multi-National Missions	 The EDA is working with partners to develop new, more effective information sharing and decision-making architectures for military and civil emergency operations, writes Philip Butterworth-Hayes   Philip Butterworth-Hayes, Editor-in-Chief, European Defence Matters   Sometime soon there will be another humanitarian crisis emerging in a remote part of the world.  The European Union (EU) will send military forces to help stabilise the area while security, aid and medical services are mobilised.  Many nations and many different government and non-governmental agencies will be involved – but how should they communicate and share information so the correct decisions are taken on the ground to protect all personnel, including the host nation, while ensuring the effectiveness of the mission? Network Enabled Capabilities While the concept of network enabled capabilities (NEC) has become integrated into European national military structures over the last few years only recently has work begun to take this to the next stage – to develop a single secure command and control (C2) network to support multinational operations involving military and civil organisations in support of the EU’s common security and defence policy (CSDP).   “There are three elements to this:  technology issues, the way you deal with the information being exchanged and an understanding of the people who use it,” said Chris Stace, Project Office Command and Control -Information. “We now have a series of work-streams to address these specific challenges in these areas and to connect to communications technologies.”   Developing a common information sharing and decision-making architecture for military forces of allied nations is difficult enough, as different national headquarters (HQs) have different standard operating procedures, different ways of managing information and different technical ways of communicating between different levels. “For operation Atalanta, for example, the UK provided the operational headquarters but the force headquarters is based on a ship and rotated every six months, so the C2 challenges are substantial.”   But when there is a need to involve civilian organisations in the C2 network the challenge becomes even more complex.  As EU expeditionary missions are becoming increasingly multi-national, involving growing numbers of small size deployments and linked to civilian missions, the flow of information at the strategic, operational and tactical levels needs to be carefully managed.  Need for Operational Security “A general can use a Smart Phone to speak to, and exchange data with, anyone in the world along with a map of anywhere in the world,” said Chris Stace. “But we face constraints in providing the ‘military iPhone’: operating in areas where there are no Wifi connections can be addressed but  principally it is facing security threats that most developers simply don’t worry about; and balancing the need to share information while securing information, and therefore maintaining operational security.”   The EDA’s NEC work culminated in November 2013 with a demonstration in Poland of how information could be exchanged between participating member states during a multi-national expeditionary operation (see “Shared situational awareness in Warsaw”).  This demonstration has led to the formation of the latest EDA project team which focuses on the information sharing needs within the EU’s command and control arrangements.    This involves linking C2 information technology (IT) and communications networks between participating Member States and developing new ideas for exchanging information between military and civil agencies during operations and missions. Integration with national networks The first part of the work is to study how the separate the functional area services (FAS) can be better integrated with C2 national networks – as used in EU HQ-providing  Member States.  The benefit is to improve the access from C2 platforms to key information areas such as administration, personnel recovery, operational planning, countering surface to air fires (C-SAFIRE), and logistics.   “We shall be researching what are the hurdles and what needs to be agreed between Member States – the technical standards, procedures, training regimes for example - by the end of 2014,” said Chris Stace. “Next year we will develop a business case for follow-on capability demonstrations, providing evidence to decision-makers on a more integrated approach to be followed in the future.   “By the end of 2015 we will also have the outcomes of the information-exchange gateways demonstration project,” said Chris Stace. “This will look at linking two C2 systems - one national and one EU system. That won’t solve the whole problem; but it is an important technical building block.”   “We are trying to add value by seeing whether best-practice military solutions can be taken on board by the civil side.” This also involves linking to the EU’s Horizon 2020 research programme,  where there are proposals to research work into civil mission “situation assessment, information exchange and operational control” systems. Command and Control in the Information Age The success of military operations has for centuries depended on sound command and control.  This has not changed.  But the realities of the information age, the current security environment and the shape and size of the EU’s comprehensive approach to security and defence challenges have all made it more important than ever to develop a more systematic approach to deploying effective command and control networks. Decision-makers at all levels need improved situational awareness and they need to interact with growing numbers of actors, to speed-up processes and to keep ahead of their adversaries.  The EDA is working with Member States to put in place such enabling C2 measures.    More Information European Defence Matters Issue 5 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/05/19/building-effective-command-and-control-for-multi-national-missions
EDA_NEWS_0699	2014-05-12	NEWS	First European Manual Neutralisation Training Course Begins	 Experts from Austria, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Sweden are taking place in the first European Manual Neutralisation Training (MNT) in Vienna this week. Manual Neutralisation is used in situations when it is not possible to for a bomb disposal expert to use remote techniques to neutralise an Improvised Explosive Device (IED). By their nature these are the most dangerous situations, for example where it is not possible to evacuate the surrounding area or where an IED has  been attached to a hostage. The MNT Course – which takes place from 5 May to 6 June involves experienced experts from each participating country. Due to the high level nature of the course, it focuses on developing and enhancing the skills needed to neutralise complex devices under dangerous situations. It is the first of four courses that will take place over the next four years. The training will make use of kits developed by EDA to defuse improvised explosive devices. In total twelve kits have been given to the Austrian Armed Forces to be stored at the Handentschärferlehrgängen Army Logistics School. These kits are available on request for training or operational use by all of the participating Member States.  IEDs – a continuing threat IEDs have been, and will continue to be, a major threat to armed forces and civilians around the world. Although in the media, they have been most heavily associated with the campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq they continue to be a significant threat in a variety locations. EDA has been working in the area for a long time, helping to support coalition forces in Afghanistan through the C-IED Lab and through support for training and exercises in Europe such as MNT.

EDA_NEWS_0700	2014-05-15	NEWS	Peter Round: European Council prioritises EDA capability development initiatives	 Peter Round, Director Capability, Armament & Technology The European Council meeting in December 2013 provided a clear set of tasks for the EDA, with four areas of capability development identified as being particularly urgent. Peter Round, the EDA’s Capability Director, explains what this means for the Agency. Air-to-air refuelling (AAR), remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS), governmental satellite communications and cyber defence are the key issues which the European Council has identified as areas in which the EDA should work to fill in immediate capability gaps. “Although these four tasks certainly occupy pole position in the Directorate’s thinking, they are not our only concerns. We need to examine these priorities in the context of our work as a whole. However, each of these four areas is on the priority list for a reason and they are worth examining in some detail,” said Round. There can be no doubt there is a fundamental shortfall in European AAR capability. In operations over Libya, over 80% of all AAR missions were flown by US aircraft. One of the first challenges to be overcome, according to Round, is that the requirement for AAR is very different in peacetime to that in time of crisis – and that leads to all sorts of priority setting issues. “The obvious issue is that more capacity is required, but the background is complex and varies from nation to nation, so some strategic thinking has been necessary,” he said. The first issue, therefore, has been to determine the best method of exploiting the existing fleet and satisfying short term demand. One solution has been to improve the efficiency of allocating various national assets and – in a move that mirrors some of the initiatives undertaken for the European Air Transport Command (EATC) – to improve and accelerate the process for gaining diplomatic clearance for AAR missions over foreign territories. A parallel and potentially difficult issue to resolve is the two types of AAR technologies available – “booms” and “reels/hoses and drogues”.  Not all aircraft can accept fuel from both systems. The Royal Air Force, for example, currently has no indigenous refuelling capacity for the Rivet Joint signals intelligence platforms it is currently bringing into service and must depend on other nations assets if AAR is required. Increased efficiency also comes from assuring adequate (and regular) training and the EDA is organising a number of what Round describes as “practical flying events,” the most recent of which took place at Decimomannu in Sardinia in late 2013. The next such event will focus on the use of Italian Boeing B767 tankers later this year. Apart from improving the efficiency of current assets, the EDA is also working on initiatives including one looking at exploiting excess national capacity (with the UK’s Voyager fleet being a prime example.  A key piece of work is support to a Dutch and Norwegian led initiative to acquire a fleet of Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft which will make a significant contribution to European Capability through Pooling and Sharing, this aircraft will not only be a tanker but a very significant air transport asset as well. The issues in the further evolution of RPAS are no less complex, but are significantly different. With the overwhelming majority of current requirements coming from the military – most of which, as Round said, have a provenance in the world of Urgent Operational Requirements – there is a tendency to forget that RPAS are most effective in an environment in which air supremacy is assured. Extending the RPAS capability from the military to the civil environment – in which the size of the market will be infinitely larger in the not-too-distant future – requires that attention be paid to a host of issues surrounding safety and public perception. “We absolutely have got to make RPAS acceptable ,” said Round. The issue is one of the Agency’s Pioneer Projects, and aims at harnessing synergies in both military and civil domains, maximising dual-use technologies and overcoming the limitations of greater RPAS-use imposed by the lack of a harmonised framework allowing them to operate in civil airspace. Some of the problems associated with overcoming these limitations centre on the regulatory and certification domains. In an important milestone, the MIDCAS (Midair Collision Avoidance System) project showed the capability of RPAS to operate safely beyond line of sight in a flight test in April 2013. “MIDCAS showed we are progressing towards ‘sense and avoid ;’ we have flown the airplane – it’s not pie in the sky,” said Round. He said “it has taken a long time – and great expense – to get to this stage but we have now reached the stepping-off point for the next generation: we’ve done it once, now we need to stop talking, and deliver a usable capability.” he said. The DeSIRE programme (Demonstration of Satellites enabling the insertion of RPAS in Europe) has been a joint EDA/European Space Agency (ESA) initiative since 2010 and in spring 2013 achieved a significant progress during flight tests in Spain. Building on the capabilities the programme demonstrated, a joint investment programme, which was launched in 2012, will focus attention on solving the individual components of the issue – including sense and avoid, air traffic management interfaces and decision architecture - from this year. “There is cooperation in a host of disciplines – technological, training and maintenance among them” , said Round. Most importantly we now have a Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) community of users established through which we will continue work to move from our current Common Staff Requirement towards a Common Staff Target to define the next generation of RPAS for Europe.  “This is a very exciting development and clearly demonstrates the support within Europe for this type of Capability” said Round.  A similar approach is being applied to the EDA’s work in the cyber domain, where the Agency provides “the defence element of a cross-Brussels cyber effort,” said Round. It is a domain that is sensitive, relatively new and not yet fully understood, though there have been no end of discussions trying to scope and size the credibility of the threat and therefore the appropriate nature of the response. “There is a lot of knowledge already in place, so the questions becomes where can we add value,” said Round. The issue in cyber seems to revolve more around people than technology. Some observers estimate there is a requirement for fully trained cyber specialists is a hundred times the number in existence. This may seem like a scaremongering statistic  – but it is difficult to refute given current knowledge available in the public domain. As a result of the recognition of this and the picture revealed by the Agency stocktaking study, an unclassified version of which was presented in May last year, it is readily apparent that while there are strengths across Europe in leadership, personnel and interoperability work has to be done on doctrine, organisation and training. So the EDA has conducted  a detailed Training Needs Analysis and currently works on building a comprehensive cyber defence curriculum. It is working closely with the US-led Multinational Capability Development Campaign to develop cyber defence operational planning and deploy situational awareness toolkits at headquarters level, thereby integrating consideration of cyber tasks into daily routines in missions and operations. It is working to promote its recently established Cyber Defence Research Agenda, the end result of which will be an R&T roadmap stretching out for the next ten years. It has already launched a project addressing the requirements for timely detection of advanced persistent threats – an area in which industrial espionage is as great a threat as military security. It has begun consultations under the umbrella of European Framework Cooperation to determine how to exploit the wealth of academic expertise in cryptology and information protection, turning it into practical solutions for timely implementation. “We have done a lot of work in quite a short period and are confident we are heading towards early implementation of some effective solutions for Member States’ requirements in this critical domain,” said Round. In terms of satellite communications (satcom) Round said this is “the ultimate Pooling & Sharing example.” The requirements for governmental satcom are very different in peacetime than in a period of crisis which, coupled with the high levels of capital expenditure involved in launching and maintaining satellites, means the incidence of capability is limited to a few nations – and even in those cases, despite the fact that satellites are ‘living longer,’ these capabilities will require replacement in the medium term future. “Space is not a military domain – the requirements for exploitation of this type of capability stretch right across government. There is a real opportunity here to share capability,” said Round. The establishment of the European Satellite Communication Procurement Cell has enabled Member States with or without such capability to supplement or procure capability on an ad hoc basis. The French military, for example, bought capability through the European Satellite Communication Procurement Cell (ESCPC) to support their operations in Mali at extremely short notice. Conclusions While these four work strands dominate EDA capability development activity at the moment, they are not the be all and end all of this genre of effort. “One of the effects of recession is the need to work together – not the aspiration, the need. The longer Member States are involved in working together, the greater the level of trust that develops and therefore the clearer and swifter the path to success. Which leads to the likelihood of continued cooperation,” said Round. “We have significant experience of collaborative projects – and we have real, concrete, demonstrable success stories.” More information European Defence Matters Issue 5 Air-to-Air Refuelling Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems Cyber Defence Governmental Satellite Communication 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/05/15/peter-round-european-council-prioritises-eda-capability-development-initiatives

EDA_NEWS_0704	2014-04-15	NEWS	EDA Steering Board: Progress on the Implementation of Council Conclusions	 At the EDA Steering Board of 15 April, the Agency updated Defence Ministers on the progress made in implementing the tasks set at December’s European Council. The main elements of the Agency’s report were on the four capability programmes, standardisation and certification, dual-use research, and the initial elements for a policy framework for long-term cooperation. Claude-France Arnould Chief Executive of the European Defency Agency commented, “this Steering Board has come only some four months after the European Council on Defence in December, which set a wide range of tasks for EDA. This meeting was an intermediate step, providing us with the first opportunity to update Defence Ministers collectively on the progress made before the first  deliverables are due to be presented in June 2014. It also gave us the opportunity to get their views on the initial proposals for the policy framework for long term cooperation.” The Four Key Capability Programmes The European Council in December gave EDA responsibility for four key capability programmes. Air-to-Air Refuelling (AAR) In AAR the EDA has taken a global approach, focusing on improving the refuelling capabilities in Europe in the short, medium, and long-term. Regarding the optimisation and pooling of existing assets, the first collective AAR clearance trial was successfully completed in Italy in September 2013 with a second one scheduled for September this year. The first multinational European Air-to-Air Refuelling Training (EART) was completed in Eindhoven in April 2014. Regarding longer term capabilities, work has progressed on the pooling of national requirements for new multi-role aircraft. A Request for Information was sent to industry in February on behalf of five participating countries -BE, ES, NL, PL and NO. A decision on the best-value option will be made by the end of 2014. Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) Work continues to support the development of RPAS capabilities in Europe and exploit possible civil-military synergies. EDA is developing the requirements and business cases for a Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) capability. During the Steering Board, France confirmed that it would take the lead within this work strand. This is being supported by the EDA’s other activities on air traffic insertion, airworthiness, and operational support. Governmental Satellite Communications (GOVSATCOM) The Common Staff Target is being prepared for submission to the Steering Board in autumn 2014, with a view to proposing a comprehensive programme by early 2016. During the Steering Board, Spain offered to take the lead on GOVSATCOM. Cyber Defence Activities are continuing in the area of Cyber Defence, including education, training, and technologies. Ad hoc projects are also under way for Cyber Ranges and deployable Cyber Defence kits for headquarters. Research The European Council tasked the EDA to further stimulate dual-use research. At the Steering Board, an initial roadmap with actions to stimulate synergies between civil and military research was presented. EDA is conducting this work in close cooperation with the European Commission in support of Member States. Standardisation and Certification EDA is active in the field of military airworthiness with an initial set of European Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) already published. Building on this experience, EDA is exploring the potential benefits of a harmonised approach to certification in other areas with Member States and the Commission. Work is on track for developing a roadmap for future hybrid and defence standards by mid-2014 in cooperation with the Commission. Long term cooperation The European Council Conclusions asked for a policy framework on long-term cooperation by the end of 2014. The objectives are to provide a coherent basis for defence cooperation in Europe, with appropriate mechanisms to support policy-review. Defence Ministers discussed the initial elements of this framework at the Steering Board.

EDA_NEWS_0706	2014-04-09	NEWS	Team Focused on Military Implementation of Single European Sky Launched in EDA	 A new cell focusing on the military implementation of SESAR - the European air traffic control modernisation programme – has been established within the EDA. The Single European Sky (SES) aims at realising the optimisation of the airspace organisation and management in Europe through a combination of technological, economic, and regulatory efforts. SESAR (Single European Sky ATM Research) is the technical pillar of this. SESAR involves developing a new ATM system to handle more traffic with greater safety and at a lower cost. Its new technologies and procedures will also seek to reduce the environmental impact of flying. Although SES regulations primarily apply to civil aviation, military could be affected whenever flying out of dedicated and restricted airspaces.   EDA’s responsibilities in SESAR deployment The SESAR programme is now reaching its deployment phase and EDA has various responsibilities regarding the military implications of the project. Since 2010, EDA has been tasked to support participating Member States in the identification of the military operational and financial risks expected with the implementation of SESAR. It has now been assigned a specific role to coordinate military views (CIR 409/2013) - by gathering input and requirements from Ministries of Defence (MODs).  EDA could also enable MODs to access EU funds for collaborative projects. How the new team operates The new team called the SESAR Cell will provide in-house expertise and will coordinate with MODs to ensure that the military views and requirements are taken into account in the implementation of SESAR. The EDA will also work closely with the European Commission, the SESAR Joint Undertaking (responsible for SESAR Development), NATO and EUROCONTROL.  A Management Committee - comprised of representatives from the 22 participating Member States will monitor the progress of the cell.

EDA_NEWS_0708	2014-03-31	NEWS	Launch of First European Air-to-Air Refuelling Exercise Today	 The first ever European Air-to-Air Refuelling Training (EART14) taking place at the Eindhoven Air Base in the Netherlands starts today. Between 31 March and 11 April aircraft and crews from Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands will participate in realistic Air-to-Air Refuelling training scenarios within a modern air combat environment.  EART14 offers participants a unique opportunity to plan and execute missions within a multinational framework. The exercise has been developed by the European Defence Agency (EDA) in close cooperation with the European Air Transport Command (EATC) and the Dutch armed forces. Critical force enabler As most transport and fighter aircraft are not able to cover intercontinental distances in just one sortie, Air-to-Air Refuelling (AAR) is a critical force enabler and is a requirement for sustained air combat operations. Despite the importance of AAR, European armed forces have suffered from both a lack of equipment and a lack of interoperability in this field. This has led EU countries to rely heavily on US assets in past operations.  In 2011, Defence Ministers tasked the EDA to propose measures to mitigate the capability gap in European military AAR-matters. The EDA has since developed and implemented a global approach to tackling the shortfall of AAR capabilities, which involves increasing the overall AAR capacity, reducing fragmentation of the fleet, and optimising the use of assets. This approach was endorsed by the European Council in December 2014, where Heads of State and Government approved the Agency’s roadmap on AAR. Dedicated AAR scenarios Eindhoven Air Base will be used as Tanker Forward Operating Base (FOB) during the exercise period. The exercise will be done in cooperation with the Dutch Frisian Flag 2014 to provide crews with the opportunity to take part in dedicated AAR scenarios embedded in a highly recognised fighter exercise. EART14 will be developed gradually with exercises becoming increasingly complex in nature over the two weeks, starting from single ship missions and evolving to become part of COMAO missions within Frisian Flag. Background The EDA has a comprehensive plan to improve the AAR capabilities in Europe. Mandated by Defence Ministers, EDA is engaged in four work strands in this domain: short-term gap filling; optimisation of existing assets; optimisation of AAR capacity offered by the future A400M fleet and enhancement of Europe’s strategic tanker capability by creating a multinational Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) capability.  As part of this global approach, the EDA, Italy and the Movement Coordination Centre Europe (MCCE) jointly organised the first collective European Air-to-Air Refuelling (AAR) clearance trial on the Italian KC767 in September 2013. This enhanced AAR capabilities, as technical and operational clearances are mandatory to provide or receive fuel and they are thus a prerequisite to interoperability in multinational operations. Aircraft from France and Sweden participated in the campaign to obtain technical and operational AAR clearances against the Italian strategic airlift tanker.  More information A media day will take place on 3 April 2014, more information is available here  EART14 factsheet available here Pictures of EART2014 are available on Flickr  First Collective Air-to-Air Refuelling Clearance Trial European Council Conclusions Air-to-Air Refuelling Factsheet EATC web page on EART14 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/03/31/launch-of-first-european-air-to-air-refuelling-exercise-today
EDA_NEWS_0709	2014-04-10	NEWS	European Air-to-Air Refuelling Training Delivers First Results	 A Distinguished Visitors (DV) Day is held as part of the first European Air-to-Air Refuelling training (EART14) at Eindhoven Air Base on 10 April 2014. The day brings together high-level military figures to witness and learn about the ongoing training. EART14 runs from 31 March to 11 April, with German and Dutch aircraft and crews present for the entire period and Italy joining for the second week. The training was developed by the European Defence Agency (EDA) in close cooperation with the European Air Transport Command (EATC) and Dutch armed forces. It runs alongside the highly recognised Dutch fighter exercise Frisian Flag, to provide crews with the opportunity to take part in dedicated Air-to-Air (AAR) scenarios embedded in realistic combat situations.   Experiences so far In the first week the Dutch KDC-10 and German A-310 flew 15 sorties  between them, off-loading more than 135,000 Kilos of fuel. The training has allowed tanker and logistic crews to enhance their skills in realistic AAR scenarios, helping ensure that crews remain proficient in areas outside of their daily AAR tasks. Crews have built up knowledge of the characteristics of aircraft used by other EU countries, while flying sorties in the morning and afternoon has allowed them to practice their quick turnaround procedures.   Multinational cooperation Speaking about the training, Giampaolo Lillo, EDA Director for Cooperation Planning & Support, commented “this first European Air-to-Air Refuelling training is a prime example of how Europe can optimise the use of its existing assets through multinational cooperation. The EDA has a role to play as an enabler, however the success of the training is thanks to the Netherlands as host nation, EATC, and the participating Member States.”   Background The EDA has a comprehensive plan to improve the AAR capabilities in Europe.

EDA_NEWS_0710	2014-04-08	NEWS	Digital Forensics Pilot Course at EDA	 From 31 March to 5 April 2014 EDA organised together with the SANS Institute a six days pilot course for digital forensics as part of the EDA Cyber Defence Programme to strengthen EU’s Cyber Defence capabilities for CSDP operations. Students from 14 EDA Member States and EDA took part in the course. On the details of the course and the course delivery one student says: “This was a mind blowing exercise. All the challenges and technical details were covered to a very deep extent.” The course provided the students with the foundational competencies and skills to enable them to pass the exam for the widely recognised certification as GIAC (Global Information Assurance Certification) Certified Forensic Examiner (GCFE) in the weeks to come. The course instructor, Mr. Chad Tilbury from SANS Institute says:  “As a former military and long-time cyber-defence practitioner, teaching a digital forensics class for the European Defence Agency was an honour.  Students from EU member countries conducted in-depth analysis and media exploitation of multiple systems.  Attendees conducted data triage and learned to extract forensic meaning from computer memory, files system and operating system artifacts, the Windows registry, email, removable devices, chat clients, web browsers, and event logs.  During the final day, students divided into teams and competed in a realistic forensic challenge requiring thousands of artifacts to be recovered, authenticated, and analysed.  From the results presented at the end of the forensic challenge, I am confident that this team can take their new skills home and immediately put them to use in real world operations.” This course is the starting point for a new EDA initiative to pool the demand of EDA Member States for such specialist training that should lead to certifications. Pooling the demand will allow Member States to benefit from economies of scale”.  The EDA Progamme Manager Cyber Defence, Mr. Wolfgang Roehrig  says: “In a lot of areas of cyber defence specialist training the military will continue to rely on private sector training capacities and expertise.  Therefore EDA is looking for ways for streamlining military training requirements in these fields. The starting point for further exploration was this on-site pilot course at EDA premises for data collection in an area of Cyber Defence expertise, in which the military most probably will continue to rely on industry-expertise, such as Digital Forensics. Digital Forensics training is a highly specialised field, in which, even putting the requirements of all EDA Member States together, relative small numbers of military students per year can be expected. Trainers in that field require special hands-on expertise that has to follow latest trends in attack techniques and technology - mere theoretical knowledge would not bring much benefit. Building-up and maintaining such trainer expertise within the military even at a European level is expected to be difficult and would be very expensive.” The initiative will be launched within the EDA framework after the final course evaluation.

EDA_NEWS_0713	2014-03-28	NEWS	European Defence Matters: Free Debate on Role of EDA	" Can the EDA make a difference and if so, how to convince European leaders to use it to the full? - was the subject of the third round-table discussion. Graham Muir, Head of Strategy and Policy at the EDA, reflected on some of the successes in the Agency’s ten year history, such as AAR, helicopter crew training and maritime surveillance, reminding the audience also of the achievements made in support for industry – particularly SMEs – and security of supply.  “But there is scope to do so much more,” he said, introducing the first panel of the afternoon. General Vincenzo Camporini, former Chief of Defence in Italy and now Vice President of the Istituto Affari Internazionali, addressed the question as to how better to use EDA from the perspective of a marketplace that is crowded with initiatives and said that the EDA has the luxury, perhaps, of choosing the role it can play. He underlined the need to involve EDA from the outset of preparing future projects. Professor Sven Biscop from the Belgian Royal Institute for International Relations drew the analogy of European defence as an apartment building, in which the Member States could each afford their own apartment, but the question then became – who should be the architect? Proposing EDA’s role be considered as the architect in this case, he went on to say that “after completion and when we all move in – then the EDA becomes the building manager.” Professor Anand Menon from King’s College Department of War Studies in the UK felt that the answer to the question how to generate additional success “is to engage the Member States, not Europe. We have not yet arrived at a Single European Market moment in defence.” Before we get to that point, he felt, we would have to achieve three things. Member States first needed to see defence as an element of socio-economic policy rather than the preservation of wider interests. Secondly, national defence is not enough and that no nation can ‘go on its own.’ Finally there is a need to persuade everybody involved that the EU is the best available institution for [the management of] collective defence. With the EDA to play a central role. Graham Muir concluded that EDA was not a procurement agency but had the flexibility to bring together Member States with similar requirements in an à la carte approach. He recalled that there was provision in the Treaties for the European Commission to participate in and financially contribute to EDA activities.  More information News ""European Defence Matters: Speech by Dimitris Avramopoulos"" (28 Mar 2014) News ""European Defence Matters: Keynote Speech by Catherine Ashton"" (27 Mar 2014) News ""European Defence Matters: Speech by Pieter de Crem"" (27 Mar 2014) News ""European Defence Matters: Securing the Future Through Research and Innovation"" (27 Mar 2014) News ""European Defence Matters: How to Move Defence Cooperation Further and Faster"" (27 Mar 2014) News ""European Defence Matters: Turning Political will into Practical Implementation"" (27 Mar 2014) News ""Debating European Cooperation on Defence Capabilities"" (27 Mar 2014) News ""EDA Annual Conference Update: Roundtables on Capabilities & Defence Industry"" (11 Mar 2014) News ""EDA Annual Conference: European Defence Matters"" (3 Feb 2014) Pictures of the Annual Conference are available on Flickr EDA Annual Conference webpage "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/03/28/european-defence-matters-free-debate-on-role-of-eda

EDA_NEWS_0715	2014-03-27	NEWS	European Defence Matters: Securing the Future Through Research and Innovation	" While the first roundtable of the EDA’s annual conference ""European Defence Matters"" had focused primarily on capabilities, this time research, innovation, and industry took centre stage. Bernhard Gerwert, CEO Airbus Defence & Space called on European policy makers to decide what their ambitions are. He said, ""we do not need special incentives, we just need programmes… Research and development is only worthwhile if we have the ambition to build the next generation of products. If we don’t have that ambition then it makes no sense to spend the money."" Michael Gahler, Member of the European Parliament and its Committee on Foreign Affairs & Subcommittee on Security and Defence agreed about the need to have a clear idea of what Europe wanted to achieve. He went further and called for a European defence review, to assess the situation at the moment, and to reverse the trend of industry and expertise leaving Europe.  He also argued strongly that that the artificial divide between civil and military research needs to be scrapped. He said ""We must make use of any funds that are available."" This was reiterated by Claudia Gärtner, CEO, Microfluidic ChipShop. She pointed out that for most new innovations, whether they had military or civil applications, the technology underpinning it was the same. Jenny Body, President of the Royal Aeronautical Society was particularly concerned by the long term effects that current budget cuts for research and development would have. ""We have to ensure that we do not lose the expertise. Remember the engineers who will build the next generation of civilian aircraft are probably only aged 3-4 today,"" she said. ""We already face a shortfall of engineers now, if you don’t invest in research you will lose not only the technologies but the people capable of developing them in the future.""

EDA_NEWS_0716	2014-03-24	NEWS	Pilot Exercise for Strategic Decision Making in Cyber Defence	 A pilot Decision-Making Exercise on Cyberspace Crisis Management will take place in Lisbon in May 2014.  The pilot exercise aims to prepare strategic leaders for situations involving  a major cyber-attack. With an increasing amount of critical infrastructure - as well as military and government activities - now online the threat of cyber-attacks is growing every day. For this reason, at the European Council meeting in December 2013, Cyber was recognised as one of four key capabilities for future EDA activity. The pilot exercise in Lisbon aims to prepare strategic leaders with the experience and structures necessary to deal with a cyberspace crisis. The exercise will help increase awareness and contribute to a better understanding of emerging cyberspace challenges and threats.     Used to develop further training courses One of the aims of the pilot is to help to develop a coherent conceptual toolkit that could be used in assessing current and future decision-making frameworks and could be used in future training plans. This could include the development of a repository of ‘off-the-shelf’ training courses, exercises, and scenarios that Member States could use in the future.   EU Cyber Security Strategy The pilot was developed under the EU Cyber Security Strategy which identified the improvement of leadership, training, and exercises as a key activity for cyber security efforts in the EU. This was reinforced by the results of an EDA study in 2012 that found shortcomings in Cyber Security training and exercises of all 20 Member States who took part. The European Council in December called for the EDA to develop a roadmap for cyber defence as well as concrete projects focused on training and exercises, improving civil/military cooperation, and the protection of assets in EU missions and operation.

She called on those present in the room to seize the opportunity and ensure that the implementation was there to follow the political will. She finished by calling on all participants to make the most of the conference as a unique opportunity where stakeholders from throughout the European Defence Community can meet and debate. Cohesion, stability, and growth The first keynote speech was delivered by Greek Minister of Defence Dimitris Avramopoulos, representing the current EU Presidency. He spoke of the importance of defence as a critical pillar for European cohesion, stability, and growth. He went on to talk about the danger of a growing arc of instability on Europe’s borders, stretching from North Africa through to Ukraine, and the need for enhanced cooperation to tackle common threats to Europe’s stability. He concluded calling for an enhanced role for the EDA to put defence more permanently on the European agenda. Technological developments Representing the upcoming Presidency of the EU, Italian Under Secretary of Defence General Domenico Rossi warned of the threats to industry and technological innovation from budget cuts. He argued that the developments of the past might not be possible with smaller defence budgets across Europe. He reinforced the importance of the EU Council in December, saying that although we may differ on ideas, when it comes to CSDP we are often on the same page.

EDA_NEWS_0719	2014-03-27	NEWS	European Defence Matters: How to Move Defence Cooperation Further and Faster	" European defence capabilities: pool it or lose it – the first round-table discussion of the EDA 2014 annual conference – brought together a wide range of ""bottom-up"" and ""top-down"" perspectives of the challenges of moving the process forward in Europe. ""The alternative to Pooling & Sharing is not that every country still gets to keep their own capabilities,"" said Ine Eriksen Søreide, Norway’s Minister of Defence. The Nordic defence cooperation (NORDEFCO) system works, she said, because cooperation is based on practicalities and a shared strategic view. ""NORDEFCO does not have a telephone number."" ""My fear is that we risk an uncoordinated approach between countries,"" she said, ""and the foundation to successful cooperation is trust. The difference in planning cycles for countries can be a major obstacle."" She added that it takes between 15 and 20 years to plan, specify and take delivery of a submarine, one of the most costly of all military capabilities. The best way to move the process forward is to identify best cases and focus on capability shortfalls. There are a number of drivers behind the process, according to General Patrick de Rousiers, Chairman of the EU Military Committee. The ability to create a capability collectively which would not be possible singly is a primary driver – so a single ship may conduct anti-piracy operations under a national flag but training and maintenance back at base is conducted collectively. Improving efficiency was the driver behind the formation of the European Air Transport Command (EATC)where 150 tactical and strategic air lift aircraft from five nations now work together. And then there are the political and industrial motivations not just to produce a single platform but to ensure it to support it for 20 or 30 years. ""Pooling is the way of the future,"" said General Sverker Göranson, Chief of Defence, Sweden. ""I’m not convinced nations will necessarily lose capabilities otherwise but they could be degraded."" Experience has shown that a good way to start is with just two nations and then grow from that. Tim Rowntree, Director of OCCAR, spoke of the need to build confidence now that the process can and will work. ""We need to learn to look objectively at what we have achieved,"" he said. Nations risk losing sovereign capabilities if their requirements remain diverse. ""We do need to plan further ahead, to align requirements between nations… Platforms such as the A400M have shown that our industry can rise to the occasion and deliver world beating solutions."" Numbers can be a powerful persuader – if you can show how much can be saved through cooperation then this can be presented to policy makers and they then can be challenged to say ""no"", he said. And cooperation is not just an issue of long term, large scale capability developments – around 90% of urgent operational requirements have been delivered through international cooperation because many of these could not be delivered through national budgets. But the changed mind-set required has not yet fully happened, said Alexander Vershbow, NATO Deputy Secretary General. Nations still show a reluctance to lose jobs or compromise on requirements. But there are positive changes, such as the emergence of the framework nation concept, where some full spectrum capability nations team with smaller nations to agree areas of specialisation and prove full capabilities between them, ""so both can get more bang for the buck,"" he said. NATO has developed a successful strategic airlift command where C-17s are operated on a time share basis."" To move defence cooperation further you will have to create incentives.

The system is being used in training for the first time at the EU Personnel Recovery Controller and Planner Course (PRCPC) in Karlsborg, Sweden this month. The PR FAS Demonstrator is a combination of software and a server designed specifically for use in situations involving Personnel Recovery. The device is rugged and portable and works on a ‘plug and play’ basis, so it can be used by just connecting it to a laptop or can be integrated into the command and control (C2) system of the force using it. Work on the project will continue - focusing on integrating the PR FAS into national C2 systems and further incremental development and improvement. The device is therefore available to participating Member States for further testing and development and the results of the original work have already been disseminated for national evaluation. The project is part of the EDA’s role in improving the capability and interoperability of the European Armed Forces in Personnel Recovery. This involves not only the development of new systems but also improving training and coordination.  Personnel Recovery is aimed at mitigating and reacting to the risk of isolation, capture, and exploitation of military or civilian personnel during a Crisis Management Operation (CMO).	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/03/11/new-system-to-help-with-personnel-recovery-missions-is-gaining-maturity

EDA_NEWS_0725	2014-03-14	NEWS	Outcome Materiel Standardisation Conference	 On 12 March 2014 defence standardisation stakeholders gathered at the European Defence Agency for an expert materiel standardisation conference. The main objective of the conference was to discuss the development of defence standards. The conference added a substantial contribution to the preparation of a roadmap for the development of defence standards as tasked by the European Council in December 2013. Speakers from EDA, the European Commission, all three European Standardisation Organisations including the chairman of the Stakeholder Forum for Defence Procurement Standardisation (SFDPS), NATO, ASD-STAN, EUROCAE and UK DSTAN with BSI contributed with their high level of expertise on the subject. It was underlined that the Member States will assess the need for standard development through the EDA Materiel Standardisation Group (MSG) at an early stage after the identification of potential materiel standardisation gaps. Furthermore the MSG will play an important role to coordinate security and defence standardisation activities with the European Commission to avoid any duplication of standardisation efforts. There was also consensus that the European Standardisation Organisations will play a coordinating role in harmonising the standardisation landscape. EDA will prepare through the MSG and together with the stakeholders of the SFDPS a more detailed roadmap for the development of defence standards based on the outcomes of this conference.

EDA_NEWS_0727	2014-02-06	NEWS	EDA And ESA Sign DeSIRE II Project Arrangement	 Through their 2011 Administrative Arrangement and active policy and programmatic coordination, the European Defence Agency (EDA) and European Space Agency (ESA), have today agreed to pursue their cooperation in the domain of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) with the signature of the DeSIRE II Project Arrangement. This cooperation is the result of the successful DeSIRE I project carried out in 2012 and 2013, through which EDA and ESA demonstrated the use of satellites enabling the insertion of RPAS in Europe. This project effectively demonstrated that RPAS complemented by satellites can be safely inserted in non-segregated airspace and thus fulfil user needs in maritime surveillance services. Following respective approval processes, EDA’s Chief Executive Claude-France Arnould and Magali Vaissiere, ESA Director of Telecommunications and Integrated Applications, have today concluded the signature of the next step of this cooperation. DeSIRE II will demonstrate that services, such as environment and maritime surveillance applications, can be rendered with RPAS flying beyond radio line of sight through the use of safe and secure satellite-based command and control data links.  This demonstration project will also seek to illustrate the benefits of the integration of space assets, such as communication satellites, navigation satellites and Earth observation satellites, with terrestrial infrastructure for enabling new services. It will further tackle the implementation of an initial set of elements for air traffic management and related safety issues in order to support the evolution of air traffic insertion regulations and standards. DeSIRE II is expected to be a bridging phase towards more cooperation between ESA and EDA on RPAS applications and capability developments.

EDA_NEWS_0729	2014-02-05	NEWS	Progress for European Satellite Communication Procurement Cell (ESCPC)	" Since the signature of a framework contract between EDA and Astrium Services in September 2012, ESCPC, the Agency’s initiative for the pooled procurement of commercial satellite communication services, has proven its operational and financial value by delivering concrete support to Member States. In 2013 the ESCPC scheme facilitated orders of more than €1 million. Three additional contributing Member States (Belgium, Finland and Luxembourg) have joined the five ESCPC founding nations (France, Italy, Poland, Romania and the United Kingdom) while others declared their interest in the pay-per-use scheme. In military operations satellite communications are fundamental for Communication, Command and Control. They also allow operational effectiveness of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance platforms, including Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems. Member States often resort to commercial satellite communications either to complement similar military capabilities or as the sole means to effectively conduct military operations. The EDA ESCPC pools commercial satellite communication demand from a number of European defence departments, reducing costs by up to 20 per cent. Astrium Services serves as the contractual, commercial and operational interface allowing for a flexible “pay per use” access to satellite communications with very little administrative burden for Member States.   More information: News ""EDA facilitates access to commercial SatCom services for Member States"" (28 September 2012) Factsheet ""Governmental Satellite Communications""  "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/02/05/progress-for-european-satellite-communication-procurement-cell-(escpc)
EDA_NEWS_0730	2014-02-04	NEWS	EDA Multinational Exercises in 2014	 Multinational training exercises increase interoperability among participating Member States; they are an efficient way to prepare armed forces for CSDP operations. This year, the European Defence Agency is organising in close cooperation with the respective host nations, contributing Member States and Air Transport Organisations four training exercises in the areas of Air-to-Air Refuelling, transport aircraft and helicopters. First European Air Refuelling Training While the fighter community has trained to operate together for years, the same cannot be said for Air-to-Air Refuelling. From 31 March to 11 April 2014, EDA together with the European Air Transport Command and the Netherlands are organising the first multinational Air-to-Air Refuelling (AAR) training opportunity in support of the Dutch Frisian Flag exercise. To this date, the Netherlands (KDC-10), Germany (A310) and Italy (KC-767) have confirmed to send their tankers to the flying event which will be an excellent opportunity to train dedicated AAR scenarios embedded in a highly recognised fighter exercise. The Air-to-Air Refuelling  planning cell will be split between Eindhoven and Leeuwarden air base to foster overall air refuelling planning and tanker operations. Third European Air Transport Training Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Norway will participate in the third edition of EDA’s European Air Transport Training flying event with ten transport aircraft of four different types; Greece will  support the training with fighters and AWACS. Taking place from 16 to 27 June 2014 at the International Airport in Plovdiv in Bulgaria, the training offers participants a unique opportunity to plan and execute missions within a multinational framework and achieve flexible training objectives. The crews will be trained in a variety of airlift disciplines. The aim is to increase interoperability, to consolidate existing qualifications or to regain them in a short period of time and with dedicated assets.   European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course The new European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course (EAATTC) aims at achieving a higher level of interoperability between airlift crews from different nations; at increasing harmonisation of advanced tactical training that will lead to higher effectiveness and survivability in operations; at sharing knowledge and providing cost efficient airlift training in Europe. Based on an agreed syllabus Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Norway will participate in the first course with eight aircraft of five different types. The flying event will be hosted by Spain at Zaragoza airbase from 22 September to 03 October 2014. This permanent training event is developed in close cooperation with the European Air Transport Command and EDA Member States; it is similar in set-up to the advanced airlift tactics training course that has been offered in the US since 1987.   Hot Blade 2014 Between 16 and 30 July, the Ovar Air Base in northern Portugal will host the third sequel of the successful series of Hot Blade exercises, powered by the Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP). Currently, some 30 helicopters, four fast jets, three transport aircraft and one Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance platform have been committed by Austria, Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden and United Kingdom. Additional to Portuguese ground forces, 450 ground troops from the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom are scheduled to participate as well allowing for a more integrated mission planning and execution. So far, roughly 50% of participant to one of the previous helicopter exercises organised in France, Spain, Italy, Portugal and Belgium have later been deployed to operations.  More information: EDA Helicopter Initiatives – project page Pictures of Hot Blade 2013 are available here  Read more about the European Air Transport Fleet  View the EATT13 Factsheet Pictures from EATT13 are published on Flickr.  Videos from previous exercises are available on YouTube. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/02/04/eda-multinational-exercises-in-2014

EDA_NEWS_0732	2013-12-20	NEWS	Statement by Claude-France Arnould following the Council Conclusions on CSDP	" ""Heads of State and Government yesterday highlighted the importance of an effective Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) for the security of European citizens, peace and stability in our neighbourhood as well as in the broader world. They have also underlined that Europe needs strong military capabilities and a healthy, innovative and competitive European Defence Technological and Industrial Base. The taskings by Heads of State and Government stemming from the EU Summit for the European Defence Agency are substantive. In terms of capability development, we will push forward four key programmes: Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), Air-to-Air Refuelling, Satellite Communications and Cyber. The Council supports a more systematic and long-term approach to cooperation through increased transparency and information-sharing in defence planning. In this context, we will continue to assess progress on the implementation of the Agency’s Code of Conduct on Pooling & Sharing and propose an appropriate policy framework by the end of 2014, as mandated by the European Council. Within the same timeframe the Agency will also propose ways in which Member States can cooperate more effectively and efficiently in pooled procurement projects. As regards the strengthening of Europe’s defence industry, EDA will closely work together with the European Commission to develop proposals to stimulate further dual use research, to develop defence industrial standards and a roadmap for a comprehensive EU-wide Security of Supply regime. This year was marked by intensive preparations for this EU Summit, which gave a fresh boost to European defence matters. It is especially important that this new dynamic in defence and security is maintained and developed. EDA will strive to ensure that further concrete and substantive deliverables are achieved when the European Council next assesses progress in June 2015.""  More information: News ""The Time is Now"" (17 Dec 2013) News ""Background Information EU Council"" (16 Dec 2013) News ""Defence Ministers Commit to Capability Programmes"" (19 Nov 2013) Factsheet on Air-to-Air Refuelling Factsheet on Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems Factsheet on Governmental Satellite Communciations Factsheet on Cyber Defence Factsheet on Support to Industry Video European External Action Service ""CSDP in Action""  European Council dedicated Summit webpage "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/12/20/statement-by-claude-france-arnould-following-the-council-conclusions-on-csdp
EDA_NEWS_0733	2014-01-24	NEWS	Exercise “Hot Blade 14” in Extensive Preparation	 During the second half of July 2014, the Ovar Air Base in northern Portugal will host the third sequel of the successful series of Hot Blade exercises, powered by the Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP). The Main Planning Conference (15-17 January in Ovar) proved an increased interest in participation in Hot Blade 14 by the HEP member states.  A total of 30 helicopters, four fast jets, three transport aircraft and one Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance platform have been committed by Austria, Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden and United Kingdom. Moreover, beside the participation of Portuguese ground forces, which have supported the  last two Hot Blade exercises, Netherlands, Germany and United Kingdom are intending to send more than 450 troops to be part of the joint missions. Due to such a high number of ground troops participating, an integrated mission planning process will be introduced for the first time to enable seamless coordination and integration of the ground forces into the individual scenarios for the benefit of common exercise success. As in the last year, the crews will be supervised and supported by the experienced mentors – instructors/graduates from the European Helicopter Tactics Instructor Course, which will be executed in March and May this year for the second time. In total the several hundred sorties and almost 1000 flying hours planned, promise a continuation of the unique multinational helicopter training opportunity provided by the Helicopter Exercise Programme.   More information: EDA Helicopter Initiatives – project page 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/01/24/exercise-hot-blade-14-in-extensive-preparation

EDA_NEWS_0735	2014-01-31	NEWS	Council Conclusions Implementation: Way Forward	" The European Council of December 2013 has provided clear taskings for the European Defence Agency. Their implementation in the areas of capability development, support to industry and enhanced defence cooperation will be the Agency’s top priority for 2014.  Capability development The endorsement of four proposed capability programmes on Air-to-Air Refuelling, Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), Governmental Satellite Communications and Cyber Defence is an important boost for European defence cooperation. The programmes will contribute to filling critical capability gaps identified during recent operations; and they should deliver – through cooperation – high-tech capabilities that no Member State can afford on its own. The associated roadmaps provide clear instructions on time schedules for each of the programmes.   Support to industry Heads of State and Government made clear that a strong European defence needs to be underpinned by a healthy defence industry. What industry needs above all is concrete programmes and the timely implementation of the four capability programmes will be of direct benefit for them.  EDA will increase its cooperation with the European Commission in order to maximise access for Member States to existing EU instruments particularly in the field of dual-use research. The Council acknowledged the importance of SMEs for the defence supply chain, as a source of innovation and a key enabler for competitiveness; by implementing its Action Plan on SMEs, EDA actively supports defence SMEs in their interactions with the European Commission and its existing instruments, improves information sharing about business opportunities, and enhances defence SME market conditions.  EDA’s enhanced Framework Arrangement on Security of Supply is an important tool for the development of long-term planning and cooperation, and for the functioning of the internal market for defence. EDA will use the experience gained in supporting Member States and industry in improving cross-border cooperation, associated measures and tools to assist the European Commission in developing a roadmap for a comprehensive EU-wide Security of Supply regime.    Standardisation and certification The European Council has also asked for standards and certification procedures for defence equipment to reduce costs, harmonise demand and enhance interoperability. EDA and the Commission are tasked to prepare a roadmap for the development of defence industrial standards by mid-2014. A first conference to help preparing this roadmap is organised by the Agency in mid-March. Building on the work of EDA’s Military Airworthiness Forum which has already produced a series of harmonised military airworthiness requirements, the Agency – together with the Commission and Member States – will develop options for lowering the costs of military certification, including by increasing mutual recognition between EU Member States.    Long-term cooperation The European Council made a clear case for increased defence cooperation and welcomed the progress achieved by the Agency’s Code of Conduct on Pooling & Sharing. Heads of State and Government asked for a policy framework to foster more systematic and long term cooperation by the end of 2014. At the same time, the positive example of the European Air Transport Command was highlighted and the Agency will study in which areas this model could be replicated. Finally, financial incentives for cooperation such as non-market distorting fiscal measures as well as ways to more effectively and efficiently cooperate in pooled procurement projects will be further developed.  More information Statement by Claude-France Arnould following the Council Conclusions on CSDP (20 December 2014) News ""The Time is Now"" (17 Dec 2013) News ""Background Information EU Council"" (16 Dec 2013) News ""Defence Ministers Commit to Capability Programmes"" (19 Nov 2013) Factsheet on Air-to-Air Refuelling Factsheet on Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems Factsheet on Governmental Satellite Communciations Factsheet on Cyber Defence Factsheet on Support to Industry Video European External Action Service ""CSDP in Action""  European Council dedicated Summit webpage "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/01/31/council-conclusions-implementation-way-forward
EDA_NEWS_0736	2013-12-17	NEWS	The Time is Now	" In order to be a credible security provider and to protect its interests, the EU requires the full suite of tools: diplomatic, economic, development, and of course military. But as recent operations have demonstrated, Europeans are still faced with critical gaps in military capabilities. There is, moreover, fragmentation of demand and supply. Investment in the technologies that will be needed to field the systems of tomorrow is in decline. And because of the rising costs of major defence systems, coupled with the on-going squeeze on defence budgets, no single Member State is able alone to have the full inventory of capabilities. The choice is simple: cooperate to acquire and maintain capabilities, or risk losing them altogether. The issues are political. What defence needs is a political boost. That’s why the discussion by EU Heads of States and Government at the European Council this December is so important. For it is they, and they alone, who can arbitrate in favour of defence.  Cooperation in defence is not new and the European Defence Agency has been created to facilitate it more systematically. We launched many new joint projects in some vital capability areas such as air-to-air refuelling, counter improvised explosive devices, satellite communications or medical field hospitals. None of these could have been realised by one Member State alone; and all of them are absolutely vital for operations.  Welcome though these projects are, a more systematic approach to cooperation or Pooling & Sharing is necessary, so that cooperation becomes second-nature; so that we avoid the mistakes of the past when, for example, over twenty variants of the same helicopter were produced; so that we extend cooperation beyond the acquisition phase into the whole life of the system; so that we improve interoperability; so that we get as much effect from our hard-pressed Euros.  Three outcomes from the European Council in December would be really significant. First, a commitment to major projects: air-to-air refuelling, Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS, or drones), satellite communications, and cyber defence. Not only are these capabilities a military necessity, our American partners have clearly expressed that they will not  go on providing most of the key enabling capabilities. Europeans must be able to act by themselves.  Second, investment in innovation and technology, including dual-use. Europe needs to stay independent when it comes to critical technologies. Europeans have already missed the first generation of RPAS. EDA has made concrete proposals for the next generation of European medium altitude, long endurance RPAS. We have also made suggestions on governmental satellite communications and cyber defence. All have significant civil and military applications. It is important to harness synergies, maximise dual-use technologies, generate economies of scale and extend the comprehensive approach into the area of capabilities development.  And third, support to industry, in particular Small and Medium Enterprises, so many of which are at the cutting edge of technological innovation. Defence is vital. But it is not just about the immediate ability to project force based on a healthy defence and security industry which is an essential component of the industrial fabric of Europe that generates growth, innovation and jobs. It is probably unrealistic to expect defence budgets to increase in the near future. But we need EU Heads of State and Government to take defence to the next level. We have to move away from expensive fragmentation to cost-effective cooperation.  Claude-France Arnould, Chief Executive, European Defence Agency More information:  News ""Background Information EU Council"" (16 December 2013) News ""Defence Ministers Commit to Capability Programmes"" (19 Nov 2013) Factsheet on Air-to-Air Refuelling Factsheet on Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems Factsheet on Governmental Satellite Communciations Factsheet on Cyber Defence Factsheet on Support to Industry Video European External Action Service ""CSDP in Action""  European Council dedicated Summit webpage "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/12/17/the-time-is-now
EDA_NEWS_0737	2013-12-18	NEWS	EDA Assists Dual-Use Projects to Access Funding	" The European Defence Agency (EDA) together with the European Commission (EC) support industries and institutes active in dual-use research to access European Structural Funds (ESF), with special focus on SMEs. Recently, seven projects have been selected according to technical eligibility criteria and R&T priorities and assisted in the application process. EDA and EC coordinate their research efforts in the areas of defence and security. Moreover, exploiting existing EU supporting tools and funds for dual-use research projects is a means to promote innovation in the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) while retaining key technological and industrial capabilities in Europe.  EDA’s work on ESF analyses the potential of accessing ESF for dual-use R&T projects and to provide interested stakeholders with a methodology to do so. SMEs are the backbone of the European economy with more than 20 million SMEs in the EU representing 99% of business. European SMEs often develop dual-use goods or services in a wide range of industries: energy, telecom and ICT, automotive, material, chemical, aeronautics and space etc. Innovation in the supply chain depends massively on SMEs, which are a key enabler for future industrial competiveness. EDA consequently developed and currently implements an SME Action Plan with a menu of supporting measures including facilitating access to ESF.   “The main goal of EDA’s Action Plan on SMEs is to ensure that key technical and industrial priorities are developed and maintained in Europe. In a climate of budget constraints, we need to efficiently use existing EU instruments to harness synergies for civil-military research”, said Claude-France Arnould during a press briefing on 12 December. Daniel Calleja Crespo, Director-General of DG Enterprise and Industry at the European Commission added at the same occasion that cross-fertilisation between civil and defence was an increasingly important factor for the future of the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base. The European Commission thus encouraged and promoted civil-military synergies.  Awareness, project support & methodoloy The main objectives of EDA’s work on ESF are to raise awareness among Ministries of Defence and defence industry as regards the use of ESF and a series of dedicated workshops in different countries have been organised so far; to identify and support eligible pilot projects in R&T and industrial capabilities for the European Structural Funds; and to develop a methodology to be used by the Ministries of Defence to increase eligibility for future projects. In terms of concrete support to projects, twelve Member States submitted 72 project proposals for screening. While the Agency provided guidance and support to 44 projects, it selected seven pilot projects (from Bulgaria, Poland, Germany, Portugal, France, UK and Spain) which were actively assisted in the development of the application folders. Out of the selected projects, two applications have been successfully submitted by the project holders to the national managing authorities for co-funding, while the rest will be submitted during the current or the next financial framework 2014-2020. Janusz Michalcewicz, CEO of the Polish SME EUROTECH which applied for project funding for developing an airborne collision avoidance system for Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems and Very Light Aircraft in low-altitude airspace based on numerical image processing, confirmed during the press briefing that access to additional funding was essential for innovative dual-use research. He highlighted that the necessary administrative procedures to access ESF pose a heavy burden on SMEs. The support provided by the EDA and the Polish Ministry of Defence was therefore essential for his company to proceed with the research.   Next steps ESF has the potential to become an additional source of funding research and innovation dual-use projects in the field of security and defence. After an experimental phase in 2013, EDA will promote a more systematic approach in support of Member States, taking advantage of the programming period 2014-2020.

EDA_NEWS_0738	2013-12-16	NEWS	Background Information EU Council	" Security and defence is on the agenda of the European Council of 19-20 December. EU leaders are expected to provide political guidance on the way ahead for the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). Their discussion will cover the effectiveness, visibility and impact of CSDP; capabilities and defence industry.  The Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) is an essential tool in the foreign policy of the European Union. Since 2003, the EU has deployed some 30 missions and operations around the world. CSDP also offers the framework for enhanced cooperation among Member States by Pooling & Sharing military capabilities, the only way forward in a context of growing threats and budgetary limitations. It also supports the strengthening of the European defence industry, which is essential for the EU's strategic autonomy as well as a driver for jobs, growth and innovation.  In preparation to the EU Council, the European Defence Agency made proposals for four capability programmes and their associated roadmaps in order to address critical shortfalls identified in recent operations:  Air-to-Air Refuelling, with the objective of establishing a multinational fleet from 2019; Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems, with the objective of laying the foundations for a European solution in the 2020-2025 timeframe; Governmental Satellite Communication, with the objective of preparing the next generation in the 2025 timeframe;  Cyber Defence, with a focus on technology, training and protection of EU assets.  EDA also proposed measures to back defence industry in Europe, including SMEs, by supporting research and innovation in Europe through prioritisation (list of European critical defence technologies), investment in critical technologies and greater synergies with EU instruments. More information can be found in the dedicated factsheets here below.   More information: News ""Defence Ministers Commit to Capability Programmes"" (19 Nov 2013) Factsheet on Air-to-Air Refuelling Factsheet on Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems Factsheet on Governmental Satellite Communciations Factsheet on Cyber Defence Factsheet on Support to Industry Video European External Action Service ""CSDP in Action""  European Council dedicated Summit webpage "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/12/16/background-information-eu-council

EDA_NEWS_0741	2013-12-09	NEWS	4th Helicopter Tactics Symposium  Held In Luxembourg	 The fourth Helicopter Tactics Symposium was held on 3 – 4 December 2013 in Kirchberg Conference Centre in Luxembourg. The event is a part of the Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP), a Category B Programme involving 13 countries. 44 helicopter tactics experts from 13 EDA Member States (AT, BE, CZ, DE, ES, HU, IT, LU, NL, PT, SE, SI, UK) discussed in-depth the latest tactical experience gained in the operational deployments in Afghanistan or Mali. The HEP member states decided to extend the invitation to the countries and organisations outside HEP to have even wider range of expertise, therefore the representatives of Joint Air Power Competence Centre (JAPCC), AIRCOM Ramstein and NATO Special Operations Headquarters (NSHQ) also attended the meeting.  The first day of the symposium, the EDA Helicopter Project Manager presented the update on EDA current helicopter projects, followed by the lessons learned brief from the HEP exercise Hot Blade 13 held in Portugal. The participating experts then shared their experience from operational deployment in Mali, mentoring Afghan pilots and maintenance personnel and lessons from recent deployments of NH-90 and Tiger helicopter platforms.  The second day was dedicated to the discussions over the HEP Standard Operating Procedure, the framework tactical document of the programme. Specific topics were brainstormed among the experts, including mission planning cycle, air-to-ground firing, NVG (Night Vision Goggles) procedures, MEDEVAC/MERT (Medical Evacuation/Medical Emergency Response Team) and SAR (Search and Rescue). As a result the SOP was once again broadened and improved – a valuable and tangible result.  The experts also “brainstormed” how this collective best practice could be integrated in the national systems in order to foster true interoperability.  The consensus view was that there must be a direct link between the many institutions involved in the Tactics and Training environment.   The lively discussions confirmed the need of further cooperation in helicopter domain across Europe.

EDA_NEWS_0744	2013-12-10	NEWS	Defence Data 2012	 The European Defence Agency (EDA) published the aggregated defence data for 2012 of the (then) 26 EDA participating Member States.   Total defence expenditure continues to decrease In 2012, total defence expenditure of the 26 EDA pMS (1) amounted to € 189.6 billion - a reduction of € 1.1 billion or 0.6% compared to 2011. It represented approximately 1.50% of their total GDP and 3.04% of their total government expenditure, both values being the lowest since 2006. In real terms (2), total defence expenditure has been decreasing since 2006. During the period from 2006 to 2011, it dropped by € 21 billion or almost 10% and between 2011 and 2012 it reduced further by almost 3%.     Equipment procurement increases, but R&D expenditure reduces Personnel-related expenditure decreased by almost 3% from 2011 to 2012 and reached its lowest level since 2006 (€ 95.7 billion). Nevertheless, it continues to account for over 50% of total defence expenditure. The second biggest component – operation and maintenance expenditure – also decreased by almost 3% and accounted for 23.7% (€ 44.8 billion) of total defence expenditure. On the other hand, after a sharp decrease in 2011, defence investment, comprising equipment procurement and R&D expenditure, increased by over 5% in 2012 to reach the same level it was in 2006 (€ 39.0 billion or 20.6% of total expenditure). But the two components of investment moved in different directions: while equipment procurement increased by 17% to € 34.2 billion (18.0% of total expenditure), close to the highest level achieved in 2010,  R&D expenditure experienced the sharpest decrease since 2006 (-38%) and amounted to € 4.8 billion (2.5% of total expenditure), half its 2006 value. As for R&T (3), after a slight increase in 2011, it reduced to € 1.93 billion (1.02% of total expenditure), both being the lowest values since 2006.    Collaboration: increases in procurement but decreases in R&T 2012 data shows a significant decrease in collaborative expenditure. This is partially due to the fact that one EDA pMS was not able to provide data on collaboration this year. If aggregated data of the 25 pMS for which collaborative figures are available is compared, between 2011 and 2012 collaborative equipment procurement increased by 10% while European collaboration increased by 16.5% and accounted for 95.5% of total collaborative equipment procurement. As for R&T, expenditure on collaborative projects and programmes decreased by almost 15% during the same period. European collaborative R&T expenditure experienced an even sharpreer decrease of 38% and accounted for 67.6% of total collaborative R&T expenditure.   Number of military personnel continues to drop while expenditure and investment per military increases 2012 saw the sixth consecutive reduction in military personnel (77.5% of total staff working in defence, the lowest ratio since 2006) and decreased by 6.3% to 1.45 million. On the other hand, the number of civilian personnel increased for the first time since 2006 by 12.8% to 422 315. Whilst military personnel numbers reduced, defence expenditure per military increased by over 6% reaching € 130 457. Defence investment per military also increased by over 12% and stood at almost € 26 821.   Reduction in troops deployed and in costs of operations As regards deployed operations outside the EU territory, similarly to the last three years, the average number of troops deployed decreased both in absolute terms (from 53 744 to 49 550) and as a share of military personnel  (from 3.5% to 3.4%) and is now at its lowest level since 2006. For the first time since 2006, costs related to deployed operations decreased by 8% to € 10.8 billion or 5.7% of total defence expenditure. Operations costs per military deployed also marginally decreased for the first time and stood at € 217 000 in 2012.     Progress made on one out of four collective benchmarks In 2007, EDA pMS agreed on a set of four collective benchmarks for investment. There is no obligation in terms of timeline or adoption of these benchmarks into national targets. In 2012, only one of the four indicators made progress towards the benchmarks. Due to an increase in defence equipment procurement expenditure, the proportion of investment (equipment procurement and R&D) of total defence expenditure increased from 19.4% to 20.6% thus exceeding the agreed target of 20%. After an increase in 2011, the share of R&T expenditure in total defence expenditure decreased to its lowest level since 2006: 1.02% (the benchmark is 2%).    Due to incomplete collaborative data, it is not possible to measure progress towards the two other benchmarks: European collaborative equipment procurement as a percentage of total equipment procurement (the benchmark is 35%) and European collaborative defence R&T as a percentage of total defence R&T (the benchmark is 20%). _______ (1) Data in this publication does not include Croatia which became the 27th EDA Member State on 1 July 2013, and Denmark which is not an EDA Member State. (2) In order to measure real growth and ensure a “real” comparison between years, inflation needs to be taken into account. Thus, data from 2006 to 2011 has been inflated to 2012 economic conditions (Source of deflator: European Commission ECFIN – based on weight of EU 27). (3) R&T is a subset of R&D which includes only basic research, applied research and technology demonstration, leaving out expenditure for demonstration or development for which a decision to procure has been taken.   More information Download here the Defence Data booklet 2012. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/12/10/defence-data-2012

EDA_NEWS_0747	2013-11-20	NEWS	EDA Launches Streamlined Structure	 The European Defence Agency (EDA) will have a new structure in place as of 1 January 2014 better to support Member States in a rapidly evolving environment. The Agency will be organised in three operational directorates: Cooperation Planning & Support; Capability, Armaments & Technology; and European Synergies & Innovation. This will facilitate prioritisation of tasks and improve operational output, in particular on key activities such as Air-to-Air Refuelling, Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems, Satellite Communications, Airworthiness, Certification, SESAR, and Energy & Environment. The Defence and security environment is evolving rapidly. Defence cuts are leading to greater cooperation on programmes. In addition, many wider EU policies such as Single European Sky or Radio Spectrum have major implications for the defence community. The overall objective of the restructuring is to ensure that the Agency is properly equipped to: anticipate and react to developments; improve its operational output; facilitate the prioritisation of tasks; and serve the needs, expectations and interests of Member States effectively and efficiently. Cooperation Planning & Support The Cooperation Planning & Support directorate will focus on the early identification of requirements at European level and the through-life aspect of capabilities. It will be responsible for capability planning through the Capability Development Plan and the Cooperative Programme Database; and Pooling & Sharing including the Code of Conduct. It will deal with Defence & Industry analysis to complement the identification and development of capability demands. The directorate will also be responsible for key enablers to support defence cooperation and enhance interoperability: military airworthiness, standardisation and certification, and education and training. In addition, it will support CSDP operations and EU Battlegroups at the request of Member States. Capability, Armaments & Technology The Capability, Armaments & Technology directorate will prepare the programmes of tomorrow by maximising synergies between capabilities, armaments and Research & Technology. The directorate will bring together the Agency’s work in the areas of: Information Superiority (Communication & Information Systems, Surveillance & Reconnaissance, Space, Cyber Defence); Air (Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems, Air-to-Air Refuelling, airlift and aerial systems technologies); Land (Counter-IED, armoured systems, camp protection and land systems technologies); Maritime (Maritime Surveillance, Mine Counter Measures and naval systems technologies); and the Joint domain (mobility, transport, medical and Ammunition). Particular attention will be given to identifying future Critical Defence Technologies needed to support military capabilities. European Synergies & Innovation This directorate will act as an interface between defence ministries and wider EU policies that have implications for defence. Its main tasks will be to promote and support innovation through innovative research in the areas such as: Components, Radio-Frequency & Optical Sensors, Materials and Structures, Energy, and CBRN protection. It will develop synergies and greater complementarity with EU programmes such as Horizon 2020 and European Structural Funds. The directorate will also be the Agency’s focal point on Space Policy, on which it will have a close dialogue with the Commission and the European Space Agency. It will be responsible for Market & Industry policy, including SMEs, Security of Supply, the REACH regulation, market efficiency and global aspects of the defence market. The directorate will also deal with the military dimension of the Single European Sky, with a particular emphasis on the SESAR deployment phase, as well as the Agency’s activities in the areas of Green Energy.

EDA_NEWS_0748	2013-11-19	NEWS	Defence Ministers Commit to Capability Programmes	 At the meeting of the European Defence Agency’s Steering Board, Defence Ministers today committed to the launch of four programmes and their associated roadmaps in order to address critical shortfalls identified in recent operations. Increased cooperation in the areas of Air-to-Air Refuelling (AAR), Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), Governmental Satellite Communication and Cyber Defence as well as support to industry including SMEs with a focus on research & innovation and military airworthiness certification result from the meeting. They will also constitute a contribution of Defence Ministers to the European Council in December addressing defence and security issues.  The objective of the EDA Steering Board on 19 November was to finalise Defence Ministers’ contribution to the European Council in December as regards capabilities and industry. Against the backdrop of constrained defence budgets, the focus is on the preparation of the capabilities of tomorrow through cooperation, supported by a healthy and competitive industry as well as technology. “The discussion by Heads of State and Government at the forthcoming European Council is of utmost importance for European defence. We need recognition at the highest political level that defence – considering the diversity of threats and challenges – is a priority. In view of today’s constrained financial situation, this effort for defence must be fully efficient which implies cooperation and searching for synergies. Clearly, we cannot do ‘more with less’”, said Claude-France Arnould.  EDA developed proposals to further enhance the development of defence capabilities and to support Europe’s defence industry. Defence Ministers today endorsed these proposals and committed to programmes and their associated roadmaps in the areas of AAR, RPAS, Governmental Satellite Communication and Cyber Defence. They also supported measures to support European defence research and innovation and industry, including SMEs.  Air-to-Air Refuelling Air-to-air refuelling (AAR) is a critical enabler for air power projection and it is required to enable sustained air combat operations. Recent operations have demonstrated an important European capability gap in this area. EDA has thus developed a global approach with three objectives: increase overall capacity; reduce fragmentation of the fleet; and optimise the use of assets. The Agency together with the Member States is engaged in four work strands to close this important capability gap, of which the most important for the future is the acquisition of a European strategic Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) capability from 2020. This builds on the Letter of Intent signed by nine Member States (BE, EL, ES, FR, HU, LU, PL, PT, NL) and NO at the Steering Board in November 2012. Work is led by NL. Synergies with other such capabilities are key to maximum efficiency; France is offering support from its own planned acquisitions, the UK Voyager is also an important contribution to this capability. Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) RPAS have proven their value in the military sphere in recent operations demonstrating their operational capacities, particularly for surveillance and information gathering. Defence Ministers endorsed a roadmap on RPAS which aims at laying the foundations for a European solution in the 2020-2025 timeframe. The roadmap includes four actions:  RPAS Certification. In the context of the Military Airworthiness Forum, the Agency is exploring together with national authorities and the European Aviation Safety Agency how to streamline the certification process for military RPAS on the European level.  Signature of a Joint Investment Programme on RPAS for Air Traffic Insertion. The programme will focus on technological priorities such as sense and avoid, taxi, automatic take-off and landing, air traffic management interfaces, safe automated monitoring and decision architecture. These demonstration projects will be complementary to the activities of the European Commission in support of RPAS in order to seek synergies. Eight Member States (AT, BE, CZ, DE, ES, FR, IT, UK) signed the programme during the Steering Board.  Future European RPAS MALE Programme. Defence Ministers today endorsed the Common Staff Target for Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) RPAS as the basis for those Member States which intend to participate in any future project to develop a Common Staff Requirement; in this context Ministers tasked EDA to prepare the launch of a Category B project. Establishment of a MALE RPAS community. The objective of this community is to exchange information as well as to identify and facilitate cooperation among Member States which currently operate or plan to operate RPAS. At the Steering Board meeting on 19 November 2013 seven Member States (FR, DE, EL, ES, IT, NL, and PL) signed a Letter of Intent to join the Community. Governmental Satellite Communications Satellite communications have become critical elements for defence, security, humanitarian, emergency response or diplomatic communications. They are a key enabler for civil and military missions/operations in particular in remote and austere environments with little or no infrastructure. Additionally, there is strong potential for a dual-use cooperative approach. The objective of EDA’s proposal for Governmental Satellite Communications (GOVSATCOM) is to prepare the next generation in the 2025 timeframe. In close cooperation with Member States, the European Commission and the European Space Agency, the programme includes (i) establishing a GOVSATCOM Operators User Group of the five Member States (DE, ES, FR, IT, UK) that operate systems; (ii) identifying and producing Common Staff Targets for future mission requirements; (iii) on this basis, undertake a gap analysis and an updated Strategic Research Agenda; (iv) coordinating civil and military requirements; and (v) preparing a Category B project for Member States interested in due course. Cyber Defence On Cyber Defence, EDA was tasked to develop, in close coordination with Member States, EEAS and the European Commission, a comprehensive roadmap for strengthening Cyber Defence Capabilities. Based on the work already commenced by EDA, the main elements of the roadmap are training, improving cyber situational awareness, improving civil/military cooperation, the protection of EU assets during missions and operations and technological aspects. Support to industry Defence industry in Europe, including SMEs, underpins the development of the capabilities of tomorrow. Research and innovation and certification provide strong industrial leverage. In this regard, Ministers agreed to support research and innovation in Europe through prioritisation (list of European critical defence technologies), through exploring new instruments for investing in critical technologies and greater synergies with EU instruments. Special attention is given to supporting SMEs. Airworthiness The development of a full suite of harmonised European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs), together with mutual recognition between participating Member States is a ‘key enabler’ to reduce defence expenditure. At the same time it contributes to an improved and more competitive European defence aerospace industry. The implementation of the EMARS into national regulations will unlock benefits for both Member States and industry to reduce aircraft support and certification costs (for both future and legacy platforms). It will also enable an open European market for the ‘Pooling & Sharing’ of aircraft maintenance resources, enhance ‘test and evaluation’ activities and significantly drive down the duplication of effort between and within Member States. Defence Ministers signed a Political Declaration on Certification and Airworthiness to achieve long-term results. The Agency is also tasked to prepare, in close coordination with Member States, the European framework conditions for certifying RPAS.

EDA_NEWS_0749	2013-11-14	NEWS	Your Work Will Be Read	" Sven Biscop, Director of the Europe in the World Programme at the Egmont Institute in Brussels and jury chair of EDA-Egmont PhD Prize in Security, Defence and Strategy explains here below the aim of this prize and why young academics should hurry to send in their work. Deadline for submissions is 1 December 2013. What is the aim of the EDA-Egmont PhD Prize in Security, Defence and Strategy? Too many not only very interesting, but also very relevant PhD dissertations, offering insights that can bring real added value to policy-making, remain under the radar screen of “Brussels”. Our aim is to link those researching European defence and those who practice it very day, to the mutual benefit of both. For as an academic myself, I can only confirm that systematic contact with policy-makers is vital to producing quality research.  Who should participate and why? Every academic who has recently defended a PhD and therefore has a message he/she wants to get out there! If you feel you have something to say to the Brussels crowd: do submit.  What is your experience from last year’s first edition of the PhD Prize? The first edition attracted a lot of really good submissions, making my work as chair of the jury very difficult, for there were several potential winners. But even those who in the end did not win the prize, now know that their work was read by the head of the EDA, the chairman of the EUMC etc., which is an achievement in itself.  Picture: Sven Biscop and Claude-France Arnould together with the winner of the first EDA-Egmont PhD Prize, Benjamin Pohl © EDA   More information News “EDA-Egmont Institute PhD Prize with Prestigious Jury” (7 Nov 2013) News ""Call for Submissions: EDA-Egmont PhD Prize"" (12 Sept 2013) Call for Submissions 2014 EDA-Egmont PhD Prize Submission form 2014 EDA-Egmont PhD Prize News ""First EDA-Egmont PhD Prize Awarded"" (12 March 2013) Video summary of the 2013 EDA Annual Conference ""European Defence Matters"" Pictures of the 2013 EDA Annual Conference ""European Defence Matters"" "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/11/14/your-work-will-be-read
EDA_NEWS_0750	2013-11-11	NEWS	Innovation Key Driver for Capability Building	" Jan-Olof Lind is Director General of the Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI) and Chairman of the European Defence Agency's Research & Technology Steering Board. In this short interview here below, Mr Lind reflects on the importance of innovation on defence, critical defence technologies and his expectations regarding EDA's upcoming R&T conference in December. EDA's R&T conference will look at the issue of innovation in and for defence. How important is innovation in defence and what is the state of innovation in Europe? Innovation is a key driver for capability building in defence and beyond. We may not normally talk about innovation in defence technology programming, but it aptly describes what we do; generating new knowledge, as well as practising existing knowledge and technology to new purposes and in novel ways. The defence world is very used to program and fund long-term knowledge generation activities against targeted capability goals. In the civilian world, the capability focus is perhaps not always that articulated but that does not mean that our innovation and knowledge generation is not of use for the civilian world, perhaps in particular for security purposes. My own research agency works, for instance, for front-line services (police, fire and rescue services), health and welfare services, etc. To a greater extent we have to be able to benefit from innovation and development in the civilian R&T sphere. The EDA could play an important role in assisting Member States in this respect. EDA developed a first list of critical defence technologies. How does this work relate to national approach in Member States? The list developed by the Agency is a good first step and we need to continue to discuss and agree on a version that we can start working on. Member States together with the Agency need to constantly review such lists in order to make sure that they are up to date and targeted towards the challenges currently at hand. The need to analyse technology dependencies is, for some nations, a relatively new approach to research and technology orientation. There is great potential for exchange of lessons learned and establishing good practices. The Agency could play a vital role here. What can participants expect from the conference? The conference focuses on two vital aspects of the current challenges in research and technology - the dependencies we face and the need to employ innovation for defence purposes, across the board, from both military and civilian research. I hope that the participants will find new thoughts and ideas from the podium that they can bring home and perhaps start employing or at least starting a national discussion. But, perhaps equally important, are the not so tangible benefits that discussions  with similarly minded people can bring, together with exchange thoughts and experiences in the margins of the conference, over a coffee during the break.

EDA_NEWS_0753	2013-10-25	NEWS	Harmonising Ammunition Qualification: Endorsement of Test Centres	" Endorsement of Test Centres is one of the short term actions in the Harmonisation of Ammunition Qualification Roadmap, which the European Defence Agency (EDA) presented to the Member States earlier this year.  On 14-16 October 2013, EDA organised the first test centre visit to TNO in the Netherlands, with the support of the Dutch Ministry of Defence.   The main objective of the event was to build trust between test centre experts and to provide a better insight into the processes, expertise and methodologies used on the implementation of the ammunition qualification standards. This was the first of several planned visits to be conducted biennially to test centres within participating Member States.  These visits provide test centre experts with a forum to share experiences and hands on working methodology.  This particular visit focused on testing of energetic materials, namely friction sensitivity, thermal analysis, pressure vacuum stability and ballistics. For the first time at European level, more than 30 government and industry experts conducted joint tests and exchanged views on the test results and outcomes. As a direct consequence, joint follow-on activities have been identified, enabling Member States to continue mutual cooperation on harmonising the ammunition qualification process and procedures.  The Endorsement of Test Centres complements other actions included in EDA’s Harmonisation of Ammunition Qualification roadmap, all aiming to improve European armed forces interoperability, enable more efficient Pooling & Sharing among Member States while in parallel reducing the overall ammunition acquisition cost.  The next activity of this kind is planned to take place in Poland in April next year.   More information: News ""Action Plan for Harmonised Ammunition Qualification"" (16 November 2012) News ""Roadmap to Harmonised Ammunition Qualification"" (7 December 2012) A factsheet on ammunition qualification is available here.

EDA_NEWS_0754	2013-10-17	NEWS	EURidea for Novel Defence Research	" Innovation is at the core of defence technology. The European Defence Agency promotes European cooperation in innovative technologies. EURidea is your new forum to pitch novel ideas for defence research. Research and innovation have a critical role to play in the creation of the next-generation of technologies that will underpin the capabilities for our armed forces. Europe benefits from a leverage effect when innovation is done with partners across the continent. Industry and academics can reduce risks and gain critical mass for innovation when work is conducted between trusted partners across sectors. It is a win-win situation when the best minds work together to tackle major challenges we are facing, now and in the future. We invite you to propose ideas in critical areas that impact the following three technology areas:  1. Materials and Nano technologies The areas of material and particularly nanotechnologies is moving very quickly at the moment. Nano-scale technologies that exploit materials and electronic and optronic components for military but also civil applications (dual use) are of interest to EDA. Especially those technologies which are critical, key enabling or cutting-edge technologies. European supply chain deficiencies, technology dependency risks, standardisation needs or industrial production capabilities can be addressed. We are interested in ideas that are an evolution of the current state of the art but we are also open to ideas that look disruptive (ie not necessarily an evolution of current trends). These may be combinations of new technologies and could be applicable to any domain. 2. Energy Achieving energy efficiency by novel energy supply technologies working alongside conventional and smart grids across all services (land, sea and air) covering all systems levels down to nano level. Focus areas: fossil fuel dependencies, renewable / alternative energy sources, energy / power storage, efficient distribution and conversion, energy management and efficiency components. 3. Unmanned systems and technologies, including sensor networks All components or (sub)systems that can be of importance for the autonomy of a system. Unmanned System to be concerned: land, air, naval (surface and underwater). Technology or function to be concerned: high level order follow up, “auto-pilot”, guidance/control, obstacle detection, automatic sense & avoid and “back-home” mode, stress/health monitoring. We invite ideas from Research Institutes, Universities, Industries, Laboratories and SMEs.  You can pitch your new, creative and innovative solution to an audience of experts and governmental decision makers from Europe.  If you like to participate, please submit the enclosed form.

EDA_NEWS_0756	2013-10-08	NEWS	C-IED Manual Neutralisation Techniques Courses and Exercises	 Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Sweden signed today a Letter of Intent expressing their interest in pooling resources and expertise for the setting up of a shared C-IED Manual Neutralisation Techniques courses and exercises capacity. Improvised Explosive Devices continue to pose significant threat to military and civilian personnel. In some cases complex explosive devices have to be neutralised manually. Member States (MS) earlier this year expressed their wish to increase efforts on Manual Neutralisation Techniques (MNT) due to an urgent but limited requirement which does not justify separate, national training programmes in this cost-intensive area. Austria as lead nation proposed and developed a four year MNT project under the umbrella of the Pooling & Sharing Countering IED Training initiative with the intention to conduct one MNT course and exercise a year. The training of Manual Neutralisers is highly cost-intensive due to equipment and specialist’s advisory role. The role of Manual Neutralisers is life saving and is a priority for participating Member States. With today’s letter of intent, the signatory countries express their interest to cooperate in the development of a project arrangement and to participate in the project.    More information Project page Counter-IED   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/10/08/c-ied-manual-neutralisation-techniques-courses-and-exercises
EDA_NEWS_0757	2013-10-16	NEWS	EDA R&T Conference - Register Now!	 Securing the supplies for defence capabilities has become a challenging task for all actors – from defence administrations to industry. Future defence capabilities rely on emerging key enabling and cutting edge technologies, which today often are of “dual-use”. The requirement of non-limited access and availability makes some of these technologies “defence-critical”, associating the need for joint and coordinated action at national, but also European level. The 2013 EDA Research & Technology (R&T) Conference (05-06 December) aims to look at critical defence technologies from various perspectives. It will give the opportunity to survey Europe’s defence technology and industrial base and identify vulnerabilities that could negatively impact Europe´s production of defence systems. Some specific research areas will be highlighted.  The conference will also provide opportunity for dissemination and exploitation of results from two Joint Investment Programmes (JIP). Furthermore it will discuss innovative ways of funding dual-use research and of connecting academia, SMEs and industry for R&T collaboration. The morning of Day 1 will provide views on the topic of Critical Defence Technologies and EDA´s role together with the Member States, European Commission, ESA, ENIAC and Defence Industry. In the afternoon, two parallel sessions will inform about the results from the JIPs “Force Protection (FP)” and “Innovative Concepts/ Emerging Technologies (ICET)”, and invite for ideas on the exploitation. A poster session will give opportunity to discuss results in depth. The day will conclude with a conference dinner. Day 2 will start with  a panel session on research for dual-use technologies, European Structural Funds and the Smart Specialization Strategy. After lunch, selected academics, SMEs and industries will  present novel research  in three  important areas for defence.  Organisation The conference is organised by the European Defence Agency (EDA) and is hosted by the Ministry of National Defence of Greece. Attendance-Registration This conference is mainly oriented towards governmental, institutional, industrial and research decision makers and experts in R&T activities and for applied research and development oriented industries and research organisations as well as their associations. Attendance is limited to 170 persons. For registrations please fill in the registration form here. Please note that registration will be valid upon receipt of confirmation.

EDA_NEWS_0758	2013-09-26	NEWS	Naval Challenges in the Arctic	" The European Defence Agency, together with the Permanent Representation of Finland to the European Union today hosted a conference on the ""Naval Challenges in the Arctic Region"" highlighting the conclusions of a long term analysis conducted by the Wise Pen Team International. Pilvi-Sisko Vierros-Villeneuve, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Finland to the European Union, opened the event by underlining the growing importance of the region due to changing circumstances. In her speech, she highlighted that diminishing ice would lead to more activity in the Artic. New resources and logistic opportunities were of interest; a European Union Maritime Security Strategy, currently in preparation, would be a key opportunity to address the EU’s support to the Arctic area. Claude-France Arnould, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency, recalled the growing importance of the Arctic for European security and economic interests, at the same time requiring  close attention to be paid to environmental protection. “The opening of the Sea Lines of Communication, the North West and North East passages for example, have required the naval community to focus more on navigational safety, the need for maritime surveillance and maritime security in the Arctic region. One of EDA’s key tasks is to anticipate capability requirements and cooperation opportunities on this basis in the Arctic area, where a truly comprehensive approach will be required.” Vice Admirals Fernando Del Pozo, Anthony Dymock, Lutz Feldt, Patrick Herbrard and Ferdinando Sanfelice di Monteforte of Wise Pen International presented their study on naval challenges in the Arctic region which concentrated on current strategies and practices; resources, challenges and capability needs; the EU and the Arctic, and gave some conclusions and recommendations. They argued that potential risks to maritime security could only be addressed collectively and internationally; they see the EU as being well placed in playing a key role. However, the group members also highlighted that raising the scientific knowledge baseline and generating a shared vision of how to harness the riches while preserving the environment was a prerequisite. Experts on the Arctic from Finland, Dr Juha-Matti Flinkman, and Sweden, Niklas Granholm, highlighted the need to develop cooperation in the Arctic area in a close cooperation between governmental authorities and scientific research, acknowledging the specific requirements of the delicate and evolving Arctic environment.    More information: Finlands Permanent Representation to the European Union MARSUR Networking project page "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/09/26/naval-challenges-in-the-arctic
EDA_NEWS_0759	2013-10-15	NEWS	Head of Agency Publishes Report on CSDP	 Catherine Ashton, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Head of the European Defence Agency, published her final report in preparation of the European Council in December where Heads of State and Government will discuss security and defence topics. The report follows the three clusters defined by President van Rompuy in December last year to guide the Council discussion: strengthening CSDP, enhancing defence capabilities, strengthening Europe’s defence industry. Mainly the second and third cluster include suggestions and proposals in EDA’s area of responsibility of which key points are highlighted here below.   Systematic and long-term European defence cooperation Cooperation in the area of military capability is essential. The report asks for a strong impulse at European Council level, both to embed Pooling & Sharing in Member States’ defence planning and decision-making processes, and to deliver key capabilities through major projects. Key elements are more transparency between Member States, sharing of future plans for key capabilities and of lessons learned, rationalisation of demand as well as a push for harmonised requirements. Through the Code of Conduct on Pooling & Sharing EDA is ready to act as a framework of coordination and transparency to enhance and facilitate synergies and identify best practises. Systematic and long-term defence cooperation with agreed priorities and milestones could be supported by a strategic level Defence Roadmap. This roadmap could also lead the way to closer synergies with OCCAR, the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation. The report makes a case for incentives for defence cooperation which could include innovative financing arrangements as well as protecting cooperative projects and initiatives from budget cuts.     Commitment to major projects Taking into account severe gaps in some capability areas, the report points out the need for Member States to commit to major projects in air-to-air refuelling, satellite communication, remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) and cyber defence. As regards air-to-air refuelling, EDA is already working on short, mid and long-term solutions to increase tanker/receivers interoperability and maximise the use of existing assets, the establishment of a multinational multirole tankers fleet, foreseen for 2020, is under way. Pioneer Projects have been promoted by EDA to develop capabilities that have both military and civil applications They are designed to harness synergies in the military and civil domains; maximise dual-use technologies; and generate economies of scale. Defence ministers have already endorsed proposals to prepare projects in the areas of remotely piloted aircraft systems and cyber defence. RPAS are very likely to constitute a key capability for the future with applications in the civil and the military domains. EDA is ready to prepare a programme for the next generation of Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) RPAS. Such a programme needs to include regulatory aspects regarding insertion into normal airspace as well as technology development possibly through joint investment programme between the European Commission, EDA, Member States and the industry. In terms of governmental SATCOM, the report mentions the objective of a future dual civil-military capability by 2025 via a user-driven approach based on a detailed roadmap. As regards cyber defence, the objective is to establish a comprehensive European approach. EDA activities, based on the recently adopted cyber strategy, focus on realistic deliverables within its remit and expertise: training, exercises, protection of headquarters, and Cyber Defence Research Agenda (focusing on dual use technologies).   Strengthening Europe’s defence industry In the chapter on measures to strengthen Europe’s defence industry a strong, healthy and globally competitive European Defence and Technological Industrial Base is acknowledged as a prerequisite for developing and sustaining defence capabilities and securing the strategic autonomy of Europe. Its importance for the wider economy is mentioned as well. This industrial base has to be safeguarded through substantive and strengthened cooperation at European level, including through major new cooperative programmes. While big industry plays a leading role in the defence sector, the defence supply chain and notably SMEs play a very important part and should be supported. EDA together with its Member States is also working on concrete measures to increase both short- and long-term Security of Supply, whether related to supply chains, European non-dependencies, raw materials, or investments in key industrial and technological capabilities. Some tangible measures EDA is already working on in cooperation with the European Commission and the European Aviation Safety Agency to improve competitiveness and to reduce development and production costs include standardisation, military airworthiness and certification.   European commitment to R&T National defence research and development expenditure decreased substantially in the last years with possible negative impact on the long-term competitiveness of the European industry. Strong investment is needed if Europe is to retain its R&T expertise. Building on the list of critical defence technologies elaborated in the EDA framework, the technologies that need to be developed at the European level for defence, space, and the civil sector should be identified on a systematic basis to underpin long-term planning for European R&T. It will also ensure that Europe is addressing the challenge of technology non-dependence on a strategic level. The report therefore suggests that Member States should be encouraged to commit to multi-annual investment in defence R&T through cooperation. Synergies between civil and defence research for dual-use technologies should be exploited. EDA closely works with the European Commission and European Space Agency on dual use research; important areas of cooperation are key enabling technologies, critical space technologies, CBRN, cyber defence and RPAS.   More information Statement by EU High Representative Catherine Ashton on her Final Report on the CSDP available here.

EDA_NEWS_0760	2013-10-08	NEWS	Military Airworthiness Conference 2013	" The Military Airworthiness Conference 2013 took place on 25-26 September in Aix-en-Provence, France. This was the 5th conference arranged under the auspices of the Military Airworthiness Authorities (MAWA) Forum and built upon the success of previous EDA Military Airworthiness Conferences and workshops that had been organised in the Czech Republic, Sweden, Poland and Cyprus.  This year presentations focused on ""Building upon the foundations of military airworthiness harmonisation in order to realise future benefits” and on exploring the way forward now that the full suite of European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) and other associated documents will be available in the near term.  The conference brought together 95 military airworthiness experts from European Member States, governmental organisations, aerospace industry and the European Aviation Safety Agency as well as representatives from Australia, Canada, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Turkey. The wide variety of presentations, interspersed with valuable Q&A sessions and discussions, posed a number of challenging questions for the Military Airworthiness community, as well as providing an exciting insight into the way-forward for European Military Airworthiness. The conference provided key opportunities for networking, ensuring that delegates were able to maximise their time with each other and to follow-up individual  presentations with more detailed discussions of specific national issues.  Conference feedback from all attendees has been very positive, and will provide further impetus to the EDA-chaired MAWA Forum as it prepares for the national consultation of several critical documents over the next few months, including EMAR 66 and the Acceptable Means of Compliance & Guidance Material linked with EMAR 21 and EMAR 147.

EDA_NEWS_0761	2013-09-06	NEWS	EU US Defence Data 2011	" EDA has compared the 2011 defence expenditure of its participating Member States with that of the United States for the same year. The data show that the US spent €503 billion on defence in 2011 compared to €193 billion spent in the EU: around 2,5 times more. In 2011, the governments of the 26 EDA pMS spent a total of €193 billion on defence. The US spent the equivalent of €503 billion (or $699 billion). Between 2006 and 2008 the aggregated defence expenditure of the 26 EDA pMS has been about half that of the US. During the years 2009-2011 this difference increased. While the EU aggregated defence expenditure decreased from €201 billion in 2008 to €193 billion in 2011, US expenditure increased from €416 billion ($612 billion) to €503 billion in the same period.  Comparing defence spending with other macroeconomic data, in 2011 US defence expenditure represented 4.7% of GDP and 11.2% of overall government expenditure. In the EU these ratios were, respectively, 1.6% and 3.2%. As for defence expenditure in relation to the total population, the US spent €1 610 ($2 242) per capita in 2011, while the EU spent on average €387.  The EU data represent spending of 26 EDA participating Member States (all EU Member States except Denmark and Croatia which joined the EU on 1 July 2013). The US data are based on public sources, mainly US Government publications. Data on GDP, General Government Expenditure, Population and Euro/US Dollar exchange rates were collected from Eurostat.

EDA_NEWS_0762	2013-09-03	NEWS	Passing on the Lessons of Bonn, Madrid, Kabul and Brussels	" Axel Butenschön joined the EDA as a Capability Development Plan (CDP) project officer in March 2012 – his experience in the field has given him an invaluable insight into the realities of what is really needed to boost Member States operational capabilities. This article was first published in the second issue of the EDA magazine ""European Defence Matters"". Project officers at the EDA need special skill sets if they are to make a real difference to enhancing Member States military capabilities and help close the gaps that can hamper joint operations. Operational experience, a firm grasp of the blockers and enablers to improved capabilities and a determination to succeed, no matter how complex the problems might seem, are often key ingredients. Like all EDA staff members Axel Butenschön will be with the Agency only temporarily before returning to a national post in the German armed forces in four, or at most six, years. “If you come from operational background and a national capability development unit, as I did in the Ministry of Defence in Germany, you see the benefits of national processes but also see their limitations,” he said, “Especially in operations - we had some situations where we had very good national equipment but we were not able to interact the best way we could with other Member States. “For example the coordination with units of other nations especially in a high intensity situation was challenging during my slot in 2010 due to different national communication systems and procedures. So that was my motivation to join the EDA - I realised there were definite limits of national capability development and at some stage you need coordination from something like this Agency to really build something together.” Capability Development Plan The Capability Development Plan (CPD) is a key EDA initiative to overcome the challenge of increasing collaboration between EU countries and improving capabilities. Axel moderates and organises with his team the set-up of the CPD between Member States on closing the capability gaps. “It’s up to the Member States to assess future threats. Then we can integrate our experts from the Agency with those of the Member States. For example, in the future we most probably will see - due to various strategic drivers like global warming, new technologies or shortages of resources - new areas and modalities of conflicts and new threats and challenges. First we look at this from the point of view of a possible adversary - what can he or she do with that? As a second step we assess what we would then need to counter it and ask what should we start to develop now to be fit for purpose in time. The CDP gives an objective orientation and supports our Member States in the assessment of whether future challenges can be met by existing assets or whether a new capability needs to be developed now and, preferably, jointly.  The strength of the CDP is that Member States work on this assessment together and agree on a common picture of the future threats as the starting point for cooperative answers to that. The findings of the CDP can highlight the area where Member States should invest, said Axel Butenschön. “In cooperation with them the Agency has to prepare and offer as a follow-on step substantial actions to convince its members to participate to their real benefit.  As an example of this, recalling my time as a national representative until 2008, let me mention the Helicopter initiative. Although already highlighted as a CDP prioritized area only the concrete EDA proposal of a helicopter pilot training initiative convinced my national stakeholders to participate in a significant manner to prepare aircrew before sending them to real operations such as Afghanistan. “ Operational experience Axel Butenschön is a German General Staff Officer with expertise in logistics. As well as staff officer training in Germany he joined the Spanish General Staff Course in Madrid for 12 months and had a chance there to learn about the multinational perspective on defence matters. When he returned to Germany he was the national German representative to several EDA activities.  He also served three tours of duty in Afghanistan, one of it as a Battalion Commander. “I commanded quite a complex battalion in Afghanistan composed of logistic, communication, reconnaissance and engineer assets, which is useful to the job I am doing now as it gives me a kind of intellectual reality check on all the theoretical things I do on a daily basis,” he said. “I think it’s important that in an Agency like the EDA you have more credibility if you can show Member States that besides your technical skills you also know what is going on operationally. Not each operation is the same; Atalanta is a different story from Afghanistan and the Afghanistan as I experienced is a very different story to the Afghanistan of today and tomorrow. “However, if you make clear that what the Agency does is to support troops in missions it gives you more credibility if you have had time out there. To understand what the overall aim is. My job is not to produce a huge amount of papers - but to assist Member States to take the right decisions in capability development and by that help to deliver the right equipment, training or concepts in support of our troops in operations” This experience helps him to analyse national capability plans with colleagues from Member States and to look for what is missing. “For example, you can look at the cyber or nano technology areas, assess how this will change future war fighting, look what Member States have already planned to develop and then assess with experts how to the best way to approach the issue in a cooperative manner . “We look at the issues from the European side of what is needed and try to match that with what Member States have and what are the shortfalls to be matched by collaborative actions.” The financial crisis across Europe has increased the willingness of national ministries of defence to cooperate and Axel Butenschön detects a more positive attitude to the EDA initiative than ever before. “The CDP has received more importance now than maybe in its initial stage when we came up with the first priorities in 2008. If you look at pooling and sharing in a more structured way and really think not only about cooperation for cooperation’s sake, but really start tackling the important things, then you do start to see the added value. And that’s what Member States are interested in.”   More information: Capability Development Plan (CDP) European Defence Matters, issue 2 "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/09/03/passing-on-the-lessons-of-bonn-madrid-kabul-and-brussels

EDA_NEWS_0764	2013-08-23	NEWS	Pooling & Sharing Helps Filling Capability Gaps	" EDA's Code of Conduct will help to mainstream Pooling & Sharing in Member States’ planning and decision-making processes. European Union (EU) defence ministers have agreed that cooperation should be systematically considered from the outset to support EU defence departments to develop defence capabilities. A key enabler to this is a new Code of Conduct on Pooling & Sharing. The objective now is for the Code to be implemented by individual defence departments in the most effective manner. At the informal Ministerial meeting under the Belgian presidency in 2010, Sweden and Germany proposed that the Agency should examine Pooling & Sharing intensively, with a view to identifying specific areas in which early progress could be achieved. Many initiatives had already begun but others had yet to get off the ground, so during 2011 the Agency looked at the overall state of play and identified key areas where progress could be made quickly.  At the EDA Steering Board meeting in November 2011 EU defence ministers endorsed a list of 11 Pooling & Sharing opportunities. “It’s very much work in progress. We have made significant achievements but nobody should assume we are anywhere near mission accomplished. I think this is going to be a long haul – an iterative process,” said Graham Muir, Head of the Policy and Planning Unit at the EDA. Pooling & Sharing It quickly became apparent that if the initiative were to be successful it could not be done only on an ad hoc basis. In April 2012 four nations – Belgium, Finland, Greece and Luxembourg – suggested a more structured approach to define a concrete framework in which Pooling & Sharing could be advanced. The Agency decided, in parallel with the specific project work in which it was already engaged, to try to create such a structured approach. “We were pretty clear about the content – the challenge was to secure Member States’ buy-in,” said Muir. At the informal Ministerial meeting in Cyprus in September 2012 the EDA tabled a paper outlining its suggestions for the Code, which Ministers approved two months later. “EDA will continue to drive Pooling & Sharing forward as a pragmatic, flexible and cost-effective model, and avoiding bureaucratization. The Code of Conduct will facilitate cooperation, and make Pooling & Sharing sustainable now and in the future"", said Claude France-Arnould, EDA’s Chief Executive after the Cyprus meeting. “We have continued to add projects to the list but we now have a better framework within which to work. We don’t for a moment claim all these ideas as our own – a lot of them were inspired by the four-nation paper issued in April last year,” said Muir. A structured approach There are several benefits to adopting a more structured approach, rather than continuing with the former ad hoc process, according to Muir. “The EDA is not the only actor working on cooperation; there is considerable effort expended in other institutional frameworks, such as NATO, as well as bilateral and regional clusters. There is a plethora of such initiatives but what’s clear is that Member States want coherence between the various initiatives, thereby achieving the twin objectives of avoiding unnecessary duplication and ensuring gaps are filled where possible. “ Another objective was to try to embed the Pooling & Sharing in Member States’ defence planning and national decision-making processes. In Sweden, for example, cooperation is the default option. “If you don’t want to collaborate on a particular capability, you have to demonstrate why going it alone is a better option,” said Muir. The Code will now be implemented nationally, on a voluntary basis. “The signals we have had have been positive.  There will also be an assessment process, which is why at the end of the Code we have a section outlining how implementation will be assessed,” said Muir. “There will be an annual report, the first one of which will be towards the end of this year.  I think this will be an important contribution of ours to the deliberations of the European Council on defence issues at the end of 2013,” said Muir. He continued: “What we want to be able to provide is a clear broad picture. Where are the gaps? Where are the duplications and redundancies? What obstacles have Member States identified in implementing the Code? What is the pan-European effect of defence cuts? Part of this will be a mapping exercise to determine the effect these cuts have on the retaining and developing capabilities. But this isn’t just about capabilities - it’s also about the impact on research and technology. Although much of our Pooling & Sharing work lies within our Capabilities Directorate there is a lot on-going in other directorates. But we must work in an integrated manner, which means that our overall approach is coherent.” Annual assessment The first annual report will be a critical milestone in the implementation of the Code of Conduct. Will national differences in attitudes towards methods of achieving this implementation make an objective and impartial report more difficult to achieve? “Itt is clear there is not a single Member State that is not involved in some form of cooperation with regard to capability development, though to significantly different degrees. We are assuming they have an inventory of these cooperative projects or initiatives and I am therefore pretty sanguine that we will receive meaningful  inputs or reports from them”, said Muir. “What will also be useful is to use EDA as a platform of information exchange on bilateral or regional initiatives both to share best practice and facilitate synergies. The result should be a clear picture of the capability map across Europe,” said Muir. How does one define “capability”? Would military air traffic control qualify, for example? “Yes I think it probably would,” said Muir. “Anything required to enable operations and deliver the necessary military effect is a capability. Some of these are lethal, but there is a huge range of such capabilities that might be less visible, but without which an operation could not succeed. When issues of sovereignty come to the fore it is sometimes easier to get nations to cooperate on capabilities that are not necessarily front line, such as logistics, medical support or training. Cooperating in support functions not only brings efficiencies and economies; it also proves the concept.  And it should demonstrate that shared sovereignty does not mean loss of sovereignty,” Muir said. The annual report, when produced towards the end of 2013, will have to answer questions on how it relates to other EU initiatives, particularly the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). Muir believes that, in line with the code’s “work in progress” status, the report will address substantive issues at the same time as recognising the need for continual effort. “I would expect to see acknowledgement of the requirement for further work in as yet unidentified areas. This process – especially the capability mapping process – is going to help identify gaps and redundancies. This could help Member States to determine capability development on a coherent basis for the future,” he said. “There is a great degree of solidarity and trust between Member States in terms of operating and fighting alongside each other. The real benefit of the Code of Conduct may eventually be to embed that solidarity and trust within the DNA of Member States so that they also pool and share the very capabilities needed to conduct those operations in the future,” he concluded.

EDA_NEWS_0765	2013-09-05	NEWS	First Collective Air-to-Air Refuelling Clearance Trial	" The European Defence Agency, Italy and the Movement Coordination Centre Europe (MCCE) jointly organise the first collective European Air-to-Air Refuelling (AAR) clearance trial on the Italian KC767. Starting on 5 September, aircraft from France (Mirage 2000, Rafale) and Sweden (Gripen) participate in the campaign to obtain technical and operational AAR clearances against the Italian strategic airlift tanker. AAR is a critical European capability gap and one of the eleven Pooling & Sharing priorities of the European Defence Agency (EDA). Mandated by Defence Ministers in March 2012, EDA is engaged in four work strands in this domain: short-term gap filling; optimisation of existing assets; optimisation of AAR capacity offered by the future A400M fleet and enhancement of Europe’s strategic tanker capability by creating a multinational Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) capability. “Italy’s AAR clearance initiative is a cost efficient way to quickly close an important capability gap regarding tanker-receiver certification; given the urgency based on lessons learned from recent operations, we would have welcomed more nations to participate in the clearance campaign”, says Claude-France Arnould, Executive Director of the European Defence Agency. Aerial Refuelling Clearance Technical and operational clearances are mandatory to provide or receive fuel and they are thus a prerequisite to interoperability in multinational operations. Taking place in Italy at Decimomannu airbase from 5 to 12 September, France and Sweden will be able to perform the necessary ground and in-flight tests to obtain missing AAR clearances. Today Europe can deploy 42 tanker aircraft of twelve different types for which more than 40% of required clearances are missing. While for critical requirements and war-time operations clearances limited to a specific operation can be issued on a case by case basis, this campaign allows for a coordinated approach for full and unrestricted clearances. This increases the flexibility of AAR operations and facilitates immediate deployment of assets in future. Benefits EDA’s collective AAR certification campaign is first of its kind; it allows several Member States to obtain the necessary technical and operational clearances in the minimum amount of time for a maximum amount of receivers. Up to now, this process had to be organised on a bilateral level. Organising a collective campaign facilitates the procedure for Member States, increases interoperability and saves time, human resources and costs. Background AAR is a critical enabler for air power projection and it is required to enable anything beyond short range air combat operations. A unique force multiplier, it is a fundamental capability embedded in modern aircraft design, not just in combat aircraft, but across the full spectrum of air platforms – including in the near future Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems.   More information Pictures are available on Flickr.  News ""Aerial Refuelling Clearance for Italian KC-767"" (8 Feb 2013) News ""Increasing Europe’s Strategic Tanker Capability by 2020"" (28 Nov 2012) Air-to-air refuelling project page  "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/09/05/first-collective-air-to-air-refuelling-clearance-trial
EDA_NEWS_0766	2013-08-14	NEWS	Innovative Unmanned Maritime Systems Research	" The EDA has developed an innovative, flexible way to manage complex, long-term defence research, reports Philip Butterworth-Hayes in the third issue of the Agency’s European Defence Matters magazine. It is one of the biggest challenges facing defence organizations around the world: how can you flexibly manage a vital, strategic military research programme encompassing a host of related but independent technologies – from initial academic research to developing a systems platform – over a long period, when economic conditions and threat environments change? When this challenge is spread across a whole continent the institutional and economic issues become even more complex. This has been the challenge that EDA has faced with its €53.7 million Unmanned Maritime Systems (UMS) programme, which aims to deliver advanced maritime mine counter-measures and related technologies in the second half of this decade (see also European Defence Matters, issue one). Its solution has been to develop a flexible, integrated research programme within the research and technology (R&T) Directorate of the Agency, with 14 different projects and encompassing a total of 11 participating Member States (pMS), each with different areas of interest. In parallel, pMSs have launched Maritime Mine Counter Measures (MMCM) work in the Armaments Directorate which aims at the common development and procurement of MMCM assets in the shorter term. Maritime Mine Counter Measures a Capability Priority From the outset the MMCM work strand has been a ‘live’ exercise, expanding and developing to meet the needs of the participants. “It was initiated within the Capability Directorate in 2008, as MMCM was identified as one of the 12 capability priorities. The idea was to bring nations together to develop further a Common Staff Target already developed at an earlier stage and to prepare for the replacement of MMCM capabilities currently in service in EU nations,” said Bart Stoelinga, Senior Officer For Maritime Programmes. “When the concept was further developed it became obvious we were looking at a stand-off, unmanned solution. We had a number of discussions in the Agency and among pMSs and from the broad idea of an unmanned, standoff concept a number of projects were identified that would need a technical solution by 2018. The UMS programme was started to work on these different areas.” Ministers approved the UMS programme as an R&T programme in 2009, but it has evolved considerably over the years. New work strands have been added and others were redefined; this year will see the start of a new work strand on the use of fuel cells in unmanned underwater vehicles while other elements of the work are being extended. “It’s a living programme,” said Jari Hartikainen, Technology Manager R&T Directorate. ""Different smaller projects can be introduced by Member States into the wider programme framework to meet their own national interests. This supports specialisation, so small countries can participate in work which reflects their own expertise and it also means these countries, with relatively small budgets, can acquire a great deal of knowledge in this important area of research.” The aim is to develop technologies, within the R&T programme, which can be carried forward into an Armaments Directorate development project. By closely linking the detailed R&T work with the strategic Capability Development Plan (CDP), which is being constantly updated, the idea is to minimize waste in resources from duplicated research. The CDP gives direction to the work carried out in the programme. The Capability Directorate has carried out a landscaping study on future naval requirements to highlight (future) capability gaps and the R&T Directorate has organised a number of workshops on the strategic research agenda to identify critical areas where work needs to be carried out. Meanwhile, the Industry and Market Directorate has commissioned a study of key industrial capabilities in the naval domain. Reliance on civilian R&T developments is a growing trend and in research areas such as batteries, navies invest only in defence specific R&T as this is a generic technology with relevant work being undertaken elsewhere. “We also organised a joint workshop with the European Commission in May 2012 to compare what we are both doing and to see how defence and civilian R&T can support each other,” said Jari Hartikainen. “Key technology challenges, such as autonomous operation, underwater communications, sensors and efficient power systems are common to both military and civilian systems.” Identifying Opportunities for Collaboration in Research The work in the UMS programme spans also more general issues, such as systems integration, standardization, safety and regulations. “Unmanned systems are not recognized in international shipping rules,” said Jari Hartikainen, “which is a major obstacle against their widespread use.” Standardization is also an absolute prerequisite for more affordable and more interoperable systems. Participants in the UMS programme include defence organizations, industry and research institutes. “Studies which require specific scientific or industrial expertise are sometimes launched by EDA on behalf of the member states” said Bart Stoelinga. “So it’s not just about technology push. The framework of UMS allows countries to identify opportunities for collaboration in research, which will feed in to their national programmes. Some defence industries may bring technologies that they have developed trying to find solutions to problems in the air and land environment for use in the naval environment. We can capitalise on this.” One of the other major challenges is institutional: trying to find ways to align the budgets of different nations so common funding streams to agreed timelines can be developed, making best use of the collaborative process. Despite the challenges, the flexible, integrated structure of the UMS programme has worked well and EDA is in the first stages of exploring whether a similar structure could be used for research in other areas like mission modular naval ships or unmanned aerial systems.   UMS programme facts There are 11 contributing Members funding the UMS programme: Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. Of the €53.7 million budget, the industrial contribution is €6.7 million. The key UMS project areas are listed below: Robust acoustic communications for underwater networks Harbour and base protection systems Systems integration Standards and interfaces for more interoperable European unmanned maritime systems Safety and regulations for European unmanned maritime systems Conformal array performance estimation modeling Modular lightweight minesweeping Signature response analysis of multi-influence mines Network enabled cooperation system of autonomous vehicles Increased autonomy of AUVs – mission planning and obstacle avoidance Buried mines Evaluation of thin line array technologies Submarine coupled 6dof motions, including boundary effects Drifting mines detection More information:  Projects search "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/08/14/innovative-unmanned-maritime-systems-research
EDA_NEWS_0767	2013-08-19	NEWS	Effective Procurement Can Slash Equipment Costs	" One of the objectives of EDA’s pooling and sharing initiative is to promote the adoption of effective procurement methods, through the development of practical and innovative ways of ensuring greater collaborative activity. Member States could potentially make savings of between 20 to 50 per cent in military equipment and services by adopting shared procurement practices. A number of Member States have asked the agency to suggest a series of best practices in equipment procurement which could deliver substantial savings and, according to EDA’s Senior Officer for Defence Market Reinhard Marak, these are realistic savings. In implementing a ‘user club’ for Leopard main battle tanks which includes common purchasing of spares, Germany – as the lead nation – demonstrated for 21 predefined items where full competition could be applied very rapid savings of €9 million, or 25 per cent. When Estonia wished to buy new radar systems, by collaborating with Finland it achieved a 50 per cent saving over the price originally quoted for solo procurement. The biggest burden on equipment procurement rests with the development phase, so any capacity to short-cut the path to collaborative acquisition using off-the-shelf methods has to be worthy of serious consideration. The agency has no plans to become a procurement agency but rather focuses on its capability to facilitate joint or harmonised acquisition of a wide range of products and services. It has a unique capability in that it can provide a full spectrum of commonality from concept development through to implementation. Furthermore EDA has a good understanding of market issues and has established a number of tools, such as the Collaborative Database (CODABA), the Third Party Logistic Support (TPLS) Platform and the Procurement Experts Network (PEN) that can be used to identify matches of demand. EDA is the only body specifically mentioned within the EU Defence Procurement Directive as having a potential central purchasing role. With an estimated 20 to 30 per cent of European defence procurement cases potentially standing to benefit from harmonisation of requirements and collaborative procurement, this is an initiative whose time has most definitely come. “And the really good thing about this is that this is what industry wants too. As a contribution to both consolidation of demand and standardisation, this is an initiative that serves the Member States’ requirements for cost-effective procurement as well as the requirements of industry for greater efficiency,” said Marak. Feedback from the Member States on early implementation of the initiative has been very encouraging. In a data collection exercise on pooling and sharing conducted by the EU Military Committee in late 2011, Member States identified procurement as their preferred option for pooling and sharing in a number of domains, including transport and logistic support – medical support and evacuation, helicopter availability, camp construction and supply, education and training – ranging from flight and pilot training through to chemical warfare and logistics support training, vehicles, ammunition, weapons and individual equipment – from light weapons, mines and explosives to rocket launchers and auxiliary field artillery equipment – and communications. While not, perhaps, completely exhaustive, such a list is at least comprehensive and gives EDA wide scope to implement further measures to promote effective procurement methods. The challenge now is to translate common demand into common action and, in Marak’s words, “to use existing tools in a better way.” Experience as a former international legal officer for the Austrian Ministry of Defence, prior to coming to EDA in September 2008, provides him with a thorough background against which to measure the viability and effectiveness of such measures in the complex arena of multilateral procurement.   This article was first published in issue 1 of EDA’s magazine “European Defence Matters”.

EDA_NEWS_0768	2013-07-29	NEWS	Hot Blade 2013: Distinguished Visitors at Exercise	 The HB13 Distinguished Visitors Day (DVD) was organised on 25 July to present the multinational helicopter training to both host nation and international delegations. After the signature of the leading document of the HEP Programme Arrangement by the 13 cMS in November 2012, the focus in HB13 DVD was directed to the military operators from the operational and tactical levels in order to promote the need for even more helicopter assets to be participating in the future exercises. The EDA Helicopter PM briefed the visitors from PT, CZ, DE, AT and NL on the status of the EDA helicopter projects and he underlined the important links amongst the HEP, HTC and HTIC as well as the need bring furher players into the projects. The Portuguese delegation was led by the Secretary of State Attached to the Minister of defence, Chief of Defence and Chiefs of Staff of Air Force, Army and Navy. Together with the EDA Deputy Chief Executive and international visitors from the HEP cMS, all guests had an excellent opportunity to watch the capabilities in a live demostration, which was the Composite Air Operation (COMAO) training mission.   The graduates from the EHTIC (SE and DE) and UK instructors are present at the exercise this year to have the direct influence on the exercise mission planning and execution. They are part of the brief sequence and get on board of helicopters to assist during the complex missions. They provide the immediate feedback to the mission commanders, package leaders and crews making sure that the mission conduct reflects the standards set in the HEP SOP. This document is reviewed in the course of the exercise by the participating crews to contain the latest lessons from the training missions. The concept of employing the EHTIC instructors into the HEP exercise proves to be the right way ahead and these experts will be involved already in the planning process of the next HEP exercise. So far seven COMAO missions and more than 450 hours have been flown during HB13 in the 'day' and 'night' multinational training scenarios.   More information: Visit EDA's HB13 webpage. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/07/29/hot-blade-2013-distinguished-visitors-at-exercise
EDA_NEWS_0769	2013-08-01	NEWS	Hot Blade 2013: Successful Second Exercise in Portugal	" More than 750 personnel from five countries (Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Portugal) participated in the successful second edition of the multinational helicopter exercise, taking place in Portugal from 17 to 31 July. During HB13 a total of 324 sorties with 962,42 helicopter hours were flown.  HB13 is designed to allow European helicopter crews to practice operations in a hot, high and dusty environment, simulating the challenge and the dynamic conditions that participating forces will encounter when they deploy to a current Theatre of Operation (TO). Besides the focus on flying in challenging environmental conditions, the exercise is developed to implement ""Joint Interoperability Training"" including Air Assault, Special Operations Aviation, Combat Service Support, Close Air Support including Urban CAS and Emergency CAS, Convoy/helicopter escorts, Reconnaissance and Security operations, Combat Search and Rescue, Personnel Recovery, Military/Non Military extractions, Medical Evacuation and Casualty Evacuation. Based on the lessons identified during the exercise, an updated version of the Standard Operation Procedures elaborated within EDA’s Helicopter Exercise Programme will be made available to contributing Member States in the next week. The work on the procedures started in January this year and they might become the baseline for further European cooperation in the field of helicopters.  Feedback from the participating Member States was excellent, highlighting the perfect organisation and support by Portugal as host nation as well as the importance of such multinational training.     More information: Access the HB13 web page Pictures are available on Flickr.

EDA_NEWS_0770	2013-07-31	NEWS	Common Procurement of Carl Gustav Ammunition Expands	" Poland joins Joint Procurement Initiative on Carl Gustav Ammunition, Czech Republic initiates accession. The recently launched EDA Joint Procurement Initiative on the common purchase of different kinds of ammunition for the Carl Gustav recoilless multi-purpose rifle attracts additional customers. Given the opportunities of pooling demand and the communalities of the ammunition purchased through this common procurement, initiated by the three Baltic Countries, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and Polish national needs, Poland decided to join the Joint Procurement Initiative in early July. On Monday this week, their accession became valid by virtue of an exchange of letters between the Polish Ministry of Defence and the EDA. Additionally, the Czech Republic announced today that they too want to become a contributing Member State to this common project and join the Joint Procurement Initiative. EDA acts as a central purchasing body in this common effort and is tendering a respective five years framework agreement, with a possible renewal of two more years, allowing all contributing Members to purchase ammunition according to their national needs. EDA’s Deputy Chief Executive, Rini Goos, welcomed the expansion of the Common Carl Gustav Procurement by saying: “EDA is a facilitator and multiplier for European defence cooperation. This common procurement initiative illustrates the success of our approach: It all started with three countries choosing EDA as their vehicle for cooperation; a couple of months later we have two additional countries on board.” More information: News ""Baltic Defence Ministries Sign Joint Ammunition Procurement Arrangement"" (23 April 2013)  Effective Procurement Methods project page "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/07/31/common-procurement-of-carl-gustav-ammunition-expands
EDA_NEWS_0771	2013-07-26	NEWS	Hot Blade 2013: Fruitful Training Week for Helicopter Crews	" The second week of Hot Blade 2013 Helicopter Exercise is now close to its conclusion. This week offered some new and challenging missions testing the capabilities of the involved military and allowing European helicopters crews to train and qualify in complex scenarios, similar to real operations theatres, as well as to improve the interoperability among the participating Nations. Formation flight session To fly in formation was on one of the possibilities that the HB13 provided to its participants during this week of exercise. Formation flight means the disciplined flight of two or more aircraft under the command of a flight “Leader”. All the other aircraft involved are called ""wings."" There are several possible formations and the 751 Squadron, EH-101 Merlin already had the opportunity to flight in formation with the Dutch and the Austrians in this edition of HB13. The Austrian OH-58 KIOWA and the Dutch CH-47D CHINNOOK joined the Portuguese EH-101 Merlin and put into practice the theory gained. The military use this kind of flight for mutual support training and for capabilities sharing. It is a type of flight that increases the capabilities of the aircraft involved: greater security and the possibility of more cargo and personnel transport. Furthermore, the flight formation can significantly increase the overall aerodynamic efficiency. It can also reduce drag, increasing the flight range. This fulfills one of the objectives of HB13: to increase the participating forces interoperability. Aviation aficionados 1st visit  Tuesday 23 July was the day dedicated to aviation enthusiasts, either professionals or amateurs. There were sixty people who assured their place at Ovar Air Base with a prior registration. The objective was to capture the aircraft best moments and images. These aviation experts had the opportunity to go through several observation points which were set up for this purpose, a privileged access to all air operations. At the end of the day, a closing briefing took place where an overall opinion about the day was collected. The enthusiasts said they had enjoyed each moment and the exercise had surpassed their expectations.

While taking stock of such cooperative items as Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), Ms. Arnould and Mr. Dordain have agreed to pursue their cooperation on such key policy topics relating to space and security as governmental satellite communications, navigation, or Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR).   Claude-France Arnould and her delegation visited ESA’s Concurrent Design Facility (CDF), where a comprehensive overview of ESA’s asset was given with specific focus on the now concluded ESA-EDA cooperation on ISR Capability Package Assessment (ICPA). Visiting ESA’s Test Center allowed EDA to learn more about BepiColombo, an ambitious European scientific mission to Mercury, and to exchange views with Didier Faivre, Director for Navigation, on Galileo. Space is a key area of action within EDA’s mandate to develop, for its Member States, key defence capabilities necessary both for decision-making and operations. Following the signing of the 2008 ESA-EDA Administrative Arrangement, cooperation has significantly increased between the two European organizations, spurring increased momentum and civ-mil synergies in this intrinsically dual use area. Space is embedded in several EDA initiatives. “EDA’s Member States are expressing support for exploring future capability packages in governmental satcoms, which I believe would greatly benefit from a civil-military approach with ESA and Member States alike, building on the strong experience of ESA. ESA and EDA will be looking at the best way to synchronize to make sure we reap the most benefits from civ-mil synergies for our respective activities and mandates, for example the Advanced Research in Telecommunications Systems programme”, said Ms. Arnould. “A second workstrand is Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems. In this regard, the successful DeSIRE demonstration of satellites enabling the insertion of RPAS in Europe, an ESA-EDA cooperation demonstrating the ability to use satellite communications to pilot a UAV in general air traffic, which took place on 24 April, is a very solid project”, she added. EDA is now looking into expanding activities in this regard with DeSIRE II, linked to the larger issue of traffic insertion and single European sky, which is being undertaken in collaboration with ESA’s Integrated Applications Programme. A novel cooperative avenue will be Cyber defence. “Cyber security needs to incorporate the space segment in capabilities development”, said Ms. Arnould. EDA is committed to pursuing the space policy drive in the context of the European Council of December 2013, where Heads of States and Governments will address defence. The April 2013 Steering Board of EDA already paved the way towards this end, namely in the area of governmental satellite communications, cyberdefence and RPAS.

EDA_NEWS_0774	2013-07-17	NEWS	Hot Blade 2013: Preparing Together for Operations	 Starting today, Portugal hosts the multinational helicopter exercise HOT BLADE 2013 (HB13) at Ovar Military Airfield, near Porto. More than 700 military personnel, 26 helicopters and seven fixed wing aircraft from Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Portugal participate in the exercise, which lasts until 31 July 2013. HB13 is part of the European Defence Agency's Helicopter Training Programme. HB13 allows European helicopter crews to practice operations in a hot, high and dusty environment, simulating the challenge and the dynamic conditions that participating forces encounter if they deploy to current theatres of operation. Besides the focus on flying in challenging environmental conditions, the exercise is developed to train joint interoperability tasks including Air Assault (AA), Special Operations Aviation (SOA), Combat Service Support (CSS), Close Air Support (CAS) including Urban CAS and Emergency CAS, Convoy/helicopter escorts, Reconnaissance and Security (R&S) operations, Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR), Personnel Recovery (PR), Military/Non Military extractions (NEO Ops), Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) and Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC). The exercise is developed on a building block approach design, starting with cross-training activities on small COMAO missions, in order to build a mutual understanding of each participant’s equipment and standard operational procedures. As the exercises progresses the complexity and numbers of assets in each COMAO missions increase. Crews from all nations will use for the first time standing operating procedures. Helicopter Training Programme HB13 builds on EDA’s Helicopter Training Programme which is consisting of the HEP (Helicopter Exercise Programme), HTC (Helicopter Tactics Course), EHTIC (European Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course), OELC (Operational English Language Course), DisSim CCD (Distributed Simulation Capability Concept Demonstrator) and the Basic Helicopter Flying Training (BHFT) projects/programmes. The exercise programme has so far delivered five multinational exercises with 123 helicopters, 227 crews and over 5,000 personnel participating. Over 50% crews that have attended these exercises later subsequently deployed to Afghanistan. In November 2012, defence ministers of thirteen nations signed a ten years programme arrangement for the Helicopter Exercise Programme. This commitment is a concrete indication that training together is an integral part of European capability and interoperability. “HB13 is the 6th EDA helicopter exercise, but it is also the first in many ways. It is the first exercise in a 10-year programme agreed by thirteen countries, it is the first exercise where we are flying to commonly agreed procedures, and most excitingly for me, it is the first exercise where we have been able to introduce instructors – who themselves are graduates from the first European Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course. These instructors drawn from Germany, Sweden and UK are the ‘best of the best’ and I am looking forward to seeing them mentor some of the less experienced crews, as they meet the planning and flying challenges of the exercise”, said Wing Commander Andy Gray, in charge of EDA’s Helicopter Training Programme.

EDA_NEWS_0775	2013-07-22	NEWS	Defence Data 2011	 The European Defence Agency (EDA) today published the aggregated defence data for 2011 of the (then) 26 EDA participating Member States. Total defence expenditure down by € 1 bln In 2011, total defence expenditure of EDA 26 pMS amounted to € 192.5 billion - a reduction of € 1 billion or 0.5% compared to 2010 – representing approximately 1.55% of their total GDP and 3.17% of their total government expenditure, both values being the lowest since 2006. In real terms , total defence expenditure has been decreasing since 2006 and between 2010 and 2011 it dropped by over 2%. Defence investment (procurement and R&D) at its lowest level since 2006 Personnel-related expenditure of € 98.6 billion accounted for 51.1% of total defence spending – virtually unchanged since 2009. The second biggest component – operation and maintenance expenditure – increased by 3.6% and accounted for 23.5% (€ 45.2 bln) of total defence expenditure. However, defence investment, comprising equipment procurement and R&D expenditure, saw a sharp decrease of almost 14% bringing its value down to the lowest level since 2006 (€ 37.0 billion or 19.2% of total expenditure). Both components of investment contributed to the decrease: equipment procurement dropped by 15% (€ 29.2 bln or 15.2% of total expenditure), and R&D expenditure – by 9% (€ 7.8 bln or 4.0% of total expenditure). As for Research and Technology , expenditure increased by 3.5% up to € 2.15 billion reversing a downward trend since 2006. Increase in collaborative procurement and R&T In 2011, 27,1% or € 7.9 bln of total defence equipment procurement expenditure was spent on collaborative projects – a slight increase compared to 2010. Of this, 92,7% (€ 7.3 bln) were European collaborations. Although the share of European collaborations in total collaborative equipment procurement decreased by 2% from 2010 to 2011, it nevertheless remained higher than in previous years. As for R&T, expenditure on collaborative projects and programmes increased by 25.6% breaking a downward trend since 2009, and in 2011 it stood at € 331 mln representing 15.4% of total R&T spend. European collaborative R&T expenditure also increased in absolute terms by over 15% reaching € 283 mln (13.2% of total R&T spend), but as a share of total collaborative R&T expenditure it decreased from 93.1% in 2010 to 85.4% in 2011, its lowest value since 2007. Numbers of military and civilian personnel continue to drop while expenditure per soldier increases In 2011, there was a reduction of both civilian and military personnel for the fifth consecutive year. Military personnel (81% of total staff working in defence) decreased by 4.3% to 1.55 million. Civilian personnel decreased by 3.9% to 374 thousand. Whilst personnel numbers reduced, defence expenditure per soldier increased by almost 4% reaching € 124 thousand. Defence investment per soldier, however, decreased by almost 10% and stood at € 24 thousand in 2011. Reduction in troops deployed, but cost of operations increase As regards deployed operations outside the EU territory, similarly to the last two years, the average number of troops deployed decreased in 2011 both in absolute terms (from 66 to 54 thousand) and as a share of military personnel (from 4.1% to 3.5%) and is now at its lowest value since 2006. However, costs related to the deployed operations increased substantially (by 12.4% from 2010 to 2011) for the fifth consecutive year, reaching € 11.7 million or 6.1% of total defence expenditure. Operations costs per military deployed have also been steadily increasing, and from 2006 to 2011 it nearly tripled reaching € 218 thousand. Progress made on three out of four collective benchmarks In 2007, EDA pMS agreed on a set of collective benchmarks for investment. There is no obligation in terms of timeline or adoption of these benchmarks into national targets, but they can assist pMS in spending more on investment. In 2011, three out of four indicators made progress towards the agreed benchmarks. R&T expenditure broke a downward trend for the first time since 2006 increasing its share in total defence expenditure slightly from its lowest value in 2010 (1.07%) to 1.12%. It, nevertheless, remains well below the agreed 2% benchmark. At the national level, not a single participating Member States reached the 2% target in 2011. The share of European collaborative R&T expenditure in total defence R&T spend also increased reaching 13.2% but remains below the 20% benchmark. The biggest progress was observed in European collaborative equipment procurement. As a share of total equipment procurement, it increased by 4 percentage points from 21.2% to 25.2%, the highest value since 2006, although still below the 35% benchmark. There was, however, a retrograde step in defence investment (equipment procurement and R&D). Being above the 20% benchmark between 2007 and 2010, in 2011 it dropped to 19.2% of total expenditure on defence, which is lower than the 2006 level. Background The European Defence Agency collects defence data on an annual basis. The Ministries of Defence of the Agency’s participating Member States provide the data. EDA acts as the custodian of the data and publishes the aggregated figures. 1 In order to measure real growth and ensure a “real” comparison between years, inflation needs to be taken into account. Thus, data from 2006 to 2010 has been inflated to 2011 economic conditions (Source of deflator: European Commission ECFIN – based on weight of EU 27). 2 R&T is a subset of R&D which includes only basic research, applied research and technology demonstration, leaving out expenditure for demonstration or development for which a decision to procure has been taken.

EDA_NEWS_0777	2013-07-02	NEWS	EATT13: High Satisfaction among Participants	 EATT13 received outstanding testimony from its 350 participants. 65% participated in an evaluation survey and 99% of them stated that they would recommend participation in next year’s EATT to their colleagues; 96% found the flying event valuable for them. On a scale from 1 (negative) to 5 (positive), overall rating of EATT13 was at 3,9 which shows high satisfaction regarding the event. In total, EATT13 included 350 aircrew and ground personnel from eight nations on twelve aircraft. During the two weeks training period, 112 sorties in increasing complexity were carried out. Due to bad weather and technical malfunctions, this number stays below the planned 143 sorties but well above the 98 from EATT12. 435 paratroopers were dropped and all static line and bundle drops were executed. Most importantly, almost all training requirements were met with a very high success ratio. For 2014, two events are planned for which already potentially 16 participating nations indicated interest in participating. “EATT was an extremely successful flying event. We were able to provide the necessary framework to allow nations to fulfill their training requirements. Congratulations to all of you and see you in 2014”, said Laurent Donnet, EDA Assistant Capability Manager Manœuvre and Deputy Exercise Director at the closing of EATT13.   More information: Visit the EATT13 webpage  Read more on the European Air Transport Fleet  View the EATT13 Factsheet Pictures from EATT13 are published on Flickr.   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/07/02/eatt13-high-satisfaction-among-participants
EDA_NEWS_0778	2013-07-15	NEWS	DTEB Database: A Future EDA Tool for Test & Evaluation Capabilities Development	 The Defence Test and Evaluation Base (DTEB) is a mechanism to increase the Pooling & Sharing of experimentation, test and evaluation capabilities for EU Member States. The DTEB is being progressed with the governance arrangements of the DTEB Development Plan agreed in 2010. An initial requirement set by pMS was the need for capability information sharing. To meet this initial requirement, a web-based, access protected, DTEB Database is currently in preparation at EDA and scheduled to go online in 2014. The overall objective of the DTEB Database project is to put in place, on a European scale, a Test & Evaluation (T&E) support tool to improve information sharing during the development or acquisition of defence equipment. The project will help answer the need of continuous optimisation of T&E capabilities and adaptation to nationally and internationally defined requirements. Participating T&E centres defined at national level, T&E experts as well as capability programme managers and other users will be entitled to access and contribute to the database. Participating T&E Centres will be able to: show and offer their own T&E capabilities to the European Defence Community be considered in European Capability, Research and Armament projects participate in European Pooling & Sharing initiatives DTEB end-users will be able to:  quickly identify potential cooperation partners for T&E activities  implement European T&E capabilities in their projects  quickly obtain details of Subject Matter Experts to seek advice Transparency of information on T&E plans and activities, visibility of T&E capabilities, harmonisation of methods, cooperation between T&E facilities and competencies will be key elements to ensure the effectiveness of DTEB. This is why a bottom-up approach to this database application will guide the initiative. Test & Evaluation Centres recognised at national level and governmental defence project managers are invited to join and to express interest for participation. Once launched, the DTEB Database will constitute a valuable tool for T&E experts, industrial consortium and programme managers, who will benefit from the database as final users.

EDA_NEWS_0779	2013-07-03	NEWS	Resilient Threat Management 2013: Proceedings Available	" The Resilient Threat Management (RTM) 2013 conference, held on 4 – 6 March 2013, was an effort to bring the Counter IED community together to take stock of the past and look to the future. Although the presence of armed forces in Afghanistan will reduce significantly, the threat of the IED still remains.  It is the weapon of choice among adversaries and will continue to be that in the future. The difference is that in the future they will combine IEDs with other asymmetric threats to spread chaos and fear among the general public in order reach their goals. The only way to defeat the IED is to defeat the network and the only way to do that is through a comprehensive approach. The RTM 2013 conference embraces that approach as can be seen from the proceedings. It further highlights the need to learn from recent operations in order to be better prepared for the future. It also shows the need for increased civil-military cooperation across borders and between international organisations. Technology has also a role to play but requires proper guidance in order to be able to deliver effective capability enhancing contributions. Within EDA a number of activities have been successfully running since 2008. Key achievements to date include: A novel train-the trainer approach enabling Member States to nationally develop key skills resulting in programmes on Search, Ground Sign Awareness, Combat Tracking and Manual Neutralisation Techniques; The definition, acquisition, design and deployment of an in-theatre forensic exploitation capability manned by a multinational team in record time. Operational since autumn 2011, EDA’s Counter-IED laboratory shows the effectiveness of forensics as an integral part to the ISAF operation; A wide range of efforts and projects addressing new protective systems for vehicles and personnel; a scenario-driven approach to optimising the use of detection techniques and technologies; a “Black Box” concept for vehicles.   Following the March conference the Project Team Counter IED has been developing a solid strategy for the future. It is envisaged that first edition of the new strategy will be ready in the autumn of 2013.

EDA_NEWS_0781	2013-06-28	NEWS	European Defence Agency Launches Defence Procurement Gateway	" The European Defence Agency officially launched a new section on its website dedicated to defence related business opportunities and information. This new “Defence Procurement Gateway” will allow European governments, industry and academia to easily access information related to defence procurement at EU and national levels. “The Defence Procurement Gateway is a user-friendly tool designed to increase awareness and visibility of defence business opportunities and information. This is not a complex new system. We simply feed available information from a number of open sources into one tool”, said Peter Scaruppe, Director Industry & Market at the European Defence Agency. Aimed at enhancing transparency in the European Defence Equipment Market, the web-based tool offers unique access to a comprehensive set of European defence procurement information and business opportunities. The gateway provides information on defence procurement opportunities published at EU level through Tenders Electronic Daily, the online version of the Supplement to the European Official Journal dedicated to European public procurement, as well as other defence contract opportunities published at national level or by European organisations and agencies such as the EDA. Specifically for governments the gateway contains such functions as the new EDA e-QUIP portal and CODABA. In addition, it brings together in one single place all relevant EU Regulations (e.g. directives and specific guidance notes published by the European Commission), court and infringement cases, EDA Codes of Conduct, EDA Procurement Rules & Regulations, specific EDA portals (i.e. EDSIS, REACh, Security of Supply), national directories (including access to national procurement policy related websites), industry directories (containing also information on defence industry associations at EU and national level) as well as information on relevant training and conferences. The Defence Procurement Gateway will additionally include an industry directory (“Yellow Pages” section) serving as a platform for European defence industry to market its knowledge and expertise in the defence domain. So far, about 80 companies have registered to be listed in this section. More registrations are expected after its launch. The Defence Procurement Gateway is accessible through the EDA website (www.eda.europa.eu/procurement-gateway) with many of its features being publicly available. The tool will be constantly updated and monitored by the Agency.    More information: Procurement Gateway News ""Register for European Defence Directory (Yellow Pages)"" (11 June 2013)   "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/06/28/european-defence-agency-launches-defence-procurement-gateway
EDA_NEWS_0782	2013-06-20	NEWS	EDA Proposes Pooling & Sharing of Governmental SATCOM	" At a high-level seminar on governmental satellite communication (SATCOM) at the International Paris Airshow “Le Bourget” on 19 June the European Defence Agency (EDA) presented and discussed its “Secure Telecom by Satellite” (SECTELSAT) concept for future governmental SATCOM. Currently, five European nations operate military satellite communication assets: the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain and Germany. In the timeframe 2018-2025 all these assets will need to be replaced. This creates a unique opportunity for Pooling & Sharing this type of satellites which EDA is promoting with its “Secure Telecom by Satellite” (SECTELSAT) concept for a European-wide use of governmental SATCOM. The intergovernmental approach proposed by EDA suggests a cross-use of future governmental assets on a broader basis and significant synergies if future programmes can be coordinated.  “With its European Satellite Communication Procurement Cell (ESCPC), the European Defence Agency has already delivered a concrete Pooling & Sharing tool in the area of commercial satellite communications. Our proposal for governmental SATCOM goes one step further. Pooling & Sharing of critical assets is an opportunity as much as a necessity in times of tight defence budgets and eroding capabilities”, says Claude-France Arnould, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency, at the opening of the high-level seminar. Secure Telecom by Satellite EDA’s concept includes the pooling of future assets with a coordinated approach to collect and harmonise national requirements of EU Member States that operate MILSATCOM, and possibly to pave the way for future cooperative ad hoc programmes. At the same time, it proposes to share future assets by leasing parts of governmental SATCOM for defence and security services to additional Member States (including Norway and Switzerland) with significant requirements. Future assets would also be shared by offering a new capability package that could benefit from EU funding for its internal and external connectivity needs through more resilient networks. High-Level Seminar The high-level seminar was divided into an open seminar on SATCOM policies and plans with speakers from the EDA, the EU Military Committee, the European Commission, the European Space Agency, EU Member States and industry representatives. During the closed afternoon session capability planners and governmental SATCOM programme managers discussed the way ahead, an action plan as well as possible Pooling & Sharing options. Background  In military operations satellite communications are fundamental for Communication, Command and Control. They also allow operational effectiveness of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance platforms, including Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems. In 2012 the Agency launched the European Satellite Communications Procurement Cell (ESCPC) to pool and share commercial satellite communications services. Five Member States (France, Italy, Poland, Romania and the United Kingdom) participate in a framework contract the Agency concluded with Astrium Services to use commercial bands. ESCPC can for instance support outsourced logistic services with the provision of a backbone network for any national, EU-led or coalition operation.

EDA_NEWS_0784	2013-06-20	NEWS	A Coordinated Response to Cyber Threats	" In view of the recent publication of the Cyber Security Strategy for the European Union, the Irish Presidency, in association with the Estonian Ministry of Defence and the European Defence Agency, organised a high-level EU Cyber Security conference in Brussels on 20 June. The conference aimed to advance the debate on European Union Member States’ preparedness to face cyber threats at national level and across the EU as a whole. The growth of cyber attacks on critical private, government and defence networks requires a coordinated response at the EU level and across Member States. To successfully counter this emerging cyber threat, cooperation between national security, defence, law enforcement and technical incident response organisations within and between Member States needs to be encouraged to identify and exploit synergies. The conference brought together key policy-makers across the EU cyber community to highlight preventative measures, the need for cooperation and crisis response procedures to the mounting cyber security challenge. After keynote speeches delivered by Mr Alan Shatter, Ireland’s Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence and Mr Jaak Aaviksoo, Estonia’s Minister for Education and Research, the first panel concentrated on a strategic view as to how the EU can protect itself against cyber threats. Mr Maciej Popowski (EEAS), Amb Gabor Iklody (NATO), Mme Claude-France Arnould (EDA) and Amb Jean-François Blarel (French Ministry of Foreign Affairs) discussed how to develop increased information sharing, early warning, and crisis response as well as closer cooperation between EU and NATO. While the second panel looked at crisis response systems, the third panel discussed cyber resilience in the EU with a view to public and private cooperation. Looking ahead to the European Council in December including defence topics, the final session of the conference dealt with requirements and capability development in cyber security and cyber defence. Topics discussed were cyber defence requirements for CSDP operations, synergies between civil R&D and military R&T as well as cyber security/defence “Dual-Use” capabilities.

EDA_NEWS_0786	2013-06-14	NEWS	European Defence Agency Launches e-Quip, the On-Line Defence Market	 The European Defence Agency (EDA) today officially launched e-Quip, its government to government electronic market place for surplus defence equipment. Through e-Quip national governments can exchange information on available assets ranging from Defence Systems and equipment, ammunition, or even space systems to services such as logistics and maintenance. With national armed forces across Europe undergoing changes, a surplus of in-service or new military equipment is expected. This trend might increase as European nations gradually withdraw from operations around the globe over the coming years. In the current financial climate European nations need to make best use of military surplus equipment. In March 2012 the European Defence Agency proposed and Defence Ministers supported the set-up of a government to government (G2G) electronic on-line market place to sell or transfer this equipment. Consequently, EDA developed, with the support of Member States’ experts, EDA’s new G2G online defence market tool, called e-QUIP. “E-Quip is a concrete and practical tool to foster cooperation among Member States. By exchanging information on available surplus equipment and services, it will help Member States not only to get best value for money but also to maintain and develop military capabilities in an environment of shrinking defence budgets”, says Giampaolo Lillo, Armaments Director of the European Defence Agency. “We see the launch of e-Quip both as a follow-up to the Ghent-initiative on enhancing national capabilities with decreasing defence budgets and as another element in the efforts towards a better functioning European defence equipment market, ensuring cost efficiency and value for money for the tax payers. EDA’s work on both dimensions is crucial. I am sure that e-Quip will be a helpful tool for both Pooling & Sharing and for a better functioning market. We welcome and support EDA’s initiative and will certainly make use of e-Quip from a national perspective”, confirms Ulf Hammarström, Director General of the Swedish Defence and Security Export Agency. Features E-Quip allows contributing Member States to exchange information on available assets. Currently, thirteen Member States have access to the platform which is open for all EDA participating Member States as well as states with which the Agency has an administrative agreement. E-Quip is designed as a cost-free, non-commercial market platform that brings together potential buyers and sellers. E-Quip allows Member States to exchange information on land, air and space as well as  naval equipment but also on cross-cutting issues such as, logistics, maintenance or other services (CBRN, training, etc.). Items under the land systems category for example can cover ammunition, protected vehicles or radar; air and space contains e.g. transport aircraft or space systems; while naval equipment can include for example sub-surface vessels. Development Process It was developed in close cooperation with the Member States to ensure meeting their exact needs. EDA does not form part of any transaction process between sellers and buyers; the Agency puts the tool at the disposal of Member States who then bilaterally finalise the transaction process. E-Quip will not be open to the public for reason of sensitivity of the offered equipment.   More information e-Quip factsheet 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/06/14/european-defence-agency-launches-e-quip-the-on-line-defence-market
EDA_NEWS_0787	2013-06-16	NEWS	Workshop: Doing Business with European Security and Defence Bodies	 On 12 June 2012, the European Defence Agency together with the Austrian Ministry of Defence and Sports and the Austrian Defence and Security Industry Association was hosting a workshop on Doing Business with European Security and Defence Bodies in Vienna. The workshop targeting governmental and industrial representatives from Austria and the Visegrad countries brought together European customers and suppliers in the field of security and defence and provided specific guidance to industries on how to successfully engage with defence and security related entities in Europe. Speakers included the Austrian Armaments Director, LtGen Freyo Apfalter, the EDA’s Armaments Director, Giampaolo Lillo and NSPA’s Director of Procurement, Patrick Fesquet, as well as high-level representatives of the European Commission, Frontex, Athena and OCCAr. The workshop tackled different fields of the European Security and Defence Market, including Security Research, Defence R&T, European Development Programmes and Off-the-Shelf Purchases of both goods and services, which are increasingly conducted through common or centralised procurement by or through EU bodies. Co-organiser Karl-Heinz Dernoschegg from the Austrian Defence and Security Industry Association stated at the end of the event that this was a perfect way to bridge the gap between supply and demand in the area of defence and security. He continued by saying that his association would be happy to host events of this kind on a more regular basis and considers this a very good model for other countries and associations to follow.   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/06/16/workshop-doing-business-with-european-security-and-defence-bodies
EDA_NEWS_0788	2013-06-19	NEWS	EASA & EDA: Civil-Military Cooperation in Aviation Safety	 Patrick Goudou, Executive Director of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and Claude-France Arnould, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency (EDA) on 18 June signed an arrangement for enhanced cooperation between the two agencies. The arrangement specifically covers the harmonisation of military aviation safety requirements with a primary focus on airworthiness. “The EDA-EASA Cooperation Arrangement will improve European civil-military cooperation in aviation safety. EDA and its Member States will profit from EASA’s experience in the field of harmonised airworthiness requirements. EDA on the other hand brings in its experience from the military side”, said Claude-France Arnould during the signature ceremony at the International Paris Airshow “Le Bourget”. Patrick Goudou added, “I am delighted to sign this agreement with EDA. The combined expertise of our two agencies is a great asset that will enable to pave the way for an effective partnership. Our common objective is to promote the highest possible aviation safety standards, in the civil and military domains.”  Both agencies expect to achieve considerable benefits from this increased cooperation, especially in areas of ‘dual use’ aircraft. One such example will be the A400M which had recently been certified by EASA in its civil aircraft configuration. This civil certification can serve as a baseline for the subsequent military certification by the respective national Military Airworthiness Authorities. Some Member States have already agreed to use EDA’s harmonised European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) for the in-service support phase of this aircraft programme.  In the field of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) close cooperation and harmonisation of civil and military rules and regulations to enable safe operations in Europe will be essential. EDA projects on air traffic insertion (DeSIRE) and mid-air collision avoidance (MIDCAS) can be preliminary enablers towards joint civil and military certification. Background In European civil aviation, EASA ensures that all civil aircraft operating within Europe are airworthy and safe. The relevant legal framework is detailed in EU regulations. This means that EASA issues aviation safety rules which are implemented the same way in all Member States following the agency’s mission of achieving a “high uniform level of civil aviation safety in Europe”.  On the military side, Member States currently have their national aviation safety systems in place. These systems are independent from each other, as each Member State is responsible for the regulation of its military and state aircraft. The results of an EDA initiated study underlined that the use of harmonised certification procedures for the development phase of multinational military aircraft programmes could generate at least 10% cost savings on industry as well as on the governments’ side, and up to 50% reduction in the programme duration. The EDA Military Airworthiness Authorities (MAWA) Forum was established by Defence Ministers in 2008 with the main objective to harmonise the European military airworthiness regulations of Member States. The MAWA Forum has already developed and approved harmonised European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) on type certification, maintenance and training as well as other supporting documents.  On invitation of EASA, EDA experts already participate as observers in EASA rulemaking groups on air traffic management, airworthiness and flight operations (RPAS).

EDA_NEWS_0789	2013-06-19	NEWS	European Defence Agency Reflects on the Need for Greater Harmonisation in Military Airworthiness	" Greater harmonisation in military airworthiness between European Member States could lead to significant cost and time savings as well as improved interoperability and other operational benefits. A common approach to the type-certification of military aircraft, together with approvals of airworthiness organisations and personnel, is essential for future Pooling & Sharing activities. During the high-level seminar on military airworthiness, organised on 18 June by the European Defence Agency (EDA) at the Paris Air Show “Le Bourget”, key European decision-maker’s discussed the enablers and perceived barriers to increased cooperation. European Member States previously operated military aviation safety systems independently from each other, with each Member State being individually responsible for the regulation of their own military and state aircraft. As a result, military airworthiness activities were conducted and regulated on a national basis, with European harmonisation only being achieved at an individual programme level and having to be repeated and developed for each new programme. This generated many challenges for multinational aircraft programmes and has been identified as one of the primary causes of delays and additional costs.  The EDA Military Airworthiness Authorities (MAWA) Forum was established by Defence Ministers in 2008 to harmonise the European military airworthiness regulations of Member States through the establishment of European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) for implementation into national military regulations. The MAWA Forum comprises of representatives from the Military Airworthiness Authorities of Member States and industry representatives. It is chaired by the EDA. High-Level Seminar The Agency’s high-level seminar aimed at increasing key European decision-maker’s awareness and visibility of the achievements made to date in the area of military airworthiness and exploring the next steps. The EDA MAWA Forum has for example approved three European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs): EMAR 21 for the initial and continued certification of military aircraft – including the approval of the design and production organisations, EMAR 145 covering the approval of maintenance organisations and the activities they undertake and EMAR 147 detailing the responsibilities of organisations responsible for the training of maintenance personnel. The EDA MAWA Forum has also approved other supporting documents and is on-track to deliver the complete set of EMARs by the end of 2015.  Panellists in the seminar included high level representatives from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), European aerospace industry, Ministries of Defence and National Military Airworthiness Authorities. The event also provided an opportunity to reflect on the progress made towards delivering the ‘Roadmap Objectives’ given to the EDA MAWA Forum by European Defence Ministers.  The discussions addressed the political implications of this activity, areas for closer cooperation with EASA, together with governmental, industrial, and European National Military Airworthiness Authorities’ views on the positive impact that increased harmonisation will have on current and future military airworthiness activities. Basic Framework Document Additionally, several Member States provided their national approval and restating their commitment to the principles of the updated “European Harmonised Military Airworthiness Basic Framework Document” which defines the role and functions of the MAWA Forum. The previous version of the document had been nationally approved by 20 Member States and with the addition of Poland today brings the total to 21 Member States. Further national re-approvals are anticipated over the next few weeks. The document clarifies the principles of a common approach to military airworthiness and addresses issues such as the mutual recognition between National Military Airworthiness Authorities which is essential to realise the expected benefits from regulatory harmonisation.  “EDA has received the mandate by Defence Ministers to work towards the harmonisation of military airworthiness. In close partnership and cooperation with the MAWA representatives from the National Military Airworthiness Authorities, we have created the necessary regulatory framework and principles. What we need now is additional political will for the next step: the implementation of the EMARs into national military regulations in order to achieve mutual recognition between Member States”, said Giampaolo Lillo, Armaments Director of the European Defence Agency, during the meeting.

EDA_NEWS_0790	2013-06-14	NEWS	“Blue Force Tracking” Demonstration at EDA	" On 13 June, the European Defence Agency (EDA) invited representatives of Member States to attend a ""Blue Force Tracking"" demonstration of the EU Distributed Experimentation Laboratory (EU-DEL) concept. The experimentation linked ten different locations from three Member States (Germany, France and Italy) to EDA and provided a unique European virtual platform for debate, networking, and future planning. EU-DEL is a tool to support information-sharing in the development of capabilities for EU crisis management operations. The objective is to improve information exchange on national experimentations, research facilities, industries and organisations to meet short- to long-term capability development goals.  The Blue Force Tracking experiment is the first pilot case to demonstrate the concept of this affordable and distributed tool. The experiment, organised by the European Defence Agency and supported by the EU Military Staff, offers perspectives for an agile and dynamic approach to research and experimentation and stimulate further EU distributed projects.    More information: BFT Experimentation Flyer   "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/06/14/-blue-force-tracking-demonstration-at-eda
EDA_NEWS_0791	2013-06-13	NEWS	Next Generation Small Arms Workshop a Success	 From 4 to 6 June 2013 the Finnish Army Command hosted the EDA Next Generation Small Arms Workshop in Mikkeli, Finland. Delegations from Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy and Sweden participated in this kick-off event with experts on small arms, weapon concepts and firearms training. The event under the framework of the “Project Team Soldier Systems” was divided into two phases: during the first phase, the group was composed of government representatives only, while the second phase also involved industry.  For one and a half days, participating Member States shared their experience with legacy small arms which have been in use for decades, addressed their shortfalls, and discussed possible options for the future, such as replacements or upgrades. Currently used small arms have suffered from heavy wear and tear due to intensive use in current operations which disclosed flaws and demonstrated opportunities for improvement. Stefan Nowak, a weapons consultant who supported the workshop as a co-moderator, explained “Recently developed small arms feature high modularity and adaptability in terms of easy mounting of mission-related components, the ability to convert to different calibres, improved ergonomics and weapons handling, high reliability and durability and lighter weight than most legacy rifles in European Armed Forces. However, in certain cases service life extensions and enhancements through upgrades are often smarter than a complete replacement.” Benjamin Fuchs, acting EDA Project Officer Engage and moderator of the workshop, stated “The rationale of this open information exchange was to broaden the mind of all individuals in terms of small arms, to question national practices, and to possibly harmonise requirements across European Armed Forces at an early stage.” Lieutenant Colonel Matti Honkela from the Finnish Army Command added “The lively discussions revealed that this approach was very welcomed by the experts.” The participants agreed that also small arms training is an equally important factor as are technical aspects and multi-national cooperation should be further promoted under the auspices of EDA.  The workshop was both heavily supported by Finland and by the industry. Industry representatives used the opportunity not only to present their portfolios, but also to discuss with government experts the latest operational requirements and technical potential and feasibility in the small arms domain. This session also covered the ammunition sector and hearing protection. During the live fire demonstration on 6th June, participants were able to test and compare various assault rifles, sniper rifles, machine guns, personal defence weapons, pistols and shotguns on the firing range.  The participants agreed that follow-up workshops on this important topic with a particular focus area should be conducted on an annual basis.    More information: Pictures of the workshop are available on Flickr.  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/06/13/next-generation-small-arms-workshop-a-success

EDA_NEWS_0793	2013-06-12	NEWS	European Air Transport Community Trains in Spain	 At the occasion of the Distinguished Visitors Day of the second European Air Transport Training 2013 (EATT13) flying event, senior representatives from European air forces received a thorough insight of the missions and training activities being performed by more than 350 aircrew and ground personnel from eight nations. The two-weeks flying event, which is coordinated by the European Defence Agency (EDA) in close cooperation with the European Air Transport Command and hosted by Spain, allows crews to train different tactical airlift missions in an international environment. The aim is to increase interoperability in the air transport area. EATT13 As part of the EDA’s Pooling & Sharing initiative to increase cooperation among participating Member States, EATT13 allows crews to train and qualify together in specific airlift disciplines.  In particular, EATT will consolidate skills in: advanced mission planning, cargo and personnel airdrops, tactical navigation and threat reactions, tactical air land operations, short field landings, formation flying, night operations, aeromedical evacuation, as well as standardised procedures among tactical aircraft operators to enhance interoperability. 350 participants and thirteen aircraft from eight nations participate in the second EATT flying event, initiated by EDA and organised by a Core Planning Team composed of personnel from the European Air Group, the European Air Transport Command, the Joint Air Power Competence Centre, the Tactical Leadership Programme as well as from national headquarters and units. Participants to EATT13 are: Belgium (one C-130 and two crews), Czech Republic (one CN-295 and two crews), France (one C-130 and one CN 235-300 and four crews), Germany (three C-160 and three crews), Italy (one C-27 and two crews), The Netherlands (one C-130 and two crews), Spain (one C-130 and one CN-295 and four crews) and Sweden (two C-130 and two crews). Additionally, Spanish and French air forces will support EATT13 with a number of fighter aircraft (F-18s and Eurofighters from Spain; Rafales and MF1s from France). In addition the French air force will engage one AWACS and Italy one KC-767A. Bulgaria, Finland, Greece, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, UK and the US participate in the event as observers. EATT is owned by the nations since they are expressing their respective training requirements for the event.  “Today’s operations are multinational ones. It is thus imperative that our trainings are as well. This second transport aircraft flying event has just begun but it is already a success. Compared to last year, we have more nations, more aircraft, more crews and more sorties”, says Rini Goos, Deputy Chief Executive at the European Defence Agency at the opening of the Distinguished Visitors Day. Training together While the fighter community has been training to operate together for years, the same cannot be said for air transport. Today airlift training in Europe is very much done on a national level and since operating together becomes more the rule than the exception, the need to train together has grown as well.  A major step towards more combined training as well as harmonisation of airlift procedures and processes was the creation of the European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) partnership in 2011. The EATF Ad Hoc Working Group Operations & Training (AHWG O&T) dealing with training at operator’s level, developed amongst others, projects to increase the opportunities to train together and to exchange best practices. The current work strands of the AHWG O&T are a yearly European Air Transport Symposium, European Air Transport Training (EATT) flying events and a European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course (EAATTC) as from 2014.  The first EATT was organised in Zaragoza, Spain in June 2012. EATT13 is hosted by Spain at the same airbase on a cost sharing basis from 9-21 June 2013.

EDA_NEWS_0795	2013-06-10	NEWS	Exchange of Views with SEDE Members	" Claude-France Arnould, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency and General Jean-Paul Paloméros, Supreme Allied Commander Transformation, NATO were invited to jointly brief the members of the European Parliament’s security and defence subcommittee on 3 June.  In her introduction, Claude-France Arnould stressed the need for greater effectiveness of defence cooperation in the context of defence budget cuts. She specified that investment in Research & Development, attention to security of supply and increased synergies between community and defence policies were crucial. Claude-France Arnould also mentioned some of the Agency’s Pooling & Sharing initiatives which successfully close European defence capability gaps in areas such as air-to-air refuelling, governmental satellite communications and traffic insertion of remotely piloted aircraft systems. General Paloméros stressed the strategic ties between EDA and NATO SACT in improving defence capabilities; key areas of common interest were air-to-air refuelling and future solutions for remotely piloted aircraft systems. He also insisted that Europe needed to increasingly become a security provider rather than just a security user. Members of the European Parliament were in the following exchange of views interested in the state of preparation for the upcoming European Council dealing with defence topics; Arnaud Danjean, chairman of the subcommittee, highlighted the importance of Pooling & Sharing and showed concern for the involvement of all Member States in cooperative programmes and the full commitment of Member States to defence cooperation.  More information: News ""Members of European Parliament Visit EDA"" (11 April 2013) "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/06/10/exchange-of-views-with-sede-members
EDA_NEWS_0796	2013-06-03	NEWS	Diplomatic Clearances for Military Transport Aircraft Officially Launched	" The European Defence Agency launched, using its website, a diplomatic clearances portal for military transport aircraft. The portal implements the technical arrangement signed by thirteen Member States (Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Romania, Slovakia, Sweden and Norway) for common provisions and harmonised procedures for overflights and landings. The arrangement enables Member States to operate without the need to submit diplomatic clearances requests for each flight, including support to on-going operations and transportation of IATA/ICAO compliant dangerous goods. This simplified mechanism is a significant step forward to more flexible and effective military airlift operations in Europe. The portal allows Member States to easily exchange the necessary information. Presented to defence ministers in November 2012, the agreement improves the freedom of movement of EU military registered transport aircraft transiting national boundaries within the EU. The existing disparate requirements to obtain diplomatic clearances to land or overfly an EU member state cause delays and hampers swift airlift operations. This legacy mechanism needed updating to 21st century’s requirements, especially with a view to the future implementation of the Single European Sky (SES) in the coming years, where a route driven system will evolve into a trajectory driven system. “The new diplomatic clearances agreement radically changes the way Member States deal with the issue. It allows substantial human and financial resource savings whilst making military transport operations more swift and efficient”, says Peter Round, Capabilities Director of the European Defence Agency. The technical arrangement was implemented on 1 June and is still open for signature for all other EU member states and Schengen area signatories. Six additional Member States (Estonia, Finland, France, Latvia, Luxembourg and Spain) indicated their willingness to sign the technical arrangement soon. Diplomatic clearances portal The new mechanism provides annual diplomatic clearance numbers for up to 95% of the daily military transport missions executed above the territories of the signing countries. It also harmonises the requirements for requests and notifications of diplomatic clearances. Finally, a common diplomatic clearance form has been created. The diplomatic clearances portal on EDA’s website (http://eda.europa.eu/DICPortal) is the backbone of the new arrangement. Its main purpose is to provide transparency on national policies and procedures for granting diplomatic clearances for transport aircraft. The portal will also list annual clearance numbers to be used as well as restrictions nations might have regarding certain areas or routings. Background and way forward The European Air Transport Fleet partnership signed by 20 Member States in 2011 under the auspices of the European Defence Agency is looking at improving the availability of military airlift in the EU and developing concrete solutions to increase its efficiency and effectiveness. The EDA ad hoc working group for Diplomatic Clearances that developed this technical arrangement will continue to work on different diplomatic clearance issues, including harmonisation of clearances for EU military transport aircraft outside the EU and clearances for air-to-air refuelling (AAR) operations in the European sky.   More information: News ""EATT13: Final Preparations"" (3 May 2013) News ""Diplomatic Clearances for Military Transport Aircraft"" (21 November 2012) Project page European Air Transport Fleet partnership "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/06/03/diplomatic-clearances-for-military-transport-aircraft-officially-launched

The project, called cyber ranges, aims at maintaining and improving cyber resilience as well as the levels of awareness, insight and expertise of personnel Member States.    By signing the letter of intent, the Member States confirmed to participate and cooperate in the development of a Common Staff Target which will for example determine the functional requirements for cyber ranges. These requirements will have to be agreed by the EDA Steering Board at a later stage. The initiative on cyber ranges has also been recommended by the recently presented EDA cyber defence landscaping study as a viable opportunity with respect to the practical implementation of Pooling and Sharing.   Cyber ranges are multipurpose environments supporting three primary process: knowledge development, assurance and dissemination. Under the Pooling & Sharing initiative, cyber ranges may consist of three complementary functionality packages: Cyber Research Range, Cyber Simulation & Test Range as well as Cyber Training & Exercise Range.    More information: Press release ""EDA Study Identifies Cooperation Prospects in Cyber Defence"" (7 June 2013) Factsheet on Cyber Defence (PDF file) News ""EDA & Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre Of Excellence Establish Liaison"" (10 April 2013) News ""European Union Strategy for Cyber Security"" (8 Feb 2013) News ""EDA Participates in Cyber Defence Conferences"" (6 Feb 2013) News ""Cyber Defence Workshop coorganised by EDA, European Commission and European Space Agency"" (25 Oct 2012) "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/06/07/work-on-cyber-ranges-initiated
EDA_NEWS_0798	2013-06-05	NEWS	Military Green 2013:  Series of Focused Workshops	 The anticipated follow-up to Military Green 2012 takes on a different form altogether. Last year’s bash formed part of the Commission’s Sustainable Energy Week gathering hundred and fifty attendants with the aim to raise awareness on the bigger picture of climate, environment and energy while exhibiting and demonstrating technological opportunities to reduce the footprint. The low key 2013 edition looks instead to develop roadmaps to deliver tangible results drawing on civil-military synergies. Addressing energy and environment is essential to sustaining defence and crisis management capabilities. Recent operations have clearly shown that energy supply in theatre is an Achilles’ heel. Time and again adversaries have targeted fuel convoys, compromising the operational effectiveness and causing unnecessary loss of life.  Increasing energy efficiency reduces vulnerability and additionally cuts costs, not only in theatre but also at home during preparations. Introducing better water and waste management as well as the use of more responsible materials and munitions provides a good base for post-conflict reconstruction while contributing to sustainable development. Furthermore, understanding how climate change affects international security supports developing capabilities that can prevent potential future disasters and conflicts. Following a strategic Government-only meeting earlier this year a number of areas were identified as quick wins, requiring little or moderate efforts. To launch the harvesting of these low hanging fruit it was decided to conduct a set of expert workshops to identify challenges, opportunities and a viable collaborative way forward. Topics that will be covered are: 6 – 7 June 2013 Climate change and loss biodiversity as threat-multipliers to international security Increasing awareness on the impact of the EU directives Exploring new business models that make it attractive for all stakeholders (supplier, buyer, user and environment) to reduce the footprint 13 – 14 June 2013 Catalysing the introduction of alternative fuels Integrating novel alternative and renewable energy supply technologies for land installations Eco-design – designing to endure environmental conditions responsibly Key stakeholders have already been invited to attend. Should you be interested in attending and there are seats available this is possible. Just send us an e-mail to gem2(a)eda.europa.eu and let us know what topics you are interested in and we will assess if it is feasible.

I have been designated by the Spanish Air Mobility Command, where I work as the Deputy Chief in the Air Transport Section, as the Exercise Director (EXDIR) for the European Air Transport Training 2013 (EATT13). My role as EXDIR, once the designing and planning phases were concluded, is to control and command the different cells involved in the EATT13 organisation.  2. What is the importance of the EATT13 for European Air Transport? Managing military budgets is quite difficult and complex for all European countries; joint operations are more common. Consequently, European projects and initiatives in this area must be focused on carrying out multinational air transport training programmes with Pooling & Sharing as a priority, followed by the standardisation of procedures, tactics, techniques, and cross-servicing activities. We can affirm that EATT13 is a clear example of this kind of initiative; the motto is “Training together to operate together” with the aim to increase interoperability of European aircrews and fleets based on common procedures. The objective is to create a European Advanced Air Tactical Transport Course (EAATTC) similar to the American one, and following the philosophy of the Tactical Leadership Programme (TLP).  3. How is this project supported by Spain? Spain is the Host Nation (HN) and the Spanish Air Force is in charge of leading the activities, the planning process and the coordination of the air transport aircraft from eight different nations, with the main support of the European Air Transport Command (EATC), the European Air Group (EAG), the Joint Air Power Competence Center (JAPCC) and, the most important support, the air transport units participants and their Senior National Representatives (SNRs). 4. What are the keys to EATT13's success? First of all, the multinational team has already been working very hard for more than one and a half years to design, plan and execute this multinational training programme; secondly, the great support of Spain, as Host Nation, of the Spanish Air Force, as host air force and of the Zaragoza Air Base, as a multiplication factor to achieve EATT13’s goals; and finally, the flexibility of the event, which allows that air missions are planned to achieve the tactical training requirements of all participating crews.    More information: Visit the EATT13 webpage Read more on the European Air Transport Fleet    	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/06/07/eatt13-interview-with-lieutenant-colonel-jose-almodovar
EDA_NEWS_0800	2013-06-03	NEWS	EDA at Paris Air Show	 Several of the Agency’s flagship projects are in the air domain: air-to-air refuelling, air traffic insertion of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems, military air transport activities, SESAR impact on the armed forces, as well as military airworthiness and governmental satellite communications. For the latter two the Agency organises high-level seminars during the Internal Paris Air Show “Le Bourget”.   Military Airworthiness The high-level military airworthiness seminar will take place on 18 June and will feature speakers from the European Defence Agency, the European Aviation Safety Agency, the European aerospace industry as well as national Ministries of Defence.  The seminar will address the political implications of the harmonisation of military airworthiness, areas for closer cooperation with EASA, as well as the impact of harmonisation on current and future military airworthiness activities. Representatives from governmental, industrial and national military airworthiness authorities’ are invited to participate in the seminar.  The seminar will take place in the VIPARIS Conference Centre, Hall 2C, Salle 1, from 3 PM to 7 PM (including networking cocktail). For more information click here.  Governmental Satellite Communication The high-level seminar on governmental satellite communication will take place on 19 June 2013 and is split between a seminar in the morning with keynote speakers and a dedicated workshop in the afternoon for government representatives only.  Military Satellite Communication (MILSATCOM) has been recognised as a very promising domain for Pooling & Sharing as synergies can mitigate the huge financial impact generated by the growing demand for resilient space-based communication in operations. The option to pool resources in the domain of MILSATCOM is particularly pertinent to the replacement of the current generation of space assets owned by France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, whose entire phase-out expected between 2018 and 2025 offers a unique opportunity to consider the establishment of a common initiative. In this perspective, the Agency has drafted a “Secure Telecom by Satellite” (SECTELSAT) concept presented to the Defence Ministers in April 2013.  The seminar will take place in the Auditorium (VI Paris Conference Centre) from 9 AM to 5.30 PM.

EDA_NEWS_0801	2013-05-31	NEWS	EDA Organises First War Game in European Framework	 Twenty-five military and civil experts from the Member States and EU bodies participate in the first war game on future capabilities in a European framework, organised by the European Defence Agency (EDA) from 4 to 6 June in The Hague. The aim is to derive conclusions for upcoming European military capability requirements. The war game will be based on four generic scenarios that will cover the full spectrum of possible futures. “Given the often long timeframes between research, development, acquisition, training and final entry into service of new assets, we need to have a timely understanding of what future capability needs might look like. The war game is one element to support Member States in defining the military capabilities needed for Common Security and Defence Policy operations in the mid to long-term”, says Peter Round, Capabilities Director of the European Defence Agency. European Capabilities Assessment Game Based on the Agency’s work on future trends in the framework of the Capability Development Plan (CDP), the European Capability Assessment Game or war game will be based on four generic scenarios. These scenarios are not aimed at predicting the most probable future, nor to engage in a discussion about political developments but to test the impact on long-term capability requirements: Classic Case: The global balance of today remains unchanged in a positive and stable way. Aggressive Multi-Polarism: Several more or less equally strong powers compete for power, influence and resources – also by military means. Failing States: An increased number of states are not able to cope with the challenges of globalisation, competition for resources, climate change and other factors. Unconventional Conflicts: Open military clashes are rare. Power blocks (states) try to undermine each other’s security by supporting for example terrorist or radical opposition groups. Objectives The 25 experts will during three days crosscheck existing and planned military capabilities against the threats and challenges described in the four scenarios. This will allow them to gain experiences in order to identify decisive points and possible measures to take. Most importantly in the framework of the CDP, they will be able to identify EU’s long-term capability trends in order to timely make the necessary decisions on capability development. The final results of the war game will be presented to Member States in autumn 2013.

EDA_NEWS_0802	2013-05-31	NEWS	Military Green Helps Shake the Fossil Fuel Addiction	 As part of the Military Green effort EDA launched a study in 2012 to address the dependency on fossil fuels in operations. The study, now concluded, sheds light over the actual consumption and proposes concrete measures to increase energy efficiency and in doing so reduce the overall fuel consumption. Using fossil fuels comes with an addiction that is hard to shake and we rely on them heavily to get through the day. Diesel and petrol power our cars and busses while coal and oil help us keep warm in the winter and cool in the summer. The latter types of fuels also help power the metro systems and the overhead railway lines to take us longer distances. To take us really long distances kerosene is what propels us all the way up into the Jetstream. The defence domain is no less susceptible. On the contrary, over the years the dependency has grown and although it mainly concerns logistic fuels, they are nonetheless fossil. But as shown by this Workshop there is room for change and improvements can be made today, some aided by technology others through spreading awareness. Reducing energy consumption and increasing energy efficiency of our deployed systems will reduce the overall need for fuel. Subsequently the number of convoys needed to be sent into high threat theatre can be reduced. By doing so, the exposure to risk by personnel can be reduced. The reduction in fuel consumption also results in lower materiel life-cycle costs. Furthermore the sheer reduction in overall combustion of fossil fuels reduces the hazardous emissions. These aspects are not only relevant to high threat areas but also to the other extreme in terms of CMOs, disaster relief. Also, if we can reduce fuel consumption in theatre, we can most likely do the same in the homeland. Contracted to Spanish company ISDEFE, the study with the acronym Fuel-D provides a statistical picture of overall energy consumption in operations as well as specific data associated with selected camps in theatre. The statistics have been analysed in order to identify trends and opportunities for reducing consumption. Fuel-D has further developed a software tool to allow mission planners to better understand how capabilities can be enhanced by reducing energy consumption and how this affects the cost burden positively. In addition Fuel-D has shown how camp designs can be optimised through the introduction of novel and renewable energy technologies. This is in particular feeds straight into EDA and Member States expert work in developing Best Practices for Energy Supply Systems for Camps. The successful conclusion of the Fuel-D study feeds into the continued work on energy and environment that EDA Member States are undertaking. The upcoming workshop series Military Green 2013 to be held in early June will be the first step in exploiting the results of the Fuel-D study.

EDA_NEWS_0804	2013-05-29	NEWS	First European Helicopter Tactics Instructor Course Delivered Successfully	 Fourteen students from Germany and Sweden together with four observers from Austria and Hungary participated in the first European Helicopter Tactics Instructor Course (EHTIC) which was successfully organised in two parts. The classroom and simulator phase took place from 08 - 28 April in the UK (RAF Linton-on-Ouse) and the life flying phase was hosted and located by Sweden at the Vidsel Test Range (06 – 24 May) 2013. The complete course is part of the EDA Helicopter Training Programme (HTP).  The aim of course is to give selected European helicopter aircrew tactical depth and expertise, leading to an enhanced awareness of helicopter tactics and employment and multi-national integration.  At the end of the course graduates are adept at imparting tactical instruction during training and on operations and are also competent in providing helicopter tactical advice at one star level, as well as leading multi-platform complex Composite Air Operations (COMAOs). Classroom and simulator phase The classroom and simulator phase was executed in the simulator assets of the Helicopter Tactics Course (HTC) and followed the syllabus of the UK QHTI (Qualified Helicopter Tactics Instructor) course as the baseline. Fourteen instructors of the UK instructor team of the ROWETU (Rotary-Wing Operational Evaluation and Trials Unit) ran the course which allowed a ratio of one instructor per student. This allowed a very individual and supportive training with a high-value output. The focus of the course is to not only train the pilots, but the rear crew (chiefs and door-gunners) as well. Not only the “Pitchers” (German nickname for the front crew) had to prepare the missions or give related briefings, the “Mixers” (German nickname for the crew chiefs) and the door-gunners where challenged as well. Life flying phase For the life flying phase, one CH-53 (Germany), one AS332 (Sweden, Super Puma) and two UH-1D (Germany) were available.The life flying phase was executed in cooperation with the UK 100 Squadron which deployed their two HAWK fast jets as red air for the evasion training phase. Swedish GRIPPEN jets were involved in this part of the course as well. The following topics are integral parts of the course: Electronic Warfare Training (EW) Evasion Training (ET) Airspace Battle Management (ATO, ACO, SPINS) Manpads/SA Helo Escort Techniques Other Operations (Wells, Tac-3D Manoeuvres, Vehicle Interdiction, Mutual Support) Tac Formations Mission Preparation & Planning COMAO Mission Planning Multinational, English language, three building-block phases Excellent support was provided by the Swedish Ministry of Defence organisation, FMV, which is running the Vidsel Test Range and which provided all necessary organisational requirements for the live flying phase in Sweden. Results and way forward The EHTI course delivers an outstanding opportunity to expose helicopter crews to the training methodology and tactical knowledge of another Member State. “An extremely challenging course, delivered by highly professional instructors, we have to keep this going”, said Major Sascha Pink from the German Army Aviation. It is also the first step in delivering a sustainable European course where successful graduates can be awarded a qualification recognised by all pMS. Additionally, on returning home, these graduates can pass on the common understanding and methodologies to their own crews and can interact as mentors vis-à-vis other helicopter programmes. During the HOT BLADE Exercise of the Helicopter Exercise Progamme (HEP) in Portugal this July, many of the freshly trained instructors will meet together with UK instructors at OVAR Airbase and form together the first Mentor Team for an HEP Exercise, ready to support the multinational crews in preparation and execution of the challenging COMAO missions. This year’s students will become next year’s instructors.  This will allow the gradual build-up of expertise and create a self-sustaining course using European Qualified Helicopter Tactics Instructors.      More information: For more information on the Agency's helicopter activities, please visit the project page.  Pictures from the course are available on Flickr.  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/05/29/first-european-helicopter-tactics-instructor-course-delivered-successfully
EDA_NEWS_0805	2013-05-24	NEWS	EDA Study Identifies Cooperation Prospects in Cyber Defence	" The European Defence Agency (EDA) presented on 24 May 2013 results of its stocktaking study of military cyber defence capabilities. Using an in depth methodology, the study benchmarked the degree of “Cyber Defence Readiness” of 20 participating Member States (pMS) and different EU level organisations. The landscaping exercise shows a mixed picture with respect to military cyber defence capabilities on national and European level. It recommends strengthening cooperation, exchange of information and proposes avenues for pragmatic Pooling & Sharing of some cyber defence capabilities. The study supports the relevance of the cyber defence activities launched by the EDA in the areas of cyber training ranges and deployable situational awareness kits for CSDP missions. “Cyberspace can be described as the fifth dimension of warfare, equally critical to military operations as land, sea, air and space. Our study reveals important gaps in military cyber defence capabilities across the EU. The Agency is offering Member States a range of projects to cooperate in the area of cyber defence capabilities as well as in the research & technology domain”, says Peter Round, Capabilities Director of the European Defence Agency. The one-year stocktaking study aimed to establish a high-level understanding of cyber defence capabilities across EDA pMS to support progress towards a more consistent level of cyber defence capability across the EU. 20 countries were included in the study. Methodology This stocktaking exercise included research into the different EU level organisations involved in cyber defence activities in the context of CSDP missions as well as data collection on cyber defence capabilities in pMS. The research was carried out via document review, semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire. Cyber defence information was analysed according to a commonly understood military framework of capability, known as Defence Lines of Development. These contributors are: Doctrine; Organisation; Training; Material; Leadership; Facilities and Interoperability (DOTMLPF-I). To measure and to a certain degree benchmark the degree of “Cyber Readiness” the study utilised a five step maturity model with 69 discrete and weighted indicators for maturity, broken down within the DOTMLPF-I structure to achieve the required granularity. Each country was qualitatively assessed for each contributor against this weighted maturity model. Results On the national level, the study revealed a mixed picture with respect to military cyber defence capability. Generally speaking, in pMS where key decision-makers are familiar with cyber-security, cyber defence capabilities are more advanced. The 20 pMS exhibit strengths in the three capability domains of Leadership, Personnel and Interoperability. In the areas of Doctrine, Organisation and Training, an early level of maturity was defined which might be linked to the fact that these three areas require more complex and longer-term efforts to establish organisational structures. Facilities is the capability domain which remains to date highly immature or non-existent. Individual country profiles are classified and cannot be made available. As regards cyber defence among EU organisations, the study highlights the complex operational set-up between the different institutions involved (e.g. EDA, the Member States, European External Action Service, European Commission, General Secretariat of the EU Council and related EU agencies). While threat analysis and cyber-intelligence gathering capability appears to be emergent, incident response capabilities could be deepened. The study also reveals that the culture of cyber-security good practice needs to be nurtured and that the use of military specific standards and tools is still poorly understood. Recommendations Military cyber defence on the European level is at a relative early stage of maturity. The study therefore makes high-level recommendations such as enhancing EU network protection, strengthening intelligence capability, deepening incident response capabilities, creating a culture of cyber-security, promulgating security standards and tools, and reinforcing links between NATO and the EU for cyber defence issues. On the national level, greater attention should be given to the development of cyber defence training and education initiatives. pMS are encouraged to consider exchanging information on equipment solutions and Pooling & Sharing for cyber defence capabilities, and on processes and shared escalation procedures, especially in EU-led missions. Finally, the study suggests pMS consider sharing – to a certain extent – facilities and to take into account interoperability aspects of cyber defence. EDA Activities Cyber defence is one of the Agency’s top capability priorities. Complementary to activities derived from the EDA Capability Development Plan (CDP), such as research on human factors in cyber defence, the establishment of a cyber defence research agenda and a common cyber defence training curriculum, there is a focus on the most pressing gaps identified in the landscaping study like training and education, or cyber defence situational awareness in CSDP operations. Consequently EDA is initiating three ad hoc projects with Member States: (1) The Cyber Ranges project aims at Pooling & Sharing of current and future resources for Cyber Defence Training, exercise & testing in order to increase availability and efficiency of existing assets, and to mainstream and improve cyber defence training, exercises & testing at European level. (2) The deployable cyber situational awareness kit initiative aims at providing, Pooling & Sharing a common and standardised cyber defence planning and management platform. It shall allow Commanders and their staff in EU-led operations to fulfil their cyber defence related tasks throughout all phases of an EU-led operation. (3) The “Advanced Persistent Threats Detection (APT-D)” project initiative is focusing on improved capabilities in early detection and smart mitigation of APT. Together with the Irish Presidency of the European Union and the Estonian Ministry of Defence, the EDA will also co-host a high level conference on Cyber Security Cooperation in the European Union on 20 June 2013.   More information: Press release (PDF file) Factsheet on Cyber Defence (PDF file) News ""EDA & Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre Of Excellence Establish Liaison"" (10 April 2013) News ""European Union Strategy for Cyber Security"" (8 Feb 2013) News ""EDA Participates in Cyber Defence Conferences"" (6 Feb 2013) News ""Cyber Defence Workshop coorganised by EDA, European Commission and European Space Agency"" (25 Oct 2012) "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/05/24/eda-study-identifies-cooperation-prospects-in-cyber-defence

EDA_NEWS_0808	2013-05-03	NEWS	EATT13: Final Preparations	" The European Air Transport Training 2013 (EATT13) is a EDA flying event that allows the transport aircraft community to train together in an international environment. Organised for the second time this year in close cooperation with the European Air Transport Command and hosted by Spain, 350 participants from eight nations with twelve aircraft will gather in Zaragoza from 9 to 21 June 2013. Laurent Donnet, EDA Assistant Capability Manager Manœuvre and Deputy Exercise Director explains the aim of the flying event and how the preparations are progressing. 1) Laurent, what is the aim of the European Air Transport Training? The allied fighter community has been extensively flying multinational training programmes for the last decades, with the Tactical Leadership Programme (TLP) and the Flag exercises being examples. Although some transport aircraft are embedded in those events, they are primarily fighter centric. Airlift training to date is very much a national responsibility while operating together becomes the rule. Therefore the aim of these EATT events is to have a dedicated framework for European air transport operators to increase the opportunity to train together but also to harmonise the training itself and exchange best practices amongst the different air forces, and this in the areas of training but also operations. The advantage of EATT is that the training is tailored to the participant’s requests. No disciplines or events are imposed to the crews and the entire flying programme is scheduled in such a way that each participating crew will get the specific training it needs. This flexibility makes EATT probably so attractive.   2) This is the second time, the flying event is organised. What is different from last year? The amount of participants and the number of sorties that will be flown! The location is the same (Zaragoza AB, Spain) and so is the organising structure, but where last year we had six nations and eight aircraft participating, we have eight nations and twelve aircraft this year. Last year we had fourteen sorties a day, this year twenty-two. In a way we are a victim of our success. Looking at the detachment size it goes from 250 to 350 people. In order to cope with this massive increase in numbers we will organise two events as from next year. One will again be in Spain, the other one in Bulgaria.   3) Around six weeks before the event starts. What are the last preparations? What do you focus on now? The focus is now on fine-tuning the entire EATT flow and ensure the crews will get the training they requested. Therefore the focus is on the flying schedule and the support that is needed around it to make it happen. This being said, the core planning team of EATT is structured in such a way that different panels (Ops, Intelligence, maintenance, media & communication, etc.) take care of specific issues and hence focusses on their area. There are so many things to take care of six weeks before such an event that all people involved are pretty busy with it. Since we don’t have any permanent structure to manage EATT, we’re using the goodwill of a lot of experts in different organisations and structures like the EATC, EAG and JAPCC but also from the national staffs and units. Last but not least, since as you mentioned this is the second edition of EATT we have a supplementary thing to take care of and that is the pressure on our shoulders to deliver an event at least as good as last year’s. This is definitely a big challenge to take.   More information: EATT2013 event entry (here) Press release ""EDA launches European air transport training"" of 31 May 2012.

EDA_NEWS_0809	2013-05-16	NEWS	Demand Consolidation Is the First Priority	" Gert Runde is the Secretary General of the AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD). In this interview he shares his views on how Europe’s defence industry can retain capabilities and profitability during challenging economic times. What do you believe should be done to strengthen and enhance the European defence industrial base? How can institutions such as the EDA contribute effectively to this process? The core role of the EDA is to help governments attain their defence objectives by outlining the efficiency gains that could be a result of doing things together. But Member States all come from different horizons and do not in all cases have homogenous security and defence policy goals. So convergence has to be created in a pragmatic way. Mostly, and particularly in this field, Europe is forging common approaches through dealing with crisis situations.  And the European Union does not see itself as a prime military power and understandably prefers to seek foreign and security policy benefits by using “soft-power” approaches. However we seem to be entering a period where we are witnessing a rising tension between not being a prime military power yet still being able to support doing the things we need and want to do to maintain a credible European foreign and security policy posture. Surely the current one-by-one policy where we shop around between ourselves for assets during times of crisis – such as military transport aircraft – is not an optimised process.  These crises can give us some guidelines to the future but we need to consider the equipment implications of these events becoming more prolonged and difficult, with increased demand for equipment. We need to consider what exactly we should be doing jointly and whether we have the technology investment in place for the longer term. Or whether we just go down commercial routes, that is, look for what is available, accepting the inevitable dependencies that this would create. The degree to which Member States achieve demand consolidation though harmonization, coordination and synchronization of their individual procurement initiatives is key to the preservation of a healthy defence industrial base in Europe. Member States have to define those defence areas which they need to retain under their direct influence to serve an immediate national interest and then agree collaborative approaches for the rest. There should be room within the EDA for this collaborative process to start and for governments, whether it is two or 27, to identify similar needs and discuss how to achieve the capabilities together. A key issue is agreeing a common timescale, to coordinate and synchronise national budgets. You can then develop an optimised investment plan from research and technology to actual procurement. Does this mean a single procurement agency for Europe? Maybe in the very long term but we can go a long way in the short term to synchronise approaches. We know this has provided benefits in the past. For example, with the Meteor air-to-air missile programme governments drew up common specifications, including those for the interfaces, and agreed to place orders in the same timeframe, but individually. This allowed the contractor the opportunity to benefit from a larger production run, with an appropriate reduced level of cost to the customer. We see no reasonable prospect in the foreseeable future of the EU itself becoming a significant source of demand for defence goods and services - the fundamental challenges and responsibilities continue to reside in Member States. But we think the full potential of the EDA is not yet recognised by Member States and the Agency will have to market itself more proactively. Industry was very much in support of the creation of the EDA and, although we do not in all questions share identical views, now more than ever we need to work more closely together. The EDA’s role for industry is essential but the Agency has to focus on speeding up the schedule under which cooperative initiatives are being delivered, to drill down into the wide process of pooling and sharing and identify more initiatives that are directly relevant to underpin defence industrial capabilities in Europe. Time is of the essence, now more than ever. Surely we also need a well regulated European defence market but it cannot be created by regulation alone. Even if we have the same transparent rules for procurement and competition, without demand consolidation fragmentation endures. And who does that help?  Is Europe investing enough in research and technology (R&T) and if not, what can be done to reverse the decline? Our mastery of technologies is an essential part of our industrial capability portfolio. Much of this capability has been generated by government investment from research to procurement, and governments should have an overwhelming interest in maintaining the competitiveness of “their” industries. But the paradigm is changing. We are –we hope – moving towards a European, rather than a national defence market, and additionally there is a real benefit for our Member States if companies can maintain or enhance their global competitive edge.  If industry is competitive in Europe, it will be competitive globally and vice-versa. In former times, governments had their national industries’ interests at heart, but if you widen the procurement circle to include other participating governments, those same companies need to be sure the new government customers will also respect their justifiable interests, in particular in the domain of Intellectual Property rights (IPR). Each company’s IPR portfolio after all is a key ingredient in its global competitiveness. In 2006 EU defence ministers in the EDA Steering Board agreed they should increase the percentage of research and technology in defence budgets from 1.6% to 2.0%. But EDA's figures for 2010 showed it has fallen to 1.2%, and today the figure is certainly lower. This does indeed represent structural under-investment. There is no doubt that the accelerating and enduring erosion of defence industrial capabilities will have serious consequences for the security and defence policies that they help to sustain.  What may be even worse is that there is no common view of which are the essential capabilities that will be needed over the next two decades;  without this view it’s impossible to say whether, if you lose capabilities, this will result in a dangerous situation or not. Defence  research and technology investment is undertaken by Member States in view of a capability need and is usually full-funded because they have an upcoming capability need and there’s nothing in the portfolio to meet that need. So they work with industry to create that capability. This process will continue but we now face important questions of affordability. Member States will increasingly have to coordinate this with other Member States – though there will still be instances of some governments undertaking work on an exclusively national basis – and coordination will typically be done through the EDA. This is an EDA capability, which is currently under-exploited in our view, especially for Category B programmes. This is a valuable resource and Member States should have more recognition of them and be more open to coordinate their approaches. It is clear that not all Member States have gone down the process of understanding what they want to share and what they don’t want to share –from both research and procurement points of view. Across the institutional divide the EDA and the European Commission now have a tool to coordinate their investments in research and technology to prevent waste and duplication. But the Commission undertakes R&T work at a lower- tier technical readiness levels from that of the EDA – the higher you go towards technical readiness the closer you move towards putting that new technology into the defence market and that’s not an area in which the Commission operates. The Commission can help through its framework research agenda with the first steps of technology research that is relevant to future defence capabilities, but not exclusively so, and then it’s up to Member States and the EDA to develop the more defence specific technology. This is a process which needs to be better coordinated; the Commission also funds this work differently and makes the results freely available within the EU and sometimes beyond, which is mostly not appropriate for the defence sector. The related IPR issues are another factor – rules for intellectual property use are different for work which is funded through the grant mechanism (on the Commission’s side) as opposed to defence research investments by the Member States. So how does Europe remain competitive in a market that is increasingly global and in which buyers are becoming far more intelligent in terms of procurement practices? The fall in product demand and increasing under-investment in R&T among European Member States are causing companies to seek market opportunities in more dynamic economies in an effort both to sustain profitable activities and maintain their defence industrial capabilities. But the European defence industrial community can only be sustainably successful in foreign markets if it can demonstrate that there is a national and/or EU home market for their products. Home customer demand has always been a pre-requisite for successful defence exporting. There are constraints to marketing globally – we cannot do it everywhere and we do not want to do it everywhere. In addition, many potential foreign customers expect genuine cooperation and industrial investment. So, by seeking to exploit foreign markets, we contribute to creating our competitors of the future. Then there is the problem of technology drain. These new competitors will not want an investment in yesterday’s technologies; they want to create their own capabilities. So suddenly you can create a “reverse dependency” situation where politically acceptable countries acquire technological capabilities on which Europe may soon start to depend. These implications have to be properly thought through. What effect do you forecast from the activities of Commissioner Barnier and the Task Force on defence? How much input has ASD had in these activities? The task force, as we interpret it, is there to help. It wants to help governments achieve the objectives they have set for themselves. While we welcome the Commission’s interest in supporting the defence sector, the actions available to or suggested by the Commission are not central to the underlying problems faced by the industry in the short and medium term, and need to be seen and understood in this context. What do you see as the priorities for European defence in light of the EU Council’s workings? How important will the EU ministerial meeting on defence be at the end of this year? In terms of raising to the level of heads of government the issue that there is more to European security and defence policy than the external aspect, the council meeting is extremely important. We have started our dialogue with the EDA and the Commission to ensure all arguments can be brought forward. We have tried the “bottom-up” approach but to achieve real progress, what Europe really needs now is the “top-down” focus and support by Heads of State and Governments. Consolidation in the European defence industry is a hot topic, with the failed merger of EADS and BAE Systems and rumours regarding mergers within French industry bringing a fresh focus to it. What is your view on the imperative for consolidation and the barriers that stand in the way of making it effective? Our association is not working on consolidation scenarios. These are issues where each company has its own strategy and its own portfolio of interests and those are extremely competition-sensitive. I can only offer you a few general considerations. “Consolidation” has become a buzz-word for journalists and analysts – it covers many underlying issues, which many people who use the word do not probably fully understand.  It is important to understand that consolidation, in particular in our industry sector, is a result of market conditions and political concerns that are fully under control of the EU Member States.   More information This interview was first published in the third issue of the European Defence Agency's magazine ""European Defence Matters"".

EDA_NEWS_0812	2013-04-23	NEWS	European Structural Funds: EDA Supports Six Pilot Projects	" The European Defence Agency (EDA) will facilitate six dual-use projects to access European Structural Funds in order to support maintaining and developing key technical and industrial priorities. This work is part of the Agency’s efforts to promote greater innovation across the defence industry in Europe. It can also be linked to the expected discussions on the state of Europe’s defence industry during the European Council in December. The Agency has presented an initiative to promote the best use of European Structural Funds by defence actors during the meeting of the Steering Board on 23 April 2013. Together with Member States, the Agency has also organised in recent months a series of workshops – in Brussels and in Member States – on the potential use of European Structural Funds by defence actors. European Structural Funds may be used by Member States to co-fund dual-use activities in Research and Innovation, as part of a national or regional smart specialisation strategy. Thirteen Member States submitted some 70 project proposals to the Agency to assess their potential for submission for structural funds. Six pilot projects from Poland, Germany, UK, Portugal, France, and Bulgaria have been selected. Topics include for example intruder detection and collision avoidance system for flight aircraft or the improvement of the urban security and defence through the implementation of advance detection sensor’s system. EDA will now accompany these projects to access available EU resources for research and innovation, in line with identified technological and industrial priorities.

EDA_NEWS_0814	2013-04-23	NEWS	Steering Board: EDA Key Initiatives Make Progress	" At the meeting of the Steering Board on 23 April 2013, Ministers of Defence noted the good progress some of the European Defence Agency’s key initiatives made in recent months. Notably, Pooling & Sharing priorities Air-to-Air Refuelling and satellite communications as well as the EDA’s work as regards implications of SESAR for the military were discussed. Air-to-Air Refuelling (AAR) EDA is facilitating four complementary and parallel work-strands for short- medium- and long-term solutions to the AAR requirement. The first pillar concerns the use of short-term commercial solutions. For the second pillar, EDA together with Italy and the Movement Coordination Centre Europe (MCCE), is promoting a multinational approach using the Italian KC767 as a test case for a collective AAR clearance campaign to be concluded in September 2013 with a flight trial. This will help establish a process for collective AAR clearances on future AAR platforms. The EDA is also working with the UK on access for other Member States  to unallocated hours in the UK Voyager programme. The third pillar involves A400M kits. For the fourth pillar - Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) – the objective is on the basis of pooled national requirements, to provide a European strategic MRTT capability from 2020. This builds on the Letter of Intent signed by nine Member States (BE, EL, ES, FR, HU, LU, PL, PO, NL) and NO at the Steering Board on 19 November 2012. This work is being led by the Netherlands.. Satellite Communications EDA is developing a concept for “Secure Telecom by Satellite” where, through Pooling & Sharing, significant savings could be achieved. Because of the dual-use nature of satellite communications, EDA proposes to examine how jointly funded activities could be launched in close cooperation with Member States, the European Commission and ESA. SESAR With the adoption of the Implementing Regulation on Common Projects for the deployment of SESAR, the defence community will be involved on a more systematic basis. It will also need to anticipate at political and at technical (equipment and technologies, commonalities with civilian users, funding opportunities, etc.) levels. In this context, EDA is proposing to establish an Ad Hoc Category A (opt-out) programme for SESAR implementation to reinforce expertise in EDA, increase coordination among Ministries of Defence and with other organisations, including NATO, and generate collaborative ad hoc projects.   More information: Pictures of the Steering Board are available here News ""Steering Board: EDA Input for European Council"" (23 April 2013) News ""European Structural Funds: EDA Supports Six Pilot Projects"" (23 April 2013) News ""Baltic Defence Ministries Sign Joint Ammunition Procurement Arrangement"" (23 April 2013) Project Page Air-to-Air Refuelling Factsheet Pooling & Sharing  "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/04/23/steering-board-eda-key-initiatives-make-progress
EDA_NEWS_0815	2013-04-26	NEWS	Successful ESA-EDA Flight Demonstration on RPAS Insertion into Civil Airspace	 San Javier Air Base (Murcia) was selected to conduct the trials and demonstrate that satellite communications are suitable to operate Remotely Piloted  Aircraft Systems (RPASs) and integrate them into civil airspace. The DeSIRE project (Demonstration of Satellites enabling the Insertion of RPAS in Europe) is funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Defence Agency (EDA) within an initiative to support the utilisation of RPAS complemented by satellites for commercial and governmental applications. To undertake this project the consultancy and technology multinational Indra (Spain) leads a European industrial consortium formed by AT-One (Germany and the Netherlands), SES ASTRA (Luxembourg), Thales Alenia Space (Italy and France) and CIRA (Italy). Test Flights DESIRE has undertaken a series of test flights to demonstrate the role of satellite communications for integrating in civil and military airspace RPAS flight Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS). The concepts and applicable procedures were defined in the precursor feasibility studies. In particular, the flight completed this Wednesday provided a generic terrestrial and maritime surveillance service, demonstrating the dual use of RPAS.  In the presence of the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Francisco Javier García-Arnaiz, an aircraft without a pilot on board took off from the San Javier runway at 11:00 a.m. on Wednesday 24 April and completed a 6-hour flight in civil and military airspace. The operation was timed to coincide with civil and military flights operating from the base, which shares its facilities with Murcia Airport. After take-off, the aircraft switched from its Line of Sight (LOS) data link, to its satellite data link, capable to operate Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS), and started its operational mission in segregated airspace, sending to the ground, by means of the satellite data link, the signals from its on-board sensors. The RPA then climbed to 20,000 feet (6,096 m), entering airspace class C, managed by AENA, the Spanish Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP), from Barcelona Control Centre. The pilot of the RPA, located at the Ground Control Station, followed all the indications issued by the AENA air traffic controllers, acting like any other civil or military aircraft. The difference is that the pilot was not on board and the radio communication with the control centre was transmitted from the aircraft to the operator via satellite. During this phase of the flight, a manned aircraft from the Air Force Academy approached the RPA, simulating frontal and 90º collision trajectories. The pilots of the two aircraft followed the separation instructions issued by the air traffic controllers, demonstrating the safe operation of remotely piloted aircraft even in an emergency situation such as the separation of two aircraft on a collision course. Situational Awareness Throughout the exercise, the data of SACTA, AENA's air traffic control system based on secondary radars, was available to the pilot of the RPA in the Ground Control Station, enabling him to improve the situational awareness of nearby aircraft, with more details and precision than an on-board pilot would have. A radar located on board the RPA was also used to detect surrounding traffic and the data were transmitted to the pilot through the satellite link. The aim was to define and test the air traffic control and operation procedures applicable to a remotely piloted aircraft and to evaluate the safety of the satellite link and the reaction capacity of the aircraft's ground pilot, both in routine operation and in emergency situations. All the information collected in these tests will be analysed and compared with the safety requirements being established by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the operational requirements being set by EUROCONTROL. During the flight, the payload data collected from the sensors on-board the aircraft (AIS receiver, radar and video) were transmitted in real-time to the Ground Control Station and further processed to enable ships’ detection and identification. The execution of the project was possible thanks to the collaboration of the Spanish Air Force, which allowed the use of San Javier Air Academy facilities for the demonstration. Staff from the Air Force UAS School, sited in Matacan (Salamanca), supervised the operation of the RPA and San Javier military air controllers managed its take-offs and landings and its operations in military airspace. The RPA was granted an Airworthiness Experimental Certificate (AEC) by INTA to guarantee the safety of the system, under the envisaged operational conditions. AENA and AESA collaborated for the part of the flight to take place in civil class C airspace and the definition of the tests and of the applicable air traffic control and safety procedures. The civil future of RPAS The development of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems originated in a defence context. However, their utilisation for civil and security purposes has significant commercial potential. Possible uses include fire fighting; highway control; electricity line, critical infrastructures and border surveillance; environmental protection surveillance; management of emergencies and even goods transport. The take up of RPAS exploitation for civil and security use would also enable the dual use logic to take full advantage of RPAS cost reduction. Current legislation does not provide a harmonised framework in Europe for enabling RPAS to fly in civil airspace, in particular Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS). This situation is curbing their use and application in the civil sphere thus making it difficult for the European industry to develop the technologies and equipment that will make their use possible in the future. The demonstration undertaken within the DeSIRE project aims at establishing an agreed set of requirements that could serve as a basis for the future definition of the regulatory framework for RPAS Air Traffic Integration in Europe. The DeSIRE project is part of the joint initiative undertaken by EDA and ESA, which follows a number of activities and projects initiated by the two agencies in the RPAS domain. Among these, the Air4All Study and MIDCAS project managed by EDA and the SINUE and ESPRIT studies managed by ESA.   More information: DeSIRE project page More information on the DeSIRE project is also available on the ESA website.

EDA_NEWS_0819	2013-04-23	NEWS	Steering Board: EDA Input for European Council	" On 23 April the European Defence Agency presented to the Steering Board a number of proposals in preparation of the European Council discussing defence topics at the end of this year. The proposals and actions concentrate around three clusters as defined by the European Council in December 2012: increase the effectiveness, visibility and impact of CSDP; enhance the development of defence capabilities; and strengthen Europe's defence industry. EDA has been active across these three clusters; it proposes, on top of its Pooling & Sharing projects, in particular Air-to-Air Refuelling, satellite communications and SESAR, to the Steering Board a number of actions for support to operations; the launch of dual-use “Pioneer” projects, initially in the areas of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) and Cyber Defence; technology non-dependence, as well as an action plan on SMEs. a) Pioneer Projects RPAS support military and civil activities alike. They thus offer the potential for a comprehensive European approach, in coordination with the European Commission, including in air traffic insertion (regulatory), technologies, platforms and use of space systems. Cyber Defence. EDA is developing ad hoc projects in the area of multinational cyber defence training, deployable cyber defence kits for headquarters, and research and technology. The aim is to launch these in autumn 2013, based on the EU Cyber Security Strategy and acknowledging the complementary activities of other actors in cyber defence, including ESA for space segments. To this end, EDA has established liaison arrangements with the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Tallinn. EDA is developing a roadmap for Cyber Defence technologies, closely coordinated with civil cyber security research, to address Member States’ future ad hoc cooperative investments. b) Technology Non-Dependence EDA is developing a concept and list of Critical Defence Technologies identifying technologies that should be maintained at European level. Electronic components and new materials are clear examples. European access to critical defence technologies will be key to further securing critical technologies, security of supply and European industry’s competitiveness and innovation. c) Action Plan on SMEs SMEs are an important factor for innovation. They are a key enabler of future industrial competiveness: encouraging their ability to access and prosper in the defence market is a priority. EDA work has focused on developing and disseminating best practice. EDA is implementing the SME Action Plan, including how to improve information sharing on business opportunities or facilitating interaction with the European Commission. In this regard, European Structural Funds may be used by Member States to co-fund dual-use activities in Research and Innovation. EDA will support Member States to access available EU resources for research and innovation, in line with identified technological and industrial priorities.   More information: Pictures of the Steering Board are available here News ""Steering Board: EDA Key Initiatives Make Progress"" (23 April 2013) News ""European Structural Funds: EDA Supports Six Pilot Projects"" (23 April 2013) News ""Baltic Defence Ministries Sign Joint Ammunition Procurement Arrangement"" (23 April 2013) "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/04/23/steering-board-eda-input-for-european-council

The seminar took place in the Naval Academy in Lisbon and was hosted by the Ministry of Defence of Portugal. Main objective of the seminar was to familiarise the Portuguese participants and similar south European regions, with the Smart Specialisation process and with the application procedures for European Structural Funds (ESF) including the opportunities for defence actors. EDA working closely with the European Commission is analysing the potential for integrating academia, institutes and industry active in the field of defence and security into the Research and Innovation Strategy of Smart Specialisation for dual-use technologies and to build relations between the civilian and military sectors. In a financially constrained environment EDA explores the possibility of using European tools, initiatives and instruments such as the ESF, without changing its civilian nature, as an opportunity to support innovation across Europe and to retain a competitive defence technological and industrial base, one better able to meet the defence capability requirements of Member States. Over the coming weeks EDA is organising similar regional seminars in Bulgaria, Poland and Ireland with the overarching objective to mobilise key stakeholders at regional level in defence and security industries, especially SMEs, but also in academia and research institutes, to encourage collective research and development and to influence better use of European Structural Funds for dual application projects.   More information: News ""Regional Smart Specialisation Workshop: Proceedings Available"" (14 Feb 2013) News ""Strengthening the Defence Industrial Sector"" (28 Jan 2013) "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/04/08/smart-specialisation-european-structural-funds-first-seminar-in-portugal
EDA_NEWS_0823	2013-04-09	NEWS	First European Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course Started	 The EDA in partnership with Rotary Wing Operational Evaluation and Training Unit (RWOETU) from the UK and the Swedish Armed Forces, has developed a European Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (EHTIC) as a sub-project to the EDA Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP).  The aim is to develop a common train-the-trainer capacity to assist in future harmonisation and interoperability. The first EHTIC started on 8 Apr 2013 at RAF Linton and it is executed in two parts. The first part consists of a two weeks ground phase of classroom theory and a one week simulator phase to be conducted in the EDA purpose built facility in RAF Linton-on-Ouse.  The second part will be a flying phase with the duration of three weeks, conducted at FMV Test Range, Vidsel, Sweden.  The total of thirteen students (instructor-pilots) from Germany and Sweden will go through intensive theoretical, synthetic and practical training led by 14 RAF Qualified helicopter instructor pilots with the aim to give selected European helicopter aircrew tactical depth and expertise leading to an enhanced awareness of helicopter tactics and employment, and multi-national integration. The EHTIC is also attended by observers from Austria, Hungary, Estonia and Sweden. The course graduation is scheduled for 24 May 2013. The EHTIC is designed to provide pMS with an opportunity to train standardised helicopter tactics instructors, acting as multipliers and mentors not only in their home units, but as well interacting with the EDA HEP and the Helicopter Tactics Course (HTC). These instructors will provide an significant contribution to an increasing interoperability and a better understanding between European helicopter crews and will form a cadre of European Helicopter Tactics Instructors.   More information:  More information on the Agency's helicopter initiatives can be found here.

EDA_NEWS_0825	2013-04-08	NEWS	EDA - Industry Standardisation Conference	 The European Defence Agency organised a standardisation conference for military land vehicle systems, vehicle components including sensors & effectors and supply chain on 4 April 2013. Both major European system houses and SME’s participated in the conference and presented their views and proposals for standardisation of land vehicle systems.  The conference was chaired by the EDA Armaments Director Mr Giampaolo Lillo and co-chaired by the ASD-STAN Director Mr Günter Lessmann. The conference underlined the importance of the concept of open standard architecture. This concept offers a high potential for benefits in the competitiveness and strengthening of the European Defence Technology and Industrial Base. Certainly it is not only limited to the area of land vehicle systems, but in particularly this technical domain needs further consolidation and more efficient solutions both among EDA’s Member States and the industry. One conclusion of the conference was therefore to revitalise the Expert Group for Armoured Land Vehicle Technology to identify best practice standard recommendations in this technical domain. The objective will then be to publish these recommendations on the EDA European Defence Standards reference system (EDSTAR) which is a tool to provide both governmental organisations and industry for procurement of Defence material with best practice standards. Of course, it is necessary to meet a consensus among all stakeholders and with EDA's conference a starting point was set for the revival of the technical domain of land vehicles with a successful end to suggest at least for some components of land vehicles best practice recommendations. EDA will take further actions to (re-)open an expert group competent to deliver these best practice recommendations. Furthermore the conference discussions have proven the link between the harmonisation of requirements and the standardisation activities. This underlines EDA’s role in the coordination of standardisation management as the harmonisation of requirements is one of EDA’s core missions. Another aspect highlighted by industry is the need of practical demonstrations (demonstrators) for supporting standardization and proving the concept of a new developed standard. Finally the importance of standardising the test requirements and procedures for the Defence Test and Evaluation Bases (DTEB) was exemplified for the qualification of ammunition.

EDA_NEWS_0827	2013-03-26	NEWS	Pooling & Sharing: Early Results for Operations	 Peter Round, Capabilities Director of the European Defence Agency, highlighted during his presentation at the Agency’s annual conference some Pooling & Sharing priorities. Already in his introduction he made clear that Pooling & Sharing was not just a buzz word and that pragmatism was the answer to budget restrictions in Member States. Mr Round emphasised that the objective of Pooling & Sharing was to address shortfalls while getting more out of current capabilities and at the same time freeing resources for other activities. While Pooling & Sharing might look easy on paper, it clearly is not. However, the Agency’s work since the endorsement of eleven initial Pooling & Sharing priorities by Defence Ministers in November 2011, has produced concrete results. Mr Round mentioned in his presentation the Agency’s Counter-IED Laboratory as an excellent example of EU/NATO co-operation and of EDA’s support to operations. Other projects with possible benefits to operations are the Agency’s European Satellite Communication Procurement Cell, its helicopter training programme, the Maritime Surveillance network, the field hospitals initiative and its comprehensive work regarding air-to-air refuelling. Regarding the latter, Mr Round emphasised that the Agency was addressing shortfalls as well as fragmentation. Next to these projects, the Agency is also working on improving efficiency. Some examples are its initiatives on diplomatic clearances for transport aircraft or on innovative tools like the Third Party Logistic Support or the Effective Procurement Methods. Finally, Mr Round emphasised the importance of the recently signed Code of Conduct on Pooling & Sharing as an important signal of increased will to cooperate.   More information: Presentation by Peter Round (Pooling & Sharing Annual Conference 2013) Pooling & Sharing factsheet European Defence Matters: summary  Alan Shatter: Speech EDA Conference Speech by Herman Van Rompuy, Council President Speech by Catherine Ashton, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs & Security Policy, Vice-President of the European Commission and Head of the European Defence Agency Welcome by Claude-France Arnould Pictures on Flickr Event summary on Storify Video report on YouTube 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/03/26/pooling-sharing-early-results-for-operations
EDA_NEWS_0828	2013-03-26	NEWS	European Framework Cooperation: First Achievements for CBRN	 On 13 March 2013 the European Commission and the European Defence Agency co-organised a workshop on European Framework Cooperation (EFC) CBRN in Madrid as part of the EC Security Research Event included in HOMSEC 2013. The focus of the workshop was to brief participants on  the first achievements of the EFC CBRN and the way ahead based upon the lessons learned. Mr Marco Malacarne (EC) and Mr Christian Breant (EDA) opened the workshop and gave an introduction on EFC CBRN as the first pilot under EFC. They concluded that it has been successful so far. Co-chairs Tristan Simonart (EC) and Gerlof de Wilde (EDA) elaborated on results out of the exchange of letters signed between the EC and the EDA on 15 Sept 2011. Coordination has been covering several aspects related to:  the preparation of research activities (i.e. calls for proposals) the evaluation of the proposals and the implementation of research activities Shared meetings and exchange of information Since 2011, EC and EDA are participating to respective programme management committees meetings (SEC programme Committee and  EDA JIP CBRN Management Committee). They regularly exchange information on on-going and future activities. EDA expert(s) were involved (access to proposal, consensus meetings and panel meeting) in CBRN proposals evaluations under FP7SEC-2011 and FP7-SEC-2012. They have been invited for the next evaluation FP7-SEC-2013. EC expert(s) were involved (access to proposal, consensus meeting and panel meeting) in evaluation of the first JIP CBRN call in Sept 2012. EC is invited to the Executive Management Groups (EMG) of the JIP CBRN projects. EDA is participating in several FP7 projects advisory groups. Transfer and re-use of results In the frame of the EFC, several projects have established links and have considered transfer or re-use of available results. EFC has contributed to synchronise research priorities for 2012 respective calls, taking into account areas and topics covered by each funding schemes, with a particular influence on the content of the first JIP CBRN call. JIP CBRN as EDA contribution to EFC The JIP CBRN is a managed as an EDA Category A Programme and has a budget of 12 Million Euro. Contributing members are Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Sweden and Norway. The JIP-CBRN provides a broad framework to conduct cooperative research in the fields of basic and applied science, to carry technology development up to the level of demonstration projects. The first call for proposals under the EFC was launched on 2 May 2012. The first call included the following topics: Improved Standoff detection of C agents Simultaneous analysis of CBR agents (mixed samples) Next generation point detection for B agents M&S of CBRN system architectures The first Call for proposals has resulted in 7 selected projects. Contracts are underway. Future of the EFC CBRN The second JIP CBRN call is scheduled for 2013 (under preparation with the participation of the EC). It will include the following topics: Next generation personal protection Next generation collective protection Next generation Decontamination CBRN Sensor-networking Under Horizon 2020 the cooperation on CBRN research will remain and will probably be reinforced. Work must be done in the area of IPR and user rights as the frameworks of EDA and EC differ in this respect.   CBRN CIV/MIL synergies addressed by workshop speakers The workshop speakers addressed several synergies between civilian and military research in CBRN protection: Dr Blatny (FFI, Norway) highlighted the standardisation efforts within FP7 projects SLAM and EQUATOX and the JIP CBRN project BFREE on CBRN sample handing. Mrs Patricia Lopez Vicente and prof Lourdes Calvo Garrido addressed CIV/MIL synergies in Spanish research related to cleaning and decontamination technologies. Prof Jean Luc Gala gave a presentation regarding the CIV/MIL aspects of research on contagious diseases / B threat agents. He presented an ESA project on Mobile Labs. He proposed a European Cluster of Excellence for CBRN. Dr Ruud Busker presented the JIP CBRN project IPODS, addressing the challenge of point Detection for B threats by using a combination of technologies such as Mass spectroscopy and fast Immunological Identification.

EDA_NEWS_0829	2013-03-22	NEWS	European Defence Matters	 450 key decision makers from the European Union defence community, including Member States, European institutions, research bodies, think-tanks, industry and the media, along with 17 high-level speakers, met at the annual conference of the European Defence Agency (EDA) yesterday in Brussels to discuss how Europe can enhance its capabilities at a time of decreasing defence budgets. “When in November 2011 Defence Ministers approved eleven Pooling & Sharing priorities they sent a clear signal that, in times of austerity, complex operations and highly advanced technology, acting together is essential if Europe is to preserve and develop the capabilities it requires,” said Claude-France Arnould, Chief Executive of the EDA, introducing the event. The European Council will discuss defence topics during its December 2013 summit; conference speakers and delegates agreed that this meeting will have to take critical decisions on finance and empowering European institutions to speed initiatives such as Pooling & Sharing if Europe is to meet its defence and security commitments. But the gap between the political rhetoric on cooperation and the speed with which it is being introduced by national administrations was a key feature of the  debate at the EDA annual conference, entitled “European Defence Matters.”  Capability gap “We face critical capability gaps,” according to Cathy Ashton, head of the EDA, who underlined what could be done through successful EU cooperation in defence. She also mentioned the efforts of EU operations, such as seeing piracy drop by 95% over the last three years in Somalia, while over 3,000 Somali troops have been trained. “If current trends continue by 2017 we risk losing 17% of the European expenditures since the economic crisis started,” said Mr Van Rompuy, President of the European Council. It was a strong message echoed by many speakers, with serious consequences for the European defence industrial base. “My main concern is not so much CSDP as such or “EU defence”, but rather the state of defence in Europe. That's how Presidents and Prime Ministers look at these issues together” declared President Van Rompuy. “The same goes for their joint responsibility for our continent's defence; there also, decisions in one country, will affect others. There is too little public awareness of this, and in that respect precisely, Presidents and Prime Ministers are uniquely placed to convince a wider public opinion, and thereby to set things into motion. (…) Upon receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo last December, [European leaders] said the European Union stands by those in pursuit of peace and human dignity. To fulfil such responsibilities, we should make sure we have the means at our disposal.” “For the defence dimension of our discussion in December, for me the important thing is to make concrete progress on three key issues: (1) priorities for future investment and equipment procurement; (2) strengthening our industrial base, so that it remains competitive and innovative; (3) and finally, the preparation and availability of forces.” stated the President of the European Union. Industrial base According to Tom Enders, Chief Executive of EADS, unless serious action is taken Europe risks losing key elements of its defence industrial base as skilled personnel either leave or transfer to civil industry. “We are facing a challenge of political drift,” said Mr Enders, “it is unlikely that EADS which was formed in 1999 could be created in 2013.” “The biggest threat to European defence today is shrinking budgets. We need some light from Heads of States.” said Mr Danjean. So what are the options? According to Claude France Arnould, Chief Executive of the EDA it would be unrealistic to expect a 20% increase in the budget of the EDA - but if more Member States came forward to support  individual Pooling & Sharing programmes that would be an excellent start.  “Money is not just the only sign of support,” said Ms Arnould.   Concurring with Tom Enders saying that more money should be given to EDA, Mr Klich, Senator of the Republic of Poland and former Minister of Defence also stated “But I have doubts about the current budget of the EDA”, suggesting that as the EDA was the only European organisation actively working to increase defence cooperation it would need more resources to undertake its role. Success in cooperation Many speakers pointed out some of the success stories of what has been achieved through cooperation in recent years. General de Rousiers, Chairman of the Military Committee of the EU, gave the example of the European air transport command which had been created in a relatively short time and the working being undertaken to exploit civil observation satellite assets for military operations. “Pooling & Sharing is one of the greatest European defence achievements of the last two to three years,” said Mr Klich. The priorities for European defence leaders were also discussed – Mr Missiroli, Director of the European Institute for Security Studies suggested these were securing the European homeland, securing the European neighbouring areas, securing global commerce and ensuring access to energy. Delegates also discussed the “quick wins” which the European Council could sanction such as improving military access to space resources, coordinating cyber defence activities, opening access to remotely piloted air systems (RPAS) in the European sky and developing air to air capabilities through Pooling & Sharing. “Cooperation between NATO ACT and EDA is essential and well-functioning” said General Palomeros, NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander Transformation. “There is a pressing need to balance defence commitments from both sides of the Atlantic, and European partners will need to deliver their full share in capabilities.” In some areas, such as developing a single European requirement for an RPAS MALE system, European defence departments have already missed the boat, but in others, such as the A400M military transport, consolidated capability requirements had delivered positive results. But not all European states faced the same problems. Mr Krystowski, CEO of Poland’s BUMAR group clearly said some states in central and Eastern Europe had different defence priorities to those in the West and a more vibrant economy which should be taken into account. Task force on defence A critical input into the Council’s meeting later this year will come from the European Commission’s task force looking at bolstering the continent’s defence industrial and technological sector. Mr Calleja, Director General of the Enterprise and Industry Directorate General of the European Commission underlined some of the priorities already identified by the task force, including enhancing the common security and defence policy, building a strong industrial base, strengthening the internal defence market, developing an industrial base to include SMEs and their access to finance and improving R&T levels of funding. Another priority was energy conservation. “Europe’s military spends around €1 billion a year on energy,” he said, “the same as a small European state.”  Despite the problems the EDA has made significant progress over the last year in meeting capability gaps through Pooling & Sharing, said Peter Round, Director Capabilities at the agency. Ten Member States are now working on a joint procurement programme to acquire urgently needed air-to-air refuelling assets in the long-term. A further procurement initiative was underway to access satellite communications services from the civil sector for a range of operational needs. Another multi-national initiative has been launched to provide medical hospitals for troops in the field. “We must now close the gap between rhetoric and reality” concluded Claude-France Arnould.  More information: Speech by Herman Van Rompuy, Council President Speech by Catherine Ashton, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs & Security Policy, Vice-President of the European Commission and Head of the European Defence Agency.

EDA_NEWS_0830	2013-03-22	NEWS	European Defence Matters: Welcome by Claude-France Arnould	 European defence matters is the title of this year’s annual conference of the European Defence Agency. It is one that is wholly appropriate as the defence community prepares for Heads of States and Government discussing defence topics at the European Council at the end of the year, and beyond. This conference will serve as an important platform to prepare and shape that key event. The European Defence Agency’s mission is to support Member States in their efforts to develop military capabilities as well as to enhance European cooperation in Research &Technology (R&T) . What is of key importance for me is that the Agency is at the service of European Member States, including when it comes to current or future operations. When in November 2011 Defence Ministers approved eleven Pooling & Sharing priorities, they sent a clear signal that, in times of austerity, complex operations and highly advanced technology, acting together is essential if Europe is to preserve and develop the capabilities it requires. The Agency’s Pooling & Sharing projects on Air-to-Air Refuelling and satellite communications are but two examples. Their relevance was demonstrated during the Libya operation; and reconfirmed more recently in Mali. The Air-to-Air Refuelling initiative has four work-strands to take care of short-, mid- and long-term solutions. Ten Member States have agreed to work together to acquire new tanker aircraft. And in the short–term, we will soon see an EDA-organised clearance campaign for Italian tankers to refuel other European aircraft. In the area of satellite communications, we have launched a procurement cell, which allows contributing Member States to benefit from commonly procured communication capacity. The cell can – and indeed shortly will – be used during operations to facilitate access to this scarce resource. The Agency is also examining longer-term activities in this domain, for example through the Pooling & Sharing of future governmental satellite communication assets. Today, we will look at lessons from past cooperative projects, at the longer-term goals, and at what new impulses are required to achieve them. Synergies between civil and military actors are cornerstones of future success. The EU needs to mobilise the instruments available through the full range of its policies. Today we are extending the EU’s Comprehensive Approach into the area of capabilities. But political will at the highest level is essential. Success will require the active involvement of those who are responsible for providing our soldiers with the necessary capabilities: capabilities encompassing not only equipment, but also training,  employment and logistic support. We need a cutting-edge industry to support our defence, our innovation, our growth and our security of supply. That is why particular attention to European industrial and technological potential is vital in this time of financial austerity. Industry needs the oxygen of a well-functioning market. But it also needs programmes, today and in the future. Industry also has a central role to play in providing solutions through cooperation. To conclude, success will require political will, engagement by national defence administrations, and the involvement of industry. We are therefore honoured to have gathered here today key players from the EU, from government, the military and industry. We look forward to your discussions. I am confident that they will provide direction to and indeed inspire our work.

EDA_NEWS_0835	2013-03-12	NEWS	First EDA-Egmont PhD Prize Awarded	" The First EDA-Egmont PhD Prize in European Defence, Security and Strategy has been awarded to Dr Benjamin Pohl for his dissertation ""But We Have to Do Something – The Drivers behind European Crisis Management Operations"". The EDA-Egmont PhD Prize in European defence, security and strategy is intended to encourage and stimulate European research in the context of European defence and security. The award targets the findings of research that have been carried out in the framework of a defended and approved doctoral thesis at a recognised academic institution in a Member State of the European Defence Agency. The Prize is awarded by the EDA in partnership with the Egmont Institute. The aim is to introduce a new award that acknowledges academic excellence while putting it in a European context. The unique partnership enables Egmont to ensure academic substance while the European Defence Agency exposes the research to the heart of European policy making. The jury of the EDA-Egmont Prize, composed of Claude-France Arnould, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency (EDA), General Patrick de Rousiers, Chairman of the EU Military Committee (EUMC), Dr Antonio Missiroli, Director of the EU Institute of Security Studies (EUISS), Prof. Jolyon Howorth, University of Yale, Prof. Richard Whitman, University of Kent, Dr Hilmar Linnenkamp, Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik, and chaired by Prof. Sven Biscop, Egmont, had a difficult task assessing no less than ten PhD dissertations of high quality, but arrived at an unanimous decision. The jury especially commends Dr Pohl’s work for asking a “key question” about the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), and answering it in a very persuasive manner. His findings are presented with admirable control and academic objectivity, giving full weight to a range of theoretical approaches in order to test their validity. The result is a very convincing thesis about the “drivers” of the CSDP. The dissertation was defended at the University of Leiden on 27 September 2012, under the supervision of Prof. Rob De Wijk. Presentation at the EDA Annual Conference Dr Pohl will receive his Prize at the Annual Conference of the EDA in Brussels on 21 March, where he will present his work to the conference participants.  For the EDA and Egmont, the first edition of the PhD Prize is an encouragement to continue promoting research on European defence, security and strategy.

EDA_NEWS_0838	2013-03-12	NEWS	Pooled Ammunition Procurement: EDA Supports Baltic States	 National Armament Directors of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have today launched the joint procurement of Carl-Gustav Ammunition in the framework of the European Defence Agency’s Effective Procurement Methods (EPM) initiative. EPM is a key Pooling & Sharing enabler which allows Member States to optimise the effectiveness of their procurement through combining existing common needs and translating them into joint procurement cases. This contract on the procurement of different types of Carl Gustav ammunition for the three Baltic States has an estimated value of up to € 50 million. EDA will support these Member States in the cooperation set-up and the contracting phases. The contract notice is expected to be published by June and the award decision to be delivered before the end of the year. “This joint procurement case is a manifestation of the trust between the three Baltic States and the European Defence Agency. We appreciate the support by the Agency and invite other Member States to join this initiative”, says Ingvar Pärnamäe, National Armament Director of Estonia, the lead nation in the procurement project. The European Defence Agency has previously successfully conducted several Effective Procurement Method cases including one on the Counter-IED exercise European Guardian held in Austria, covering instructors’ services and expertise; and another one on Basic Logistics Services for the 2012 EU Battle Group for three Member States: Austria, the Czech Republic and Germany with a total value of €228 million. Potential savings yielded by shared procurement of military equipment and services lie between 20 to 50 per cent.

EDA_NEWS_0839	2013-03-12	NEWS	IEDs Won’t Go Away	 Three days of the Resilient Threat Management 2013 conference and the conclusion is undisputed – IEDs are here to stay and the only way to defeat them is through a comprehensive approach at a global level drawing on the strengths of both military and civil security resources. Resilient Threat Management 2013 – a partnership between the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union and the EDA –aimed at taking stock of all the efforts to date dedicated to Countering Improvised Explosive Devices (C-IED) while pointing the direction to the future. IEDs have existed for hundreds of years and there is a consensus that they will continue to exist for many more years to come. What complicates things is that they are employed by networks adversaries that range from terrorists to organised criminals affecting both the European homeland as well as crisis zones around the world. Each of these adversary networks have an agenda and employ IEDs along with other types of asymmetric methods to achieve their goals, with no consideration to civilian bi-standers. The consequences are heartbreaking tragedies. Resilient Threat Management 2013 saw experts come together for two days to share information, experiences and ideas on how to take C-IED to the next phase. At the end of current operations, the fight against IEDs will continue but in a different way. Experts delved into the overarching strategic aspects as well as discussing the future of specifics such as forensic exploitation – its dual-use nature and its role as the hub for intelligence building, evidence gathering and for technology development. Scientists provided further insights into novel approaches to defeating the network, detection technologies, neutralisation techniques and deployable forensics. The third and final day brought decision-makers to the table. With Professor Sven Biscop (Egmont Institute) addressing the EU’s role in future crisis management, Dr Jamie SHEA (NATO) spoke about the complexities of asymmetric warfare. A panel with representatives from the IHS, EU Military Staff, Irish Defence Forces, Guardia Civil and RUSI then addressed what threat management needs to be like beyond 2020. A second panel with representatives FRIDE, EDA, FBI, An Garda Siochana, EUROPOL and OSCE explored how we can solidify inter-institutional cooperation platforms, within Europe and also outside. Ciaran Murphy (Irish Department of Defence) addressed the need for the EU to mirror President Barak Obama’s recent C-IED policy statement. Peter Round and Graham Muir (EDA) spoke about EDA’s role in developing a comprehensive strategy for Member States in partnership with other institutions in order to establish a vehicle for ensuring that we are prepared to tackle the evolving threats in a resilient manner. Many lives have been lost in combating the IEDs. Many more lives have been lost in relearning how to combat IEDs. We cannot afford to repeat this learning process costing more lives. Resilient Threat Management 2013 has shown that there is a will among experts, decision makers, Member States and institutions to work together and to build on the current momentum. The fight against the IED needs to continue. It must, however, do so as part of a comprehensive approach to managing the evolution of asymmetric threats and their networks. Preparedness and resilience are key to success.

EDA_NEWS_0844	2013-02-08	NEWS	Aerial Refuelling Clearance for Italian KC-767	" The European Defence Agency (EDA) will in the next months organise a European-wide collective air-to-air refuelling (AAR) clearance trial for Italy’s Boeing KC-767 military aerial refuelling and strategic tanker aircraft. The trial is part of EDA’s efforts to address Europe’s AAR capability shortfall. Mandated by Defence Ministers in March 2012, EDA is engaged in four work strands to increase the European AAR capability: short-term gap filling, optimisation of existing assets and organisation, optimisation of AAR capacity offered by the future A400M fleet as well as the long-term enhancement of Europe’s strategic tanker capability. Aerial Refuelling Clearance As a mean to increase the number of AAR clearances for receivers and hereby more efficiently pool & share European aerial refueling capabilities, EDA together with the Movement Coordination Centre Europe and Italy organise a two weeks collective AAR clearance campaign on the recently fielded Italian KC767 aircraft. During the trial, interested Member States will be able to perform the necessary ground and in-flight tests to  obtain missing AAR clearances. So far, 10 nations have expressed interest in participating in the trial. Urgency AAR clearances are a prerequisite to interoperability in multinational operations. Europe can today deploy 42 tanker aircraft of ten different types and more than 40% of required clearances are missing. While for critical requirements and war-time operations clearances limited to a specific operation can be issued on a case by case basis, EDA’s initiative will allow for a coordinated approach for full and unlimited clearances. This will increase the flexibility of AAR operations and facilitate immediate deployment of assets in future. Background AAR is a critical enabler for air power projection and it is required to enable anything beyond short range air combat operations. A unique force multiplier, it is a fundamental capability embedded in modern aircraft design, not just in combat aircraft, but across the full spectrum of air platforms – including in the near future Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. European armed forces rely substantively on American assets. This was originally demonstrated in the Kosovo Campaign, and the increased reliance on the US was a lesson from operations over Libya.

EDA_NEWS_0848	2013-02-06	NEWS	EDA Participates in Cyber Defence Conferences	" IQPC´s Cyber Defence & Network Security (CDANS) Conference 2013 was held at the Russel Hotel in London from 29 to 30 January 2013. The conference attracted an international panel of speakers, clearly illustrating one of the key messages - the need of international cooperation and sharing of information. Belgium’s Minister of Defence, Pieter De Crem, then rightly took on this requirement in his speech ""Key International Challenges for Cooperation and Coordination against Cyber Attacks"". Representatives of the European Defence Agency, as a facilitator of cooperation among European member states, had been invited to speak. In the morning and afternoon sessions of the second day, EU institutions were able to deliver a taste of how much interrelation and coordination has developed since Cyber Security has been put on a joint agenda. European Framework Cooperation Marco Malacarne, Head of Security Research and Industry at DG Enterprise and Industry of the European Commission, started with introducing some Cyber research projects funded under the Security Programme of the EU Framework Programme 7, and giving an outlook on the next framework programme called Horizon 2020. He explained how the European Commission, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Defence Agency (EDA) coordinate their research efforts under the European Framework Cooperation (EFC). Michael Sieber, Assistant R&T Director at EDA, summarised the key messages from a joint EFC workshop organised in Brussels on 23 October 2012. There, a top-class panel of speakers, mainly from academia, shared their views on future research priorities. Cyber  Security requires a multidisciplinary approach - it is not only technology. Service and product providers need incentives for more security and safety, to be integrated already by design, and they need to be more competitive. Among the users, higher level of security and safety awareness  is required. Finally, specific profiles of Security and Defence will prompt more robust resilience, with specific technologies for detection, reaction, prevention/protection. In this respect, EDA will contribute to the EFC by its Cyber Defence Research Agenda, currently being established. EDA Progress Air Commodore Peter Round, EDA Capability Director, explained the exceptional progress the Agency has made, supported by a project team of 23 Member States' delegates, on a considerable portfolio of initiatives, such as stock-taking, training, conceptual work and intelligence. The EU circle of presentations was completed by Victoria Baines, Strategic Advisor on Cyber Crime from the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) in The Hague. The show room offered newest Cyber technology presented by a number of exhibitors, and occassions for interesting discussions. Parallel to this IQPC conference in London, Cyber Security/Defence conferences took place in Lille and Brussels around the same dates, with EDA invited to all of them. EDA R&T Director Christian Bréant addressed strategic technological issues in a high level industrial policy panel of the 5ème Forum International de la cybersécurité (FIC 2013) co-organised by the French Gendarmerie Nationale, Région Nord-Pas-de-Calais and CEIS. EDA Cyber Defence Project Officer Wolfgang Röhrig participated in another FIC 2013 panel (Crossed views on Cyber Security Strategies), before he moved on to the ESRT Global Cyber Security Conference in Brussels.

EDA_NEWS_0849	2013-02-04	NEWS	Bio Sensor Information Demonstrator	 A consortium led by Sagem, with Hidalgo and the Institut de Recherche Biomédicale des Armées, recently handed over the Bio Sensor Information Demonstrator to the European Defence Agency (EDA) after a twelve-month elaboration and development.  The aims of this project were to generate operational requirements for soldiers’ health status, to investigate possible sensor solutions and to assess the integration into the soldiers’ C4I systems through a thorough analysis and a validation during a representative demonstration. The realistic operational requirements for a soldier’s Health Monitoring System (HMS) were identified with the involvement of participating Member States (pMS), European Union Military Staff (EUMS) and EDA experts in March 2012. The Demonstration Phase was performed in September 2012 at Sagem’s Development Centre of Massy in France and included laboratory and operational tests. This study has allowed identifying the operational requirements for a HMS integrated in a Soldier’s Combat system. The analysis also assessed data and information needed for both medical and command chains in operational situations. With limited improvements and integration efforts, current technologies and systems could be effectively used in training missions in the shorter term. The pMS will now assess the study results, if applicable compare them with their national results and discuss the way forward in the respective R&T and Capability panels within EDA.

EDA_NEWS_0850	2013-02-04	NEWS	Progress for Military Airworthiness Harmonisation	 Continuing to build on the excellent progress already made, on 23 January 2013 the Military Airworthiness Authorities (MAWA) Forum approved two more airworthiness documents for publication (EMAR 21 Section A & B (combined) and EMAD R). This brings the total number of airworthiness documents now published on the EDA website to seven. In November 2008, the EDA Steering Board entrusted the EDA with the establishment of a Military Airworthiness Authorities (MAWA) Forum and approved the associated military airworthiness roadmap for achieving common harmonisation and certification processes. The harmonisation of military airworthiness regulations is a strategic decision for improving European armaments co-operation, enhancing the competitiveness of the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base and improving cohesion between joint military-military and civil-military airworthiness regulations. Participating Member States all have their own national-specific systems to manage the airworthiness of their military aircraft. However, until the formation of the EDA MAWA Forum, there has been very little coordination between European States. The implementation of the harmonised European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) into national regulations will address this lack of cohesion. Jan Plevka, Chairman of the EDA MAWA Forum, said “I am absolutely delighted with the approval of these latest airworthiness documents. A huge amount of effort and commitment is required to harmonise often diverse views and opinions. However, the success that the MAWA Forum has achieved clearly shows the significant cooperation that nations have provided to this activity.” The goal of the EDA MAWA Forum is to have the full suite of EMARs available by the end of 2015.

In parallel it provided regional decision makers with practical knowledge on the potential of the defence sector to support regional economic development.    Europe’s defence industry, formed by many world class companies large and small, has long been a driving force for technical innovation, wealth generation and business growth across Europe but with constrained defence spending there is a need for new approaches. In this context the workshop addressed three key themes;   increasing the cross-fertilisation between the military and civil sectors; promoting best practice for defence related industry centres of excellence/clusters contributing to regional development; investigating the support that regional policy can offer to defence-related SME supply chain.   The workshop is a practical example of how European Commission instruments and EDA expertise can be fused to help support Europe retaining an innovative and competitive industrial base, one better able to meet the defence capability requirements of Member States.   Over the coming weeks EDA and European Commission will be analysing the workshop proceedings to see what lessons can be learnt and what concrete measures can be undertaken – to support the defence industry. This input is also very timely as the European Commission is preparing a Communication in support of the competitiveness of the defence industry and the internal market, which is expected to be finalised by June 2013.      	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/01/28/strengthening-the-defence-industrial-sector

EDA_NEWS_0856	2013-01-21	NEWS	Future Soldier Systems	 Eight EDA Member States launch a Feasibility Study Programme to address four topics related to soldier systems, namely on observation, energy, human factors and survivability. The objective of the programme is to further identify possibilities offered by existing and innovative technologies to later recommend the implementation on future soldier systems, or to identify possible trends of research investment to improve system performance. The deadline for this call for proposals is 12 April 2013.  The majority of EDA Member States have their own national soldier system programmes, which are often not interoperable. Cooperation in developing new soldier systems is advantageous given the high number of multinational operations as well as the high costs of developing individual soldier systems.  The EDA programme Combat Equipment for Dismounted Soldier (CEDS) gathers the efforts of eight contributing Member States (Austria, France, Germany, Finland, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Sweden). These countries have already defined common requirements, and will now investigate technologies for future soldier systems in the technology areas of energy, survivability, human factors and observation through a Feasibility Study Programme (CEDS-FSP). The prospect is to propose common technological solutions in the mid-term. A part of the Feasibility Study Programme takes the form of a set of studies to be awarded following a call for proposals. All the documentation necessary to take part in this call for proposals (deadline: 12 April 2013) is available on EDA website in the procurement section.  More information: Call for proposals 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/01/21/future-soldier-systems

EDA_NEWS_0858	2013-01-08	NEWS	Resilient Threat Management Conference	 The EDA will gather decision makers and experts on 4 - 6 March 2013 for a conference that will examine the future of threats and how we can collaborate to develop a pool for readily available and resilient capabilities. Current operations have taught EDA Member States about modern warfare and forced them to adapt. Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) symbolise this change in mind set. In some ways primitive, but when put in the context of a network that ensures funding, manufacturing, distribution and emplacement, they have repeatedly proven their effectiveness against forces designed for the Cold War as well as their ruthlessness against bystanders. But what lies ahead at home and in theatre? A few trends can be observed that hint on in which direction operations are heading. Future deployed operations may no longer be large land based, airborne or naval units working together to achieve a desired end state. Instead focus is more likely to be on gathering intelligence to support specific low level operations with the aim of arresting suspects and securing evidence in order to bring them to justice, avoiding to the use of force.  To achieve this, a number of different actors are likely to be involved, beyond the military. Operations are likely to continue to be exposed to public scrutiny via media, requiring full transparency and accountability to governance and legislation. However militaries will be required to retain their ability to act as a deterrent to other states and thus need to be able to manage both ends of the conflict spectrum. Being prepared requires having in place capabilities that can tackle a number of conventional and asymmetric threats, not only IEDs. Drawing on civil-military synergies to maximise the availability of effective and resilient capabilities could provide solutions. The Conference pinnacle is the High Level Day, during which senior decision makers from Governments, EU institutions, international organisations as well as academia to discuss how threats are likely to evolve and how we can ensure a sufficient level or preparedness for future operations. The High Level Day will be preceded by an Expert Conference where accepted papers will be presented on specific areas such as forensics, detection, training and search. A Government-only Seminar will focus on the story so far with regard to the role of exploitation past, present and future. Stay tuned for more information on how to register and how to submit papers.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/01/08/resilient-threat-management-conference
EDA_NEWS_0859	2013-01-07	NEWS	Counter IED Lab Saves Lives in Afghanistan	 Of all the weapons deployed by terrorists the improvised explosive device (IED) is the most effective, causing more combat casualties than any other method of attack in Afghanistan. NATO Exploitation Level Two for C-IED requires intermediate processing of information in theatre for investigation of IED events. This implies a forward deployed asset with sufficient capacity to deal with a wide variety of data input and a team of specialists to analyse, interpret and disseminate the product derived from such investigation. That is exactly what the EDA laboratory, built by Indra in Spain, has provided for the Multinational TEL (MN TEL) deployed last year. The laboratory was deployed to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) theatre of operations under the management of France, which assumed Lead Nation responsibility for the project. Captain Jean-Charles Dhyser of the French corps of military engineers was tasked by the Direction Générale de l’Armement (DGA - France’s defence procurement management authority) with overseeing the development of the laboratory in collaboration with the EDA. Once deployed, he acted in the capacity of technical advisor and EOD expert to the commander of the MN TEL. Long-term engagement “It is important to note that this is a long term project and what we have deployed so far is just a trial version. Nevertheless, we have managed a marriage of all the principles involved and can already identify at least five individuals who have been caught making IEDs as a result of the TEL’s activity. Which is what this project is all about – the ultimate objective is the saving of lives,” he said. The laboratory itself, consisting of a number of standard ISO containers jammed with equipment, provides a wide range of facilities for the gathering of IED event-related information and the processing of that information into actionable intelligence for use by local commanders. In addition to photographic facilities and what Dhyser calls a “triage and security” functionality, the TEL consists of four main modules: biometric analysis (latent finger print recovery) electrical circuitry (primarily radio parts); media recovery (focused on the mobile phones often used as IED triggering devices); and chemical analysis. “Every explosive has a chemical signature, identification of which is extremely useful,” said Dhyser. Level Two accreditation Level Two accreditation of the laboratory is a major step forward. “This gives us the capability for a more comprehensive and rapid analysis after an IED event and enables us to develop intelligence that allows us to get inside the enemy’s decision chain – it’s really about entering the mindset of the terrorist and interrupting his production process; being able to take action before the next event,” he said. Very few nations have a Level Two capability at the moment – the United States and United Kingdom foremost among them – so the development of a European TEL is an extremely important asset. In a novel approach to pooling and sharing, the EDA’s approach to the MN TEL was to manage the project through its own operational budget and to procure the asset for use by any participating Member State (pMS). Although France, as lead nation, was joined by Austria, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Romania and Poland in directly supporting the project, any pMS can request deployment of the TEL, conditional on its accepting responsibility as lead nation for the deployment period. Comprehensive and rapid analysis The major advantages of the MN TEL, according to Dhyser, are the features of “portability and above all flexibility – the ability to develop and disseminate information in a very short period of time.” The rapid nature of activity is not limited to the operational level, however: the speed with which the procurement and deployment process is quite impressive, even by comparison with other urgent operational requirements (UOR) coming from the Afghan theatre of operations. “This was true de facto collaboration and we were able to contribute significantly to the activities of Combined Joint Task Force Paladin in areas not covered by purely national assets,” said Antoine Torres, spokesman for the DGA. He adds that some of the immediate results of the initial deployment point to the “true benefits stemming from combining national technological capabilities with an international team of experts and a secure working environment.” Having analysts on the spot, from a variety of nations, with different but complimentary experience and a depth of knowledge that can be applied to a situation as it evolves, rather than at the end of a long communication chain back to a laboratory in mainland Europe, has already proven to be an asset worth every cent of the funding that has gone into making the TEL demonstrator available for operations.  More information For more information on the EDA's Counter-IED work, go to the project page.  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/01/07/counter-ied-lab-saves-lives-in-afghanistan
EDA_NEWS_0860	2012-12-21	NEWS	European Initiatives in the Maritime Environment	 Under the auspices of the Cyprus EU Presidency, the European Defence Agency together with the Cypriot Ministry of Defence organised a seminar on European initiatives in the maritime environment on 18 and 19 October. The seminar aimed at highlighting the need to address the future capacity of Europe to act, taking into account the requirement for appropriate maritime assets within the current financial climate and the need for identification of civil-military synergies. Maritime security and defence is of high importance for Europe as highlighted by the Council conclusions on Maritime Security Strategy (26 April 2010) and the Commission’s Green paper “Towards a future Maritime Policy for the Union” (7 June 2006). Maritime Security could be considered as three separate pillars of knowledge, regulations and capacity to act. In the opening speech of the seminar, Mr Demetris Eliades, Cyprus Minister of Defence, highlighted Cyprus’ aim to contribute towards the maintenance of safe navigation, the protection of sea-lines and maritime transportation, in order to enhance security, which would allow maritime nations to make the best use of their maritime wealth and capacities. During the seminar, discussions focused on a strategic approach in the maritime security domain and several supportive actions were presented. Ideas for new Pooling & Sharing initiatives were also identified   The seminar concluded that for the European Union to be a global actor in the maritime environment, it requires the ability to act within the context of maritime security. The Union therefore needs to identify, in a strategic, integrated and comprehensive approach innovative and bold solutions for short- and long-term response.

EDA_NEWS_0861	2012-12-13	NEWS	EDA Kicks Off Aircraft Structural Health Monitoring Project	 On 13 December, Adam Sowa, EDA deputy chief executive, signed the ASTYANAX contract (aircraft fuselage crack monitoring system and prognosis through on-board expert sensor network). Italy, Poland and Spain contribute to this three-year, 4.17 M€ project. The contract was awarded to an industry consortium led by Politecnico di Milano. The research project will focus on the development of a reliable methodology for the application of a Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system on an aerodyne (rotor and fixed-wing platforms) structure. ASTYANAX represents an important follow-on of the HECTOR project from the ICET programme (Innovative Concept and Emerging Technologies), which concluded at the end of 2011 with very interesting and useful results. HECTOR developed a preliminary SHM methodology for metallic helicopter structures.  The current ASTYANAX project involves the following partners: From Italy: POLIMI (Politecnico di Milano, consortium leader), ALENIA Aermacchi, AgustaWestland. From Poland: AFIT (Air Force Institute of Technology), MAW1 (Military Aviation Works No. 1) , AGH (University of Science and Technology). From Spain: INTA (Instituto Nacional de Técnica Aeroespacial).  Next steps The first step proposed in ASTYANAX is to apply the developed methodology and the experience acquired in HECTOR to a large scale helicopter platform .. The results from HECTOR have so far only be tested and demonstrated on simple test beds. The main objective is to examine the possibility, and assess the requirements, to extend the HECTOR methodology to an air-vehicle fuselage, considering a rotary wing system (Mi-8/17 helicopter) as air-vehicle type. Given the input extension for SHM application on air-vehicle environments, the next step will be to directly apply a validated SHM device to a real platform: the helicopter Mi-8/17 Hip. This platform has been already identified by Poland (and shared by other partners) as suitable system for ASTYANAX’s scope. Inside this platform the aim is to concentrate the attention on a real component, critical for maintenance procedures and, at the same time, available for device testing and development without interfering with safety parameters. After a preliminary analysis to identify the most suitable component/part, the attention will be focused on a particular structural section defined according to the criticalities identified through the end-user experience in damage occurrences. Moreover, the use of non-electrical sensors will be analysed in details representing an additional clear step further of HECTOR. The effective output of the research will be: an increase in knowledge needed to pass from a simple methodology (HECTOR) to solve the problems linked to a real application; a deep analysis of different types of sensor useful for the SHM application, with particular attention on Fiber Bragg optical sensors and non-electrical devices; a general development of a structural assessment of a helicopter fuselage through the use of Finite Elements models combined with damage characterization; a creation of a reliable database regarding the damage types and location occurred in the helicopter fleet during the past activities and registered during the maintenance operations. These outputs will permit to design a device, including both the hardware and the software, obtained through coupling the usage of Finite Elements Modelling for basic knowledge generation with advanced algorithms for structural diagnosis and prognosis. The purpose of ASTYANAX is to acquire an elevated Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for SHM systems (up to 5-6).     ASTYANAX: from model to reality 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/12/13/eda-kicks-off-aircraft-structural-health-monitoring-project
EDA_NEWS_0862	2012-12-07	NEWS	ICAR Research Project: Inspection Robot Wins EUREKA Silver Medal	 The inspection robot DROMADER was awarded a silver medal in the EUREKA competition, carried out in the margins of the 2012 INNOVA Brussels World Exhibition on inventions, research and new technologies.  The robotic vehicle had been developed by the Polish Military University (MUT) in Warsaw under the EDA project “Intelligent Control of Adversary Radio (ICAR). This project is part of a series of collaborative research activities improving the protection of EU Member States' armed forces during their missions (Joint Investment Programme on Force Protection – JIP FP, with a total budget of more than 70 M€ over the last 3 years).  ICAR is tackling the ubiquitous threat of Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Devices (RC-IED). While a ground or airborne sensor unit is constantly capturing radio emissions, for example around a convoy or a camp, feeding them into a complex system of algorithms to identify suspicious elements, the DROMADER robot is used to suppress radio activity of such elements and inspect them in a safe distance for the soldier. The ICAR system has successfully passed its proof of concept during a live demonstration in Großmittel, Austria (19 July 2012).  Its basic features have been published recently in the “Counter IED Report”.  More information: An overview of the live demonstration in Austria can be found here.  Pictures from the live demonstration are available here.  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/12/07/icar-research-project-inspection-robot-wins-eureka-silver-medal
EDA_NEWS_0863	2012-12-11	NEWS	Why Another PhD Prize?	 The European Defence Agency and the Egmont Institute have launched a PhD Prize in defence, security and strategy. Young researchers who have recently completed their PhD thesis are encouraged to participate in the competition. The award? A financial remuneration and especially the chance for the winner to present the results of his/her research during the EDA annual conference in March 2013 in front of the European defence community. Dinesh Rempling, EDA Project Officer, in charge of the Prize explains the aims and background of the Prize. ​1. Dinesh, why another PhD prize? While PhD prizes exist across the world, they are often either linked to academic institutions or societies. Some of the prizes have an international flavour but none are specifically targeting a European audience. Filling this gap will strengthen European research in defence, security and strategy. Moreover the hope is that it will encourage a new generation of scholars to continue to push the boundaries, helping shape better and more effective European policies.  2. Why do the Egmont Institute and the EDA cooperate? As it so happened EDA and Egmont Institute were thinking the same thing at the same time. It is the ideal complementary partnership in many ways. Being an agency under the Council framework, EDA is very close to the heart of EU decision-making. In fact EDA is run by a Steering Board consisting of Defence Ministers from twenty-six EU Member States and chaired by Baroness Catherine Ashton (Head of the Agency, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice President of the European Commission). Egmont Institute on the other hand is in the forefront of research in defence, security and strategy. As such it come with a pan-European network of academic excellence. The EDA-Egmont partnership is fortunate enough to be completed by a Prize Jury of brilliant minds. All Members come with a wealth of experience, each covering a different angle of defence, security and strategy – this is what boosts the essence of the Prize. Together the Jury Members will be able to objectively evaluate the quality and impact of the candidates’ achievements. 3. Who should participate? Anybody can submit their candidacy for the Prize. The more applicants there are the merrier because the ambition is to award outstanding work and the more there is the to choose from the likelier it is that exceptional achievements surface. Some basic provisions need to be met: the need to be a national of an EDA Member State, the PhD must have been awarded by an academic institution in an EDA Member State and the thesis needs to be available in English. Other than that there are no restrictions so long the substance of the thesis addresses one or more aspects of defence, security and strategy. The Prize itself comes with a number of perks. Apart from the prestige, there is a generous financial contribution to look forward to. Furthermore the successful candidate will speak in front of an international audience of senior decision-makers at the EDA Annual Conference on 21 March 2013. In addition the winner will be offered the opportunity to publish the key findings of the thesis in the form of a book!

EDA_NEWS_0864	2012-12-14	NEWS	EDA Helicopter Exercise Programme Confirmed for 10 Years	" During the EDA Steering Board meeting held on 19 November 2012, ministers of defence of twelve Member States signed the Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP) Program Arrangement (PA). This act formally transitioned the HEP to a Category B programme, where twelve nations commit their crews and helicopters to a ten-year programme, a concrete indication that training together is an integral part of enhancing European capability and interoperability.   Originally part of the Helicopter Training Programme (HTP) concept,  approved at the Ministerial Steering Board in November 2009, the HEP aims to provide a framework to Member States to allow them to develop, consolidate and share best practices to meet the challenges of flying helicopters in the modern operational environment, helping to mitigate the risks and successfully complete their mission. The HEP is built on three main pillars: 1. Exercises Five exercises have so far been delivered under the umbrella of the EDA. These exercises met the urgent training requirements for the participating Member States (pMS) and greatly enhanced the helicopter capability available. To date, 14 pMS have actively taken part with another three sending observers.  A total of 123 helicopters, 794 aircrew nearly 5000 support personnel  have deployed to the exercises which were held in France, Spain, Italy, Portugal and Belgium.   2. Symposia Beside the exercises, an integral part of the HEP is the Helicopter Tactics Symposium which has now been held three times in Luxembourg. It is designed to allow our helicopter crews to share experiences, gain knowledge of the current threats they face and to discuss the tactics, techniques and procedures. 3. Core Planning Team (CPT) In order to ensure coherence and continuity of the programme, a CPT of two personnel has been appointed. Sharing  the office with the EDA Helicopter Programme Officers, together they form the EDA helicopter team within Capabilities Directorate. The CPT is managed through the EDA Helicopter Project Manager, ensuring that the knowledge and experience gained so far transitions into this programme. The CPT will be tasked by the Management Committee formed by the representatives of the contributing Member States (cMS). The main tasks are to assist host nations in the delivery of exercises and take any lessons identified and integrate them into future exercises. Additionally, the team will also be able to give training advice to cMS to assist with the national training task as required.  More information: An overview of the last helicopter exercise ""Green Blade"" in Belgium is available on Storify. Pictures from Green Blade are available on Flickr. Videos from helicopter exercises in Belgium and Portugal are available on YouTube.  "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/12/14/eda-helicopter-exercise-programme-confirmed-for-10-years
EDA_NEWS_0865	2012-12-20	NEWS	Speeding the Response to CBRN Threats	" The EDA is becoming ever more active as a focal point for European Union nations looking for technical solutions to the growing challenge of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) attacks, writes Tim Mahon in the second issue of the EDA's European Defence Matters magazine. Military and civil emergency management planners face a significant and constantly evolving threat with the potential terrorist use of chemical, biological and radiological weapons. Detection and identification of agents – quickly and efficiently, to allow incident commanders to take appropriate remedial action – is the basis of efficient defence in this domain. And the EDA has responded by generating a multinational research and technology programme aimed at making that easier. As a paradigm for pooling and sharing of knowledge, the current category A programme for CBRN technologies is a four-year, €12 million joint investment project aimed at examining and evaluating the next generation of technologies for detection and identification of chemical, biological and similar threats – in both military and civil environments. The project has been running since 2010 and is moving rapidly towards its second highly active phase. Alignment with European Commission “We are aiming far beyond the current status quo – for the next generation of technologies,” said Gerlof De Wilde, EDA’s Assistant Director for Research and Technology and the programme’s project manager, adding that this means harnessing and deploying technologies beyond the 2015 timeframe. Although on the surface the programme differs little from other research and technology (R&T) projects in the Agency’s remit, in fact there are some characteristics of the CBRN joint investment programme that set it apart. “One of the specific characteristics of this project is that we are aligning our work with that of the European Commission in this area,” said De Wilde. Cooperation with the European Commission’s framework research programme has focused on detection and identification of chemical and biological agents and should empower better use of resources which will inevitably lead to more far-reaching results, in De Wilde’s view. “We have agreed the objectives and procedures – this is the first mature action in which we have done this – have been involved in joint workshops and are conducting joint evaluation at every stage,” he said. Broad involvement of Member States The Agency’s programme is thus being supported by 13 member states – Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, France, Spain, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Sweden and Norway. The first call for proposals resulted in 22 separate submissions being made from industry, academia and research institutes, which are now being evaluated with contracts to be let before the end of this year, according to De Wilde. The first call focused on technologies for detection and identification, modelling and simulation of CBRN architectures and methodologies for handling a broad spectrum of unknown samples, an area in which De Wilde says there is a significant capability gap. The second call for proposals, due to take place in the spring of 2013, will focus on next generation decontamination for personal and collective protection. Nations have serious concerns about the need for adequate detection and diagnostic capabilities for potential CBRN threats. Although over 150 nations subscribe to treaties governing the non-proliferation of such weapons, there are significant evolving threats involving non-state actors. ""After all, terrorists (for example) don't care about treaties,"" said De Wilde. Combined with the effects of budget constraints and pressure on limited resources, these concerns mean that an opportunity to pool and share in the development of a next generation response to these threats is attractive to many nations. Technical challenges The technical challenges are complex. Detection needs to be quick, accurate and tied to a fast-time simulation model which can assess the spread of the threat in a given environment. The result is that the next generation of detection technologies will feature a high degree of automation. The capability to evaluate mixed samples is something that simply does not exist in a robust format today, according to De Wilde. Improvements in modelling and simulation – in which the Agency has proposed use of software it developed under the BIOEDEP programme – will also provide CBRN professionals with vastly improved capability.  In a challenging and politically sensitive area of research and technology, EDA’s CBRN programme is resonating with a broad spectrum of community members. Perhaps the single most important outcome to date, however, has been the recognition of the benefits accruing to contributing members, especially from the collaboration with non-military research with the European Commission. “We have become part of a broader family with this project and it promises to become a true generator of useful and exploitable knowledge,” said De Wilde.

EDA_NEWS_0867	2012-12-07	NEWS	EDA Future Land Systems Study Delivers Final Report	 EDA’s Future Land Systems (FLS) study final report was presented to the Member-States and relevant stakeholders at EDA headquarters on 6 December 2012. The FLS study was carried out by an industry consortium of 17 European defence industries, all members of the land sectorial group of ASD (ELDIG), managed by BAE Systems.  At the meeting participating Member States, EU institutes, research centres, academia and relevant industries including SME’s, who had supported the study through its entire schedule, had the opportunity to exchange views on the different topics addressed by the study including the final proposals and recommendations.  The main deliverable of the FLS study is a Roadmap and Implementation Plan to be used as the baseline to enable the land related European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) to meet future military capability requirements in a time frame up to 2035.  Member States and EDA will be given the opportunity to review the results and evaluate the proposed recommendations, identifying actions needed to implement the proposed Roadmap.  This study is part of EDA’s work on identifying the Key Industrial Capabilities to be preserved or developed in the EDTIB to determine future European capabilities.    Future land systems study partners and work programmes The study includes contributions from the continent’s major manufacturers: BAE Systems (UK/Sweden), Cassidian (Germany/France), Diehl BGT Systems (Germany), Expal (Spain/Denmark/Italy/Bulgaria), General Dynamics European Land Systems (Spain/Austria/UK), IVECO Defence Vehicles (Italy), Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (Germany), Marshall Land Systems (UK), MBDA (UK/France/Germany), Thales (UK/France/Germany/Netherlands), Safran (France), Saab (Sweden), Rheinmetall Defence (Germany/Switzerland/Austria), Patria (Finland), OTO Melara (Italy), Nexter (France) and Navantia (Spain). The work of the study has been organised into five work packages (WP). WP 1 Capability Analysis with Thales as WP leader. The task for WP1 was to identify key military capability requirements in the land environment over the next 30 years in order to determine the key industrial implications for the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB). A Draft Capability Analysis Report has now been delivered and updates are on-going to Member States, EDA and relevant stakeholders such as Finabel and European Union Military Staff (EUMS). WP 2 State of Play Analysis with Rheinmetall Waffe Munitions as WP leader. The task has been wide-ranging, incorporating a global analysis, a determination of key relevant technology sectors, an industrial landscaping exercise, an analysis of past, present and planned activities across Europe and a determination of the civil trends that will have tangible effects. A draft State of Play Report has already been submitted and is now in the evaluation and comment/feedback stage. WP 3 Analysis phase with BAE Systems Bofors as WP leader. Early conclusions from this WP indicate that the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) is indeed fragmented but has acceptable skills and capacity to provide EU with the required capabilities in the near- and mid-term. In the long term, however, the study foresees a loss of capacity, given that the technology, industrial and programme areas are not being handled adequately. Much effort requires to be invested in the area of ‘key,’ ‘pacing’ and ‘emerging’ technologies to leverage effect on the long term evolution of the market and the group of ‘generic’ technologies must be improved, not only to ensure interoperability but also to secure effect on near, mid- and long-term prospects.  WP 4 Roadmap and Implementation plan with MBDA as WP Leader, a phase of the project due to reach conclusion in the last quarter of 2012.. The process is driven by the output of WP3 and the shortfalls in the EDITB identified therein. A detailed questionnaire and interview programme, due to have been completed in early October 2012, will also contribute substantively to the evolution of the roadmap. WP 5 Pilot Projects and Programmes with Rheinmetall Waffe Munitions as WP leader. The Future Land Systems project includes a tangible demonstration of benefits in the form of a recommended list of pilot programmes for implementation immediately after the conclusion of the study. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/12/07/eda-future-land-systems-study-delivers-final-report

The EATC is a multinational command, established on 1 September 2010 by the Netherlands, France, Belgium and Germany to pool and share national military assets. Luxembourg joined the EATC as fifth nation on 22nd November 2012. Earlier this year, Spain had also expressed its interest in joining the EATC. The Command plans, tasks and controls the missions of major parts of the air transport- and air-to-air refuelling fleets of the member states (almost 150 aircraft). Additionally, the EATC bears a nationally defined level of responsibility for aircrew training, coordination of training and exercise objectives as well as the harmonisation of appropriate air transport regulations of the nations. The overall objective is to manage the scarce resource air transport as effectively and efficiently as possible. During its visit, the Agency’s delegation had useful discussions with the EATC’s Commander, Major General Pascal Valentin as well as with Colonel Christian Schmidt, Director of the Movement Coordination Centre Europe. Claude-France Arnould noted that the EATC was a very successful model for pooling in the operational area with existing similar potential in the functional area. As the two organisations share important areas of interest such as diplomatic clearances for military transport aircraft, air-to-air refuelling, a future A400M multinational unit, enhanced cooperation especially in the area of maintenance and exchange of spare parts could be envisaged. Discussions also included the air-to-air refueling initiative of the European Defence Agency.   More information: - For more information on diplomatic clearances for military transport aircraft, click here. - Latest news on the Agency's multirole tanker initiative is available here. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/11/30/claude-france-arnould-visits-eatc-headquarters

EDA_NEWS_0872	2012-11-29	NEWS	Roadmap to Harmonised Ammunition Qualification	 Ammunition safety experts from Member States and industry met on 27 and 28 November at EDA headquarters to discuss and detail the implementation of a roadmap for the harmonisation of ammunition qualification in Europe. This roadmap was approved by defence ministers during their steering board meeting on 19 November as part of EDA’s work on Pooling & Sharing enablers. The European ammunition sector is considered key in the consolidation of a globally competitive and capable European Defence Technological and Industrial Base. This sector has a high operational impact and is considered critical to the capabilities of the European armed forces. During recent multinational operations partner nations needed to exchange ammunition. However, the ammunition testing procedures vary between Member States preventing such sharing arrangements. Harmonisation of safety standards would enable pooling and sharing, procuring, stockpiling, exchanging or transporting of ammunition between Member States.  At the European Network of National Safety Authorities (ENNSA – an EDA body) meeting this week, government and industry representatives agreed that harmonisation would benefit the demand as well as the supply side, improving interoperability and cooperation, facilitating cost reduction, and increasing the competitiveness of European industry. They prioritised the following short term actions (to be implemented by the end of 2013):  Standardised reporting – to facilitate sharing and acceptance of qualification results. This will also enable cooperation, including promoting P&S activities among EU nations while avoiding duplication of tests.  This will inevitably reduce total ammunition procurement costs; and, Minimum Safety Data Package – to be established to ensure better understanding of Member States’ national safety requirements thus enhancing harmonisation. Other actions from the meeting to be initiated in 2013 include: Endorsement of Test & Evaluation Houses:  The aim is to increase trust and provide better insight of the processes, expertise and methodologies used. Creation of European users group on specific standards: To enable nations using similar standards to share experience and views on standard implementation further enhancing harmonisation and common understanding.  For more information: - A factsheet on ammunition qualification is available here. - Access the ammunition project page here. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/11/29/roadmap-to-harmonised-ammunition-qualification
EDA_NEWS_0873	2012-11-27	NEWS	Pooling & Sharing: More Effective, Not Cheaper Defence	" Claude-France Arnould, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency, participates in the 11th Congress on European Security and Defence, the Berlin Security Conference, starting today. Madam Arnould will introduce a panel on 28 November entitled ""The financial crisis and its impact on European Security and Defence"". Read here below her views on the role of the EDA in times of austerity. Pooling & Sharing: more effective, not cheaper defence Without doubt, the financial crisis has an adverse impact on the European defence sector. Defence spending is on a record low; national defence budgets have nearly halved since the Cold War. But the financial crisis  also triggers the necessary momentum to further cooperate, to pool and share capabilities. The European Defence Agency has initiated projects already following the eleven priority areas defined by its Steering Board in May 2011, covering the full capability line, from logistical support to acquisition. An essential project is air-to-air refuelling. During the campaign in Libya, the EU heavily relied on US tankers to keep their fighter jet fleet operational. As a consequence, EU defence ministers acknowledged that air-to-air refuelling was a critical capability shortfall which required an urgent solution. Another potential opportunity for cooperation is military satellite communication. It is assessed that EU Member States could save up to 2 bn Euro over the 15 coming years if they intensify their cooperation in this domain. A key enabler for Pooling and Sharing : certification and standardisation Certification and standardisation is very important to create better conditions for cooperation, efficiencies, and less bureaucracy. For instance, Member States are in the process of implementing in national law the European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) developed by EDA to facilitate the certification process of military aircrafts. Some Member States have already agreed to use EMARs for the in-service phase of the A400M. Harmonised rules will allow for mutual recognition between Member States’ military airworthiness authorities which in turn will help to reduce costs considerably. Another example is certification in the field of ammunition. Up to 500 million euro could be optimised each year in Europe through more standardised certification processes. Not less but more efficient But Pooling & Sharing cannot be an alibi to further reduce efforts. It is a way to harness and maximise investment. Pooling & Sharing is not an excuse to invest less; rather, it offers a way to acquire together what is out of reach individually and get more efficiency in the deployment of these capabilities. We see that Europe risks losing significant industrial capability between now and 2020. One of the areas where Europe should intensity its efforts to run in the global competition is Unmanned Aerial Systems. Defence capability needs innovation. While the US spends 31% of its defence budget on investment, in Europe this accounts for only 22%. With the Member State’s budgetary room for maneuver being more limited than ever, the Agency is actively looking for synergies with wider EU policies – research and technology, the Future Horizon 2020 programme, space policy, etc.. All these synergies will build on dual use technologies, for civil as well as military applications, but are not a substitute for national investment in future key technologies. Towards a more systematic approach of Pooling & Sharing Cooperative programmes are of course not a novelty in the military domain. But what the European Defence Agency offers to its participating Member States is unique. We work at the service of the Member States, applying an “à la carte” approach by supporting groupings of two Member States upwards. We also pay particular attention to avoid duplication of efforts on the national level or with NATO. Recently, we have put a voluntary Pooling & Sharing code of conduct on the table of Ministers to allow for a more structured approach. It meant for example that Pooling & Sharing would be considered from the outset of an equipment or capability. As said before, the financial crisis created an urgency to closer work together. The political mandate of EDA is to propose ways, means and opportunities to cooperate efficiently. Obviously, this is in full respect of national sovereignty. Military capabilities are Member States’ capabilities. But the EDA is there to support by building on maximum synergy. We have now to translate this political will into real commitment.

EDA_NEWS_0874	2012-11-28	NEWS	Increasing Europe’s Strategic Tanker Capability by 2020	 During the meeting of the EDA steering board on 19 November, defence ministers from ten European states signed a letter of intent to work together to boost their military air-to-air refuelling capacity. Air-to-air refuelling (AAR) is a critical enabler for air power projection and it is required to enable anything beyond short range air combat operations. A unique force multiplier, it is a fundamental capability embedded in modern aircraft design, not just in combat aircraft, but across the full spectrum of air platforms – including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. In the past, European armed forces have relied substantively on American assets. This was originally demonstrated in the Kosovo campaign, and the increased reliance on the US was a lesson from operations over Libya. Currently, Europe can field 42 aircraft of ten different types, which compares with US resources of over 650 of four types.   EDA’s approach Defence ministers tasked the Agency in March 2012 to work on air-to-air refuelling capabilities as a priority. Consequently, EDA has developed a global approach with three objectives: increasing overall capacity, reducing fragmentation of the fleet, and optimising the use of assets. This work has finally led to four complementary work-strands, on some of which EDA is cooperating closely with OCCAR: - Facilitating access to commercial AAR services; - Optimisation of use of existing capabilities which can include the sharing of surplus capacities for example; - Optimisation of the A400M fleet AAR capability including the option for acquiring additional AAR kits; - Increasing the strategic tanker capability in Europe by 2020.   Letter of intent With the letter of intent signed by defence ministers on 19 November, defence ministers from Belgium, France, Greece, Spain, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Norway have now agreed to envisage buying or leasing new tanker aircraft together. The initiative is led by the Netherlands. The objective of the initiative is to contribute to reducing the existing shortfalls in the field of strategic air to air refuelling and transport whilst contributing to streamlining the European inventories. The aim is to reach an initial European strategic Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) capability by 2020. The aircraft will be available for multinational and national use. EDA expects that the pooled acquisition will result in important synergies in terms of initial overall investment, interoperability and life costs.

EDA_NEWS_0875	2012-11-21	NEWS	Diplomatic Clearances for Military Transport Aircraft	 On 19 November 2012, defence ministers from Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, German, Greece, the Netherlands, Romania, Slovakia, Sweden and Norway signed a technical arrangement regarding diplomatic clearances for participants’ military transport aircraft in their respective national airspace or territory. The arrangement describes common provisions and harmonised procedures for overflights and landings and enables Member States to operate without the need to submit diplomatic clearances requests for each flight, including support to on-going operations and transportation of IATA/ICAO compliant dangerous goods. This simplified mechanism can be seen as a significant step forward to more flexible and effective military airlift operations in Europe. Also included in this technical arrangement is a common clearances request and notification form which will further enhance harmonisation of the entire mechanism.   Freedom of movement The agreement clearly improves the freedom of movement of EU military registered transport aircraft transiting national boundaries within the EU. The existing disparate requirements to obtain diplomatic clearances to land or overfly an EU member state cause delays and effectively hampers swift airlift operations. This legacy mechanism needs to be tailored to the 21st century’s requirements, especially looking at the future implementation of the Single European Sky (SES) in the coming years, where a route driven system will evolve into a trajectory driven system. The technical arrangement is still open for signature until 1 June 2013.   Background and way forward The European Air Transport Fleet partnership signed by 20 Member States in 2011under the auspices of the European Defence Agency is looking at augmenting the availability of military airlift in the EU and developing concrete solutions to increase its efficiency and effectiveness. The EDA ad hoc working group diplomatic clearances that developed this technical arrangement will continue to work on different diplomatic clearance issues, including harmonisation of clearances for EU military transport aircraft outside the EU. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/11/21/diplomatic-clearances-for-military-transport-aircraft

Several Member States are interested in cooperating in the testing phase or the pooling of spare parts for the NH90.  EDA will develop the maritime landscaping exercise by pooling for example spare parts, coordinating maintenance and submarine related support activities.  EDA will establish a European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course (EATTC) in the framework of the European Air Transport Fleet programme.  Picture credit: Eurocopter	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/11/19/pooling-sharing-new-opportunities
EDA_NEWS_0878	2012-11-19	NEWS	Interaction Between Defence and Wider EU Policies	 EDA is tasked to ensure that the requirements of defence are clearly articulated in the development of EU policies and in their implementation. During the EDA Steering Board meeting of 19 November 2012, defence ministers invited EDA to further develop EU policies in the following areas:  On Defence Industry & Market, to allow for a more competitive European defence market and industry.  In terms of Research & Innovation, to focus on civil-military synergies (dual use research). To this end, EDA is for example closely working together with the European Space Agency, is involved in the European Commission’s work regarding Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems and topics included in the Horizon 2020 (i.e. coordination of future research agendas in Cyber Defence, or civil-military synergies in areas such as sensors, standards, and communication for Unmanned Maritime Systems (UMS)). European Space Policy: to federate defence-related requirements, identifying civil-military synergies in preparation of demonstrators and by providing support to critical space technologies for European non-dependence.  EDA participated in the development of the EU Cyber Security Strategy. Once endorsed, the Strategy will provide the framework of EDA activities on Cyber Defence in areas relevant to defence capabilities.  As the SESAR (Single European ATM Research) programme enters its deployment phase, EDA relays the views of the defence community at an early stage. It works in close coordination with NATO and Eurocontrol and organises information exchange between NATO and the SESAR Joint Undertaking.  EDA supports Member States in the area of the EU Radio Spectrum Policy Programme on issues such as spectrum inventory, sharing opportunities, and to prepare for the World Radio Conference 2015.  EDA will contribute to the development of an EU Maritime Security Strategy.  Picture credit: European Space Agency 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/11/19/interaction-between-defence-and-wider-eu-policies
EDA_NEWS_0879	2012-11-19	NEWS	Good Progress of EDA Pooling & Sharing Projects	 During today’s meeting of the European Defence Agency’s Steering Board, defence ministers welcomed the progress made by the majority of Pooling & Sharing initiatives they had endorsed one year ago.  In 2012, two exercises were held in the framework of the Helicopter Training Programme (HTP). The exercises hosted by Portugal and Belgium allowed for the training of 56 helicopter crews and over 3,000 ground personnel. During the EDA Steering Board, Defence Ministers signed a Programme Arrangement for live exercises over ten years. Initially based on delivering live exercises aiming at disseminating tactical skills, the Helicopter Training Programme now includes a synthetic simulator based training project, a helicopter tactics instructor training course, and an operational English training course. The Maritime Surveillance (MARSUR) live network continues to extend its membership. The goals of the network are to facilitate exchange of information and to support safety and security. In October 2012, Bulgaria, Latvia and Norway joined the network which now includes 18 nations.  The European Satellite Communications Procurement Cell (ESCPC) has moved forward as planned, with the signature of a framework contract in 2012. Five Member States participate on a pay-per-use basis of commercial satellite communications services. For the longer-term Future Military SATCOM project, decisions are required in the near future on the replacement of existing satellite networks in the 2018-25 timeframe. As the window of opportunity will close shortly, EDA stands ready to take action on P&S solutions, and is planning a high level workshop “MILSATCOM 2020” in the first half of 2013 in order to present proposals, foster common activities, and link with bi-lateral initiatives. The Multinational Modular Medical Units (Medical Field Hospitals) attracts growing participation. Fifteen Member States have so far signed the Letter of Intent. The Common Staff Target is expected to be finalised by mid-2013. The Memorandum of Understanding and Common Requirements will follow, with the objective of procurement of assets in 2014 and Initial Operational Capability in 2015. Air to Air Refuelling (AAR): EDA has developed a global approach with three objectives: increasing overall capacity, reducing fragmentation of the fleet, and optimising the use of assets. The Agency has started to work on short-term solutions including access to commercial AAR services and optimised use of existing assets. Longer-term actions include the acquisition of more AAR kits and increasing the strategic tanker capability in Europe by 2020. A Letter of Intent on a European Strategic Multirole Tanker Transport initiative, prepared under the lead of the Netherlands, was signed during the Steering Board. Pilot Training has attracted significant interest. France has offered to lead on transport crew training, and Italy on fast jet training.  Work on European Multimodal Transport Hubs has been launched through a study (the results of which will be available in March 2013). The aim is to develop a European concept to increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of Europe’s transport assets in support of military, civil and disaster relief operations.  EDA has shaped substantive work on Smart Munitions. Possible P&S opportunities are outlined (i.e. in the areas of training and education) but no lead nation has yet been identified. Ireland, as lead nation, has initiated work on European Naval Training with a view to inter alia improving the sharing of existing facilities and the realisation of civil/military synergies.  Additionally, the Agency presented the successful work delivered as regards to Pooling & Sharing enablers: Airworthiness: Member States are implementing EDA’s European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) in national law. Currently, additional EMARs for Maintenance Personnel Licensing and Airworthiness Management are being developed. A first practical example where EMARs are being applied is the A400M.  Ammunition: EDA addresses the regulatory framework (harmonisation of qualification and certification regulations) in the field of ammunition; this will facilitate cooperation on procuring, stockpiling, exchanging or transporting all types of ammunition.  The government to government online market place – eQuip – for redundant or surplus equipment will be launched shortly. The first Technical Agreement on diplomatic clearance for military transport aircraft was signed during the Steering Board. The arrangement describes harmonised procedures for overflights and landings and enables Member States to operate without the need to submit diplomatic clearances requests for each flight (by using diplomatic clearance numbers valid for one year), including support to on-going operations and transportation of dangerous goods.  The Go Green project on alternative energy sources for European army forces was launched in March 2012. Seven Member States are participating and the tender procedure has been launched.  Pooling demand. EDA has concluded a € 228m Euro Framework Contract covering Basic Logistic Services to support the current German-led EU Battle Group.   The EDA continues to work on the European Defence Standards Reference System for a harmonised approach to standardisation. The development of hybrid standards, with both civil and military applications, will contribute to an efficient EDTIB.

EDA_NEWS_0881	2012-11-13	NEWS	Nanoelectronics’ Importance for Defence	" On 6 November 2012, MEP Lambert van Nistelrooij (EPP, NL) hosted a roundtable on the strategic importance of Europe's nanoelectronic sector, co-organised by The Parliament Magazine and ENIAC Joint Undertaking. Michael Sieber, EDA assistant director for research and technology,  had been invited to present the defence view on this key technology. Nanoelectronics are the backbone of many advanced technologies also used in the military context and hence part of the European Defence Agency's Strategic Research Agenda. While defence and security tasks can be supported quite efficiently in taking advantage from “dual-use” technologies, specific military requirements are driving some of them. In the case of nanoelectronics it is cutting edge performance, reliability and robustness in specific operational environments, multi-functionality, high integration density and low weight. Limited production volumes and access to critical technologies and materials which are subject to export restrictions draw attention to managing technological and industrial dependencies, keeping supply chains in Europe if necessary. Only a sustainable and globally competitive European industrial base can secure future supplies. For next generation  Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits (MMIC) based on the widebandgap semiconductor Gallium Nitride and the related  technologies, EDA projects supported the creation of a comprehensive European supply chain which will be critical for the development and production of the next generation radar, communication and electronic protection defence systems. Regarding the current “technology drain” and declining Research and Development efforts by European Member States, action may be required in additional areas such as Nano-Electro-Mechanical Systems (NEMS), System-on-Chip, Photonics, Advanced Multifunctional and Conformal Antennas. ""Without the nanoelectronics sector there would be no viable defence sector, and without defence, investment in nanoelectronics would not be feasible"", said Michael Sieber during the roundtable. EDA is leveraging its respective efforts with other European institutions (European Commission, European Space Agency), to create synergies and avoid duplication. Participating in the Critical Space Technologies for European Strategic Non-Dependence (CRISP) mapping process for example allows to continuously analyse, assess and determine  urgent actions for improving  European Technology non-Dependence (ETnD) in this area. Recommendations and proposed actions of the parliamentary roundtable on nanoelectronics included continuous and sustainable investment in research, supply chains and innovative production. Strategic planning and commitment by policy makers will be as necessary as the development of business cases which combine highly specialised supply chains across EU institutions (defence, security, space, others).  All pictures courtesy of Fraunhofer IAF "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/11/13/nanoelectronics-importance-for-defence

EDA_NEWS_0883	2012-10-25	NEWS	Cyber Defence: Workshop Shows Way Forward	 Research and innovation for cyber defence and combating cyber-crime is an issue that concerns the European Defence Agency (EDA), the European Commission, and the European Space Agency (ESA) alike. Many of the underlying technologies are the same for civil and military applications. Consequently, a certain degree of coordination between civil an defence research is needed. A joint workshop to shape the research and innovation agenda in the areas of cyber defence and the fight against cyber-crime and terrorism was therefore organised on 23 October in Brussels. Marco Malacarne, acting director in the European Commission’s Directorate-General Enterprise and Industry, opened the workshop by giving an overview of his department’s achievements in cyber research. Michael Sieber, responsible for cyber research in the European Defence Agency, listed typical defence characteristics for research in the domain, while Géraldine Naja of the European Space Agency explained that the EU’s growing number of space assets needed to be protected. She continued that satellites had been subject to cyber-attacks in the past and that the protection of ground segments should be enhanced as well. A coordinated action at EU level would be most effective to that end. Europol’s concern in the cyber domain lies more in the area of online criminal behaviour as companies  attempt to gain a competitive edge and enhance their market share by stealing information online. Academics pointed to a set of research issues for the cloud, ubiquitous computing and the future internet. Professor Van Eeten from Delft University explained how his research showed that internet service providers needed to be given incentives to improve online security. ‘Effortless security’ was the issue raised by Professor Paar, University of Bochum, who listed obfuscation and reverse engineering as a field where more research needed to be done. Federated military networks are the area of research of Dr Aurisch in his German Fraunhofer Institute; while Professor Nieto Taladriz from Madrid showed the results of research in the area of reputation and anomaly detection for securing distributed networks. Cryptography is another part of the overall online security puzzle. Crypto research in Europe is proven to be top-of-the-world, with EU research outfits winning awards in U.S competitions. However, the EU lacks a European cryptography policy . Such a policy, Professor Preneel from KU Leuven argued, could push crypto research to the next level. Managing threats and vulnerabilities, visualisation techniques and self-repair based on biology research were all issues covered. Feedback from the audience showed that cyber security and cyber defence research in Europe is in a good shape. There is a need for communication and exchange of results between the different research communities and across Europe. More exchange in the sort of workshop organised by EDA, ESA and the European Commission will  help to avoid duplication and to connect different bits of research.  Topical workshops will follow on the issues raised; the ideas generated in the workshop will feed into the research agenda of each institution. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/10/25/cyber-defence-workshop-shows-way-forward
EDA_NEWS_0884	2012-11-16	NEWS	Action Plan for Harmonised Ammunition Qualification	 Claude-France Arnould, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency, attended an ammunition qualification live demonstration at Rheinmetall’s Waffe Munition GmbH (RWM) Test Facilities in Unterlüß (Germany) on 15 November 2012. During this visit, Claude-France Arnould highlighted that European Member States could benefit from important savings through full harmonisation of ammunition qualification procedures. The European ammunition sector is considered key in the consolidation of a globally competitive and capable European Defence Technological and Industrial Base. This sector has a high operational impact and is critical to the capabilities of the Member States  armed forces. During recent multinational operations partner nations needed to exchange ammunition. However, the current ammunition testing procedures vary between Member States preventing such sharing arrangements. Harmonisation of safety standards would enable pooling and sharing, procuring, stockpiling, exchanging or transporting of ammunition between Member States. “In order to contribute to a more systematic and sustainable approach to the long-term development of Pooling & Sharing, harmonisation and rationalisation of European military regulations and procedures is a key area where EDA can add value in offering its services to the Member States”, said Claude-France Arnould during her visit in Unterlüß. EDA action plan to improve harmonisation The lack of harmonisation in ammunition qualification in Europe increases the procurement costs for Member States, puts the EU defence industry at a disadvantage in comparison to its global competitors and most importantly prevents European Armed Forces from conducting common operations and logistics. EDA’s action plan aims to improve this situation without posing additional burden on national authorities or duplicating relevant activities such as in NATO. This action plan includes short to mid-term term objectives expected to drastically reduce duplication and total acquisition costs, while improving harmonisation and the potential for further cooperation, including Pooling & Sharing. Actions such as Standardised Qualification Reporting, development of a Minimum Safety Data Package and the Endorsement of Test and Evaluation Houses, are designed to enable comparison between individual Member States qualification results, reducing unnecessary duplication and enhancing trust among national authorities and test centres to promote commonly accepted qualification processes. Broad support During the opening session of this event Detlef Selhausen, the National Armaments Director of Germany , Ralf Prechtl, CEO of Rheinmetall’s Waffe Munition GmbH, and Jan-Olov Blix representing the land sectorial group of ASD (ELDIG) as former Executive Vice-President, provided their views on the topic, all of them supporting EDA’s initiative for enhanced harmonisation. Implementation of EDA’s action plan will be coordinated by the European Network of National Safety Authorities on Ammunition (ENNSA) including short to longer term objectives, delivering incrementally the expected benefits for the Member States and European defence industry.  More information: Factsheet on harmonisation of ammunition qualification Pictures of the live demonstration on 15 November can be found on Flickr.  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/11/16/action-plan-for-harmonised-ammunition-qualification

EDA_NEWS_0886	2012-10-15	NEWS	High Level Seminar on The European Initiatives in Maritime Environment – Cyprus – 18/19 October	 The Cyprus Presidency of the Council of the European Union, together with the European Defence Agency, is hosting a High Level Seminar on The European Initiatives in Maritime Environment – Future Capabilities, Technologies and Civil-Military Synergies on the 18th and 19th of October 2012, at the Nicosia Filoxenia Conference Centre. EDA is currently bringing together Naval Initiatives in three domains: Research & Technology (Naval Systems and their environment), Industry & Market (Naval key industrial capabilities) and Capabilities (Naval landscaping). Taking these into account, the aim of this seminar is to highlight the need to address the future capacity of Europe to act taking into account the requirement for appropriate maritime assets within the current financial climate. The seminar will examine important Capability and Research & Technology issues as well as the naval industry’s role in supporting European Capabilities. We hope, through this seminar, to promote European defence initiatives in the maritime environment, while continuing current efforts for integrated maritime surveillance, and broader maritime issues. Discussion is expected on the need for a European approach and the identification of civil - military synergies. The conference will be addressed by the Minister of Defence of the Republic of Cyprus, Mr Demetris Eliades, and the Deputy Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency, Mr Adam Sowa. The conference will include presentations from a number of Maritime stakeholders, including European bodies, institutions and agencies, as well as governments and industry.

EDA_NEWS_0887	2012-10-12	NEWS	MEPs Push for Pooling & Sharing	 During the latest session of the European Parliament’s Defence and Security subcommittee on 9 October, MEPs showed strong support for the European Defence Agency and its Pooling & Sharing initiative. Introducing EDA’s Chief Executive Claude-France Arnould, Arnaud Danjean the subcommittee’s chairman says, ”Pooling & Sharing is at the top of our list of priorities when it comes to defence.” In her presentation, Claude-France Arnould stressed that the EDA worked only on the capabilities the Member States set priorities in. Successful examples like the Agency’s air-to-air refuelling initiative, field hospital project or multinational helicopter training exercises have been put forward and are led by Member States. The Chief Executive confirmed, “EDA works at the service of Member States. We provide à la carte  support where needed.” The Agency invests particular efforts to avoid duplication with NATO. The EDA has recently also signed an agreement with Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR) facilitating closer cooperation between these two bodies. Under the arrangement, EDA and OCCAR will share information on projects and programmes throughout their lifecycle, helping to guarantee a seamless handover in each case, with both parties remaining involved and informed at every stage. The subcommittee received in the same session Catherine Ashton, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission, European External Action Service (EEAS) Deputy Secretary General Maciej Popowski as well as Eric Huybrechts, Deputy Director of OCCAR-EA.   Further information: Video of the subcommittee’s session Press release of the European Parliament	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/10/12/meps-push-for-pooling-sharing
EDA_NEWS_0888	2012-10-11	NEWS	Maritime Surveillance network expands to 3 more countries and moves forward	 Today, at the margins of the EDA Steering Board in Capabilities Directors formation, two EDA Member States, Bulgaria and Latvia, plus Norway, joined the Maritime Surveillance (MARSUR) community by signing the Technical Arrangement “Live phase”. The 15 initial participating Member States are Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Spain, Finland, Greece, France, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Sweden and the UK. Maritime situational awareness is the effective understanding of activities, associated with and occurring in the maritime domain, that could im¬pact on the security, safety and environment of the European Union and its Member States. The project is coordinated by the European Defence Agency (EDA) since September 2006, following a mandate given by the EU Defence Ministers in late 2005. MARSUR aims at creating a network using existing naval and maritime information exchange systems. Overall goals are to avoid duplication of effort and the use of available technologies, data and information; to enhance cooperation in a simple, efficient and low-cost solution for civil-military cooperation; and to support safety and security. The MARSUR Networking Project has successfully highlighted the fundamental need to control the maritime domain information. This network enables the exchange of maritime surveillance information between participating maritime countries, connecting multiple national systems in real time, while there is no central EU component that collects, processes and distributes the information. Each country is responsible for correlating its own data with the data received from others. The total common costs of MARSUR project is €930.000. A large amount of this investment was spent on the definition and development of the key component of the network: the interface linking the existing national systems. On top of this, Member States have to plug in their national systems into the interface. Furthermore, 12 of those Member States plus Norway signed today a €1 million Project Arrangement, which is very promising in terms of future cooperation and operational efficiency. This Category B programme aims at further developing the technical elements necessary to use MARSUR in a fully operational context. The Project Arrangement sets out the provisions for managing the MARSUR Development Project. Specifically, it outlines the tools necessary to implement a secure network for the exchange of classified information in the support of CSDP operations, to maximize cooperation whilst maintaining appropriate levels of security. This programme will be fully operational in 2014.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/10/11/maritime-surveillance-network-expands-to-3-more-countries-and-moves-forward

EDA_NEWS_0891	2012-09-27	NEWS	Green Blade 2012: Towards wrap-up	 The last two weeks were very busy for the more than 500 participant of the multinational Green Blade exercise. Military personnel from Belgium, Germany and Italy trained together with Special Forces from Belgium, Germany and Spain on numerous common missions. In total, 15 helicopters of different types are currently involved in the combined Green Blade/Pegasus exercise. Italy operates transport (CH-47) and attack (A-129) helicopters, Germany and Belgium two types of utility helicopters (UH-1D and A-109). Other aircraft used by Belgium are two C-130s, two B-Hunters and up to four F-16s. During the entire exercise, helicopters execute around 65 missions of steadily increasing complexity, from typical Special Operations-related missions, such as insertion/ extraction, Direct Action, Personnel Recovery, and Intelligence Surveillance & Reconnaissance, by day and by night, in single or multiship configurations. The exercise will also include more conventional types of missions, such as Airmobile Operations, Recce & Surveillance and Medical Evacuation, as well as non-tactical training missions, such as Night Vision Goggle-flying, Nap of Earth flight and Gun Firing. These missions will add up to around 650 crucial Flying Hours. The exercise will run until 5 October.

EDA_NEWS_0892	2012-09-28	NEWS	EDA facilitates access to commercial SatCom services for Member States	 With today's signature of a framework contract between the European Defence Agency (EDA) and Astrium Services, five Member States - France, Italy, Poland, Romania and the United Kingdom - benefit from pooled procurement of commercial satellite communications (SatCom) services. The advantages of the European Satellite Communications Procurement Cell (ESCPC) are convincing: reduced costs and easy access. The initial investment (2.3 million Euro) will allow the ESCPC to deliver concrete satellite capacities in the upcoming months. In military operations satellite communications are fundamental for Communication, Command and Control. They also allow operational effectiveness of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance platforms, including Remotely Piloted Aircraft. Member States often resort to commercial SatCom either to complement similar military capabilities or as the sole means to effectively conduct military operations. The EDA ESCPC aims at pooling commercial SatCom demand from a number of EU national defence departments, reducing costs by around 10 per cent. “The overall aim of the ESCPC is to overcome fragmented procurement of commercial SatCom capacity in order to reduce costs, promote ease of access and improve efficiency to deliver a better connectivity to armed forces of the EU Member States.” said Claude-France Arnould, EDA Chief Executive, after signing the framework contract with Astrium Services. Pooling and sharing of commercial satellite communications ESCPC is a good example of an EDA project delivering services to improve EU defence capabilities. As an implementation of the Effective Procurement Method promoted by the Agency, the ESCPC can for instance support outsourced logistic services backing any national, EU-led or coalition operation. The ESCPC is linked to the Third Party Logistics Support Platform, allowing for a more cost effective access to logistic support.   Cooperation with Astrium Services With the signature of the three years framework contract, Astrium Services will act as a one-stop-shop. It will serve as contractual, commercial and operational interface towards SatCom operators, providing the participating Member States with commercial bands (C, Ku and Ka). MILSATCOM: Savings in the order of one billion Euro ESCPC is a first and short-term step to improve SatCom capability for European defence. But Europe now also has the opportunity to cooperate to replace the existing national-based military satellite communications (MILSATCOM) capacities. In this respect EDA proposes the concept of Secure Telecom by Satellite (SECTELSAT) – a cooperative approach inspired by the Pooling and Sharing initiative. The initiative foresees a scheme in which MILSATCOM operating Nations will: Pool MILSATCOM assets with other operating Nations for mutual benefits (increased coverage and operational flexibility); Share MILSATCOM capacities by giving access for non-MILSATCOM Nations under defined conditions; Contribute to a European MILSATCOM capability package for the CSDP. Through this scheme, European Member States could save around one billion Euro stemming from synergies in research and technology investments, acquisition of recurring assets and standardised operations. “Today’s defence budgets are under severe pressure. The EDA offers European Member States a cost effective solution. I think this is an opportunity we should grasp.” concluded Claude-France Arnould. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/09/28/eda-facilitates-access-to-commercial-satcom-services-for-member-states
EDA_NEWS_0893	2012-10-05	NEWS	Green Blade 2012: Interoperability and mutual trust	"   With the redeployment of the last helicopters and ground forces, Green Blade 2012 ends today. Three weeks, 49 missions and 487 flying hours later, the 550 participants from four countries part from the Belgian Air Base Kleine-Brogel better trained and better prepared for multinational missions. “Green Blade 2012 was a great success. All participants have made tremendous efforts and have delivered hard work with passion. All have reached an extraordinary level of interoperability and gained new grounds of mission preparation by sharing  experiences and mutual trust and friendship.” Said Michael Becker, responsible for Green Blade 2012 at the EDA. Andy Gray, in charge of EDA’s helicopter training programme added, “We have to train personnel the way we fight. Collaboration is the only option and Green Blade was an excellent example of how far we get by working and training together.” Throughout the exercise, the high level of interoperability was projected into various mission scenarios. Moreover, in between their challenging mission executions, the participating crews managed to organize an expert workshop aimed at the exchange of experience and lessons learned from their real Afghanistan or Iraq mission deployments. Led by Italian instructor pilots, the workshop was introduced with the presentation ""ISAF mission in Afghanistan"", providing the valuable lessons learned and original footage from the Italian helicopter deployment. The briefing was followed by an open and lively discussion, in which the particpating pilots of different participating Member States and even observers from Canada shared their crucial experiences from their missions abroad. This kind of experience exchange between real experts perfectly fits into the concept of the Helicopter Exercise Programme. Similar workshops at even wider range of participants will represent a great value for the programme and show a valuable keypiont for the further strengthening of interoperability within our Member States.

EDA_NEWS_0895	2012-09-28	NEWS	Ministers of Defence welcome EDA’s Pooling & Sharing	" On 26 and 27 September, EU Ministers of Defence had a two-day informal meeting hosted by the Cypriot Presidency. The meeting was chaired by Cyprus’ Minister of Defence, Mr. Demetris Eliades, on behalf of the High Representative Baroness Catherine Ashton, who was represented by the Deputy Secretary-General of the European External Action Service (EEAS), Ambassador Maciej Popowski. Ms. Claude France-Arnould, EDA’s Chief Executive, also attended the meeting. Mr. Eliades described the meeting as a “positive step forward in our common efforts to enhance the Common Security and Defence Policy”, which aims to enhance peace, security, stability and growth. In addition to the discussions on EU’s southern neighborhood and on Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions, EU Defence Ministers also discussed the issue of pooling and sharing in support of developing military capabilities. Ministers welcomed the European Defence Agency’s proposal to develop a voluntary code of conduct on pooling and sharing, and emphasized the need to make this process more systematic and sustainable in the long run. “EDA will continue to drive Pooling & Sharing forward as a pragmatic, flexible and cost-effective model, and avoiding bureaucratisation. The Code of Conduct will facilitate cooperation, and make Pooling & Sharing sustainable now and in the future"", said Ms. Arnould, after the meeting. EDA’s proposal and results were acknowledged by Ministers; the EEAS representative said: “reactions to EDA's proposal on pooling and sharing and on the specific proposal to establish a code of conduct were encouraging as ministers were positive,” said Ambassador Popowski. The EEAS Deputy Secretary General also pointed out that the main challenge is to link pooling and sharing as a European initiative with the national defence planning processes.

EDA_NEWS_0897	2012-09-20	NEWS	Pooling Demand seminar to make defence spending go further	" As part of the wider Pooling and Sharing Initiative, Pooling and Consolidating Demand was examined yesterday at a high-level seminar in Brussels. Under discussion was an important tool in addressing the challenges of restricted defence budgets: combining purchases for reduced costs. The initiative has received support from across the defence spectrum, including defence and security industry. The Cyprus EU Council Presidency, in association with the European Defence Agency and the Egmont - Royal Institute for International Relations of Belgium, has organised a seminar entitled: ""Innovative European Defence Cooperation - Pooling and Consolidating Demand."" Drawing together representatives from Ministries of Defence, the European Commission, industry and media, the event permitted an in-depth discussion of some pressing issues. It featured contributions from leading figures in EU defence: speakers included Demetris Eliades, Minister of Defence of the Republic of Cyprus, General Håkan Syrén, Chairman of the EU Military Committee, Detlef Selhausen, German National Armaments Director, Antti Peltomäki, Deputy Director-General of DG Enterprise and Frank Haun, Chief Executive Officer of Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, as well as Claude-France Arnould, the EDA's Chief Executive. Reductions in EU defence budgets have given extra importance to the need for co-operation in Pooling and Sharing at a European level. At the seminar, delegates further examined the benefits and impacts of consolidating demand on EU governments and industries; the opportunities and challenges this creates, both in the short and in the long term; and in general, further means, methods and ways of improving the effectiveness of military expenditure within the EU. Giving a keynote address, General Håkan Syrén outlined many of the challenges, and called for deeper cooperation. He said “The recent budget cuts have further exacerbated the situation and made a difficult situation worse. A good thing is that they have increased the visibility and awareness of the problems, but let me underline that the fundamental problems are that defence is getting increasingly costly, that our efforts are spread too thinly to be really efficient and most important that our decisions are taken in 27 different national contexts. The potential for generating a greater capability output is substantial if we are able to coordinate our efforts better.” Central to the progress in Pooling Demand has been the EDA’s own project, Effective Procurement Methods. Having overcome the legal and bureaucratic obstacles to this initiative, the Agency has now successfully completed two pilot projects, one on training, covering instructors’ services and expertise for the European Guardian, a Counter-IED exercise held in Austria this summer, and another one on Basic Logistics Services for the EU Battle Group for three Member States: Austria, Czech Republic and Germany. Frank Haun, the Chief Executive Officer of German firm Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, in an EDA interview before the event, offered this call in support of the project: “In times of declining budgets and the massive re-allocation of financial resources, all partners in the defence market need to rethink and discuss objectives, structures, and processes.” He concluded that “it finally comes down to economies of scale.” The EDA’s Chief Executive, Claude-France Arnould, said at the end of the seminar: “I am very happy with today’s outcome. One could feel that all stakeholders are ready to translate our political commitment to Pooling & Sharing into real and tangible action. Pooling and Consolidating Demand is a key tool to make this happen and the EDA with its integrated way of working is just the natural place for it.” The Pooling Demand seminar forms part of the defence programme of Cyprus’ presidency of the European Council. More information on the Cypriot presidency is available at their dedicated website. Their press release about the seminar is available here.

EDA_NEWS_0898	2012-09-24	NEWS	Green Blade 2012: Up to speed	" The Combat Enhancement and Force Integration Training (CET & FIT) phase of Exercise Green Blade/Pegasus is up to speed now. Special Forces from Belgium (Special Forces Group in Heverlee), Italy (IX Battaglione “Col Moschin” in Livorno) and Spain (Escuadrón de Zapadores Paracaidistas in Murcia and Fuerza de Guerra Naval Especial in Cartagena) continue improving their combat procedures and techniques through repeated training, evaluation and assessment. Interoperability of the different participants increases by mutually exchanging information on techniques, procedures and equipment. On Wednesday and Thursday 18 and 19 September, aircrews continued their familiarisation briefings and flights as well as night flying exercises. All these flights started and ended at Kleine-Brogel Air Base, which acts as Deployed Operating Base (DOB) in the scenario of Exercise Green Blade/Pegasus. A DOB provides air support to combat operations from an air base or airfield at a more or less safe location near or in the area of operations. All flights were conducted at a minimum altitude above ground level (AGL) as a noise abatement precaution. In dedicated Helicopter Training Areas (HTA), mostly sparsely populated areas, the helicopters, were allowed to fly below 250 ft AGL and to perform landings in predetermined landing zones. Crews who already performed local area orientation flights, started supporting the cross-training of the Special Forces from a small airfield near the Leopoldsburg Barracks: locally known as Sanicole Aero Club. During this cross-training, troopers of all three participating nations rehearsed fast-roping and the use of SPIERIG, by day as well as at night. Fast-roping is a technique for descending a thick rope and is most convenient for deploying personnel from a helicopter in places where the helicopter itself cannot land, like built-up areas and woodland. It was developed by the British and first used in combat during the Falklands War. The technique is quicker than rappelling, but also more challenging as the person is not attached to the rope with a descender. The person just holds onto the rope with his gloved hands and feet and slides down. The rope has to be thick to prevent it from being blown around in the helicopter’s rotor blast. SPIERIG or Special Purpose Insertion/Extraction Rig is equipment developed by the US Marines to rapidly insert or extract personnel from terrain where a helicopter cannot land. To pick up personnel, a SPIE rope is lowered from a hovering helicopter into the pickup area. The troopers, wearing a harness with a carabiner, hook up to a D-ring inserted in the SPIE rope and secure themselves with a second safety line that is attached to a second D-ring in the rope. The helicopter then climbs vertically until rope and personnel are clear of obstacles and proceeds in forward flight to a secure insert zone. The extracted persons then board the helicopter or are picked up by other means of transport. In the past years, night flying became less hazardous by the use of Night Vision Goggles (NVG), but not less challenging. NVGs are optical instruments worn by pilots and other aircrew on their helmet and produce images in levels of light almost approaching total darkness. They were first used in World War II and came into wide use during the Vietnam War. Although NVGs make night flying less hazardous, the military always take a number of safety precautions into account. The helicopter’s Identification Friend or Foe (IFF, a system allowing identifying an aircraft on a radar screen), navigation and landing lights, and radar altimeter (a kind of radar allowing determining an aircraft’s altitude) have to be serviceable. Pilots have to respect the minima for visibility, ceiling and illuminance as specified in their national regulations, and for emergency procedures, a detailed fuel calculation has to be executed. The multinational “Best Practice Helicopter Tactics Workshop"" that took place on Thursday delivered a valuable exchange of information on important items like the mission planning cycle, NVG flying experience using different system setups, MEDEVAC and SOF tactics, and sequence and contents of briefings. More pictures are available on Flickr; several Green Blade videos are available on YouTube. "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/09/24/green-blade-2012-up-to-speed
EDA_NEWS_0899	2012-09-18	NEWS	European helicopter deployability is boosted by Special Operations exercise	 The European Defence Agency’s Helicopter Training Programme is holding its latest exercise, this time in Belgium; enhancing deployability by training personnel in multinational helicopter missions, while demonstrating the advantages and concrete results of cooperation in the context of Pooling & Sharing efforts. Exercise Green Blade is focusing on helicopter-special forces cooperation, a vital area of modern operations. Exercise Green Blade runs from 17 September to 5 October 2012, hosted by the Belgian Air Component. Running together with Exercise Pegasus, a Special Operations training exercise, the two groups will work closely together on numerous missions. With helicopters from Belgium, Germany and Italy, the two exercises in total draw together some 800 personnel from seven countries: EDA Member States Belgium, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Austria, Ireland and Spain (as well as Canada for the Pegasus exercise). In total 18 helicopters will deploy to Kleine Brogel Airbase, varying from transport (CH47), to utility (A109, UH-1D) and attack helicopters (A129). They will work in concert with other air assets, to maximize the realism of these testing missions; supporting assets will include an AWACS; F16; C130; and UAVs. The Belgian UAV, the B-Hunter, will be integrated for reconnaissance and surveillance of targets in direct support of the Special Forces, as well as for area surveillance during Personnel Recovery scenarios. The exercise will principally take place in the North of Belgium, with some missions taking place over Southeast Belgium. This vast and challenging training area is characterized by a low population density, a varied geography and a favourable airspace classification. Helicopters will execute around 65 missions of steadily increasing complexity, from typical Special Operations-related missions, such as insertion/extraction, Direct Action, Personnel Recovery, and Intelligence Surveillance & Reconnaissance, by day and by night, in single or multiship configurations. The exercise will also include more conventional types of missions, such as Airmobile Operations, Recce & Surveillance and Medical Evacuation, as well as non-tactical training missions, such as Night Vision Goggle-flying, Nap of Earth flight and Gun Firing. These missions will add up to around 650 crucial Flying Hours. The exercise, planning for which began in June 2011, will demonstrate the benefits of cooperation in the context of Pooling & Sharing efforts, delivering an exercise that few EDA Member States could undertake alone, enhancing helicopter deployability and freeing up scarce resources for other investments in the defence sector. Peter Round, EDA Capabilities Director, explained: “We fight together, and so we have to work together, pooling our resources. An exercise like this is the best way to deliver high quality training in these challenging times.” EDA Helicopter Activity The exercise is one part of wider ongoing EDA work to boost deployability, as requested by Member States. Green Blade is the latest in a series of increasingly effective helicopter exercises, held in France, Spain, Italy and Portugal since 2009 under the Helicopter Exercise Programme. The programme has so far involved 108 helicopters. Exercise Green Blade will be the first of these exercises run by the new Core Planning Team, which will steer the programme in the long-term, incorporating lessons learned and enhancing helicopter deployability for Member States. The EDA has also worked with its Member States to create the Helicopter Tactics Course in the UK, with 18 crews trained thus far. A new ‘train-the-trainers’ initiative is planned for this year; the European Qualified Helicopter Tactics Course, which is a joint effort by Sweden and the UK, aims to create a recognised tactics instructor cadre across Europe. Work has also started to harmonize helicopter flying training across participating Member States; trial courses have been delivered in Operational English Language learning and later this year, the EDA will conduct a capability concept demonstration into the use of distributed simulator training. EDA and Pooling & Sharing The Agency’s helicopter work sits alongside a succession of EDA programmes to pool and share assets and resources, enhancing the overall military capabilities of the EDA’s Member States in challenging times for defence. Similar programmes include the Tactical Air Transport strand, which recently held a major air exercise in Zaragoza, Spain, the EDA’s work in training Counter-IED professionals, and the recently launched pilot programme to pool demand for efficient procurement. The Agency is currently working on 10 Pooling & Sharing priority areas: Countering Improvised Explosive Devices; Medical support; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; Helicopters; Cyber Defence; Multinational logistics support’; Common Security and Development Policy Information Exchange; Strategic & Tactical Airlift Management; and Fuel & Energy. This exercise provides an ideal opportunity to demonstrate the advances made by the EDA’s Pooling & Sharing initiative.

EDA_NEWS_0900	2012-09-20	NEWS	Exercise Green Blade is under way	 Around 550 personnel and 15 helicopters arrived at Kleine-Brogel Air Base on Monday 17 September to participate in the joint and combined helicopter training and Special Forces exercise Green Blade/Pegasus. Green Blade is the fifth helicopter training exercise in a row organised since 2009 by the Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP) of the European Defence Agency (EDA), while Pegasus is a biennial Belgian exercise for Special Forces. Combining both exercises into one not only offers excellent added training opportunities for both helicopter crews and Special Forces, but also has a cost-reducing effect. By training together and exchanging ideas, the different Belgian, German and Italian helicopter crews and their support personnel develop common best practices and mutually improve their interoperability. The same goes for the participating Special Forces from Belgium, Italy and Spain. Additionally, the joint training of aircrews and Special Forces means that both groups of specialists are better prepared to work together in future operations. On arrivals day, all personnel received a place to work and a bed to sleep, and went through a series of mandatory safety and security briefings. Safety in general and flight safety in particular are among the major concerns of the exercise direction as well as of the host nation, as was stressed once more by their representatives in their welcoming speech on the first evening. The first week of the exercise is fully dedicated to what is called Combat Enhancement Training/Force Integration Training (CET/FIT) in military terminology. In short, it is a phase preceding the actual exercise during which the participants familiarise themselves with the exercise area and the equipment and procedures of their colleagues. Tuesday 18 September was mainly spent on familiarisation briefings and flights. Members of the participating Special Forces became acquainted with the general characteristics and performances of the different types of helicopters present as well as with the procedures for safe boarding and disembarking. Belgian helicopter crews showed their German and Italian colleagues around in the area of operations for Exercise Green Blade/Pegasus during a pinpoint navigation over the provinces of Antwerp, Liège, Limburg and Namur. During these flights, Belgian pilots made their guests familiar not only with the local landscape and its landmarks, but also with particularities of the Belgian airspace, local flight rules and exercise specific operating procedures. The images and the video below show the arrival of the helicopters, and the initial familiarization flights. More updates from the exercise will be posted throughout the next fortnight.

EDA_NEWS_0902	2012-09-17	NEWS	European Defence Agency calls for concerted action for future air systems	 Claude-France Arnould, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency (EDA), today highlighted the need for urgent action on European cooperation in the area of future air systems (FAS) during a conference at ILA Berlin. The Agency is already supporting a wide range of projects in the air domain fostering cooperation among Member States. However, new results from a recent EDA study suggest that while the air defense industry is still healthy, important industrial capabilities are eroding. Without additional concerted action, the situation will soon become critical, for example for the development of future combat aircraft (manned and unmanned) and attack helicopters. Military aviation is paramount in enabling EU Member States to meet their national security and defence requirements. Additionally, the industry has long been a driver for innovation, producing cutting edge technology that contributes to wider economic growth in Europe. Around 200,000 people in high-tech jobs are currently directly employed in the sector. It comprises important system integrators and a dynamic and innovative supply chain rich in SMEs. The industry generates an annual turnover of approximately 45 billion euro[1]. This technically advanced sector is a key supporting component of strong European military capabilities. Recent EDA-sponsored work has shown that Europe risks losing significant industrial know-how between now and 2020. This includes the ability to produce advanced combat aircraft. Moreover, Europe risks falling significantly behind the global competition in UAS capabilities. “Europe has successfully managed to join forces in two fields closely related to military aviation: space and civil aviation. If we want a similarly strong and independent aeronautics defence sector, we have to set the course now”, said Claude-France Arnould during the EDA Future Air Systems Conference at ILA Berlin. EDA: Fostering aerial cooperation With budgets under pressure and joint operations more and more common, the EDA is playing a key role in pooling and sharing vital defence capabilities in Europe. Notably in the area of air operations, a number of successful projects are being conducted: EDA’s air-to-air refuelling initiative is supporting Member States in developing interoperable European solutions to overcome current shortfalls, and propose options for future requirements in this respect. Bringing together air crews from across Europe to train and qualify together in airlift disciplines is the aim of the European air transport training. The first training event was held successfully in Zaragoza, Spain in June this year. More exercises will follow in 2013. To date, military airworthiness activities have been conducted and regulated on a national basis. This generates many problems in multinational programmes and is a primary cause for delay and additional cost. The EDA is a key actor in working towards an EU-wide harmonisation and unification strategy on military airworthiness which will make the process more efficient and will help to reduce costs. The EDA’s Helicopter Training Programme provides a framework to Member States to allow them to develop, consolidate and share best practices to meet the challenges of flying helicopters in the modern operational environment. EDA has to date delivered four exercises: one in Gap, France, one in Logrono, Spain, one in Viterbo, Italy and one near Porto, Portugal. A fifth one, Green Blade 2012, will be held in Belgium at the end of September. These exercises have met an urgent training requirement for the participating Member States, greatly enhancing the helicopter capacity available. They are complemented by the EDA’s three-week Helicopter Tactics Course, ten being held in 2012. The Agency has worked on Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) issues since its inception, and in 2007 it received an explicit directive from European defence ministers to examine the challenges to UAS air traffic insertion. Apart from facilitating concrete projects (e.g. Midair Collision Avoidance project (MIDCAS)) and funding studies (e.g. Study on military spectrum requirements for the insertion of UAS into general air traffic (SIGAT)), the EDA cooperates with European and international organisations to move forward technical, regulatory and standardisation issues. “FAS4Europe” study: how to safeguard the future of the military aviation industry Almost 30 industrial entities, representing a significant proportion of Europe’s military aviation industry, were involved in the twelve month FAS4Europe study under the leadership of Saab AB. Its aim was to analyse the current state of the European air defence industry, to identify the sector’s strengths and weaknesses and to provide a roadmap and implementation plan. The main result of the study is that the European military aeronautical industry is now losing capabilities. The situation for future air systems is severe, with some important industrial capabilities and technologies already at risk. The study highlights that an opportunity exists to break the current trend of erosion. However, it requires the launch of actions based on a common and coordinated plan. The EDA study thus sets out a roadmap of projects and demonstrator programmes. This roadmap includes proposals to work on: Technologies for advanced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance UAS; Increasing air system survivability against future threats (rotary and fixed wing); and, Improving the lifecycle affordability of military aircraft (rotary and fixed wing). Additionally, the study highlights the potential to link civil-military research and development to exploit synergies within the civil aerospace market. Finally, it strongly suggests co-operative European aerospace development programmes to avoid further fragmentation. Agency position The EDA will address the issue of a common European approach with stakeholders and will raise it at Board level. “What is in question today is Europe’s future ability to design and develop advanced new military aircraft. The Agency aims to make a strong case for strategic European cooperation for future air systems”, concluded Claude-France Arnould in Berlin.

EDA_NEWS_0903	2012-09-12	NEWS	Opinion: Paper argues for Political Will in Pooling Demand	 With the upcoming seminar on Pooling & Consolidating Demand, EDA has been highlighting other perspectives on this vital issue. One major contribution to the debate comes from Christian Mölling of the German think tank SWP. In a June 2012 article title 'Pooling and Sharing in the EU and NATO', he lays out the opportunities and challenges that defence cooperation faces today. Ultimately he highlights a crucial point: that Pooling & Sharing is not a technocratic process, but requires real political will to be truly effective; Dr Mölling provides a useful framework for this debate, terming it Sovereignty vs Effectiveness. He also calls for a push in three neglected areas of defence cooperation: role specialisation, the arms industry and additional investments. The full article is available here: Moelling Article: Pooling and Sharing For more on this topic, see our interview with Frank Haun, the CEO of Krauss-Maffei Wegmann. Note: These are the views of Dr. Mölling. EDA welcomes the contribution to the debate, without officially endorsing any of his conclusions. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/09/12/opinion-paper-argues-for-political-will-in-pooling-demand
EDA_NEWS_0904	2012-09-17	NEWS	Seminar: Flight path for a better future	 International military aviation specialists followed EDA’s invitation to its “European Military Aviation – Flight Path for a Better Future” conference at ILA Berlin on 13 September 2012. Opening the seminar, Claude-France Arnould, EDA’s Chief Executive, highlighted the importance of military air capabilities to meet national security and defence requirements. She furthermore insisted that the sector was an important factor in producing wider economic growth in Europe. The recent EDA FAS4Europe study however shows that European military air capabilities are eroding with adverse impact on Europe’s ability to act in moments of crisis. Madame Arnould made clear that the European Defence Agency was committed to promoting a comprehensive approach to the military aerospace sector in Europe. Domingo Ureña-Raso, CEO Airbus Military, also emphasized in his keynote speech that Europe’s industrial capacity was already deteriorated and would soon be seriously impacted with consequences for the key capabilities and technologies. He therefore called for increased European cooperation, especially through EDA. Further speakers shared with the audience lessons learnt from operational experience, challenges from a procurement and supply perspective as well as ideas for a future strategic approach to cooperation in supplying air capabilities. 2012-09-11 Future Air Systems factsheet Speech by Urena-Raso - Sept 2012 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/09/17/seminar-flight-path-for-a-better-future
EDA_NEWS_0905	2012-09-11	NEWS	Data Fusion in Urban Sensor Network (D-FUSE): closing meeting	 On 11 September 2012, the EDA hosted the final meeting of the project Data Fusion in Urban Sensor Network (D-FUSE) in Brussels. This Research and Technology project is contracted by the European Defence Agency on behalf of Member States contributing to the Joint Investment Programme on Force Protection. It is implemented by a consortium consisting of Thales Nederland, SAAB, Thales Air Systems, Datactica, Bumar Electronica and Data Fusion International. This project reviews in particular networks of simple sensors, of capable sensors, and of mixed sensors. It covers practical issues for system implementation in an operational environment. Public results available are the posters of the dissemination seminar held last 6 March in Delft, in the Netherlands (see this link) and the Executive Summary. Full results will be distributed to the contributing Members of the Force Protection Programme.  The Executive Summary of the D-FUSE study is available here. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/09/11/data-fusion-in-urban-sensor-network-(d-fuse)-closing-meeting
EDA_NEWS_0906	2012-07-31	NEWS	EDA Research Project Results on Intelligent IED Countermeasures Successfully Tested	 On 19 July 2012, a Demonstration and Visitor Day in Großmittel, Austria, concluded the trials of the EDA research project “Intelligent Control of Adversary Radio-Communication (ICAR)”, aiming at more sophisticated sensing and countering of Remote-Controlled Improvised Explosive Devices (RC-IED). ICAR started under the Joint Investment Programme on Force Protection (JIP-FP), one of the flagships in the EDA portfolio. The work is driven by European forces´ most recent lessons from Crisis Management Operations, and is a true testimony that European collaboration in defence research works. The project value is around €4m, and it involves a consortium from 8 nations (France, Germany, Netherlands, Poland, Austria, Greece, Slovakia and Belgium), the logos of whom are at the foot of this article. In his opening address, Michael Sieber, Assistant R&T Director at EDA, underlined that IEDs are among the most important threats in asymmetric warfare, with not only a physical, but also a high psychological impact on our forces. ICAR has explored new technologies to mitigate this threat – smarter sensing, powerful information fusion and intelligent counter-measures. Quite a number of EDA member states´ representatives took up the invitation to take part in the project demonstration, which offered 3 scenarios: protection of patrols, of convoys and of infrastructure. The most spectacular scenario was certainly convoy protection, where the sensor platform was integrated into an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. But the robotic ground vehicle carrying the counter-measure unit also generated high interest among the audience. Organisers of the event were able to benefit from the kind support by the Austrian Ministry of Defence (Bundesministerium für Landesverteidigung und Sport – BMLVS) and the Austrian Armed Forces already during its preparation. The Director for Research and Technology of the BMLVS, Brigadier Klemens Hofmeister, summarised his impressions of the day in his concluding remarks, rating the project a full success.

EDA_NEWS_0907	2012-07-30	NEWS	New report highlights importance of defence cooperation	 The European Economic and Social Committee have released an Opinion Paper on the current state of the European defence industry. Many of the conclusions in the Opinion are in line with work being carried out by EDA. Entitled ‘The need for a European defence industry: industrial, innovative and social aspects’, the paper calls for a stronger and more integrated European defence sector, suggesting that “Obsolete approaches visibly lead to increasing fragmentation, gaps, overcapacity and a lack of interoperability in European defence capabilities. The arguments for improvement are overwhelming; it is a matter of political will.” The report notes that security is the first duty of governments, and a key part of their compact with their citizens – and suggests that current spending levels mean that the credibility of this guarantee is being undermined. It makes the point that foreign affairs and security, defence, and industrial capability are all deeply interrelated, and must be integrated into a coherent strategy. The report calls for a “radical” change of mindset in the way governments deal with defence. One area that the report particularly highlights is Research and Development, which has seen many cuts in recent years, but which remains absolutely crucial to an effective defence in the long term. The report concludes that European research spending should seek opportunities for “dual use” investments and reduce technological dependency on sources outside Europe. The report welcomes the creation of the Task Force on Defence – with EDA as an associated member – as well as the European Parliament’s December 2011 Resolution on European Defence, and the personal commitment of many senior EU officials to the cause of an effective national defence. In that regard, the paper calls for still closer cooperation between the key parties in defence. The authors argue that the European Defence Agency in particular has a key role to play, and that it must act as a full partner to the European Commission on defence issues – with the full involvement also of the defence industry and other stakeholders. In doing so, the fragmentation and duplication of public expenditure may be reduced, enhancing quality and interoperability. Many of the issues raised in this paper fall within the purview of the EDA. The recent launch of the Effective Procurement Methods initiative and the progress made on the joint procurement of satellite communications are but two examples of EDA’s successes in European defence cooperation. Today’s signature of an Administrative Arrangement with OCCAR demonstrates the commitment to maximizing effectiveness through links with other defence stakeholders. The full text of the Committee’s Opinion Paper is available here. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/07/30/new-report-highlights-importance-of-defence-cooperation
EDA_NEWS_0908	2012-09-03	NEWS	Five Questions on Pooling & Consolidating Demand	 Mr Haun, you will be speaking at a High Level Seminar on Pooling and Consolidating Demand, co-organised by the Cyprus EU Council Presidency, the Egmont Institute and the European Defence Agency. What is your motivation to devote your scarce time to this topic? In times of declining budgets and the massive re-allocation of financial resources, all partners in the defence market need to rethink and discuss objectives, structures, and processes. We all act within a system of interdependencies. Creating win-win situations should be our common denominator. Thus – representing the supply side – I feel personally responsible to contribute and listen on this occasion. When the EDA started to prepare the Effective Procurement Methods work strand as one of the main vehicles to implement Pooling and Consolidating Demand, our research revealed that the potential savings for governments, depending on the degree of demand consolidation, can lead up to more than 30 per cent – so the advantages seem to be rather on the demand side. Yet, European defence industries are constantly calling for it. Can you explain the benefits of Pooling and Consolidating Demand for the supply side? Well, it finally comes down to economies of scale. Assuming that EU’s nations by and large will have to face the same challenges in land warfare for the time being: Is there really a necessity for six types of 8x8 vehicles developed and produced within the European Union? Or put it the other way round: Do different operators of one and the same vehicle really need different specifications, levels of protection, and so forth? Being an engineering-driven company, KMW loves to supply leading-edge technologies. We are really good at that; but we would do even better if the breadth of demand would be reduced in favour of consolidated high-tech depth. The benefits of Pooling and Consolidating Demand seem so obvious, and yet it is still an exception rather than a rule. From your point of view, what are the main obstacles to Pooling and Consolidating Demand? In defence as in many other respects, Europe still is a patchwork. Aiming at pooling and consolidating demand, none of us may start from a blank sheet of paper. Today, military equipment varies from nation to nation. To a certain extent and for some time ahead, this constitutes part of the reference frame for new procurements. Another major obstacle, of course, is national thinking. As Europeans, we share the same values, most of us share the same currency, and we co-ordinate our foreign policy – but in defence issues and in defence industries, things remain pretty domestic. The European Union's package of directives in the field of defence and security is a significant step in the right direction. However, competition on this platform can only be fair and cost-efficient, if governments step back from various ways of supporting or owning their national defence industries. Please allow us to become a bit more concrete now. We have learned that Krauss-Maffei Wegmann has already long-lasting experience with Pooling and Consolidating Demand, for example through your cooperation with so called weapon systems user clubs like the one for Leopard Main Battle Tanks. At the same time your company is not offering the equipment only but also related training and logistic services. Can you tell us a bit more about your actual experiences and elaborate a bit on where you see further potential for Pooling and Consolidating demand? We constantly listen to customers, we facilitate communication among our customers. Thus, all involved may benefit from each other’s experiences. With the Leopard user club, we have a platform to define and devise common supply concepts, further development and plans for adaptions. At KMW, this is an integral part of customer relationship management. If we talk about pooling and consolidating demand in the European Union, we are talking about something as efficient, but on a much bigger scale and backed-up decisively by national politics. If you were given the possibility to deliver one key message related to Pooling and Consolidating Demand to European governmental decision makers, what would it be? Define your needs, discuss them open-minded with your fellow-nations – and have faith in the market. Mr Haun, thank you very much for this interview. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/09/03/five-questions-on-pooling-consolidating-demand
EDA_NEWS_0909	2012-09-03	NEWS	French Minister of Defence visits EDA	 The French Minister of Defence visited the European Defence Agency today. Jean-Yves Le Drian and a delegation from the French Ministry of Defence received presentations from EDA experts on some of the Agency’s current priority projects: air-to-air refueling, countering improvised explosive devices and Research & Technology. The presentations highlighted the concrete progress made in these Pooling & Sharing workstrands: to combat the most significant threat in current conflicts, IEDs; to maintain Europe’s technological edge in the defence arena; and to ensure European aircraft can operate flexibly and effectively beyond their bases. The Minister then met with Agency Chief Executive Claude-France Arnould and the EDA’s Directors; they discussed the current state of European defence, and the imperative to take action. In particular, Ms Arnould emphasized the Agency’s flexibility, and openness to supporting bilateral and regional, as well as pan-European defence cooperation – something the Agency achieves through its ‘opt-in’ project structure and constant emphasis on the needs of Member States. The French Minister of Defence expressed his political support for European defence cooperation, and he emphasized the importance of the Agency’s work in that cause. Claude-France Arnould commented: “We’re very pleased to have the opportunity to showcase our work to Monsieur Le Drian. I think we both agree that projects like our work on air-to-air refueling will be vital to Europe’s defence in the future.” Indeed, thanks to the Agency’s recent agreement with OCCAR, projects like air-to-air refueling can now be carried through more effectively, with the smoothest possible handover from concept to procurement. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/09/03/french-minister-of-defence-visits-eda
EDA_NEWS_0910	2012-08-08	NEWS	Pooling Demand: Finding best practice and fostering progress	" In times of austerity, Ministries of Defence must find more efficient and effective ways to procure. Pooling Demand with a view to common procurements, particularly in the field of off-the-shelf purchases, offers considerable opportunities to increase the effectiveness of defence spending, while boosting interoperability. Equally, Pooling Demand helps counter fragmentation and small orders, helping the European defence industry plan better and seek economies of scale – thereby enhancing the global competiveness of the European defence technological and industrial base, which is a crucial element for long term security of supply. It is for these reasons that Pooling Demand was named a key enabler for multinational cooperation by the EU Council of 22 March 2012. The European Defence Agency has been at the forefront of pooling demand: its Effective Procurement Methods project is already delivering results, with the launch of two pilot cases in recent months. In association with the European Defence Agency and the Egmont - Royal Institute for International Relations of Belgium, the Cyprus EU Presidency is organizing a high level seminar entitled: ""Innovative European Defence Cooperation - Pooling and Consolidating Demand."" The seminar will bring together policy makers and senior level experts from governments, industry and institutions to discuss on-going efforts, and to identify those areas where future work would be needed to further implement and complement these initiatives. Pooling Demand: Designed for Member States Pooling of Demand is driven by the Member States. Member States have to identify the areas they are willing to cooperate on, find the appropriate partners and decide on how to structure such a cooperation. The EDA through its Effective Procurement Methods workstrand is on hand to offer its expertise and assistance throughout this process. This flexible, Member State-driven approach ensures that Pooling Demand delivers clear benefits. Some Member States have already gained concrete experience in pooling demand, either in the role of a lead nation managing common demand on behalf of others or as country benefitting from the purchasing services of another country or international body, like the EDA. It is now about sharing these experiences and identifying improvements to existing processes, for the benefit of Member States. From Common Demand to Common Action Finding the right subjects for Pooling Demand is one of the biggest challenges in the process. It is not only about selecting which goods and services to procure, but also about finding an appropriate composition of beneficiaries for a procurement. Cooperative programmes of the past have not automatically led to more effectiveness or efficiency. Therefore, we will have to openly assess the different possibilities and challenges. Comparing governmental and industrial perspectives will help identify promising areas for Pooling Demand and – just as importantly – detect areas which are not ready to be included in such efforts. Once, based on consolidated requirements, common demand has been detected, such demand has to be translated into actual cooperation. Working together in the EDA framework is certainly one of the options. But there are a number of other possibilities that may be equally appropriate and worth exploring. At the end of the day, Member States have to identify their preferred collaborative vehicle for a given case. Learning from past experience and building best practices in this regard will help avoiding some of the challenges encountered by past cooperative initiatives. Eventually, through optimising cooperation – in procurement and beyond – we will be able to make common efforts more and more attractive. By this, we would contribute to bridge the gap between the common political will for more Pooling of Demand and its practical and concrete implementation.

EDA_NEWS_0912	2012-07-04	NEWS	EDA’s Helicopter Training Programme forges ahead with Exercise Hot Blade	 One of the largest helicopter exercises in Europe gets under way today. Some 2700 personnel from all three services and seven countries will take part in Exercise Hot Blade from 4-19 July. The exercise forms part of the European Defence Agency’s Helicopter Training Programme. Exercise Hot Blade draws on forces from Portugal (the hosts), and Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, Austria and Finland - as well as observers from Sweden and the UK. The exercise area covers almost half of Portugal, and will be based at Ovar Air Base near Porto. Portugal are being supported by Luxembourg. Forces have been arriving over the last few days, by sea, land and air in a tricky logistical operation. Today they will receive briefings and prepare; after this evening’s opening ceremony, flying operations proper will begin tomorrow. Hot Blade: Mission Under the overall theme of hot, high and dusty conditions, a broad range of skills will be practiced, including Air Assault, Special Operations Aviation and Casualty Evacuation. In an important innovation, helicopters will work together with F-16 fighters, and crews will train with an embedded civil protection cell. Crews will fly in joint and combined formations, learning to communicate and trust one another in operational scenarios. The mission incorporates lessons learned from recent operations in Afghanistan and Libya. This takes place under an umbrella scenario designed to test planners and crews in realistic conditions. The scenario is based in the fictional Idrasse Peninsula, where an EU Force is tasked with maintaining security conditions for humanitarian activities, surveilling and suppressing illegal armed groups, and deterring territorial incursions by a neighbouring state. Hot Blade: Assets The exercise employs a variety of assets. From Portugal, EH-101 Merlins will fly alongside F-16 fighters and C-160 transport aircraft. These are supported by an Air Force Control and Reporting Centre, a Tactical Air Control Party and a Force Protection Unit. The Portuguese Army have meanwhile contributed a Quick Response Brigade, a Special Operations Troops Centre, and a Commando Troops Centre, while the Portuguese Navy have contributed further Special Operations Forces. From Belgium, A109 helicopters will participate, while Finland is providing NH90 helicopters. Germany is represented by CH53 Sea Stallions, while The Netherlands is contributing Cougar AS-532U2 and Chinook CH47D helicopters. From Austria come Agusta Bell 212 rotary wing assets. Each country will also contribute crews and support staff, and many are also making contributions-in-kind to the running of the exercise. The breadth and variety of air assets, from many European states, presents a great opportunity to test and stretch crews and planners, who will learn to work together under operational pressure. EDA & Helicopter Training Programme The exercise is part of EDA’s Helicopter Training Programme. Hot Blade is the latest in a series of increasingly effective helicopter exercises, held in France, Spain and Italy since 2009. The exercise programme has delivered training to: 72 helicopters, 152 crews and over 1800 personnel. Over 50% crews that have participated have subsequently deployed to Afghanistan. The programme has also involved the creation of the Helicopter Tactics Course in the UK, with 18 crews trained thus far, a new ‘train-the-trainers’ initiative to be held this year, work to harmonize helicopter flying training across participating Member States, trial courses in Operational English Language learning and experimentation with distributed simulator training. In this context, EDA looks forward to Exercise Green Blade, to be held in Belgium this Autumn, and to the creation of a core planning team to steer the programme in the long-term. EDA & Cooperation The Helicopter Training Programme is one of a number of EDA programmes that pool and share assets and resources, enhancing the overall military capabilities of the EDA’s Member States. Similar programmes include Tactical Air Transport, which recently held a major air exercise in Zaragoza, Spain, and the EDA’s work in training Counter-IED professionals. Pictures and videos from the exercise are available here.

Meanwhile, EDA's Project Manager, Wing Commander Andy Gray, also arrived in Ovar, where he has been helping coordinate the final preparations. Before he left, he gave an advance briefing to Brussels-based journalists on the exercise. There, he noted with thanks the dedicated involvement of the contributing Member States, Portugal (the hosts), and Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, Austria and Finland - as well as observers from Sweden and the UK. He thanked Portugal for their contribution in hosting the exercise, and also Luxembourg for their important financial support. Wing Cdr Gray stressed the scale of the exercise and its complexity. In that vein, he provided illustrations of the scope of the exercise area, which covers almost half of Portugal, and listed the many skills that will be practiced in the exercise, including Air Assault, Special Operations Aviation, Combat Service Support, Close Air Support including Urban CAS and Emergency CAS, Convoy/helicopter escorts, Reconnaissance and Security operations, Combat Search and Rescue, Personnel Recovery, Military/Non Military extractions, Medical Evacuation and Casualty Evacuation. Wing Cdr Gray went on to place the exercise in the wider context of the Helicopter Training Programme. He offered a potted history of the programme, and explained that Hot Blade built on the lessons learned and past successes of previous exercises in France, Spain and Italy. He highlighted the creation of the Helicopter Tactics Course in the UK, the ‘train-the-trainers’ initiative, harmonization of flying training, the development of the NH90 and experimentation with distributed simulator training. In this context, he looked forward to Exercise Green Blade, to be held in Belgium in Autumn 2012, and to the creation of a core planning team to steer the programme in the long-term basis. Exercise Hot Blade takes place from 4-19 July.

EDA_NEWS_0914	2012-07-12	NEWS	Ministers of Defence and EDA's Chief Executive pay visit to exercise HOT BLADE	" One of the largest helicopter exercises in Europe is taking place at Ovar, Portugal . Some 36 helicopters and 3000 personnel from seven countries are taking part. Today, the Portuguese Minister of Defence, Mr. José Pedro Aguiar-Branco, welcomed Mr. Jean-Marie Halsdorf, Luxembourg Minister of Defence, and Ms. Claude France-Arnould, European Defence Agency's Chief Executive at Ovar Air Base. Portugal hosts HOT BLADE 12 multinational helicopter exercise, from 9 to 19 July 2012, based at Ovar Military Airfield, near Porto, Portugal. Delivered by the Portuguese Air Force and supported by Luxembourg, HOT BLADE 2012 is part of the European Defence Agency's Helicopter Training Program. 3000 military and 36 helicopters from Austria, Belgium, Finland, Germany, and Netherlands participate in the exercise, with Sweden and United Kingdom sending observers. The exercise allows European helicopter crews to practice operations in a hot, high and dusty environment, simulating the challenge and the dynamic conditions that participant forces will encounter when they deploy to a current theatres of operation, taking into consideration the lessons learned from recent scenarios like Afghanistan and Libya. Recognising the importance of the Helicopter Training Programme, the Portuguese Minister of Defence, Mr. José Pedro Aguiar-Branco welcomed today Mr. Jean-Marie Halsdorf, Luxembourg Minister of Defence, and Ms. Claude France-Arnould, European Defence Agency's Chief Executive, at Ovar Air Base. Participating forces demonstrated a typical joint tasks mission, including Air Assault (AA), Special Operations Aviation (SOA), Close Air Support (CAS), Convoy protection, Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) and logistic resupply. Thanking the Portuguese authorities, Ms. Arnould stressed how successful the exercise is, saying ""this builds up into a coordinated EDA effort to address Europe’s helicopter shortfall. And this in turn fits into a still broader campaign – to provide all of our member states with the aerial capabilities they need"".   Background information Hot Blade: Mission Under the overall theme of hot, high and dusty conditions, a broad range of skills will be practiced, including Air Assault, Special Operations Aviation and Casualty Evacuation. In an important innovation, helicopters will work together with F-16 fighters, and crews will train with an embedded civil protection cell. Crews will fly in joint and combined formations, and where possible within national regulations, with mixed-nationality aircrews, learning to communicate and trust one another in operational scenarios. The mission incorporates lessons learned from recent operations in Afghanistan and Libya. This takes place under an umbrella scenario designed to test planners and crews in realistic conditions. The scenario is based in the fictional Idrasse Peninsula, where an EU Force is tasked with maintaining security conditions for humanitarian activities, monitoring and suppressing illegal armed groups, and deterring territorial incursions by a neighbouring state. Hot Blade: Assets The exercise employs a variety of assets. From Portugal, EH-101 Merlins will fly, alongside F-16 fighters. These are supported by an Air Force Control and Reporting Centre, a Tactical Air Control Party and a Force Protection Unit. The Portuguese Army have meanwhile contributed a Quick Response Brigade, a Special Operations Troops Centre, and a Commando Troops Centre, while the Portuguese Navy have contributed further Special Operations Forces. From Belgium, A109 helicopters will attend, while Finland is providing NH90 helicopters. Germany is represented by CH53 Sea Stallions, while The Netherlands is contributing Cougar AS-532U2 and Chinook CH47D helicopters. From Austria come Agusta Bell 212 rotary wing assets. Each country will also contribute crews and relevant support staff, and many are also making contributions-in-kind to the running of the exercise. The breadth and variety of air assets, from such a range of European states, presents a great opportunity to test and stretch crews and planners, who will learn to work together under operational pressure. EDA & Helicopter Training Programme The exercise builds on EDA’s Helicopter Training Programme, run by Wing Commander Andy Gray. Hot Blade is only the latest in a succession of increasingly effective helicopter exercises, held in France, Spain and Italy since 2009. The exercise programme has delivered training to: 72 helicopters, 152 crews and over 1800 personnel. Over 50% crews that have attended these exercises and then subsequently deployed to Afghanistan. The programme has also involved the creation of the Helicopter Tactics Course in the UK, with 18 crews trained thus far, a new ‘train-the-trainers’ initiative to be held this year, work to harmonize helicopter flying training across participating Member States, trial courses in Operational English Language learning and experimentation with distributed simulator training. In this context, EDA looks forward to Exercise Green Blade, to be held in Belgium this Autumn, and to the creation of a core planning team to steer the programme in the long-term. EDA & Pooling & Sharing The Helicopter Training Programme since alongside a succession of EDA programmes that pool and share assets and resources, enhancing the overall military capabilities of the EDA’s Member States in challenging times for defence. Similar programmes include the Tactical Air Transport strand, which recently held a major air exercise in Zaragoza, Spain, and the EDA’s work in training Counter-IED professionals.

EDA_NEWS_0915	2012-07-27	NEWS	EDA & OCCAR build links, seeking efficiencies through cooperation	 The European Defence Agency and the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation today signed an Administrative Arrangement, paving the way for a closer relationship between these two important actors in European defence cooperation. The European Defence Agency (EDA) and the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR) fulfil complementary roles. In recognition of the close working relations established between EDA and OCCAR and the potential benefits and synergies stemming from still closer cooperation, an Administrative Arrangement (AA) was signed today by Ms Claude-France Arnould, the EDA Chief Executive and Mr. Patrick Bellouard, the OCCAR-EA Director. Claude-France Arnould commented: “Thanks to this partnership, a project can be brought from concept to battlefields with fewer delays, delivering at greater speed and greater efficiency for our Member States.” The AA constitutes the foundation and establishes the framework for further cooperation between EDA and OCCAR. EDA and OCCAR will seek to ensure that their activities are coherent, complementary and effective. In pursuing cooperative projects and programmes, EDA and OCCAR will direct their efforts towards enhancing European defence capabilities, improving European Armaments cooperation, and strengthening the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB). Patrick Bellouard expressed his conviction that: “From now on, integration into OCCAR of programmes originating from EDA’s work on capabilities and harmonisation of requirements, will run smoother, delivering maximum efficiency for our customers.” Principles of cooperation With the signing of this arrangement, OCCAR and EDA become privileged partners in the field of defence capabilities development. Under the arrangement, EDA and OCCAR will share information on projects and programmes throughout their lifecycle, helping to guarantee a seamless handover in each case, with both parties remaining involved and informed at every stage. EDA and OCCAR can now deepen their cooperation through the administrative arrangement and a security agreement on the exchange of classified information. EDA & OCCAR will subsequently identify cooperative projects initiated and prepared by EDA that may be managed by OCCAR. This Administrative Arrangement forms part of both organisations’ ongoing efforts to engage with all defence stakeholders in Europe, delivering maximum efficiency for Member States. EDA-OCCAR cooperation in practice EDA and OCCAR have cooperated effectively on an ad hoc basis on several major projects. This arrangement incorporates the lessons learned from these projects. For instance, on Maritime Mine Counter-Measures (MMCM), 13 states collaborated within an EDA programme harmonising requirements for the replacement of their capability. France and the UK have drawn from these results to launch a bi-lateral collaborative programme and have mandated OCCAR to manage the programme for two MMCM Mission Packages by 2018. Also for MUSIS, seven Nations are cooperating in the framework of a Letter of Intent in the EDA context, while France and Italy launched the early phases of a bilateral OCCAR managed programme. MUSIS will federate future space systems for surveillance, reconnaissance and observation. Another example is the European Secured Software Radio (ESSOR). An EDA project from 2007, the development of ESSOR has been entrusted to OCCAR with a programme division established in Bonn. This project will improve European military interoperability and help make European industry competitive in this crucial segment of the military communication market. One more example is the Biological Equipment Development and Enhancement Programme (BIO-EDEP). The EDA is currently developing a demonstrator of various subsystems to detect, identify and monitor biological agents, and it is intended to transfer BIO-EDEP to OCCAR within a year. There it will lead to equipment that will enable European forces to operate in a biological threat environment, through increased protection and survivability of individual soldiers and units. Looking ahead, EDA and OCCAR will intensify their cooperation to develop and enhance Europe’s air-to-air refuelling capability – a vital capacity in modern operations. As a first step they will investigate a multinational solution to fit air-to-air refuelling kits to A400M aircraft with a view to increase the European tactical air-to-air refuelling capability. As a second step they will investigate Multi Role Tanker Transport acquisition options to increase the European strategic air-to-air refuelling capability on the longer term. EDA and OCCAR’s joint efforts are contributing to elaborate a European solution to a European shortfall. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/07/27/eda-occar-build-links-seeking-efficiencies-through-cooperation
EDA_NEWS_0916	2012-06-27	NEWS	EDA launches Effective Procurement Methods Pilot Case	 In a ceremony today, the European Defence Agency signed the contract for an Effective Procurement Methods Pilot Case on Basic Logistics Services for the EU Battle Group. Representing EDA, Deputy Chief Executive Adam Sowa signed the contract with Karsten Deiseroth, the Senior Vice President of IABG, the German technology company, and Massimo Ciano, the CEO of Ciano Group, an Italian logistics company. Also present was General Håkan Syrén, Chairman of the EU Military Committee, and representatives from the sponsoring Member States: Austria, Czech Republic and Germany. Effective Procurement Methods (EPM) is an EDA work strand under the umbrella of the wider Pooling & Sharing initiative. It focusses on identifying common (off-the-shelf) demand of groups of Member States and translating these into a common procurement. This pooling of demand should lead to benefits from increased competition and economies of scale. Moreover, more frequent use of common procurement mechanisms will support European defence industry in its efforts to increase cross-border consolidation, and lead to more interoperability between European Armed Forces. This contract forms one of the first EPM pilot cases. It constitutes a Framework Contract on Basic Logistic Services (Food, Water, Sales Goods) for the Battle Group 2012/2, for the benefit of Austria, Czech Republic and Germany. A consortium of IABG and Ciano was awarded the contract on 29 May 2012, which is worth up to 228m Euros.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/06/27/EDA_launches_Effective_Procurement_Methods_Pilot_Case
EDA_NEWS_0917	2012-06-21	NEWS	Military Green 2012: Examining sustainability in defence	 The European Defence Agency has been reflecting on the role of the military in environmental sustainability. At a conference scheduled to coincide with the EU’s Sustainable Energy Week, high level speakers made a powerful call for the military to shoulder its responsibilities in this domain – and technical experts plotted ways to do so. Day 1 of the conference focused on the politics of military sustainability. In a series of panel discussions, speakers reflected on the military’s role in green action, from reducing emissions to improving recyclability. Big questions were asked: where is energy and environmental policy going? What will be the impact of those policies on defence and crisis management? What has been achieved so far? And how can the military and defence world comply with current policy, while enhancing its capabilities? The overall message that emerged was one of tempered hope. There was a clear consensus that the military has a role to play in this field, a role which goes beyond merely complying with legal obligations – though that in itself is a challenge to be tackled. Mr Jose Maria Figueres, the former President of Costa Rica, and now President of the Carbon War Room, addressed the conference on a videolink from Rio de Janeiro. Speaking with passion and detail, he reminded attendees of the big picture; the imperative incumbent on all of us to move to a low-carbon economy. Building on that message, the UK MoD’s Alexis Hammer led the way in proposing solutions, explaining the importance of framing action as producing concrete benefits in lives and money saved, rather than abstract common goods. Numerous speakers concurred, proffering statistics that included that every penny increase in the cost of fuel impoverishes the UK MoD by £13 million a year, while US convoys took one casualty for every 24 convoys they operated in Iraq. This consensus opened the way for a focused debate on the solutions available. David Muchow of Power Anywhere said of the technology for reducing fuel consumption: “It’s real, it’s here now”, and that was on display in the exhibitions by representatives from industry. Though all showed off innovative products, Belgian company ContenO, which produces mobile water purification & packaging systems, was singled out for a special award for their novel and promising offering. On Day 2, then, technical experts debated how to fulfill the military’s sustainability obligations. Drawing on a number of technical papers, they considered three major areas: systems and architecture; responsible management of munitions and hazardous substances; and improving efficiency and reducing consumption. Paul Johnson recounted his experience in constructing the experimental Power Forward Operating Base to test power-generation technologies, while the EDA’s Tarja Jaakkola offered a European perspective on complying with the Commission’s REACH directive in defence. Jean Perrot, representing EADS France, offered three principles that might summarize the conference. With long timescales, costly equipment and lives on the line, any military sustainability initiative must march to the beat of three words: anticipation, transparency and communication. In the coming months, the European Defence Agency will move forward with its Military Green initiative, helping build consensus and standards among European militaries in support of sustainability. As it does so, it will bear these precepts in mind.          	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/12-06-21/Military_Green_2012_Examining_sustainability_in_defence
EDA_NEWS_0918	2012-06-13	NEWS	Condolences on the death of Lt Gen Juan Luis Abad Cellini	 The European Defence Agency was saddened to hear of the death of Lieutenant General Juan Luis Abad Cellini. A highly respected officer of the Spanish Air Force, his sudden death came in the early hours of 12th June. At the time, he was the Officer Conducting Exercise (OCE) on EATT 2012, the EDA's air transport training, currently being held in Zaragoza. Our thoughts are with his family, friends and colleagues. The Distinguished Visitors Day (and accompanying Press Day) due to be held in Zaragoza tomorrow have accordingly been cancelled, in order to allow his colleagues to reflect on his achievements and to concentrate on the training task at hand.  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/06/13/Condolences_on_the_death_of_Lt_Gen_Juan_Luis_Abad_Cellini
EDA_NEWS_0919	2012-06-15	NEWS	As EATT ends, European air transport training makes great strides	 The EATT 2012 air transport training course ends today. This innovative flying event has brought numerous aircrews up to speed on the latest tactical airlift tactics, and cleared the way for still closer cooperation in this field. Despite the sad death of the Officer Commanding the Exercise, Lt Gen Juan Luis Abad Cellini, the exercise has been a great success. As it draws to a close, we spoke to Laurent Donnet. Laurent has been one the key movers at the European Defence Agency in creating this training course, and he offered some context on the future of European air transport cooperation. Hi Laurent. Tell us about your background. What do you do at the EDA, and what did you do before that? I am a Belgian Air Force lieutenant-colonel. For 16 years I flew F-16’s from wingman to squadron commander. In 2000 I was assigned for three years in the Deployable CAOC in Ramstein to work as ATO coordinator. In 2006 I went for Staff College in Paris. I have now been working at the EDA since April 2009 in the Manoeuver area, looking mainly at airlift issues. Since November 2010 I have also been the Manoeuver Assistant Manager. So tell us a little about EATT ’12. What was it, and who was involved? EATT is the first multinational air transport live flying training event to take place in Europe. This event focused on airlift-specific tactics, techniques and procedures and allowed their harmonisation leading to more interoperability between EU aircrews. The participants to EATT 2012 were the following: Spain as host nation with a C-130 and a CASA-295, Belgium with a C-130, Czech Republic with a CASA-295, France with a C-130, Germany with two C-160 and finally The Netherlands with a C-130. Austria, Bulgaria, Italy and Norway were all there as observer nation and the chances are high they will participate to EATT 2013. Why was this exercise conducted? What is the importance of this exercise, and why is it exciting? In 2011 19 pMS plus Norway signed up for the European Air Transport Fleet partnership that looks at improving airlift provision in the EU. In this framework an Ad Hoc Working Group Tactical Air Transport (AHWG TAT) was created to identify common issues, problems encountered and lessons learned in order to achieve a far-reaching level of interoperability between tactical airlift users in the area of training and operations. After only two years of work this AHWG can already conduct a first flying event, EATT, which is a pretty good achievement. This first flying event is extremely important to better work together in the future. In Europe airlift training is today a very much national issue and as operating together becomes more the rule than the exception, the need to train together becomes bigger every day. Moreover, this EATT will help develop a European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course (EAATTC) to be organised from 2014. The main value of such a training is to effectively fly the techniques, tactics and procedures that were developed and to get used to fly together. There is no substitute for being airborne. Nothing will beat that, even if you have the best and most advanced flight simulator in the world. How have the preparations been going? The entire preparation was done under the auspices of the AHWG. To be underlined is that this preparation, which was heavy, went well thanks to the huge involvement of the AHWG TAT chairman, LTC Pascal July from the Belgian air force but also thanks to the massive support of the European Air Transport Command (EATC). The Initial Planning Conference took place in Madrid in March 2011, the Main Planning Conference in September and the Final Planning Conference in March. These conferences were absolutely necessary to safeguard a good training event. Nevertheless, separate AHWG meetings were still needed between those main conferences. As you can see, the IPC took place more than one year before EATT. This is a minimum since so many things need to be discussed and arranged, especially for the first one. What are your hopes for the future of air transport training? My hope is that the EU nations will clearly see the benefit they can take out of this type of event and invest manpower and financial resources not only to improve EATT but also in future projects proposed by EATF. This being said, EATF is a Category A programme and thus ‘owned’ by the pMS. EATF provides a unique framework to tackle airlift issues and the AHWG Tactical Air Transport is the working group created by the pMS to make EU progress towards more airlift interoperability. This opportunity needs to be taken with both hands. What other cooperative initiatives are there in this field? For European air transport this is the only training initiative. A multinational advanced airlift tactics course exists in the US (and some pMS send crews to that course) but besides that, no other known initiative exists in the field of tactical air transport. That’s why it is so important for the European airlift community. EATT seems to be a great example of European defence cooperation. Do you agree? What is your general view of European defence cooperation? I fully agree with the statement that EATT, and I would even say EATF, is an example of European defence cooperation. However, to stay alive, pMS and all concerned organisations and agencies should continue to involve themselves even more in this airlift initiative. It is a very young project and lots of issues still need to be solved. A lot of work has still to be done and it is only with the involvement of all that we will make this an even bigger success. Concerning European defence cooperation I have mixed feelings. Even though pooling resources will save manpower, money and equipment on the medium term, on the short term, to launch those cooperations, most of the times more manpower and money is needed, and that is a challenge in these times. I think we have to invest more to pay less.   This Q&A is part of a series.

EDA_NEWS_0920	2012-06-08	NEWS	EDA and Cassidian Sign First Effective Procurement Methods Contract on Counter-IED Training	 Today the European Defence Agency’s Deputy Chief Executive, Adam Sowa, and Cassidian’s Sales Director Services, Heinz Unterreiner, met at the EDA to sign a 100.000 Euro training services contract. The contract covers instructors services and expertise in the area of Counter-IED, one of the top-ten priorities of the Capability Development Plan. This is for the upcoming European Guardian international exercise, taking place in Austria, which will train experts from European nations in manual neutralisation of improvised explosive devices – the most challenging aspect of bomb disposal. The training has been made possible through a Joint Procurement Initiative (JPI) of Luxembourg and Austria, following the newly introduced EDA Effective Procurement Methods (EPM) model, which enables Member States to procure off-the-shelf goods and services together through the EDA in a streamlined and accelerated way. On the occasion of the signature, Adam Sowa commented “The signature of this contract, constituting the successful delivery of one of our first EPM pilot cases, shows how Pooling & Sharing can be translated into real and tangible results. Two EDA Member States have joined forces to conduct a common exercise in a crucial area and opened it up for experts from all EU nations for free. For me this is effective cooperation at its best.” This was echoed by Heinz Unterreiner who underlined that a streamlining of processes is in the interest of both governments and industry, and in the interests of Cassidian.  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/06/08/EDA_and_Cassidian_Sign_First_Effective_Procurement_Methods_Contract_on_Counter-IED_Training
EDA_NEWS_0921	2012-05-31	NEWS	EDA launches European air transport training	 From 4th to 15th of June, the first European Air Transport Training event (EATT2012) will take place in Zaragoza, Spain. Bringing together tactical air transport assets from six states, the course has been organized by the European Defence Agency (EDA), with the vital support of the European Air Transport Command, and is hosted by the Spanish Air Force. The flying event is part of the EDA’s ongoing Pooling and Sharing initiative, through which Member States cooperate to increase defence capabilities and save money. It signals important progress on the EDA’s European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) initiative and its work on Pilot Training, as required by the Agency Steering Board in November 2011. EATT2012 As part of the EDA’s work to build a culture of increased cooperation among participating Member States and aiming at increasing interoperability in air transport area, the flying event will allow crews to train and qualify together in specific airlift disciplines. In particular, EATT will consolidate skills in: advanced mission planning; cargo and personnel airdrops; tactical navigation with training of trainers and threat reactions; tactical Air-Land Operations including tactical recoveries, substandard field operations (assault landings), engines running on and offloads and combat offloads; short field landings; formation flying; and night operations. Six of the EDA’s Member States are participating in this flying event: Belgium (1 C-130 with 2 crews); Czech Republic (1 CASA-295 with 2 crews); France (1 C-130 with 2 crews); Germany (2 C-160 with 2 crews); The Netherlands (1 C-130 with 2 crews); Spain (1 C-130 and 1 CASA-295 with 4 crews). EDA Assistant Manager Laurent Donnet explained, “The main value of such a training is to effectively fly the techniques, tactics and procedures that were developed and to get used to flying together. There is no substitute for being airborne. Nothing will beat that, even if you have the best and most advanced flight simulator in the world.” Context: European Air Transport With budgets under pressure and joint operations more and more common, the need for multinational air transport training has become paramount. It was for this reason that the EDA Steering Board mandated the Agency to take on pilot training as an area of Pooling & Sharing. A major step towards more combined training as well as harmonization of airlift procedures and processes in Europe was the creation of the Ad Hoc Working Group Tactical Air Transport (AHWG TAT) within the framework of the European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) partnership, an initiative that became a EDA Category A Programme signed so far by 19 participating Member States plus Norway. The AHWG TAT deals with operations and training issues, as well as conducting a yearly European Air Transport Symposium. and conducts a yearly European Air Transport Symposium. In addition, the AHWG TAT, is organizing a second EATT in 2013. With observers from many Member States attending, EATT 2013 is expected to be an even more significant event. All this work will lead to the establishment of a permanent European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course (EAATTC) in 2014, modelled on the US course that has operated with great success since 1984. EDA Assistant Manager Laurent Donnet explained that EATT 2012 is part of a larger effort: “pMS and all concerned organisations and agencies should continue to involve themselves even more in this airlift initiative. A lot of work has still to be done and it is only with the involvement of all that we will make this an even bigger success.” Context: Aerial Pooling & Sharing Indeed, defence cooperation initiatives are continuing across the aerial arena. Under the heading of the Agency’s work on Pilot Training, in addition to the air transport initiatives, the Agency is working with pMS to develop an Air Crew Military Licencing system across Europe, using the already delivered EDA analysis of basic helicopter flying training as the start point. This forms part of an extensive and highly successful programme of rotary wing training activity. This year 9 pMS will send crews to tactics simulator courses in the UK and there will be 2 multinational helicopter live-flying exercises in Portugal in July and Belgium in September, involving 10 pMS and over 60 helicopters. All of these signal the excellent progress made by the EDA in the field of European defence cooperation. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/05/31/EDA_launches_European_air_transport_training

EDA_NEWS_0923	2012-03-16	NEWS	Press release - Signing of EDA-Switzerland Framework for Cooperation	 EDA Chief Executive, Claude-France Arnould, welcomed today Ambassador Jacques de Watteville to sign a Framework for Cooperation between the European Defence Agency (EDA) and the Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports (DDPS) of the Swiss Confederation. The conclusion of the Framework for Cooperation follows a negotiation mandate provided to the Head of the Agency, Baroness Catherine Ashton, by the EDA Steering Board. The EU Council approved the Framework for Cooperation in November 2011. The Framework for Cooperation formalizes the relationship between EDA and Switzerland, thereby enabling Swiss participation in EDA’s projects and programmes. The Framework for Cooperation will allow for pragmatic joint activities in R&T and armaments projects and programmes. Cooperative areas remain to be further defined, but areas such as unmanned aerial systems, information acquisition and processing, cyber security, protection against improvised explosive devices and vehicle protection are examples of potential cooperative areas. At the signature ceremony, Ambassador de Watteville said “Switzerland is a close partner of the European Union. The signing of the cooperation framework today is proof of this. The closer cooperation in the field of armament will be of benefit for both the EU and Switzerland.” “This signature is an extremely welcome development for the Agency and European cooperation. Switzerland’s high technological know-how and long-standing cooperation with EU Member States provide an excellent foundation for our common efforts. The Framework we have signed focuses on Research & Technology and armaments cooperation. In both areas, European cooperation is a necessity to sustain and develop the capabilities our armed forces need. It is a must to ensure our global competitive edge”, said Ms. Arnould. “I congratulate our new partner, Switzerland. We are looking forward to further elaborating our joint efforts in the future, securing a mutually constructive and rewarding relationship”, she added. Background The European Defence Agency was established under a Joint Action of the Council of Ministers of 12 July, 2004, “to support the Member States and the Council in their effort to improve European defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the European Security and Defence Policy as it stands now and develops in the future”. For the purpose of fulfilling its mission – to improve EU’s defence capabilities for the Common Security and Defence Policy - the Agency may enter into administrative arrangements with third States, organizations and entities. Such arrangements are a means to support the Agency’s work by establishing mutually beneficial and practical cooperation, including participation in EDA’s projects and programmes. All administrative arrangements are approved by the EU Council. The Head of the Agency is responsible for negotiating these arrangements in accordance with directives given by the EDA Steering Board. EDA has signed an administrative arrangement with Norway (in 2006) and with the European Space Agency (in 2011).	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/03/16/Press_release_-_Signing_of_EDA-Switzerland_Framework_for_Cooperation
EDA_NEWS_0924	2012-04-18	NEWS	Political resolution drives pooling & sharing	 On 22nd March 2012, European defence ministers met in Brussels, and offered renewed political momentum on defence cooperation. They endorsed the European Defence Agency’s work so far, and mandated it to continue work in new areas. Air-to-Air Refueling has been identified as a vital capability gap for European forces, a fact that was brought home by the Libya campaign. In this field, ministers took action, signing a Political Declaration indicating that Pooling & Sharing efforts in Air-to-Air Refueling should get underway, facilitated by the European Defence Agency. The EDA is consequently working on potential solutions, including a Strategic Air Command-model. The aim is to increase tanker capacity by 2020 in a manner that delivers flexibility, cost-effectiveness, greater interoperability and operational effect. It is hoped that further economies may be found through rationalization and efficient basing arrangements. Ultimately, these capabilities would be available for EU, NATO or other operations by Member States. Progress was also made on the development of a cooperative project to provide field hospitals. Thirteen ministers signed a Declaration of Intent to establish Multinational Modular Medical Units. Based on an vision initiated by Italy, this project is already ahead of schedule. This year, work gets under way on standardization, and by 2014 a deployable capability should be ready for use. Another key decision was the approval of two new projects. The first, Go Green, looks for innovative ways to reduce the use of fossil fuels, potentially by employing solar panels. This will save money, as well as helping the environment and reducing dependence on finite energy resources. The second is the launch of the EU Battle Group Logistic Services Pilot Case. These cooperative pilot projects will help Member States save money and increase capabilities.   In the longer term, there was also a ministerial-level consensus that further progress is required on harmonizing regulation, and the Steering Board called for further discussion of the role of financial incentives and opportunities to reinvest all or part of the savings realized through Pooling & Sharing initiatives. Concrete results were agreed in the research field, with the approval of the Second Joint Investment Programme on Innovative Concepts and Emerging Technologies, a two year project with an expected budget of €10m. Similarly, ministers formally approved the Programme Arrangement of the Research & Technology Joint Investment Programme on CBRN Protection, which develops CBRN protective measures in close coordination with the European Commission and European Space Agency, governed by the European Framework Cooperation. Meanwhile, ministers recognized and complimented the EDA’s recent work in Pooling & Sharing, with especial reference to the European SATCOM Procurement Cell, helicopter training and maritime surveillance. Perhaps the greatest endorsement, though, lies in their calls for the EDA to explore still further areas of defence cooperation. The EDA will build on these concrete results in the coming months, and continue to work with Member States for closer defence cooperation in Europe.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/04/18/Political_resolution_drives_pooling_sharing

EDA_NEWS_0926	2012-02-28	NEWS	Joint Procurement Initiative on Training Services: Counter-IED Training European Guardian becomes an Effective Procurement Methods Pilot Case	 The European Defence Agency’s new Effective Procurement Methods work strand, launched in July 2011 to complement the Pooling & Sharing initiative, is about identifying existing common (off-the-shelf) demand of groups of Member States and translating such demand into joint procurement. Pooling and thus consolidating demand does not only respond to a constant call from European Defence Industries but, in times of austerity and declining defence budgets, has also become almost a necessity to further sustain our Armed Forces. As regards economies of scale and shared administrative costs, previous cooperative procurement cases show savings of 20% to up to 50%. From the very beginning, the EPM work strand has followed a twin track approach to develop a generic, slim and flexible concept and to prove it in parallel through actual pilot cases. Our research has revealed the identifying existing common demand is more likely in specific areas of defence procurement which stretch from third party logistics and basic military equipment to ammunition and training services. So it does not come as a surprise that the first pilot cases have been established in exactly these fields. In this specific case, two countries have joined forces to conduct the common counter-IED training exercise European Guardian. Whereas Luxembourg provides the funds to contract the training services, Austria offers the respective training site. As European Guardian will be open to experts from all Member States, the savings of this Joint Procurement Initiative, which has been established through an EDA Ad hoc project endorsed by the Steering Board end of last week in a silence procedure, is even more pertinent.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/02/28/Joint_Procurement_Initiative_on_Training_Services_Counter-IED_Training_European_Guardian_becomes_an_Effective_Procurement_Methods_Pilot_Case
EDA_NEWS_0927	2012-01-18	NEWS	On the way to EDA’s Annual Conference: Defence Market: Going Global – an Opportunity and a Necessity?	 A globally competitive European defence industry is vital to ensure that Europe is able to respond with autonomy to today’s and tomorrow’s security and defence challenges. At a time of increasingly constrained defence budgets in Europe and the US, European (and US) defence companies have a choice of shrinking in line with their domestic defence budgets or seeking greater access to global markets to survive and perhaps thrive in a time of austerity. Consequently, if Europe is to retain a robust Defence Technological Industrial Base we have to work towards maximising the global competitiveness of its industry. This and associated issue of reciprocal market access are key topics in the debate on defence at a time of financial challenge. The EDA Annual Conference 2012 will bring together some of Europe’s leading defence experts to examine these very issues. Among its many advantages defence export success can help provide resources for continued investment in the critical defence research and development that determines future competitiveness and industry’s ability to produce the leading edge defence equipment necessary to capture military sales. An unfortunate consequence of defence budget cuts in Member States has been reductions in government defence R&D. The R&D situation looks bleak and this is at a time when Europe’s significant R&D gap with the US is expanding and R&D investment among competitors is growing. While exports often can only be achieved at the cost of technology transfer and licensed production – with the associated risk of losing industrial capabilities, skills and technologies, to the detriment of the long term heath of Europe’s Defence Industrial Base (EDTIB) - they can also foster important partnerships and facilitate cooperation that can stimulate technological advancement and innovation. They also help spread some the high overhead costs often associated with defence procurement and provide economies of scale reducing the procurement cost for the domestic European customer. Last year marked the fifth anniversary of the launch of the Intergovernmental Regime on Defence Procurement, a landmark agreement by EU governments towards opening up to competition some of the most sensitive areas of Europe’s defence market. The regime has pioneered a gradual transition from closed and fragmented national markets to a more open, transparent and competitive marketplace where value for money is the key procurement priority. Together with the European Commission’s new defence directives on procurement and intra-Community Transfers real progress has been made towards the creation of an internationally competitive European defence equipment market. These are laudable developments but not enough – by themselves – to ensure the future of Europe’s defence industry. If the foreseeable growth in defence markets is, as it seems, to be found outside Europe then industry has to tap into these markets to stay competitive, innovative, and healthy. Better access to the global marketplace therefore has become crucial. At present, it is often hampered by various restrictions and obstacles embedded in national laws, rules, policies and practices as well as export control systems. Some of the challenges are just too great for industry to handle on their own. No serious attention has yet been paid to this issue. Important questions must be addressed on how governments and institutions can play a constructive role in enhancing European defence industries competitiveness and innovative advantage in the global defence market and facilitating market access through concrete measures to limit barriers and inherent obstacles to defence trade. Collectively governments, institutions and industry must develop adequate policies and strategies that would address such issues as technology transfer requirements, local content and work share rules, offsets and juste retour and foreign investment policies. One thing is certain fortress Europe policies and protectionism will not save Europe’s defence industrial base, this is simply a dead end. Europe’s defence industries future depends on looking outward and embracing the challenge of globalisation. The EDA Annual conference will be a first step towards providing solutions on the way forward. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/01/18/On_the_way_to_EDA_s_Annual_Conference_Defence_Market_Going_Global_%E2%80%93_an_Opportunity_and_a_Necessity
EDA_NEWS_0928	2012-01-24	NEWS	Annual Conference: The European Defence Technological and Industrial Base – what is strategic for the future?	 Could the financial crisis be the final nail in the coffin for Europe retaining a widely-capable defence industry? Opinions vary on the damage likely to be inflicted by the latest round of defence cuts but it is clear it that they will make life even more difficult for European industry. EDA’s annual conference hopes to show that there are ways Europe’s industry can survive and prosper in austerity. The first thing to say is that the European Defence Technology and Industrial Base (EDTIB) is not a statistical fact – it is almost impossible to comprehensively track developments, once you go beyond the prime contractors, as there is no clear data on the industry; a gap that the Agency is working to correct. So it is difficult to make categorical judgements. The suspicion is that the bigger prime contractors, with their wide portfolios will manage better than the smaller supply chain specialists but challenging times are ahead for all. There are also likely to be differences by sector reflecting the different market conditions in the Air, Land, Sea and Space domains. It used to be said that unlike most other industries, the defence business was different, because it depended critically on national governments in their role as regulators, customers and investors. Yet, in Europe at least, this position is changing with the European Commission increasing its regulatory role following its “defence procurement directive” and national governments’ position as dominant customers and investors often under challenge as budget cuts bite, export markets become increasingly important and national policies on the ownership and control of defence assets allow significant third party investment. The defence industry in many ways is not that different from other markets. It responds to investment. Europe’s defence industry is increasingly service oriented as design, development and production work declines. The question is how far this trend should go; for example what design capabilities should Europe retain and which can it allow to disappear? And how do you ensure the key skills required for future programmes are maintained? Should Europe care about the future of Defence Technology and Industrial Base? Liberal market economists might say no. However, the EDTIB possesses specialist skills, processes, know-how and facilities which are not replicated in the wider commercial economy and not easily reconstituted if lost. If you allow such unique industrial capabilities to wither away you are either consciously disarming (some commentators have already warned of a trend towards demilitarisation in Europe) or committing yourself to long term dependency on specialist skills and facilities outside Europe with the inevitable consequences for autonomy of action. So a robust and competent EDTIB underpins the credibility of Europe’s Common Security and Defence Policy. Allowing the indigenous industrial capability to produce sophisticated defence equipment to erode makes no sense if your ambition is for Europe to play a greater role in world affairs. In fact the contrary is necessary: you must protect what is important by investing in the key industrial capabilities needed for the future. The EDTIB is also a valuable economic asset providing hundreds of thousands of high quality jobs across Europe. With many EU economies on the brink of recession it is worth recalling the full economic value of defence expenditure. There are considerable spill-over benefits to the wider commercial economy from high tech defence investment. This has been demonstrated across all the sectors but most clearly on aerospace. Europe’s problem is that demand, supply and investment are all fragmented. Recognition that a fully adequate DTIB is no longer sustainable on a strictly national basis is widespread but translating this understanding into changed practice is not that straightforward. Europeans need to achieve consolidation on both sides of the market aligning and combining various needs in shared equipment requirements and meeting them from an increasingly integrated EDTIB supported by a rational rather than a fragment approach to R&D investment. Yet such a break from the past requires courage and strong political will if all the obstacles are to be overcome. There is clearly a significant cost associated with Europeans not co-operating on defence and the Agency has launched work to better define this “cost”, part of which relates to industry, and such empirical data will be important in making the case for a more integrated European approach. The EDA Conference will help frame the debate on the prospects for Europe’s defence industries. Where defence equipment is manufactured, where the skills and know-how to maintain and support defence systems is retained matters. It is an important issue with ramifications for Europe’s future role in the world and one we need to get right.

EDA_NEWS_0929	2012-01-25	NEWS	EU and US government Defence spending	 In 2010 the governments of the 26 EDA pMS spent a total of €194 billion on defence. The US spent the equivalent of €520 billion (or $689 billion). Between 2006 and 2008 the aggregated defence expenditure of the 26 EDA pMS has been about half that of the US. In the years 2009 and 2010 this difference increased. While the EU aggregated defence expenditure decreased from €201 billion in 2008 to €194 billion in 2010, US expenditure increased from €416 billion ($612 billion) to €520 billion in the same period.  Photoxpress.com Comparing defence spending with other macroeconomic data, in 2010 US defence expenditure represented 4.8% of GDP and 11.2% of overall government expenditure. In the EU these ratios were, respectively, 1.6% and 3.2%. As for defence expenditure in relation to the total population, the US spent €1 676 ($2 222) per capita in 2010, while the EU spent on average €390. In terms of allocation of the defence budget there remain significant differences between the EU and the US. Between 2006 and 2010, EU pMS spent half of their aggregated defence budget on personnel (civilian and military staff). In the US, personnel costs represented slightly less than one third of total defence spending during the same period. Operation and Maintenance costs of EDA pMS were between 22% and 23% of total defence expenditure for the period 2006 to 2010. In the US this percentage was closer to 30%. Another important component of the defence budget is defence Investment (Equipment procurement and R&D/R&T). In the EU the proportion of the budget dedicated to investment has always been lower than in the US (respectively 20% and 30%). However, it increased from 19% in 2006 to 22% in 2010: from €39 billion in 2006 to €43 billion in 2010. As for R&D expenditure the US spends more both in absolute terms and as a proportion of defence expenditure. In 2010 EU governments spent in total €9 billion on defence R&D (4.4% of defence expenditure). For the US these values were, respectively, €58 billion ($77 billion) and 11.2% (this percentage has however decreased from the 13.2% spent in 2006). Turning to defence personnel, in 2006 total defence staff was higher in the EU than in the US (2.4 million against 2.1 million). Between 2006 and 2010, the number of staff working in defence decreased by 17% in the EU and in the US it increased by 6%. As a result in the past two years (2009 and 2010) the relative position changed and total personnel in the US exceeded the number of personnel in the EU (2.2 million and 2.0 million respectively in 2010). Military personnel represents 80% of total personnel in the EU while in the US the proportion is 66% (these proportions have remained constant for the period 2006 to 2010). In terms of absolute figures, the US has twice as many civilian defence staff as the EU (778 thousand and 390 thousand), whereas the EU has more military staff than the US (1.6 million in the EU against 1.4 million in the US). In terms of deployed personnel, the US deployed on average almost 200 000 troops. This represents 14% of military personnel. The EU deployed 66 000 troops, 4% of the total military personnel. Note: The EU figures refer to the total for all 26 EDA pMS (all EU Member States except Denmark) and the data is provided directly by the pMS. Information for the US comes from official US Government publications. All the figures refer to government spending and government personnel.

EDA_NEWS_0930	2012-03-07	NEWS	Roadmap and Implementation Plan on Precision Guided Ammunition	 Due to the nature of modern warfare, the demand for precision has grown, both to increase the effect against the opponent and to avoid casualties amongst friendly forces and non-combatant third parties, reducing collateral damages and providing European soldiers with better tools to fulfill their missions. Precision Guided Ammunition (PGA) is tailored to achieve precision effects. For this reason it is identified as an area of strategic importance both from the military capabilities perspective as well as from technological and industrial point of view. The current situation shows that the European Capability to provide Precision Guided Ammunition (PGA) needs to be preserved and further developed to fulfill future needs and to avoid dependencies on non-European sources for critical skills and technologies. To assure future military operations, the supply of European PGA must be secured. In December 2010, EDA signed a contract for a one year study, to provide a step by step plan to develop a more robust competitive ammunition industry, able to provide the member states with the PGA capability required in the time frame of 2020. Main objective of the study was to provide a Roadmap and Implementation Plan on Precision Guided Ammunition, capturing military requirements and analyzing the capability of the European industry to develop and produce PGAs able to meet Member States’ requirements. Methodology The study-contractor (an industry team lead by BAE Systems and including Diehl BGT Defence, EXPAL Systems, MBDA, Nexter Munitions, OTO Melara, Rheinmetall Defence, SAGEM and TDA Armements SAS) conducted the study and reported to EDA and its Member States’ representatives coming from various fields of expertise (capability development, Research & Technology, procurement, etc.) Input was collected from companies all around Europe, including primes and major as well as small subcontractors in the ammunition area, but also institutes and academia’s Sub Matter Experts. The starting points of the study were some studies analyzing capability needs, (including EDA’s Capability Development Plan), EU/EDA’s Capability ‘Lessons learned’ documents, and also relevant LoI and NATO/NIAG studies. This was complemented with Member States expert’s views, collected through questionnaires and workshops. The complete Precision Fire Support Engagement process has been evaluated by use of 12 scenarios, derived from previous land studies and pMS’ requirements. Areas such as engagement cycles, fire support organizations and key requirements have been studied. The results were presented to the Member States and other stakeholders for review, feedback and further comments either during workshops or by sending out completed documents. The State of Play of the European industry was evaluated in a similar way. A significant amount of data about existing and planned products, capabilities and resources for development and testing and crucial technologies for precision guided munitions in Europe was collected from experts in main suppliers and subcontractors, academia, institutes and Ministries of Defence. Preliminary results were discussed with focused expert groups, such as the European Network of National Safety Authorities on Ammunition (ENNSA) and EDA’s group on the Defence Test & Evaluation Base. After collecting data on Future Capability needs in Europe and about the industrial State of Play in PGAs, a deep gap analysis was performed. The objective was to make an assessment of the European industry concerning its ability to develop and produce Precision Guided Ammunition, using European and ITAR-free components and to identify potential gaps to perform against future national and EU scenarios. The analysis assessed existing or potential obstacles and other factors, such as Technology Gaps, Economic Shortfalls or Non-EU Dependencies. Conclusions from this analysis fed the next phase of the project that consisted in the design of the Roadmap and Implementation Plan of Actions - which was the final delivery of the Study. Key Conclusions At the end of the Study some clear key conclusions can be derived: Capabilities Analysis Member States have a clear need for Precision Guided Ammunition. The study identified similarities but also differences amongst Member States requirements concerning for example the expected precision, dispersion, etc. The requirements do not differ in essential parameters between artillery, mortar or naval support areas, except for range capability of the projectile. Different kinds of communication tools to permit additional functionality, such as mission abort, or to change the terminal effect, are considered important. Certain levels of conformity in requirements among Member States have been identified. A harmonization of these requirements (fully or in part) would be preferred to achieve both improved interoperability and increased Security of Supply. The latter requirement in particular may support the creation of a new business model across Europe. State of Play Analysis The data collection also gave a good view of the Ammunition industrial base in Europe. Few delivered PGA products and on-going development programs were identified within the EU. However, sufficient capabilities exist (dispersed around various countries) for development, qualification and manufacturing of Precision Guided Ammunition and would create a solid base for a secured chain of supply for future PGA military requirements. The bigger part of the main technology or capability base is ITAR-Free, but on critical areas dependencies is an existing (or potential) threat for Europe’s capacity on PGAs in the future. GPS receivers were the most frequently mentioned ITAR component; it was noted that several Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers are available in Europe. However, in other critical areas like rare earth materials or production of electronics, dependencies and cost issues were identified. Some of these areas are shared with other parts of civilian and defence industry and a joint solution would be preferred. Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products might be introduced to PGA military solutions on component level. Standards for qualification and testing and the need of appropriate test facilities for PGAs were especially evaluated and discussed with both pMS and specialised EDA’s groups of Member States experts. This area is considered to be very demanding both in terms of costs as well as provision of sufficient safety areas during tests. Gap Analysis The gaps that have been identified in the areas of technologies, funding and other resources can be sorted in three main groups. The first group which is considered to become critical is the one of components, materials and technologies not existing in Europe. This group would need an early investment and additional sources in Europe need to be established to secure the European sovereign supply of military components. The second group is technology gaps where there are few resources or little knowledge available in Europe. Products may be world-class but with only one source, or others may not be purchased for development programs very often, with the additional risk that those resources (or that knowledge) may disappear if not exercised or supported. A number of components and products were identified in this group. The last group includes the capabilities that are currently available in Europe but about which there is a perceived real risk of total loss of that capability if the resource is not exercised in any development programmes. Mapped safety and qualification standards have been analysed. Existing standards are not considered to be sufficient for new versions of PGA. Given the expected time consuming process to achieve a set of European standardized test requirements, it is recommended that activities should commence very soon to get agreements in place in the next five years by leveraging on the ENNSA group. The culture of the low-quantity missile testing regime may need to influence the traditional thinking about ammunition thinking, based on high numbers of live firing. European facilities and proving grounds have been assessed and analysed. For military systems, a lot of testing and qualification procedures are normally required, which is time-consuming and very expensive - especially in the Precision Guided Ammunition area - and activities to preserve existing resources are needed. Some proposals regarding test facilities are included in the study-results for future considerations. In addition, it is clear that development and qualification costs can only be reduced by collaboration and sharing of international test facilities. Economic gap analysis was done according to the ability to deliver a PGA capability in within the upcoming decade. The impact of the upcoming economic crisis cannot be clearly seen. Other rationales such as political priorities, ongoing military contracts and personal expenditures will have influence on Defence spending. Improvement of coordination between countries will support cost reduction efforts, both on short and long-terms. Meanwhile, the funding of relevant technologies by non-European countries, is increasing. The need for economic cooperation between European Ministries of Defence is seen to be the most important factor in achieving a European PGA capability and the only real possibility. Roadmap and Implementation plan The study has identified and described five generic PGA concepts which cover the full potential of precision enhancement. These concepts are evaluated both against general requirements, associated technologies knowledge base and the need for facilities. Priority measures to close identified gaps in the supply chain have been identified and prioritised. Some identified areas, such as material dependencies, are shared with a wider community and joint solutions are preferred. The major result of the study is the Roadmap and Implementation Plan that covers a ten years cycle of proposed activities. It includes the foundation of a European PGA forum, discussions about European production of identified critical components and, the definition of a joint European PGA program. A full list of actions is proposed, with an assessment based on priority, risk and cost. Way ahead Member States are currently assessing the study-results to evaluate and undertake necessary actions on the implementation of the Roadmap. A timely start of the implementation process is an imperative for maintaining the European option for a capability at the required moment. The European Precision Guided Ammunition Forum is an effective instrument to ignite the process. EDA will present the study results to the proper Member States’ experts working groups and to relevant fora, to better assess the results and to better assist Member States’ decision making process. In that frame, specialised workshops are also planned with the participation of industry and academia/technology institutes. *By Pieter Taal, EDA’s Industry & Market Assistant Director, and Vassilis Tsiamis, Senior Officer Defence Industry, Industry and Market Directorate	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/12-03-07/Roadmap_and_Implementation_Plan_on_Precision_Guided_Ammunition
EDA_NEWS_0931	2011-11-24	NEWS	Refocusing defence: European perspective on defence cooperation in a time of financial challenge	 EU Member States have acknowledged that in today’s climate of austerity, enhanced defence cooperation, particularly through the pooling & sharing of assets and capabilities, is more than ever necessary to retain effective military capabilities. Such an approach will allow our military to increase interoperability and standardization, generate savings, and share the costs of developing and procuring high-technology defence equipment. While there will be challenges, there is no viable alternative. It will require a fundamental change in how Europeans address defence cooperation if we are to yield anything other than marginal improvements and ad hoc results.   In this context, the European Defence Agency will hold a high level conference on 31 January 2012, to generate new thinking and the political momentum necessary for refocusing defence cooperation. The conference is expected to mark a major advance in European thinking on such issues as models for enhanced defence collaboration, the strategic priorities for the defence technological and industrial base, as well as measures to increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the defence marketplace. It will be used as a sounding board for concrete proposals for more effective use of defence resources, which will be presented to the Defence Ministers when they next meet in the Agency’s Steering Board, in spring 2012. An audience of around 250 senior decision makers from Ministries of Defence, Ministries of Foreign Affairs, the EU Member States’ Armed Forces, NATO and defence industry is expected.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2011/11/24/Refocusing_defence_European_perspective_on_defence_cooperation_in_a_time_of_financial_challenge
EDA_NEWS_0932	2011-12-20	NEWS	Effective defence collaboration – a business case for Europe	   The financial crisis will continue to have a significant impact on European military capabilities. This is one of the important topics which will be addressed at EDA’s annual conference on 31 January 2012. As EDA data shows, Europe’s defence expenditure has been declining steadily since 2005. The current crisis has made matters worse. Yet Europe collectively still spends around 200bn Euros per year. The challenge is for Member States to invest in a more efficient way so that Europe can retain and sustain the effective military capabilities it needs to play its role in the world. Given the budgetary pressures it would be all too easy to conclude that individually Member States have no option but to cut military capabilities. But difficult times call for imaginative policies and new approaches. The Pooling and Sharing concept provides Defence Ministries with an opportunity to “prosper” collectively rather than “decline” individually. It needs to be exploited to the full. Defence Ministers have recognised that it is better to have excellent collective capabilities than unsustainable or unattainable national ones. Since the informal EU Defence Ministerial at Ghent in 2010 there has been a strong political will to pool and share capabilities more systematically. This powerful political dynamic for progress was evident in last month’s EDA Ministerial Board which saw overwhelming support for EDA's activities in support of Member States. But the actual practice of pooling and sharing does not occur overnight. It needs hard work to get projects started. The move from a national approach to a collaborative one – such as pooling and sharing - is to a large extent about a change of culture. Member States need to consider whether they can live with giving up national control and accept a degree of interdependence. These are challenging notions, particularly in the area of defence, where sovereignty often plays an important part in national decision-making. And there are also important practical aspects related to sharing military capabilities: a likeminded partner (or partners) needs to be identified; and that “like-mindedness” must have a very good chance of being sustained in the long term and at moments of crisis and perhaps in extremis war. That is why much of pooling and sharing in the past has been regional - linking countries with the same geopolitical outlook. Member States with strong pre-existing patterns of co-operation and a largely common outlook: Nordic Defence cooperation being an excellent example. There is a need to prioritise the work and to focus on those projects that will have the biggest impact - which will retain or deliver key military capabilities that are otherwise at risk, or which save significant sums of money. The first targets should be those activities which will deliver the most added value. Delivering major Pooling and Sharing projects will be important but of equal if not greater long term value is the need for a more sustainable, structured approach to multinational cooperation. There is a requirement to develop new, more efficient ways of doing collaborative business if Europe wants to sustain and develop its defence capabilities in this period of financial austerity given that these financial difficulties could well last for some time. It is for Member States to decide whether and, if so, with whom they pool and share. But EDA can help them work more effectively: amongst other things by acting as a support hub, identifying best practice and the key lessons learnt from previous programmes, including important factors such as getting the business case right and understanding the industrial perspective. Pooling and sharing is not always straightforward. Nor is it risk-free. Ministers have seen the enormous potential to unlock significant financial and military benefits - EDA's task is to help Member States deliver them. That will require imagination, innovation, risk-taking and hard work. Yet given the budget situation, is there an alternative? Without transformation Europe risks having hollow forces: undermining the future effectiveness of national capabilities and Member States’ ability to contribute to crisis management. The bottom line is that Europe’s role in the world can only be sustained through better cooperation. EDA’s Conference will be an important step in this direction.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/11-12-20/Effective_defence_collaboration_%E2%80%93_a_business_case_for_Europe

It is a well-established and recognized exercise. Data are always from the previous year, because they are the most reliable. Analysis has been conducted over period 2006-2010. The data given now to the media are only collective figures. It should be noted that there are big differences between individual Member States. National breakdown data will be provided by mid-January after the standard consultation process has taken place asking for authorisation (the data are owned by the pMS; EDA is only the custodian of the data). KEY FINDINGS In 2010, total defence spending by EDA 26 pMS remained constant at EUR 194 billion. This represents 1.6% of total GDP or 3.2% of Total Government Expenditure. However, if inflation is taken into account, we can see that defence spending in real terms decreased not only in 2010 but it has been decreasing since 2006. Personnel-related expenditure represents 50% of total defence expenditure. The second biggest component of defence spend is Operation and Maintenance with a share of 23% amounting to EUR 44 billion, followed by Investment which takes up almost EUR 43 billion or a share of 22%, the highest since 2006 both in absolute value and share of total defence budget. Analysing now the different Investment components, in 2010 equipment procurement (which represents 80% of total Investment) increased by 5.5% reaching EUR 34 billion. Research and Technology (R&T, including basic research, applied research and technology demonstration, leaving out expenditure for demonstration) it continues in a decreasing trend, amounting in 2010 to about EUR 2 billion. Looking at European Collaboration, in 2010 collaborative equipment procurement increased for the fourth consecutive year and is now more than EUR 7.5 billion. This represents 22% of the total defence equipment procurement, the same as in 2009 but still the highest share since 2006. As for European Collaboration in R&T, it decreased for the second year being now at its lowest value since 2006, EUR 246 million and the lowest share of total R&T expenditure since 2007, 11.8%. As for personnel, in 2010 there was a reduction, continuing an already 4 year trend. Military staff, which represents 80% of total defence staff decreased by almost 3% to 1.62 million. Civilian staff decreased by more than 8% and went below 390 thousand. Despite this decrease in personnel numbers, after a drop of EUR 9 billion in 2009, the total personnel expenditure increased marginally in 2010 from EUR 98.4 billion to EUR 98.7 billion. Turning now to deployed operations outside the EU territory, similar to what happened in 2009, in 2010 the average number of troops deployed throughout the year decreased (from 68 to 66 thousand) and was now at its lowest value since 2006. However, the costs with the deployment of troops increased in 2010 for the fourth consecutive year reaching EUR 10 billion (or 5% of total defence expenditure). If we look at the operation costs per military deployed we see that they have been steadily increasing and the 157 thousand euros of 2010 represent almost the double as the value in 2006. Note: The figures refer to the total for all EDA 26 pMS and if not otherwise stated, they are nominal. The Defence Data booklet is available here.

EDA_NEWS_0934	2012-01-06	NEWS	Pooling of Demand and Effective Procurement Methods – Common Off-the-Shelf Procurement: a new EDA Pooling & Sharing Initiative	 Why pooling of demand? At the recent Steering Board of the European Defence Agency (EDA) on 30 November 2011, European Ministers of Defence had an intense discussion on Pooling & Sharing, an EU flagship initiative aiming at increasing further multinational cooperation among European Union Member States. Pooling & Sharing can take various forms, like common training, common logistic support solutions or combining transport capacities, but all have one thing in common: the aim to use decreasing resources in a more efficient and effective way through collaboration and prevention of redundancies. It goes without saying that procurement is an area very well-suited to the increase in the effectiveness of military spending. This is also reflected in the EDA’s mandate as laid down in Art 45 of the Treaty on European Union which tasks the Agency, among other things, to promote the adoption of effective procurement methods as well as to contribute to identifying and, if necessary, implementing any useful measure for strengthening the technological and industrial base of the defence sector and for improving the effectiveness of military expenditure. Accordingly, the Ministers of Defence, during the previous Steering Board in May this year, called upon the EDA to explore new opportunities for more effective procurement methods through developing practical and innovative ways for more cooperative action, including common military and commercial off-the-shelf procurement and to develop guidelines and best practices facilitating bi- and multilateral collaborative procurement. In the current economic climate, implementing these tasks becomes even more pressing to ensure the continuous support of our Armed Forces by getting best value for money at the same time. In some instances and for some EU Member States pooling demand could actually be the only way to grant access to a specific capability. Pooling demand should automatically lead to more consolidation and more standardisation on the buyers’ side of the European Defence Equipment Market, which in turn should contribute to an improvement of interoperability and permit industries to attain bigger production lots with better planning, again reducing unit cost and therefore prices. By the same token, pooled and consolidated demand could be an incentive for the defence industries of EU countries to intensify their cross-border cooperation and consolidation. Identifying existing common demand. Now it is up to the EDA to translate this strategic mandate into concrete action, and we are doing it through a newly introduced work strand called Effective Procurement Methods (EPM). In principle, EPM can cover all areas of procurement, including procurement of R&T services, development programmes and off-the-shelf procurement of the entire range of defence equipment, materiel and services. However, given the fact that there are already processes in place to cover specifically co-operative R&T and development programmes, for the time being, we focus with this new initiative on common off-the-shelf procurement. This will also help us to circumvent the “trouble zones” of defence cooperation – which is often the common development phase – and to make the benefits for Member States more evident. As this initiative at this time is not about developing or generating common demand, the most crucial, but also most challenging, element of EPM is the identification of existing common demand. Trying to do this for a group of 26 EDA participating Member States is impossible of course, so we focus on identifying common requirements of smaller groups of Member States. We have already identified that this requires a very active role of the Agency. We must not put any additional burden on Member States who, in many cases, do already have to cope with personnel reduction while their tasks do not shrink but often expand. This is why it is of utmost importance that we rely on existing data sources for the identification of common demand. The EDA has a number of such sources already, like the Collaborative Data Base (CoDaBa) or the various Integrated Development Teams (IDTs). Now we have to search actively for potential matches in these data sources and liaise with the Member States concerned on a bi- and multilateral basis to understand their readiness for common action. The feed-back from Member States so far is very encouraging. Not only smaller Member States but also bigger nations seem more and more to accept that sustaining their national Armed Forces entirely through national solutions is not always a viable approach in the long run. This change of attitude has only recently been manifested in a data collecting exercise on Pooling & Sharing conducted by the European Union Military Committee the outcome of which was presented to the Council of the European Union in November this year.   In this exercise Member States named procurement as their preferred option for Pooling & Sharing for a number of areas including Transport and Logistic Support (Medevac, deployable medical structures, medical support, helicopter availability, basic logistics – food, water, fuel – and camp construction), Education and Training (CBRN training, logistics staff training, pilot training, helicopter training and flight simulator training), Vehicles (multi-lift, soft-skin vehicles, wheeled armoured personal carriers as well as heavy and light wheeled vehicles), Ammunition, Weapons and Individual Equipment (rocket launcher, auxiliary equipment field artillery, non-guided ammunition, light weapons, mines and explosive devices) and Communications. This comprehensive list does not only reflect the increasing preparedness of Member States for common procurement but also represents a good starting point for us in the EDA to identify the products and services eligible for pooling off-the-shelf demand and so to decide where we should focus our efforts on. If we, on top of that, concentrate at first on highly standardised products, this will reduce the desire for national solutions and so overcome one of the chief obstacles to cooperation. Translating Common Demand into Common Action. In essence, EPM is not about developing something new, it is about using existing tools in a better way. Therefore we are developing this initiative along with Member States and relevant inter-governmental organisations as well as industry with the aim to learn from best practices and expand them to a greater group of users. The EDA, with its unique structure linking Capability Development, Defence Research & Technology, Armaments and Industry & Market elements, is a natural place for such an exercise and will facilitate the identification of pilot cases to prove and refine the concept over time. Additionally, the EDA’s legal framework, reinforced through its Council Decision 2011/411/CFSP, provides for a sound basis for multinational ad hoc cooperation which is exactly what is needed to launch real common procurement cases. EPM will bring together smaller groups of Member States which makes it an “à la carte” concept. Such intergovernmental cooperation within the EDA is typically based on the provisions of so-called ad hoc Category B projects. This procedure is widely acknowledged and used in the areas of R&T and Development programmes. It basically offers the possibility to Member States to propose to the EDA Steering Board an ad hoc cooperation combined with an opt-in phase for other Member States to join. If not rejected by the Steering Board this ad hoc cooperation becomes an EDA Category B project enabling the contributing Member States to use the services of the Agency. For EPM cases, such Category B projects could be used to develop common technical requirements on the basis of pre-identified common demand. It would establish some general rules on how to organise the intergovernmental cooperation and it would identify who would act as the common contracting body. In this regard, we have a number of different options. A Lead Nation option is perhaps the most prominent one. In such case, a lead nation would procure on behalf of a group of Member States or simply include in its national contract an option for other interested countries. Another possible option is that a group of Member States identifies and shapes their common demand within an EDA Category B project but then decides to have the actual procurement done by another international body. In any of these cases we have to make sure that the procurement processes and models are as flexible as possible when meeting the different requirements of the Member States and at the same time ensuring transparency and competition. To avoid upfront commitment of Member States and to cope with different budgetary cycles, Framework Agreements stretching over a certain period of time seem to be a worthwhile option. This would not only be beneficial to the Member States contributing to a specific common procurement case but would also allow industry to better utilise their production lines. We are still at the starting point but the interest and feedback from Member States is encouraging and are proof that we are on the right track. One by one, pilot cases will show the benefits and more and more Member States will acknowledge the advantages of European cooperation. This will further reduce fragmentation to the point where we create a real European Defence Equipment Market and a genuine European Defence Technological and Industrial Base. by Reinhard Marak, EDA’s Senior Officer for Defence Market.

EDA_NEWS_0935	2012-01-11	NEWS	Towards SDR standardisation for military applications	   Software Defined Radio (SDR) is a well-established concept in the military domain where the radio is no longer the physical manufacturing of a single waveform but becomes a computer host onto which different waveforms can be loaded. The military have been studying SDR for a long time and has adopted the Software Communication Architecture (SCA) as the “de-facto” standard upon which different solutions can be developed. SCA is published by the Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO, under the umbrella of the US Department of Defence - DoD) of the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS). This architecture has been developed to assist in the development of SDR communication systems and captures the benefits of most recent technology advances to greatly enhance the interoperability of communication systems and reduce development and deployment costs. Together with the SCA architecture (v 2.2.2 now evolving to the so-called “SCA Next”), the JPEO has also published a number of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), to allow software components to communicate with each other, but some have a restricted access (basically security and crypto APIs). On this side of the ocean two programmes are currently working on the same topic. ESSOR (European Secure Software Radio Program) is a programme realised as a joint effort between six nations: Finland, France, Italy, Poland, Spain and Sweden and managed by OCCAR (Organization for Joint Armament Cooperation). ESSOR is based on the (public) SCA architecture (SCA 2.2.2 and JTRS 1.0.3 APIs) and aims at developing an architecture of Software Defined Radio (SDR) for military purposes and a military High Data Rate Waveform (HDR WF) compliant with such an architecture. SVFuA is the German national programme aiming at developing an architecture of SDR to be used by the Bundeswehr, the German Federal Armed Forces. Also, in this case the starting point is the public SCA architecture (SCA 2.2.2 and JTRS 1.0.3 APIs). With respect to the ESSOR programme, Germany doesn’t currently have any national military High Data Rate Waveform (HDR WF) initiatives, but rely on another programme, COALWNW (Coalition Wideband Networking Waveform), to satisfy their operational requirements. The COALWNW objective is to realise a wideband, networking High Data Rate Waveform (similar to the one under development in ESSOR) to pass secure voice, video, and data among Coalition Partners. Partners of this programme are: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, Australia, Sweden, Finland and Spain. The coexistence of a US programme (JTRS) and two European programmes (ESSOR and SVFuA) for the SCA-based SDR architecture plus one transatlantic programme for an HDR waveform translates into two risks that need to be managed: - duplication of effort; and the - loss of interoperability both at European level and transatlantic level. This paper describes a model which has been proposed to overcome these issues and reach in a reasonable timeframe a converged SDR standard to be used in joint operations. EDA and SDR Software Defined Radio is a key issue in the European Defence Agency’s agenda as it is seen as a means to maximise interoperability amongst coalition forces. The approach favoured by EDA is to push for an “international SDR standard”. In November 2009, with the help of the Finnish armed forces, the EDA organised a Conference in Helsinki to address this topic. The Conference brought together international key stake-holders and speakers from EDA, ESSOR, US JPEO, NATO, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the Wireless Innovations Forum (WINNF). The main achievements of the conference was the initial consensus on the principle to approach standardisation with what was then known as the “three basket model” and that ETSI, together with the Wireless Innovation Forum, were possible candidates for the custodianship of some international SDR standards. All this then depended on final agreements with the involved governmental stakeholders. The model sees SDR architecture standardisation falling into three different baskets. The first basket is related to market driven technologies that are available to everyone, where the Governmental Stakeholder Group, i.e. contributing nations, would control the content and release of defence related product specifications in order to guarantee compatibility with non-public API specifications as well as backward compatibility. The second basket includes more sensitive issues, like security and crypto APIs, where the governments, as trusted partners, would remain in charge of custodianship. There may be also need for a third basket which deals specifically with Nation sensitive information. Since the very first time the three basket model was presented, lots of discussions on how to make it happen started. One point of common agreement is that it would be beneficial for the military SDR community to transfer control of the standardisation activities to a Standard Developing Organisation (SDO), at least for that part of the standard not containing sensitive information (and so not restricted). Some advantages of such an approach would be the following: avoiding duplication of work and divergences, which could hamper interoperability; the reduction of costs; and the fostering of harmonisation and help with speeding up the convergence process. During the workshop on SDR and Cognitive Radio (CR) standardisation that took place on the 17/18 November 2011 in Ispra (organised by the Joint Research Centre – JRC - and co-hosted by the Directorate General Enterprise and Industry - DG ENTR – and EDA), ETSI, in cooperation with the EDA and the JRC, presented a model aiming at reaching a European standard in the short/medium term and a converged standard allowing transatlantic interoperability in the mid/long term (i.e. between Europe and the US), which is of paramount importance for joint operations. It is important to remark that this model: has not been endorsed yet by EU stakeholders, but all are showing great interest; is perfectly aligned with the objectives of the EU government standardisation strategies (mainly ESSOR); foresees since the beginning, the presence of both WINNF and the US government and industries (if available to participate). is also aligned with the three basket model as it involves an officially recognised European Standard Organization (ETSI) for all those standardisation activities not requiring any restriction, which corresponds to basket one of the three basket model. The ETSI-EDA Model The model is based on the assumption that, while a “transatlantic” SDR standard for a military application is certainly the ultimate aim, in the short term at least a US programme and a European programme will continue to exist separately. This is also due to the fact the US programme is more advanced than the European ones (ESSOR and SFVuA) and therefore a convergence and harmonisation can best take place in the medium/long term. The model takes into account these considerations and allows for a seamless transition within the same standardisation body from “regional standards” to an “international standard” without hampering, in the short term, the developments of existing programmes. It is here assumed that the European standardisation activities will take place in a dedicated Working Group (WG5) of the Technical Committee Reconfigurable Radio System (TC RRS). TC RRS is responsible within ETSI for SDR and CR standardisation and therefore is the natural host for SDR standardisation for military applications. Two options are possible: in the first case TC RRS will host the standardisation activities related to a European standard while in the second case an ideal model is drawn where the two short-term regional standards are developed in the same committee, i.e. ETSI TC RRS. In both cases interoperability, i.e. a converged standard for joint operations, is considered essential for the mid/long term achievement. The model for the EC standard The starting point is the ongoing regional European programmes, i.e. ESSOR and SVFuA. A set of interoperability specifications (to be developed in cooperation with the US) would speed up the “migration” towards a converged standard, which is supposed to take place in the medium/long term.  Figure 1: SCA-based SDR European Standard The WINNF, with its technical expertise in SCA, could provide support to the standard development and help coordinating the technical and market requirements with respect to the US programme. This will assure a gradual convergence towards the “international standard”, which remains the final target for the mid/long term. The Interoperability Specifications produced are therefore expected to provide the baselines for such a convergence. The Model for the Converged Standard The following section describes the model for achieving an international standard in the mid/long term. Although ETSI has had preliminary discussions with the US on this topic and a positive feedback has been received, the final model to be applied has not yet been agreed. As shown in Figure 2 below, in the short term it is envisaged to have two different regional standards as well as a set of interoperability specifications (for instance under the form of ETSI Technical Specifications and/or feasibility studies (ETSI Technical Reports) that would “complement” the regional standard themselves. It is assumed that the starting points are the ongoing regional programmes, i.e.: ESSOR/SVFuA for the “regional standard 1”, i.e. for the European Standard; and JTRS specification for the “regional standard 2”, i.e. for the US Standard. The set of interoperability specifications complementing the regional standards would speed up the “migration” towards a converged standard, which is supposed to take place in the medium/long term.  Figure 2: Model for a converged standard – one dedicated WG   The two regional standards would be developed independently of each other in the same committee without forgetting the interoperability element which is essential for the development of a single standard in the mid/long term. In this regard it is clearly an advantage to have all these activities within the same committee as it will optimise resources (some stakeholders might be interested in participating actively in the development of both regional standards). At the same time the WINNF, with its technical expertise in SCA, would provide support to the standard development and would help in the coordination of technical and market requirements. In Figure 2 it is assumed that these activities will take place in a single Working Group (WG5) but it would be also possible to create two separate Working Groups for the two regional standards (WG5 and WG6). In this case the two working groups are supposed to coordinate their activities in order to minimise the duplication of work and maximise interoperability in the short term. The model is shown in Figure 3.  Figure 3: Model for a converged standard – two dedicated WGs Conclusions This paper has presented the EDA-ETSI model for starting military SDR standardisation in the most efficient way. ETSI is an officially recognised European Standard Organization (ESO) and a Global Standard Producer (GSP) and can thus offer a single “forum” where standardisation activities can start and evolve in the medium/long term towards a true transatlantic and globally recognised standard. * By Carlo ZAMMARIELLO, EDA Software Defined Radio Principal Officer, and Andrea LORELLI, ETSI TC RRS Technical Officer.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/12-01-11/Towards_SDR_standardisation_for_military_applications
EDA_NEWS_0936	2011-10-14	NEWS	Industry Day Route Clearance	 The European Defence Agency, in close cooperation with Italy (Lead Nation on the Route Clearance workstream of the Project Team C-IED), recently organized a Route Clearance Industry Day on 27-28 September at the Italian C-IED Centre for Excellence in Cecchignola, Rome.   Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) continue to cause significant casualties on operations and are amongst the most significant operational challenges. It is important to address all aspects of countering IEDs and part of this is ensuring mobility in an IED environment. For this reason a Route Clearance Capability is required. Many of the Member States who have identified a need for this requirement have acquired the capability as part of an Urgent Operational Requirement (UOR) process. Nations are now examining the longer term next generation solutions. The aim of the Industry Day was to provide industries and pMS with an overview on the state of play of this work strand and the conceptual base summarised by pMS experts in a framework document on Future Route Clearance Capability Development. This overview of Common Military Requirements for Future Route Clearance will allow industries to prepare themselves for eventually supporting the development of the envisaged capability. This initial brief to industry should be the first step along the road to closer cooperation in the development of new capabilities and give industry a better understanding of defence requirements in this area. Industries with relevant expertise were invited to give a presentation on their current capabilities and ideas to pMS Route Clearance experts and to EDA. A number of CIED related capabilities were briefed which left the Member States with a better appreciation for the current state of the art technologies and it was therefore possible to reconsider the capabilities that could be demanded in this essential area. The event was well attended by 26 industries from European Member States with more than 100 delegates. Representatives from nine EDA Participating Member States were also present at the event. The Route Clearance Industry day was a really successful event that allowed industries to position themselves in the direction of the EDA’s thinking and to be given an understanding of the way ahead.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/11-10-14/Industry_Day_Route_Clearance
EDA_NEWS_0937	2011-10-28	NEWS	Enhancing the role and engagement of Europe’s Defence Industries	 by Claude-France Arnould, EDA’s Chief Executive*   Defence and Security policy is not only a subject for politicians, diplomats and military strategists. Delivering credible defence capabilities is also about getting the underlying economics right; about having sufficient, sustainable resources available. and about retaining independence of action or “operational sovereignty”. Recalibrating Defence in the new financial environment At the moment European governments are going through a financial crisis which has further accelerated cuts in defence budgets. Europe’s ability to deliver effective military capabilities risks being eroded as Defence Ministries respond to their share of budget reductions. To keep the same military capabilities and to satisfactorily prepare for emerging threats with smaller budgets, a new approach is required. A more systematic “Pooling and Sharing” of military capabilities – doing more together – is a response to these financial pressures. Member States are increasingly recognising that, in certain areas, it is better to have excellent shared capabilities rather than unsustainable national ones. They are responding to the challenge and searching for innovative ways to deliver more military capabilities together. EDA is playing a key role in supporting their efforts, acting as a hub to facilitate Member States’ initiatives on a European collaborative basis. More off-the-shelf procurement, with greater openness to competition, is also seen by governments as a means of living within constrained budgets. This is consistent with the European defence package which entered into force this summer with the objective of strengthening an open and competitive European Defence Equipment Market and a long-term and genuine European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB). These developments have the potential to have far-reaching implications for Europe’s Defence including for its defence industry. EDA’s role in strengthening the EDTIB EDA is supporting Member States in identifying and analysing the implications of the changing business environment to Europe’s Defence Technological and Industrial Base. Only with a realistic appreciation of industry’s broad capabilities, including a good understanding of its limitations, can Member States ensure that their strategies will be supported by a strong and viable industrial base. In this context the Agency is assessing progress on and considering an update of the 2007 Ministerial EDTIB Strategy. That document was a call for Member States to adopt a more collective, European approach to the industrial base matters rather than a range of purely national ones – “to recognise that a fully adequate DTIB is no longer sustainable on a strictly national basis” and to “develop a truly European DTIB”. Inter alia the Strategy noted the importance of identifying Europe’s key industrial capabilities and need for less dependence on non-European sources of supply, both of which are important parts of EDA’s on-going work. Industrial Capabilities at risk European governments’ investment decisions underpin the future of the EDTIB. Their funding of military R&T is crucial to the sector’s future competitiveness and their decisions as customers shape its future size and structure. However, defence planners can take industrial capacity as a given, and perhaps be unaware of issues such as non-European dependence and long term security of supply. The risk is that for short and medium term financial expediency decisions could be taken which have a negative effect on the industrial capabilities required for the future. The situation is further complicated by a mismatch between the evolution of governmental defence policy and decision making in privately owned defence companies. Ensuring that the value of Industrial capabilities is understood In market economies it is only reasonable that industry makes money; defence companies are no different. Driven by the need to demonstrate shareholder value, companies can quickly shed industrial capabilities where there is no sign of sustaining government contracts. Companies can (and do) change business. Industrial capabilities – specialist competences - that can take many years to establish can be shed very quickly. Sometimes this happens through strategic decisions at corporate level; other times through middle managers “good housekeeping” measures: either way the outcome can be damaging. Reconstituting such capabilities is time-consuming and often prohibitively expensive. Obviously if you are dependent on non-European suppliers the case is the same but the decision is out of your hands. That the key specialised facilities, skills, competences and know-how to develop, produce and support complex defence systems is retained in Europe can be clearly demonstrated. These competences do not exist in the civil world. If you take defence seriously, you recognise the value of a strong indigenous industrial base. You want suppliers on whom you can depend and who meet your security of supply requirements; having sufficient industrial capabilities to react flexibly and positively to evolving needs and priorities, particularly during times of conflict. One only has to look at US defence industrial policy and at the efforts of emerging powers like China and India to develop indigenous defence industries, to recognise that the retention and development of such capabilities is of strategic importance. The EDTIB underpins the credibility of the European Union’s Common Security and Defence Policy. It is a prerequisite that Europe identifies the key industrial capabilities it requires to meet future operational requirements and takes positive, collective, action to ensure that, in these key areas, the technology and the manufacturing capabilities are retained in Europe. A strong EDTIB that exploits competition is required. However there must be acknowledgement of the need to sustain strategic industrial capabilities where necessary and agreement on a common means to achieve this with specific delivery methods. There currently exists no systematic process at European level to ensure that the EDTIB will be able to meet EU Member States’ future military capability needs. No practical means where by Europe can complement and add coherence to national investments. These weaknesses clearly need to be corrected and this is an issue that EDA is addressing in the context of the EDTIB strategy update. What is the role for industry and what can industry offer? Industry can help shape the evolution of government demand. It cannot afford to sit on the fence as defence policies evolve in the new financial climate. This is not going to be “business as usual” and there are opportunities for industry to help focus the debate. There is a need for a better industry-government dialogue on a European level; only when industry fully understands what will be needed in the years ahead can it realistically assess what issues it will face. And government decision makers need to fully understand the industrial base consequences of defence choices. At EDA we see industry as a real partner. We recognise the need to better utilise the expertise and knowledge imbedded in the defence industry and the need for engagement. For example on Pooling and Sharing we have sought to proactively inform and consult. We will continue to develop this mutually constructive dialogue. For industry’s voice to be heard in the new cash constrained environment there has to be a new message; a new bargain between industry and government. Industries need to take the initiative and make proposals on how they can assist through reciprocal action with governments. There are many areas that could be considered. From an EDA perspective the following “illustrative list” merits further consideration. Industry could consider making proposals on: New business models; that would reduce the development risk and increase the speed of complex defence programmes. Risk sharing incentives which would reduce the cost of ownership of defence equipment. How governments might benefit from adopting commercial best practice solutions particularly in the context of pooling and sharing. How governments and industry might maximise the benefits of the R&T investment crucial to future competitiveness through avoiding duplicative defence research. An offer to increase industry R&T investment if governments can restructure their budgets to release more money for defence research. How prime contractors can take greater responsibility for the long term health of the supply chain. How industrial duplication could be addressed through companies reaching agreement on better sharing of industrial competences. Difficult decisions lie ahead as Europe adapts to the new financial realities. If Europe is to retain the robust and competitive EDTIB it needs to underpin its future political freedom of action there needs to be change including a new business model for government and industry relations. By embracing new and innovative ways of working together we can retain effective military capabilities and a world class defence industry. And that’s something we at EDA believe is worth striving for. *Article published on “Focus”, the magazine of the Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD).	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/11-10-28/Enhancing_the_role_and_engagement_of_Europe_s_Defence_Industries
EDA_NEWS_0938	2011-11-10	NEWS	Launch of the Security of Supply Portal – Interview with Peter Scaruppe	 Security of Supply is a critical topic regarding both the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) and the functioning of the European Defence Equipment Market (EDEM). EDA is taking a major step today, launching a new Portal on the Security of Supply (SoS). Peter Scaruppe, EDA’s Industry and Market Director, explains this new tool.   What is the importance of Security of Supply for the realisation of the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) and the functioning of the European Defence Equipment Market (EDEM)? Security of Supply is very important both for strengthening the EDTIB (the industrial side) and for the functioning of the EDEM (the market side). That’s why SoS remains at the core of our work. One definition of SoS, developed by the Letter of Intent (LoI) community and widely used, is “a Nation’s ability to guarantee and to be guaranteed a supply of Defence Articles and Defence Services sufficient to discharge its commitments in accordance with its foreign and security policy requirements”. This of course means that SoS has an impact on many defence related issues and on many of EDA’s work strands. It is definitely not becoming less important in the current financial and economic situation as the need for “pooling and sharing” and the need for Member States to rely on each other increase. Regarding the importance for the EDTIB, the EDTIB Strategy agreed by Defence Ministers in 2007 states that the concept of a truly European DTIB will not be realised in practice unless Member States are confident that increased mutual dependence for supply of defence goods and services is matched by increased mutual assurance of that supply. In speaking terms, Security of Supply is all about “trust”. Defence procurement is often sensitive in one way or the other, and in order for Member States to rely on non-national sources of supply and to procure from the open EDEM, they need to be assured of the Security of Supply on that market. In the end, Security of Supply is really a pre-requisite for effective and efficient industrial restructuring and for the confidence in open competition. It is a key, cross-cutting EDA work strand and it supports successful collaboration! What are EDA’s achievements so far? The first milestone was the “Framework Arrangement for Security of Supply between subscribing Member States in Circumstances of Operational Urgency”, which was endorsed by the EDA Steering Board in 2006. The Framework Arrangement is an integral part of the voluntary Intergovernmental Regime to encourage competition in the defence market. Subscribing Member States to the Regime have agreed to assist and expedite each other’s contracted defence requirements, particularly in circumstances of pressing operational urgency. They will also work to increase the level of mutual confidence. The Framework Arrangement is based on consultation processes and the principles of cooperation and solidarity. Right now, one of our major tasks together with Member States is the further implementation of this Arrangement and we believe that the SoS Portal will contribute to this process, for example by simply making the necessary contact information more accessible. What is the aim of this new Portal? Well, the ultimate aim of the EDA work on Security of Supply is the achievement of equal confidence in Security of Supply from any part of Europe. This of course sounds very ambitious, but we base our work on a pragmatic step by step approach, reaching a common understanding on and taking into account the different aspects of Security of Supply. The Portal will contribute to this work by increasing the transparency of Member States policies, procedures and priorities connected to the Security of Supply. And as already mentioned: by providing contact information it simplifies access to our Member States’ SoS systems and/or to further information. What sort of information is available on this Portal? The Portal contains information provided by our Member States on their legal basis for SoS, their SoS objectives, the national bodies involved and their areas of responsibilities, the role of SoS in their procurement processes, possible contractual terms on SoS that they use, existing bi- and multilateral agreements on SoS that they might have and contact information to relevant PoCs in their respective administrations. We will also have information on the related EDA documents and links to other relevant sources of information on SoS. But of course, the Portal is a living tool! Who is your target audience? The Portal will be publically available on the Internet for everybody. It will probably be most useful to stakeholders such as Governments and Industry, but also for other institutions and academia. And what sort of benefits will users get from this new platform? We hope that finding this sort of information collected in one place will be of real benefit for our stakeholders. The Portal will be a place to collect information about Member States’ SoS policies, but also to identify Points of Contact to communicate with. For example a company planning to place a bid in one of our Member State´s procurements could use the Portal to get an overview of the SoS policies, practices and requirements of that Member State. A Member State on the other hand could use the Portal to get an idea of the SoS policies in its fellow Member States, which could be useful when considering one’s own policies, when procuring on the open EDEM or when engaging in a collaborative project. How did your team collect this information? Which lessons have you learned from this exercise? Last year we conducted a stocktaking exercise with Member States, basically collecting the information that is now available on the Portal. One of the practical outcomes of the stocktaking was the decision by Member States to set up this Portal. We have worked closely together with our SoS Experts community throughout the setting up of this Portal. This has proven to work very well and we would like to thank all our Member States for their support! It has been very helpful to have the experiences of the LoI and Nordic communities, who have been cooperating on SoS for a long time. What are your expectations? That the SoS Portal will be a hub for finding information on SoS and that it will be of real use for our stakeholders, others and also for ourselves. We also hope that it will contribute to the practical implementation of our Framework Arrangement, so that this Arrangement can be used for solving SoS issues in cases of operational urgency. What is the way ahead for SoS? We are working together with our SoS Experts community on various issues. As mentioned, we hope that the Portal will contribute to the practical implementation and use of our Framework Arrangement. In addition to that we are also following the practical implementation of the Defence and Security Procurement and Intra Community Transfer Directives in Member States and the impact these will have on SoS. Recently we also started discussions on how to involve industry in our work on SoS. The current Polish Presidency of the EU held a high-level seminar on this topic in September, which we consider a good kick-off for our work on this. The way ahead looks challenging and interesting!	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2011/11/10/Launch_of_the_Security_of_Supply_Portal_%E2%80%93_Interview_with_Peter_Scaruppe
EDA_NEWS_0939	2011-10-10	NEWS	Towards a European solution on Precision Guided Ammunition	 Defence Ministers have acknowledged the importance of maintaining a strong EDTIB in Europe. The EDTIB Strategy describes the vision for the future size and shape of the EDTIB. One element of this Strategy is the need to determine which key industrial capabilities must be preserved or developed in Europe. Member States decided to use the ammunition sector as a pilot area to be addressed from both the demand and the supply side. Ammunition is a cross-cutting sector for European armed forces: it affects the performance of platforms, and interoperability in the field. Procurement decisions influence security of supply and thus affect the operational sovereignty of Member States. The ammunition sector is sensitive; testing and procedures for the qualification of ammunition are main cost drivers. Currently, ammunition is also a promising candidate for pooling & sharing activities including possibilities for the use of modern, effective procurement methods such as collaborative procurement.   Precision and Guidance on ammunition is an identified area of strategic importance, both from the military capabilities perspective and from the technological and industrial perspective, playing a key role for a sustainable ammunition related EDTIB. In December 2010, the European Defence Agency (EDA) signed a 12 month study contract. The objective of this study is to provide an achievable step-by-step plan to develop a more robust, sustainable and competitive European defence ammunition industry, able to provide the military capabilities that Member States require. This contract sets out work on the: identification of capabilities requirements on Precision Engagement, focusing on Precision Guided Ammunition; mapping of the current Global and European technological and industrial situation, assessing Europe’s strengths and weaknesses; identification of existing gaps; provision of a roadmap and an implementation plan identifying priority measures to be taken with special focus on key technologies and key industrial capabilities to be preserved or developed; and the identification of pilot cooperative programmes and areas of priority for investment. Results of the study are expected to be a significant factor in developing harmonised capabilities requirements, achieving strong stakeholder consensus, improving European collaboration, and achieving economies of scale. Nine months after contract signature, the study has already identified common areas for the future operational use of Precision Guided Ammunition shared by Member States. It has also identified critical technologies and industrial capabilities that need to be preserved, non-EU dependencies and regulatory/qualification issues. In the forthcoming months the study, under the close monitoring of EDA, and in consultation with Member States, will enter its final phase: the development of a detailed roadmap and implementation plan. This plan will include concrete and prioritised collaborative actions for a European solution on Precision Guided Ammunition, while safeguarding in parallel critical industrial capabilities to meet the future operational requirements of the European armed forces.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2011/10/10/Towards_a_European_solution_on_Precision_Guided_Ammunition
EDA_NEWS_0940	2011-10-17	NEWS	Interview with Austria’s Senior Commander, Colonel Hannes Mittermair	"  Credits: Austrian Air Force Colonel Hannes Mittermair was Austria’s Senior Commander at the Helicopter Exercise ITALIAN CALL 11, the third European Helicopter Training Programme Exercise, hosted in Italy, on May-June 2011. As Austria’s Senior Commander in place, Mittermair was responsible for the 26 Austrian soldiers, operating three AB-212 Army helicopters. Mittermair and his crews are already planning HOT BLADE 2012, the next EDA’s Helicopter Exercise. EDA recovers an interview with Mittermair, a Commander who strongly and enthusiastically believes that ""helicopter practice works very well in the international arena”. Q : From your point of view, what is the importance of attending this Exercise - for you, for your crews, and for Austria’s helicopter capability development? A : ITALIAN CALL 2011 was the second Exercise we attended with our helicopters, and we found that the Exercises’ concept had developed greatly. Our aim is to validate our procedures and techniques for the crews. We have learned in operations, like Kosovo and Bosnia, that we do apply good flight techniques, but also have certain difficulties in understanding how the procedures work, how they are applied. So, this is an ideal opportunity for us where we can demonstrate our improved procedures, which we will also present in a NATO evaluation programme. I think that the success of this European Helicopter Training Programme Exercise is now established. Q : What about the European Helicopter Training Programme? How do you see it? A : Our experience until now… in 2003 we cooperated with both Germany and Switzerland in Kosovo, and that was our first step on the international scene. Being neutral emphasises certain sensitive areas in terms of interaction with other nations, but I do see a development here, because the Exercise language was English – and not German, to which we were used. So, crews were “forced” to apply their techniques and skills, in English – which is challenging. They did a very good job and, as we have seen, the cockpit swap was successfully executed. Since AZOR 2010, the exchange of ideas has also been well done. Q : To which developments are you referring to? A : Exercise AZOR 2010 (July 2010, Spain) was a kind of national exercise in an international playground. Now we have a truly international exercise model, hosted by a given Nation, which is Italy. Q : So, it means a small step forward towards a new concept of Exercise… A : I wouldn’t say it is a small step forward… it’s a big step forward! Once you manage it, Nations open up and give the pilots the trust they need to swap cockpits… this is really a big, big sign of mutual confidence and trust. This means they feel completely confident that there are professional and very well prepared troops on both sides. So, a big step forward, I would say! Q : Would you emphasise a specific mission that the Austrian crews carried out with other nations during IT CALL 2011? A : No, I have no specific reference to make... we had a great experience here with all crews. From what I have seen here from all contributing nations, and being a truly convinced European citizen, I would like nations to cooperate in a more united and multinational European environment. This engagement is a political decision – and I am just a soldier. Soldiers operate and make basic lines to sustain political decisions. But my “soldier experience” is great. And the European Defence Agency is working for it!"	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/11-10-17/Interview_with_Austria_s_Senior_Commander_Colonel_Hannes_Mittermair
EDA_NEWS_0941	2011-09-26	NEWS	European Defence Agency Capability output in Afghanistan	 by Jim Blackburn, EDA's Capability/Capability Area Engagement   The European Defence Agency has recently completed a project to develop and build a forensic laboratory to analyse Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) recovered from incidents. IEDs account for approximately 80% of military casualties in Afghanistan and kill approximately three times that number of civilians. Taking actions to counter the threat of IEDs involves gathering as much information as possible about who is making them, where the components have come from and who is supporting the supply and building network. This allows the IED network to be interdicted, thus saving the lives of soldiers and civilians alike. It is essential in modern conflict to ensure that the prosecution of the campaign is conducted within boundaries of the law and therefore the collection of information about bombers must be carried out in an evidentially pure fashion such that it could later be used as evidence in a judicial process.   The Ministers of Defence from the EDA Member states directed the Agency to spend Operational Budget money to purchase the equipment for such a forward deployable forensic laboratory to deploy into operations under a lead nation. The aim is to demonstrate to all Member States the utility of such a laboratory and the contributions that it can make. Furthermore it aims to prove the requirements, specifications and procedures, which can then be passed back in an intellectual package to all pMS to enable a template for the development of similar capabilities in the future. Following the initial direction, the EDA set up a small team of experts from across the Member States to define the requirements for the demonstrator, establish the legal framework under which it could exist and deploy, set up the contracting, organise the personnel from across the Union to man the laboratory, and train the team. The contract was let on 17 December 2010 with the Spanish company Indra and delivered at the end of July after training personnel. The laboratory and the personnel flew into Afghanistan by the end of July 2011 and was set up and running with Initial Operating Capability by mid September 2011. The whole project was completed in a very short time which considering the multinational dimension of the staffing was remarkable.   The EDA Project, known as the Theatre Exploitation Laboratory (Demonstrator) or TEL(D), has been deployed by France as the lead nation and is manned by a multi-national team from France, Spain, Poland and the Netherlands. Early next year Italy, Romania and Sweden are expected to send manning contributions. Austria has bought some additional hardware for the laboratory to enhance its capabilities and has also made a significant contribution to training the personnel. Sweden and the Netherlands provided experts to help with training. Luxembourg covered the expenses for and organised the transport of the laboratory to Afghanistan. The Republic of Ireland, despite not officially participating in the project, hosted the team to excellent training to give them a better awareness of IEDs and the tactics used by insurgents. The whole effort was truly multinational and although exceptionally challenging, it proves that it is possible to work collaboratively and quickly if the will exists. The laboratory is now getting good reports from Afghanistan where it is making a significant contribution to the effort to counter Improvised Explosive Devices and where it directly supports the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and the Afghan National forces by providing real tangible input. The laboratory is envisaged to remain in Afghanistan this year and next year, but its future beyond then is yet to be decided.

EDA_NEWS_0942	2011-09-30	NEWS	Further steps on Effective Procurement Methods	 As a next step in the EDA’s new Effective Procurement Methods (EPM) initiative, a workshop was held on 15 September 2011 where Member States met to explore new opportunities for improving the effectiveness of defence expenditure under the umbrella of the Agency. The meeting focused on two main topics: the identification of existing common demand by groups of Member States and its translation into common action; and the modalities of using the EDA as a central purchasing body. To this end, the EDA’s recent common procurement of synthetic helicopter training was presented to Member States as an example of potential benefits and savings. One of the main findings of the presentation was that aggregating demand could be the only way for some countries to afford certain purchases. Member States, who welcomed this new EDA work strand as a way to support Pooling & Sharing efforts, stated that the main focus should be on the identification of common demand. They supported the EDA taking an active role, while recalling that the need for flexibility in meeting Member States’ specific requirements and preferences. On EDA’s possible role as a central purchasing body, Member States exchanged views on issues such as the legal framework or how cooperation among participating Member States could be structured. These discussions will facilitate the development of an EPM concept to be presented to Member States. The next step in the EPM work strand will be the implementation of pilot cases. The common procurement of EU Battle Group-related logistic services may offer opportunities: synergies with the EDA’s Third Party Logistic Services (TPLS) Platform could also be achieved. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2011/09/30/further-steps-on-effective-procurement-methods

EDA_NEWS_0950	2011-07-14	NEWS	EDA Military Airworthiness Authorities (MAWA) Airworthiness Conference 2011	 The 3rd Military Airworthiness Conference took place on 6 and 7 July 2011 in Warsaw, Poland, to coincide with the Polish Presidency of the EU. The conference was jointly arranged by the Polish Ministry of Defence and the EDA. This was the third conference on this subject - following previous successful ones organised under the Czech and Swedish Presidencies - to support the decision of the European Defence Agency (EDA) Steering Board in Defence Ministers’ formation to create an EU-wide forum for Military Airworthiness Authorities (MAWA). Ministers decision was implemented by the National Armaments Directors and the National Military Airworthiness Authorities (NMAAs) executive level decision on harmonising national military airworthiness regulations. The conference received presentations from key military airworthiness stakeholders, including EDA MAWA, EU NMAAs, the Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD), international NMAAs and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) on how they achieve and ensure airworthiness in challenging and innovative programmes. This was set against the wider background of the EDA MAWA efforts to achieve greater harmonisation of military airworthiness amongst EDA participating Member States. A common theme was that of the implementation of European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) and how this can be achieved building upon existing national adaptation of EASA regulations into national military airworthiness regulations and also previous and on-going transformation of national airworthiness organisations. More information (including presentations) is posted here.    	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2011/07/14/EDA_Military_Airworthiness_Authorities_MAWA_Airworthiness_Conference_2011
EDA_NEWS_0951	2011-07-07	NEWS	Launch of new EDA Initiative on Effective Procurement Methods	 Today, representatives of the EDA participating Member States met in a web conference to discuss a new EDA initiative on Effective Procurement Methods – Common Off-The-Shelf Procurement. Based on a tasking from the new EU Treaty, Effective Procurement Methods focuses on the development of innovative ways to consolidate the demand side of the European Defence Equipment Market. As a first target area, the Member States identified off-the-shelf procurement. Though further investments into development programmes are still of utmost importance for the maintenance of a high-end European Defence Technological and Industrial Base and a priority in the EDA’s work, the number of military purchases of off-the-shelf products is increasing. This applies, in particular, to urgent operational requirements and logistical support of EU operations where Armed Forces often rely on third party contractors. Off-the-shelf purchases is an area where the benefits of common ways of procurement are self-evident. Since demand is met from existing sources, the need for national variants is much lower than for other types of procurement. Likewise the potential savings for Member States are higher as fewer variants result in more streamlined production for industry and higher economies of scales. Moreover, collaborative procurement conducted in a transparent and competitive way increases cross-border competition which again is a key factor in market terms. Finally, a more frequent use of common procurement methods will lead to more nations employing the same equipment and thus increased interoperability. The main focus for the EDA in this initiative is the consolidation of demand for European defence equipment, and indeed the identification of current common demand. The EDA, with its integrated way of working is ideally placed. Given the new legal framework after the Defence Procurement Directive which explicitly names the EDA as a central purchasing body for common defence procurement, the Agency could, in time, conduct contracting for a group of Member States and thus become a one-stop-shop for defence cooperation. The EDA’s Industry & Market Director, Peter Scaruppe, stated after the meeting: “Today’s feedback from Member States has been very encouraging and showed us that we are on the right track. With their interest and help we will be able clearly to demonstrate the benefits of this new approach. At the end of the day, common off-the-shelf procurement should become the rule rather than the exception.”	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2011/07/07/launch-of-new-eda-initiative-on-effective-procurement-methods

EDA_NEWS_0953	2011-06-29	NEWS	Polish view on EDA's Unmanned Maritime Systems programme	   By Dr Michał WIERCIŃSKI - UMS Management Committee member. Science and Military Education Department. PL MoD. The European Defence Agency Unmanned Maritime Systems Cat. A programme (UMS) is an opportunity for developing technologies for the XXI century mine counter measures (MCM) and other naval applications. Moreover, it represents a unique opportunity to provide the Polish Navy with modern military equipment increasing its operational capabilities in 2020 perspective. The UMS related technologies should enable the Polish Navy to conduct more efficient MCM operations in the future. Bearing this in mind, the Polish Minister of National Defence signed the relevant Programme Arrangement during the EDA Steering Board meeting held in Brussels on 9 December 2010. His signature, along with the signatures of 10 other defence ministers will allow specific UMS projects to be initiated in 2011. Poland’s decision to join the UMS was a consequence of a detailed analysis among different institutions in the Ministry of National Defence (MoND). Furthermore, the Polish participation required the approval of the Navy Command, which supported the decision since the scope of the UMS programme is fully in line with the Polish Armed Forces Development Plan for the years 2009-2018, as far as MCM issues are concerned. This document reflects all operational needs of the Polish Armed Forces and is treated as one of the main guidelines in terms of R&T investment. It is also worth mentioning that the Polish Navy Command pays a special attention to the UMS results. By delegating representatives to manage three UMS projects, the Command hopes to fully harmonize their outputs with the Polish Navy’s operational needs.   According to Polish R&T Director Col. Józef Wrona the above mentioned aspect of harmonization is a key element as far as R&T is concerned. This opinion was presented during an opening ceremony of the UMS programme that took place in Gdynia on 19 April 2011. During this meeting, the Navy representatives had for the first time an opportunity to talk to the scientists and deeply discuss the UMS-led issues. Col Wrona also reminded that there still exists a necessity for developing an efficient mechanism that will enable the identification of technologies for which development is required from the capabilities’ perspective. He also stressed the importance of the end-user’s participation in the whole MCM capability development process. This involvement should start from an identification of the capability gaps, followed by research and development to address them, and ending with a capability delivery. Polish involvement in the UMS programme therefore, fully reflects this approach. Poland decided to join five UMS projects with a total investment of 2,83 M€. The Naval Academy will perform some tasks within the “Signature Response Analysis of Multi-influence Mines” project that should improve knowledge on the ships signature response. Another Polish contractor - Maritime Technology Centre - will be involved in the projects of “Buried Mines” and “Modular Light-weight minesweeping”. The first one is expected to fill up technological gaps in buried mines detection and neutralization. The second will develop technologies for lightweight sweep sources that could be used in future unmanned surface vehicle platforms. Moreover, bearing in mind standardization and integration of different UMS projects it was fully recommended to engage in the “Systems Integration” and the “Standards and Interfaces” projects. Both Polish sub-contractors are participating in these projects. The results of the UMS will represent an added value to national R&T efforts that will be conducted within National Research and Development Centre (NRDC) - the main national entity responsible for applied research and development programmes. In a couple of months a national strategic programme will be established focusing on development of different technologies and components. Its aim will be to enable the building of the XXI century MCM system based on national unmanned surface vehicles and unmanned underwater vehicles. Polish participation in the UMS programme is an important element providing the national programme with common European standards and necessary interfaces among different UMS-led technologies. Moreover, the UMS programme is also treated as an integrated element of a national armaments programme that is expected to provide the Polish Navy with a next-generation mine-countermeasures vessel (MCMV). The UMS technologies are therefore, the ones that potentially could be used by the MCMV to increase its operational capabilities.   From the Polish point of view, the development of MCM capability requires a comprehensive approach. While, national efforts are the core element of MCM technology development, the involvement in the international cooperation under the EDA framework is also essential. This cooperation will provide with the common standards so important as long as building a European MCM capability is concerned.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2011/06/29/Polish_view_on_EDA_s_Unmanned_Maritime_Systems_programme
EDA_NEWS_0954	2011-07-04	NEWS	European defence equipment market reaches significant milestone	 5thanniversary of the launch of the Intergovernmental Regime on Defence Procurement   1 July 2011 marked the fifth anniversary of the launch of the Intergovernmental Regime on Defence Procurement, a landmark agreement of EU governments to open up to cross border competition the most sensitive share of the defence market covered by Article 346 TFEU. Since then, the Regime has been pioneering a gradual transition from closed and fragmented national defence markets to a more open, transparent and competitive marketplace where better value for money is the key procurement priority and a critical determinant. Rob de Jong, Chairman of the EDA National Armaments Directors Steering Board The launch of the Regime has been a remarkable achievement and brought fundamental changes in defence procurement/defence business. In its 5 years of operation it has been creating new opportunities for companies across Europe, strengthening our defence technological and industrial base, beneficial both for our Armed Forces and taxpayers. Results: Over 650 contract opportunities published on the Electronic Bulletin Board operated by the Agency Over 400 contracts awarded under competition with a total value of 5,4 bn euros 1/3 cross–border awards Over 500 000 views In this process, both Member States, as shareholders, and Defence Industries, as stakeholders, are critical. Domingo Ureña Raso, President of The AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe and CEO Airbus Military I would like to congratulate the Agency on its essential role in the process of opening up the defence market in Europe through the Regime. ASD has been actively supporting it from the beginning and we are pleased with the results. But this has to be accompanied by efforts to consolidate demand through the harmonisation of requirements across the continent. We need more consolidated defence procurement across Europe, with the EDA being used as a prime vehicle to co-ordinate this process, increased effort on research and technology and more collaborative programmes between EU Member States. Together with the European Commission’s new directive on defence procurement, it provides a solid foundation in our joint endeavours towards enhancing and strengthening the development of a genuine European Defence Market. Michel Barnier, EU Commissioner in charge of the Internal Market and Services The Intergovernmental Regime has been an important step towards the creation of a European Defence Equipment Market. It has fostered trans-border competition in a market segment which was traditionally closed for non-national suppliers. Moreover, it has helped - by its very existence - to build consensus on the necessity of market openness between Member States. This consensus made it possible to adopt Directive 2009/81/EC which will apply from August 21 on to the bulk of defence procurement in the EU. I am convinced that the EDA will continue to play an important role for European defence markets and industries, in particular in areas related to the demand side such as security of supply and pooling and sharing. The Commission will cooperate as closely as possible with the EDA to develop a fully integrated EDEM and to strengthen the EDTIB. This twin - track approach combines community measures and intergovernmental initiatives and ensures that Member State's Armed Forces get the best possible, robust, flexible and interoperable equipment in the most cost – effective and efficient way. Dr. Csaba Hende, Minister of Defence of Hungary A strong Europe needs a globally competitive European defence industry. At the same time the current financial crisis and the budgetary problems faced by most nations only make the development of a European defence market an even more pressing necessity. We need to use the economic constraints as an incentive to eliminate duplication and rationalise our defence procurement. The final goal is to save money for our taxpayers and deliver high-technology, European made defence equipment for our armed forces. The work of EDA and the Commission is vital in this process. Next steps: Less fragmented markets mean more efficient use of resources – this is simply an imperative given constraints on European defence spending. To this end, we have to also increase our efforts to consolidate demand in order to achieve the economies of scale to maintain and develop defence capabilities in Europe. Last month, the EDA Defence Ministers, building on the 5 – year success of the Regime, decided to take forward the development the European defence market and tasked the Agency to bring about 5 critical objectives in close consultation with the participating Member States and in cooperation with the European Commission: 1.  Ensuring security of supply on a European level 2.  New opportunities for more effective procurement and improved effectiveness of military expenditures through more cooperative action 3.  Increased global competitiveness of the European defence industry and reciprocal market access 4.  Addressing security aspects in view of the development of a wider European Defence and Security Market 5.  Constructive dialogue with defence industry; incentives for more defence industrial efficiencies and innovation Claude – France Arnould, the EDA Chief Executive The success of the Regime would not have been possible without the strong commitment of Member States and Industry’s support. But we cannot stop there. The actions we are launching now will not only contribute to further development of a more open and globally competitive European defence market but will considerably support pooling efforts together to meet future military needs, ensure interoperability and standardization, and share the ever-increasing costs of developing and procuring high-technology defence equipment. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2011/07/04/European_defence_equipment_market_reaches_significant_milestone

All credits: www.defense.gouv.fr/das This Seminar, organised by France in full cooperation with Germany, Poland (the Weimar Triangle), follows proposals by their Defence and Foreign Affairs Ministers to Ms. Catherine Ashton, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, on how to reinforce EU-NATO cooperation, the EU’s ability to plan and conduct operations, and cooperation on military capabilities. The seminar was opened by the French Minister of defence, and was designed to deliver concrete proposals on how to promote European cooperation in the field of defence capabilities.. Ms. Arnould spoke in two panels. In the first, which she shared with Mr Patrick Bellouard, Director of OCCAr Executive Administration, she spoke about “EDA added value for European cooperation – EDA-OCCAr synergy”. She underlined the natural partnership between EDA and OCCAR, which allowed for a seamless transition of the management of projects at the European level, such as the Advanced European Jet Pilot Training or the Biological Equipment Development and Enhancement Programme. “EDA-OCCAr cooperation is, now more than ever, an imperative”, she concluded. In the second panel, which she shared with General Stephane Abrial, NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander for Transformation, Ms. Arnould addressed the issue of “EU Pooling and Sharing initiative and NATO Multinational and Innovative Approaches: comparative advantages”. Ms. Arnould said “In the context of budget cuts, Pooling and Sharing is a key priority for the Agency: we need to improve cooperation. Pooling and Sharing has been a driver for the Agency for some time. But European involvement in Libya should act as a wake-up call. The Agency needs to continue to deliver and benefit from the high level support”. Together with the General Abrial, she underlined the need for reciprocal transparency with NATO: “Coordination with NATO is essential because both share the same goal, namely to improve capabilities in a constrained financial environment”.   	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2011/07/14/Ms_Claude-France_Arnould_attended_the_Weimar_High_Level_Seminar_on_capabilities
EDA_NEWS_0956	2011-06-06	NEWS	National Breakdown of Defence Data	 The European Defence Agency (EDA) has just published the National Breakdown of Defence Data for 2009. These are official statistics on the main defence expenditure components for each of the EDA participating Member States (all EU Member States except Denmark): Macro-economic data to show how defence budgets relate to GDP, overall government spending and population. Major categories of defence budget spending – personnel; investment, including research & technology; operations & maintenance; and others – to show how defence budgets are spent. European collaboration for equipment procurement and R&T to show to the extent to which the Agency’s participating Member States are investing together. Deployability: military deployed in crisis management operations to show the ratio between deployments and the total number of military. The figures provided are official figures based on data provided direct by the main spending authorities, the Ministries of Defence. EDA has been gathering data on its Member States’ defence expenditure since 2005. The exercise of periodically assembling accurate data in the four areas described above aims at providing an annual overview of Member States’ defence expenditure, overall and in specific categories, to show their defence expenditure trends and to measure progress against benchmarks for investment. Accurate data is needed to provide a baseline for setting targets to improve defence output. Defence Data collection and analysis is also supporting EDA activities, in particular relating to R&T (collaboration), Armaments (collaboration) and to capability development, in order to help measure progress in their respective areas of responsibility. Benchmarks allow for specific measuring of progress at the aggregate EU level on spending more (together) for R&T and Equipment Procurement. The method for the annual data-gathering and analysis is well-established and prepared through a fixed annual cycle. The definitions were agreed by the 26 participating Member States in order to have comparable data across them all. After some adjustments that occurred in the first years of data collection, the definitions are now stable thus allowing not only for a comparison between countries but also for an analysis of the evolution over time. The Agency is also launching a new Defence Data Portal, with improved graphics as well as more detailed information on the indicators used, on the targets that have been set for investment and on the method used for gathering the data. We invite you to visit the Defence Data Portal, where you can access the statistics on defence expenditure for each of the 26 EDA participating Member States. By selecting any of the 26 Nations (or the EDA flag) you can access data per Member State or for the EU as a whole for the period 2005 to 2009. Clicking on the links in the right side column “Consolidated Data”, you can access the National Defence Data files (where each page provides a comparison between all the Member States over two consecutive years), aggregated data at the EU level, and a comparison between the EU and the US in terms of defence expenditure. You can also obtain information on the Methodology used, the Benchmarks and the Definitions, through the dedicated pages.

EDA_NEWS_0958	2011-05-01	NEWS	EDA’s new website: a cornerstone in EDA communication, by Ms. Claude-France Arnould, EDA Chief Executive	 It could be said that the European Defence Agency’s ethos is cooperation. Since 2004, EDA has been supporting its participating Member States in their capability development. This has always meant “doing more with less”, through identifying innovative and timely pooling & sharing opportunities. The current budgetary crisis has brought this requirement into sharper relief. It also means ensuring complementarity for participating Member States’ common priorities and investments. We strive to avoid duplication by maintaining a constant dialogue with our stakeholders. Ministers are committed to the Agency. Recent ministerial-level discussions on pooling & sharing revealed that participating Member States were increasingly willing to work together. EDA is aware that it must deliver concrete and affordable results. I would add that EDA enjoys a privileged role: on the one hand, Member States are both shareholder and client; on the other, EDA is well-positioned in the European landscape (the High Representative and Head of the Agency is also Vice-President of the European Commission). EDA has also proved to be an important interlocutor when it comes to liaising with other institutions, including the European Space Agency and NATO. Working with Member States and, at the same time, with such a diverse range of intergovernmental and industrial, European and non-European, military and non-military, bilateral and multilateral institutions, EDA needs to get its message across. EDA is a lean, non-bureaucratic, responsive and result-oriented organisation, designed to support Member States. It should be the first choice for where European Defence cooperation takes place. For this, mutual-confidence, knowledge and communication are crucial. I believe we have to be more pro-active and to improve how we communicate with our key interlocutors. This is why EDA has reassessed its communication tools and invested considerable time and effort in rebuilding its main gateway: the website. The website is neither a repository nor a library, but rather a living platform, where EDA describes, on different levels, its major ongoing projects and its achievements. EDA has also developed a new electronic Newsletter to reach different audiences. This proactive communication channel will enable you to hear from us more effectively. We welcome you to our new website.

EDA_NEWS_0959	2011-05-16	NEWS	Helicopters Training Programme: ITALIAN CALL 2011 starts on 23 May	" Italy will host a Multinational Helicopter Exercise from 23 May to 12 June 2011, as part of the European Defence Agency's Helicopter Training Programme (HTP). “IT CALL 2011” follows two past successful exercises: GAP 2009 and AZOR 2010. The European Helicopter Training Programme was approved by Ministers of Defence in November 2009 to increase in the short-term the availability of helicopters for crisis management operations. The Programme started in 2010 and consists of two live exercises per year - one focusing on individual training and one on interoperability and operational tactics. An annual symposium takes stock of lessons learned from operations and further shapes the development of additional exercises. This Helicopter Training Programme is one of EDA’s most successful stories. Together with Member States, the Agency realised that the lack of transport helicopters deployed into operational scenarios is not so much related to a lack of helicopters in itself. The training factor seems to be the major determinant, as crews are insufficiently trained to fly in the kind of environments that reflect current operational circumstances (high-altitude, low-visibility, dusty or snowy environments). Taking into account Member States' requirements, EDA organises the training for ""hot & dusty"" or for ""snow & mountains"" conditions, exactly the scenarios Member States are facing. So far, 63 helicopter crews trained under the Helicopter Training Programme have deployed to Afghanistan. Andrew Gray, EDA Helicopter Project Manager, explains briefly the aim of the HTP and the purpose of the next Exercise, IT CALL 2011:   To follow the IT CALL 2011, visit the exercise's blog:   Photo gallery:  "	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2011/05/16/Helicopters_Training_Programme_ITALIAN_CALL_2011_starts_on_23_May

EDA_NEWS_0963	2011-04-13	NEWS	EDA launches key work towards a European Technology non-Dependence Policy for Defence	 (Press release) EDA holds a high-level Conference in Budapest on European Technology non-Dependence (ETnD), on the 13-14 April, under the Hungarian EU Presidency. It brings together, for the first time, senior defence experts and policy makers from across Europe to discuss this subject. Some 150 participants are expected with representatives from the Member States, the European Commission, the European Space Agency, Industry and the Research Community. The Conference addresses the challenges for improving access to the key enabling technologies that will underpin future defence capabilities and makes recommendations on future actions. Non-Dependence on key technologies - the possibility for Europe to have unrestricted access to any required technology - is a pre-condition for a robust, sustainable, globally competitive European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB). EDA is proposing that its Member States develop a comprehensive European approach. Technological dependency limits the capabilities of the European Industry and their supporting research providers to respond to the evolving needs of the defence, space and security market. It can also seriously restrict EU Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) capabilities. Although excellent sectorial examples of ETnD exist, an overall European framework is lacking. Besides the identification and prioritisation of the critical technologies and supply chains, an ambitious roadmap linked to sustained investments is necessary to achieve adequate technology non-dependence on a European level. ETnD is a major topic for Defence but it also has a wider strategic dimension for Europe. The topic fits well in the EDA R&T objectives and is consistent with the European Defence Research & Technology Strategy, approved by Ministers of Defence. Some critical technology areas which meet the criteria of Technology non-Dependence have already been identified and are subject to on-going EDA action. The goal of the Conference is to convince all stakeholders of the strategic importance of European Technology non-Dependence for Defence and the need for a proactive policy. (Photo: Adam Sowa, EDA's Deputy Chief Executive. Credits: EDA). *** Photo galery Video, Adam Sowa, EDA's Deputy Chief Executive Speech of Adam Sowa, EDA's Deputy Chief Executive. Video of Péter Siklósi, Hungarian Deputy State Secretary Video of Christian Bréant, EDA R&T Director *** Background It is now widely accepted that investment in critical non dependence technologies can no longer be done nationally and that Europe collectively needs to have autonomous access to a range of critical Defence technologies and to maintain a capable Defence Technology and Industrial Base (EDTIB) to support its military capabilities. Technological dependency limits the capabilities of European Industry and their supporting research providers to respond to the evolving needs of the defence, space and security market. It can also seriously restrict EU Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) capabilities. Non-Dependence on key technologies - the possibility for Europe to have unrestricted access to any required technology - is a pre-condition for a robust, sustainable, globally EDTIB. A comprehensive, high- level, European response to defence non-dependence is required. European nations are suffering financial constraints and many have come under additional pressure due to the recent financial crisis. Smarter co-operation, guided by a strategy which generates and secures critical key enabling technologies could help to make Europe reasonably technologically non-dependent, now and in the future. Such a strategy would focus strongly on leveraging synergies between the civil and Defence communities. ETnD requires a common European strategy which is guided by a common perception and policy. To achieve an adequate technology non-dependence on a European level, in addition to the identification and prioritization of the critical technologies and supply chains, a comprehensive roadmap, linked to sustained measures, milestones and investments, will be necessary. The study contract and the Budapest Conference are important steps towards these objectives. However, adequate commitment and actions by the European stakeholders, supported by the nations, are mandatory if the issue is to be developed further. Understanding and dealing with the issue of technology and industrial dependencies is part of EDA’s day to day business. Work is already on going in a range of key enabling technologies (including FPGA, Carbon Fibres, Printed Circuit Boards and Gan Technology). Additional work is underway in the following sections: in the domain of Military Aerospace, identifying highly added value competences future Air Systems and supply chain dependencies on non-EU suppliers; in the ammunition sector looking at a reduction of technical non-EU dependencies: a contract has been let examining the position on Precision Guided Ammunition to a consortia led by BAE Systems Bofors (including Diehl BGT Defence, EXPAL, MBDA, Nexter Munitions, OTO Melara, Rheinmetall Waffe Munition, SAGEM and Thales TDA.) The study is part of a step-by-step plan to develop a more competitive European Defence ammunition industry. Contract addressing key European Defence Technology and Industrial Dependencies EDA has recently signed a contract to establish a better understanding of the scope of EU dependence on non-EU sources of supply in the Defence sector. A consortia led by FOI, including RAND Europe and the French aerospace lab ONERA, will undertake this work. The aim of the contract is to: Map the current level of dependency across the EDTIB, identifying the consequences for key technologies, industrial processes and skills and a sustainable EDTIB able to satisfy future Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) requirements. Develop criteria to objectively decide the critical technologies and industrial capabilities that are required to deliver defence capabilities and make proposals on which critical areas should be monitored. Benchmark international best practices in dealing with dependency issues (from both the commercial and defence fiends) and propose best practice solutions. Examine specifically the key dependency concerns in the European aerospace industry.  	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2011/04/13/EDA_launches_key_work_towards_a_European_Technology_non-Dependence_Policy_for_Defence

EDA_NEWS_0970	2011-03-18	NEWS	Successful completion of first European Personnel Recovery Course in Sweden	 The Swedish Armed Forces invited EDA participating Member States as well as other countries to the first European Personnel Recovery Operations and Plans Course in Karlsborg, 7-18 March 2011. Course participants came from Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden. In addition to the Swedish instructors, Canada, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and the United States additionally sent observers and instructors to Karlsborg. The intensive two-week course aimed at enabling participants to prepare, plan and execute Personnel Recovery Operations. “This course is indeed very helpful for our operational planning. The instructors are very experienced and motivated”, said course participant First Lieutenant Jos Tijs from the Royal Netherlands Navy. Major Tor Cavalli-Björkman, a Swedish Instructor, is convinced: “We all benefit tremendously from this international information exchange. I would like to stress that this initiative will increase the number of trained personnel available to support on-going operations as well as EU Battle Group.” The initiative to standardise Personnel Recovery training emerged from the Project Team Personnel Recovery in the European Defence Agency (EDA) at the end of November 2010. Jon Mullin, Capabilities Director at EDA, stated: “I am most grateful that Sweden agreed to offer the first EU opportunity of this kind and hosted it so successfully at its Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) School. This initiative will significantly boost Personnel Recovery capabilities in Europe.” A Belgian officer said “The course could not come at a better time, given the obvious requirements we have witnessed in the press regarding the events in North Africa during the past few weeks.” Personnel Recovery is aimed at mitigating and reacting to the risk of isolation, capture and exploitation of military or civilian personnel during a Crisis Management Operation (CMO). The Personnel Recovery Course, envisaged to be held regularly by various host nations, is one of several results of the respective Project Team at EDA. Other initiatives include a Personnel Recovery Concept, a personnel registration tool and the preparation of joint procurement of Personnel Recovery Equipment in the future. The European Defence Agency was established in 2004 to support the participating Member States and the Council in their effort to improve European defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) as well as pooling efforts and resources in the development of transformed, interoperable and cost-effective armed forces.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2011/03/18/Successful_completion_of_first_European_Personnel_Recovery_Course_in_Sweden

EDA_NEWS_0973	2011-03-09	NEWS	EDA Member States endorse updated Capability Development Plan and agree on priorities	 The European Defence Agency’s participating Member States have endorsed an update of the Capability Development Plan (CDP) defining the future military needs and priorities of Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), and also agreed to reshape the priorities set out in 2008.   The initial CDP was endorsed in July 2008 and the present updated CDP encompasses substantial additional input, in particular on short-term needs based on the Headline Goal Process and lessons from operations. The update led by the EDA is based on important contributions made by participating Member States, the EU Military Committee and the European External Action Service. The CDP is now firmly established as a tool for informing Member States’ capability development. It remains the Agency’s ‘overall strategic tool’, driving Research & Technology investment, Armaments collaborations and Defence Industry & Market activities. The update has also enabled the reshaping of the initial tranche of 12 prioritised actions agreed on in 2008. The Steering Board has approved a set of prioritised actions that will be focal points for the Agency’s activities in the years to come. They are presented in three groups as follows: The CDP Top 10 Priorities, consisting of: Counter Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED); Medical Support; Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance; Increased Availability of Helicopters; Cyber Defence; Multinational Logistic Support; CSDP Information Exchange; Strategic and Tactical Airlift Management; Fuel and Energy; Mobility Assurance. Maturing/Mature Actions, consisting of: Maritime Mine Counter-Measures; Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear defence; Counter-Man Portable Air Detection Systems; Military Human Intelligence. Core Drivers/Environments, consisting of: Comprehensive Approach; Network Enabled Capabilities; Radio Spectrum Management for EU Capabilities; Space; Single European Sky. The CDP priorities, many of which are already EDA projects and programmes, offer good opportunities for Pooling & Sharing between the participating Member States.    	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2011/03/09/EDA_Member_States_endorse_updated_Capability_Development_Plan_and_agree_on_priorities

EDA_NEWS_0988	2010-12-09	NEWS	EDA seeking savings through Pooling and Sharing	 (Press release) European Defence Ministers have agreed that the Agency’s activities on Pooling and Sharing of national military capabilities should be enhanced. In addition to successful existing projects – such as improving helicopters availability, air transport, third party logistics support and airworthiness – more pooling and sharing opportunities exist in areas like satellite communications, medical support and naval logistics. In many cases pooling and sharing also offers opportunities for civil-military dual-use. “The Agency has quickly reacted to the needs of European Defence Ministers, who are looking for opportunities to work closely together in order to improve capabilities while budgets are under pressure. Pooling and sharing offers potential for savings, while increasing interoperable capacities”, said Catherine Ashton, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Vice-President of the European Commission and Head of the European Defence Agency. Defence Ministers also discussed the impact of the Single European Sky initiative of the European Commission for military aviation. The Single European Sky’s objective is to replace the currently fragmented airspace over Europe by one air traffic management system, thereby increasing capacity, reducing pollution and improving safety and security. The SES Air Traffic Management Research (SESAR) Joint Undertaking is addressing the technological challenges. Ministers have tasked the Agency to engage with the SESAR Joint Undertaking in order to identify important financial and operational risks as wells as emerging opportunities for the defence community. Following new opportunities under the Lisbon Treaty regarding Defence Research at Union level, Ministers called for a constructive dialogue in the coming months between the European Commission, the European Parliament, the Agency and the participating Member States on the preparation of the 8th Framework Programme for investment in technology areas of common interest at the European Union level. Ministers were informed on the progress made with the project to deploy a field laboratory for forensic research of road-side bombs explosions. With France as lead-nation, supported by several other Member States, the mobile laboratory will be deployed to Afghanistan by mid-2011. Technical preparations, procurement and planning of the laboratory’s manning are all on track. “This is a concrete contribution to urgent operational needs, as road-side bombs are endangering the lives of soldiers and civilians day-after-day. It is a direct European contribution to the Alliance’s operation in Afghanistan”, Acting Chief Executive, Adam Sowa, said. The Steering Board approved the Agency’s Work Programme 2011. The Agency’s budget will be € 30.5 million, as decided by the Foreign Affairs Council in Defence Ministers formation. Ministers were informed on the results of the Agency’s collection of 2009 defence data and on the assessment of the collective benchmarks for defence R&T and equipment procurement. A dedicated booklet has been released. The Steering Board approved that the Agency can start the book-building process for the new Joint Investment Programme (JIP) on protection against Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) threats, with the nations willing to participate indicating their financial contributions. The JIP-CBRN is the first EDA programme in the context of the European Framework Cooperation, which aims at systematic synchronisation of research investment by the Agency, the European Commission and the European Space Agency. Defence Ministers took stock of the progress made in the Agency’s work on the Level Playing Field. They reaffirmed that the LPF initiative is a strategic and long-term exercise, which in full respect of the specificities of defence aims at contributing to the creation of a truly European Defence Equipment Market, whilst focusing on strengthening the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base. The Agency will continue its work to develop a common understanding of those issues which may hamper the establishment of a Level Playing Field, based on an agreed categorisation of issues as a first step towards prioritisation. Furthermore, the Ministerial Steering Board tasked the Agency to analyse defence-related aspects of the EU Radio Spectrum Policy Programme (RSPP), recognising that this programme will have medium to long term operational and cost implications on the use of spectrum by the military. Radio frequencies are of crucial importance for EU crisis management operations. The Agency will develop recommendations regarding defence issues in order to support the participating Member States’ interests. During the Steering Board meeting Defence Ministers of Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden signed the programme arrangement for Unmanned Maritime Systems, a new major EDA R&T programme of more than € 50 million for mine counter measures and other naval applications. Norway also contributes to the UMS programme. The Polish Defence Minister signed a Letter of Intent to participate in the Multinational Space-based Imaging System (MUSIS) project, joining Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy and Spain.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2010/12/09/EDA_seeking_savings_through_Pooling_and_Sharing

EDA_NEWS_0996	2010-07-01	NEWS	EDA-EC Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) recommends a High Level Group	 The European Defence Agency (EDA) and the European Commission (EC) co-organised today a Conference dedicated to Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). Over 450 senior government officials and industry representatives gathered to discuss the potential of UAS for European users, their economic, technological and industrial impact, as well as a common European way forward. Presentations by senior representatives of European stakeholders’ groups outlined the dual use nature of UAS, both for defence and civilian security purposes. Financial savings and environmental benefits through reduced fuel consumption as well as CO2 emissions were highlighted, in addition to the multiple possibilities UAS already offer in reducing the risk to human life in high risk missions. This sector opens a promising chapter for the aerospace domain and for the aviation industry in Europe, where EDA and EC already have joined forces to promote innovation and new opportunities for a wide range of businesses and SMEs. Military and civil UAS markets are highly interdependent, with technology developments inevitably driving both. The Commission and the European Defence Agency are committed at the European level, to closely observe, support and contribute to the evolution of UAS technologies for dual-use purposes. To underline this commitment, EDA’s Chief Executive, Alexander Weis, announced ongoing work under the so called “European Framework Cooperation”, a pragmatic approach by the European Commission, the European Defence Agency and the European Space Agency to synchronise systematically Research and Technology investment in their respective frameworks. “The tasking given by the EDA’s Steering Board in Ministers of Defence formation, in April this year, is to prepare and propose a Joint Investment programme on Unmanned Aircraft Systems for political launch in autumn this year. The target is clear; we want to address the remaining technological challenges for UAS Air Traffic Insertion as well as exploitation of their capabilities to support seamless flying of UAS in Europe by 2015”, said Alexander Weis, EDA Chief Executive. Several senior officials called for a joint European approach to develop common Unmanned Aircraft System capabilities in order to maximise efficiency in public spending and to ensure that alternative European platforms are available within the coming years. The Conference recommended the establishment of a High Level Group on UAS, providing a discussion platform to European Stakeholder communities in order to ensure coherence whilst improving sustainability and competiveness, notably building on input and ongoing initiatives from research areas such as the “European Framework Cooperation”. Underlining that “Europe’s progress will be judged not on the basis of policy statements but by concrete measures and investment”, Alexander Weis called for an “open discussion among all stakeholder communities to prevent duplication of effort, ineffectiveness and a fragmented market”. “This dialogue will be invigorated today but will need to be continued on a day by day basis to allow concrete measures on European level. We believe that this process would be facilitated by the creation of a High Level Group on Unmanned Aircraft Systems, bringing together all relevant actors in Europe”, he added.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2010/06/30/EDA-EC_Conference_on_Unmanned_Aircraft_Systems_UAS_recommends_a_High_Level_Group
EDA_NEWS_0997	2010-07-20	NEWS	Contract signature on Future of the European Military Aerospace Defence Technological & Industrial Base	 At the occasion of the Farnborough International Air Show 2010, the European Defence Agency (EDA) and SAAB, representing a large part of the EU’s military aerospace industry, signed a contract launching strategic work to help safeguard Europe’s ability to independently provide competitive aerospace solutions to meet CSDP capability requirements in the 2035 timeframe. The contract, valued at € 400 k, aims to provide an achievable step by step plan to develop a more robust, sustainable and competitive European military aerospace industry, one better able to provide the military capabilities Member States require. It includes work to: capture a commonly shared view of the state of the industry and the challenges ahead, identify the strengths and weaknesses, provide a roadmap and implementation plan identifying priority measures to be taken to strengthen the industry, identify pilot programmes in the UAS and helicopter areas. It is an important step in fulfilling the Agency’s task, given by Defence Ministers, of identifying those key industrial capabilities to preserve or to develop in Europe and on which work has commenced with a focus on the military aerospace industry. EDA’s Chief Executive, Alexander Weis, highlighted that Europe’s military aerospace industry, which represents over 55% of Europe’s Defence Technological and Industrial Base (DTIB), employing directly over 200,000 people, is critical to meeting Member States' future military requirements, but is unlikely to be sustained in the long term without transformational action and new ways of business. Recalling that the Lisbon Treaty set out the Agency’s important role in “identifying and implementing any useful measure for strengthening the industrial and technological base and improving the effectiveness of military expenditure”, Weis noted that the contract would “help create a European approach to the aerospace DTIB - one that recognised that it is more than a disparate range of national capacities - and that European collaboration must be an important part of the sectors future”. EDA is engaged in a dialogue with stakeholders on collaborative policies, plans and programmes which could assist European decision makers in safeguarding European industry’s ability to competitively respond to future military capabilities requirements.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2010/07/19/Contract_signature_on_Future_of_the_European_Military_Aerospace_Defence_Technological_Industrial_Base

This successful project involves government and industry experts from Germany, Belgium, Italy and Spain, and it is supported financially by the Ministries of Defence of these four countries. The 3 year project is managed by a consortium led by Diehl DGT Defence, and which is additionally made up by Fraunhofer FKIE, SENER Ingeniería y Sistemas, DISAM-UPM Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Oto Melara, Centro Stefanini - Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna, Celin Avio and the Belgium Royal Military Academy. EDA premises were adapted to accommodate rows of posters and a wall of monitors to provide a full overview of the robots’ behaviour. NM-RS is also a special project for the EDA as it is the first R&T project funded by the Member States contracted within the Agency’s framework in June, 2007. A follow-up to this simulation project is foreseen with the aim to demonstrate the real robots’ behaviour in the field. A public Executive Summary will be available shortly.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2010/07/14/EDA_hosts_the_final_meeting_of_R_T_project_NM-RS
EDA_NEWS_1000	2010-06-28	NEWS	Poland and Sweden express the intention to join the Multinational Space-Based Imaging System Programme	 Poland and Sweden announced their intention to join MUSIS, the MUltinational Space-based Imaging System, a collaborative EDA programme of six European Countries (Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, France and Italy) to enhance their future Earth Observation (EO) capabilities. “This is most welcome”, said Alexander Weis, EDA’s Chief Executive. “The MUSIS project was brought to EDA to open up the participation to other Member States. The Polish and Swedish decisions show the added value of bringing such projects to the Agency.” MUSIS aims to federate some of the next generation European military or dual use satellites for Earth Observation, such as the replacements for the French Helios II, the Italian CosmoSkyMed and the German SAR Lupe, and assure “access to space” for each of the contributing Member States (cMS) by common User Ground Stations. Approved as a Category B project in March 2009 by the EDA Steering Board, MUSIS is open to participation of other EDA participating Member States, if their proposed contribution is acceptable to the existing contributing Members. Marcin Idzik, Undersecretary of State for Armaments and Modernisation, and National Armaments Director of Poland said “Military space-based observation has been providing a cooperative venture for the past 20 years. The latest stage of cooperation, MUSIS, represents what could be referred to as the third generation of the cooperative model.” He added “From our perspective, the MUSIS programme is one of the most important EDA programmes.” Gunnar Hult, Chief Scientist of the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) and Deputy National Armaments Director of Sweden, said “FMV will initiate negotiations regarding this innovative step in Space-based Imaging System for surveillance, reconnaissance and observation. MUSIS will be critical to ensure space-based imaging capabilities, which are essential in the context of CSDP – as identified in the Agency’s Capability Development Plan”. Background information The MUSIS Programme entered the Agency in March 2009 as a Category B project. EDA is adding value by offering its expertise in dealing with multinational programmes through flexible and collaborative procedures. In particular, EDA’s role in MUSIS is related to seeking possible interest in the programme by other EU Member States, according to the conditions defined by the MUSIS cMS for new Members. The Mandate that the MUSIS cMS gave to EDA also identifies the Agency as the appropriate body to liaise with Research and Technology projects that could be potentially of interest for MUSIS such as those included in EU Commission Framework Programme 7 and ESDP related initiatives such as the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) and the European Data Relay Satellite (EDRS). As a consequence, the EDA will also represent MUSIS nations’ interests in any institutional forum where Defence and Security issues related to Space capabilities are discussed, and synergies between civil and military EU Space capabilities are being identified.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2010/06/27/Poland_and_Sweden_express_the_intention_to_join_the_Multinational_Space-Based_Imaging_System_Programme

EDA_NEWS_1003	2010-06-08	NEWS	European Aerial Capabilities Seminar at ILA Berlin – 8 June 2010	 The European Defence Agency (EDA) organised today, in Berlin, a Seminar on European Aerial Capabilities, which gathered government and industry representatives to discuss how Europe’s military aeronautics sector will preserve the capability to provide the aerial capacities Member States’ forces require in future with reduced research & technology investment and constrained procurement budgets. The seminar took place in the context of the Agency’s task, given by Defence Ministers, of identifying those key industrial capabilities to preserve or to develop in Europe. Carlo Magrassi, EDA’s Deputy Chief Executive (Strategy), said “We have made progress. We are creating a European approach to the Defence Technological and Industrial Base (DTIB) - one that recognises that it is more than a disparate range of national capacities.” Magrassi highlighted that Europe’s Military Aerospace Industry, which represents over 55% of Europe’s DTIB, is critical to meet Member States' military requirements, but is unlikely to be sustained without transformational action and new ways of business. He concluded by saying that “European collaboration must be an important part of the solution”. In this half day seminar, the moderator Arturo Alfonso-Meiriño, EDA’s Industry & Market Director, stressed that the Lisbon Treaty sets out the Agency’s important role in “identifying and implementing any useful measure for strengthening the industrial and technological base and improving the effectiveness of military expenditure”. Several experts from the European Defence Agency presented current EDA ongoing projects. The Capability Planning Process, Measures on the Technological and Industrial Base for Future Air Systems, Key Industrial Capabilities, the European Air Transport  Fleet, Challenges of Unmanned Aarial Vehicles Air Traffic Insertion, Unmanned Aerial Systems and the European Framework Cooperation, were some of the topics addressed by EDA staff, who underlined the potential for the maximisation of capabilities through innovative solutions. Dr. Georges Bridel, from EADS Military Aircraft, shared with the audience the industry points of view on a competitive industrial base for aerial capabilities in future. The Seminar contributed to the mandate from the EDA Steering Board to engage in a dialogue with stakeholders on collaborative policies, plans and programmes which could assist European decision makers in safeguarding European industry’s ability to competitively respond to future military capabilities requirements.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2010/06/07/European_Aerial_Capabilities_Seminar_at_ILA_Berlin_8_June_2010
EDA_NEWS_1004	2010-05-10	NEWS	EDA holds a Biological Equipment Development and Enhancement Programme symposium in Paris	 Following the successful Biological Detection Identification and Monitoring Symposium in 2008 hosted by the Bundeswehr Research Institute for Protection Technologies and NBC Protection in Munster, Lower Saxony, Germany and the subsequent launch of the Ad Hoc Category B Project Biological Equipment Development and Enhancement Programme – Preparation Phase by European Defence Ministers on 18 March 2009, the European Defence Agency is holding a symposium, hosted by the French Ministry of Defence, from 10 – 11 May 2010 in the Military School, Paris, France. The aim of the symposium is to update and exchange information on the Ad Hoc Cat B Project BIO EDEP PREP, between contributing governmental members of the Ad Hoc Project and industrial stakeholders in order to gain industrial and technological consolidated views for the programme phase of the Biological Integrated Reconnaissance Defence (BIRD) System commencing 2012. Essentially the two day symposium aims to address the following issues: To inform on the current status of the Ad Hoc Cat B Project BIO EDEP PREP; To present the current overall view of the operational requirements for the future Biological Integrated Reconnaissance Defence (BIRD) System; To inform on concluded and ongoing EDA funded BIO EDEP supporting studies; To request industry to inform (RFI) on BIRD operational and related technological system orientated solutions in the mid (next 5 years) and long term (5 – 10 years); To review and discuss the proposed industrial and technological solutions in closed BIO EDEP capability orientated panels with governmental end users and industry; To develop a first draft open Short List of industrial and technological solutions to support a Business Case and MoU development in order to minimise risk for 2nd generation BIRD development. Background The Ad Hoc Cat B Project “BIO EDEP - PREP” is the initial phase of an armaments programme aimed at enhancing and developing equipment provided to EU forces to enable them to operate in a biologically hazardous environment, by providing increased protection and survivability for individual soldiers and enabling operational and tactical commanders to maintain freedom of action and movement. The project is currently being conducted in accordance with the EDA Guide to the Conduct of a Programme Preparation Phase as part of the EDA Armaments strategy, with completion targeted by end 2010, with a possible decision to integrate the programme in the OCCAR in 2011. The specific aim of the preparation phase is to develop Common Staff Requirements (CSR) for Individual Soldier Protection, Non-Specialist all-arms CBRN Defence Unit Protection, and CBRN Defence Specialists Equipment Capability leading to options for the realisation of BIOEDEP. More specifically, this preparation phase will result, by the end of this year, in the elaboration of eight CSR documents describing the specific requirements for each of the eight sub-systems that will eventually build up the BIRD system: one overarching system integration project that warrants the global coherence of the system and its seamless integration within the EU forces and 7 sub-system development projects. They address the need for protection of the forces at all required levels: individual, non-specialist and CBRN.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2010/05/09/EDA_holds_a_Biological_Equipment_Development_and_Enhancement_Programme_symposium_in_Paris

EDA_NEWS_1008	2010-02-09	NEWS	"Press release: Signature of first coordinated EDA/ESA studies on ""Satellite Services for UAS Missions"""	 At the venue of EDA’s Annual Conference 2010 on “Bridging Efforts – Connecting Civilian Security and Military Capability Development”, the European Defence Agency (EDA) and the European Space Agency (ESA) signed contracts with two consortia regarding feasibility studies on “Satellite Services for the integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) into European Airspace”. EDA's Chief Executive, Mr. Alexander Weis, signed one contract with EADS Astrium Services / EADS Defence & Security - Military Air Systems (France) and in parallel ESA’s Director of Telecommunications and Integrated Applications, Ms Magali Vaissiere, signed a second contract with INDRA Espacio (Spain). The two studies, worth € 400 k each, will explore the feasibility of a demonstration mission in the timeframe 2010/2011. Close coordination between the two Agencies ensures that both European civilian and defence actors will benefit from the use of multiple integrated space systems as enablers for cost-effective, sustainable and competitive UAS services in the future. In particular, the studies will look at: The feasibility and the overall planning for a UAS mission, demonstrating that UAS can be integrated into non-segregated airspace using satellite communications and satellite navigation for Command and Control, Sense and Avoid, and Air Traffic Control, and the added value of satellite communications for high data rate payload links. The viability of such a solution for future services based on UAS supported by space systems. The investments necessary in the future and the next steps required in technical and regulatory terms to effectively establish such a service. The roadmap for civilian, security and military services development. Building on their respective work in the areas of UAS Air Traffic Insertion and Satellite-UAS cooperative missions, EDA and ESA have joined forces since the start of 2009 to demonstrate that technological challenges in Command and Control / Air Traffic Control can be overcome through the use of satellite services. EDA Chief Executive Mr. Alexander Weis highlighted “the cooperative spirit between the two organisations, bringing about benefits for both civilian and defence stakeholders to get best value for money”. Referring to the overall topic of EDA’s Annual Conference, he further stressed the need for concrete synergies and result-oriented projects to effectively connect Civilian Security and Military Capability Development. In this context EDA’s initiative on a ‘European Framework Cooperation’ aims at systematically reaping the benefits of working together with partners such as the European Commission and ESA, including the strategic research area of UAS for air traffic insertion by 2015. ESA’s Director of Telecommunications and Integrated Applications, Ms Magali Vaissiere stressed the importance of demonstrating the use of space-based services for new user communities outside the space domain. She pointed out that the subject of the studies is an excellent example of how integration of space assets into other systems can be used in order to respond to and fulfil actual user needs. Given that satellite services could significantly contribute to paving the way for a broad range of civil and commercial UAS applications, she also stressed the multi disciplinary character of the initiative, the expected synergy between civil and security applications, and thus the importance of a coordinated approach between EDA, ESA and their respective Member States.   Picture: (From left to right) Nicolas Chamussy - Senior Vice President  Mission Air Systems (EADS Defence & Security), Eric Béranger - Chief Executive Oficer (EADS Astrium Services), Alexander Weis - Chief Executive (European Defence Agency), Magali Vaissiere - Director of Telecommunications & Integrated Applications (European Space Agency), José María Martí Fluxá - General Manager (INDRA Espacio) and Carlos Belmonte - Director Telecom and Navigation Solutions (INDRA Espacio).	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2010/02/08/Press_release_Signature_of_first_coordinated_EDA_ESA_studies_on_Satellite_Services_for_UAS_Missions

EDA_NEWS_1019	2009-11-26	NEWS	EDA’s Conference on “Interoperability Through Joint Standards and Common Certification”	 Together with Finnish Defence Forces, EDA has organised a Conference on Software Defined Radio dedicated to “Interoperability through joint standards and common certification”. The Conference took place on 17 and 18 November 2009 in Tuusula, Finland. More than 70 senior decision-makers and experts from EDA’s participating Member States, the United States, OCCAR, NATO, ETSI, the Software Defined Radio Forum and from major industries attended this event. This broad participation allowed for much-appreciated open discussions between Governments, Industries and Standardization organisations. The main achievement was the consensus on standardization work share. It was agreed that SDR standardization should be divided at least into two different “baskets”. The first basket being the public one, containing unclassified information with unlimited distribution, where Governments act mainly as observers, maybe controllers, and meanwhile the work itself is market-driven. The second “basket” includes more sensitive issues, like security and cryptographic application programming interfaces, where the governments will definitely remain in control. Further work is needed to analyse and to agree the specific contents and custodians of these “baskets”. It was also concluded that the certification process can only be decided after the standardization process and its principles are more mature.

The Programme will start in 2010. It will consist of two life exercises per year, one focussing on individual training and one on interoperability and operational tactics. An annual symposium will take stock of lessons learned from operations and further shape the development of further exercises. “This is another concrete result of the Agency’s work. The Helicopter Training Programme will deliver immediately more helicopter capabilities, which we all know in a continuous shortfall in deployed operations”, said Head of the Agency Javier Solana, who chaired the meeting. European Ministers met in the Steering Board of the European Defence Agency on 17 November. A Letter of Intent on the European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) was signed by fourteen Ministers.[1] The EATF aims to address the critical European shortfalls in air transport by developing a wide range of innovative solutions, from pooling training, logistics or procurement to exchanging flight hours and making aircraft available. “A new milestone for the EATF has been reached. I am in particular happy that 14 Ministers have signed the Letter of Intent. Now, we have to work hard on elaborating the details of the different forms of pooling and cooperation”, said Alexander Weis, EDA’s Chief Executive.The Ministerial Steering Board approved two Political Declarations: On European Military Airworthiness Requirements – Ministers underlined the political importance of developing and implementing common European Military Airworthiness Requirements which will significantly reduce costs of air systems and speed up European aircraft programmes. On Level Playing Field for the European Defence Equipment Market – Ministers stressed that the creation of a Level Playing Field is a prerequisite for fair competition in an open and transparent European Defence Equipment Market. They tasked the Agency to develop with the participating Member States a common understanding of the scope of the factors hampering the Level Playing Field, to consider what mitigating actions are achievable and in what timeframe, and to develop a roadmap based on prioritisation of the issues to be addressed. Furthermore, the Ministerial Steering Board approved the launch of a new Category A programme on Unmanned Maritime Systems - UMS. This programme will serve as an umbrella for several Category B R&T projects, with different groups of Member States contributing. It will connect R&T priority work on uninhabited naval systems, especially underwater systems, with the Maritime Mine Counter-Measures project, which is one of the twelve priorities under the EDA Capability Development Plan. Ministers also launched the European Framework Cooperation for Security and Defence, which aims at a systematic synchronisation between R&T investment under the EDA umbrella and by the Commission - thus maximising complementarity of civilian security, space and defence-related research programmes. EDA has been tasked to set up, together with the Commission and the European Space Agency, the details of the coordination scheme and to develop proposals for possible subjects for this cooperation, situation awareness being one possible candidate. The Steering Board approved the Agency’s Work Programme 2010. Work will focus on implementation of the four EDA strategies, on concrete projects and on other policies and initiatives. The Agency will have a 2010 budget of € 31 million, including € 8.4 million operational budget for studies, and will recruit four new staff bringing the EDA staff total to 113. The budget was adopted by the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Defence Ministers formation. Ministers were informed on the results of the Agency’s collection of defence data for 2008 and on the assessment of the collective benchmarks for defence R&T and equipment procurement, which shows positive trends with regard to European collaboration. A dedicated brochure has been released.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2009/11/16/Defence_Ministers_launch_European_Helicopter_Training
EDA_NEWS_1021	2009-07-01	NEWS	EU Third Party Logistic Support Platform Officially Launched	 Today the European Defence Agency launched the operational phase of the EU Third Party Logistic Support Platform. The EU TPLS Platform will act as a common interactive website-based instrument for European industries having expertise in the field of mission and operations-related TPLS. Companies will have the opportunity to advertise their services in a very detailed and user-friendly way to a specialised community of customers. In turn, these customers, Contracting Authorities from all over Europe, will be provided tools to directly interact with particular service providers. In addition to that, the Platform will facilitate the identification of new business for specialised service providers, by comprising a publicly accessible area for Contracting Authorities to advertise their public tenders (including ongoing and completed contracts). In doing so, the TPLS Platform will bring together demand and offer in a very specific area of the European Defence Equipment Market and will at the same time introduce more transparency and competition for the benefit of both customers and suppliers. The TPLS Platform was established after an EDA Steering Board decision of 2 April 2009. An initial registration period for Economic Operators started soon after, as a preparation to today’s operational and official launch of the new portal.

EDA_NEWS_1022	2009-10-15	NEWS	Progress of the EDA Future Unmanned Aerial System project	 In November 2008 the EDA Steering Board approved a new Category B project on a Future Aerial Unmanned System (or FUAS). Seven EDA participating Member States contribute to this project: Germany, Finland, France, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. The FUAS project is currently in its Preparation Phase. It aims at fulfilling Army and Navy tactical ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance) requirements from the seven contributing Member States, reflected in the Common Staff Requirement (CSR), by means of a Vertical Take Off and Landing Unmanned Aerial System (VTOL-UAS). An initial in service horizon of the FUAS is the timeframe 2016-2018.   Based on the CSR, the Request for Information was submitted by EDA on 3 June 2009 to a list of industries worldwide at the request of the cMS. The RFI was divided in five parts: System, RADAR payload, Data Link, Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) payload and Automatic Take Off and Landing (ATOL) System. EDA has received responses from 19 companies and has transmitted these to the cMS for analysis.   The results of the cMS’ analyses of the RFI will have two uses: first, to refine the cMS requirements to bring these into line with what is feasible in the short to medium term; second, to contribute the definition of the scope of the next phase. This project, which is now in a Preparation process, will be followed by a Definition Phase that will lead to Development and Production.   The FUAS project has interfaces to other important EDA efforts and initiatives in the field of ISTAR capability development, such as Maritime Surveillance (MARSUR), FAS (Future Air Systems), Airworthiness and UAS insertion into General Airspace, among others.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2009/10/14/Progress_of_the_EDA_Future_Unmanned_Aerial_System_project

EDA_NEWS_1024	2009-06-17	NEWS	France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden launch world leading technology on the MID-air Collision Avoidance System (MIDCAS) at the Paris Air Show	" The corresponding commercial MIDCAS contract was also signed by EDA on behalf of the five contributing Member States (CMs) with the MIDCAS industry consortium, consisting of the following co-contractors: Saab AB (publ), Saab Aerosystems  (appointed as Coordinator); Alenia Aeronautica S.p.A; Diehl BGT Defence GmbH & Co. KG; Deutsche Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V. in der Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft; EADS Deutschland GmbH; ESG Elektroniksystem- und Logistik-GmbH; Galileo Avionica S.p.A; INDRA SISTEMAS S.A; Italian Aerospace Research Centre CIRA S.c.p.A; Sagem Défense Sécurité; Selex Communications S.p.A; SELEX Sistemi Integrati S.p.A; and THALES Systèmes Aéroportés S.A.  From left to right: Dr. Gunnar Hult, from FMV (Sweden), representing the MIDCAS contributing Member States, Alexander Weis, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency, and Lennart Sindahl, Executive Vice President Saab, speaking on behalf of the Consortium. Credits: European Defence Agency The pilot's responsibility to ""see and avoid"" needs an equivalent mechanism in Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), hence a Sense & Avoid (S&A) system to determine the presence of potential collision threats and manoeuvering clear of them. “This is key for future military UAV based capabilities and a key technology for the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base. With this technology, Europe will become world leading in this area”, said Alexander Weis, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency. This work will be conducted in close co-operation with European organizations, e.g. EUROCONTROL, EUROCAE (European Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment) and EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency). Transatlantic coordination will happen throughout the project with organisations such as the Radio Technical Commision for Aeronautics (RTCA) and the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA). The intention is to demonstrate by actually flying a UAS in non-segregated air space at the end of the project, where the process of approval together with a national Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) for such a flight will be one of the main contributions to the standardisation work.  At the Le Bourget Air Show, on 17 June, the five contributing Member States, cMS, have signed the Project Arrangement, whilst EDA has signed the contract worth approximately € 50m with the MIDCAS Industry consortium. EDA has signed the contract on behalf of the cMS with the following co-contractors: Saab AB (publ), Saab Aerosystems  (appointed as Coordinator), Alenia Aeronautica S.p.A, Diehl BGT Defence GmbH & Co. KG, Deutsche Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V. in der Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft, EADS Deutschland GmbH, ESG Elektroniksystem- und Logistik-GmbH, Galileo Avionica S.p.A, INDRA SISTEMAS S.A, Italian Aerospace Research Centre CIRA S.c.p.A, Sagem Défense Sécurité,Selex Communications S.p.A, SELEX Sistemi Integrati S.p.A and THALES Systèmes Aéroportés S.A. The project logic will to a large extent be based on the development of a safety case which in turn will be supported by a large amount of simulations. Data from performed demonstrations and flight tests will be used to correlate the simulations for confidence. The goal is to reach a maturity level of the safety case enough to enable a final demonstration with a UAS in non-segregated airspace at the end of the project. Performing the development and standardisation for future Sense & Avoid technology in parallel with utilising gained knowledge from EDA and national projects as a basis is considered a key contribution for integration of manned and unmanned aviation flying routinely in non-segregated airspace. This integration of manned and unmanned traffic will unlock the potential of usage of UAS in many military, security and civil applications."	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2009/06/16/France_Germany_Italy_Spain_and_Sweden_launch_world_leading_technology_on_the_MID-air_Collision_Avoidance_System_MIDCAS_at_the_Paris_Air_Show

EDA_NEWS_1028	2009-05-18	NEWS	EDA and Commission to work closely together on research	 The European Defence Agency aims to establish a European Framework Cooperation for Security and Defence Research, together with the European Commission. This new Framework will provide the overarching structure for maximising complementarity and synergy between defence and civilian security-related research activities.   European Ministers of Defence, meeting in EDA’s Steering Board on 18 May 2009, have tasked the EDA to develop concrete proposals, working in close coordination with the Commission. Decisions on the European Framework Cooperation, including on the content of a coordinated Programme, will be taken by Defence Ministers in November. The likely candidate of this Programme is ‘situational awareness’, from sensing to command and control of networked assets. “Coordination on investment in research between the Agency and the Commission will save the European taxpayer money, as our actions will be concerted”, said Head of the Agency Javier Solana, who chaired the meeting. EDA and the European Commission are already synergising their research in specific projects, such as Software Defined Radio and for the insertion of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles into regulated airspace. The European Framework Cooperation for Security and Defence has the purpose to systematically ensure complementarity and synergy of Defence R&T investment by the Agency with research investment of the European Commission under the Seventh Framework Programme for civilian security. “Our existing cooperation with the Commission will be brought to a more intensive level. There will be no joint funding and the management responsibilities in both frameworks will remain unchanged. The aim is to synchronise research and allow for mutual use of results, as technologies are increasingly of a dual-use nature for military and civilian operators”, said Alexander Weis, EDA’s Chief Executive.   The Ministerial Steering Board also discussed the ongoing activities on the European Air Transport Fleet (EATF), based on the Declaration of Intent signed by twelve Ministers in November last year. The concept has been widened from an initially envisaged fleet into a framework for military air transport related aspects with modular participation. Signature of a Letter on Intent is foreseen for November 2009. Ministers took stock of the progress made with Increasing Helicopters’ Availability: Training: the Agency’s work is on track. Lessons learned have been drawn from a multinational helicopter training exercise in the French Alps in March and from an EDA study on high end tactical synthetic training – during which 20 Czech helicopter crews have been trained in preparation for their deployment to Afghanistan later this year. The Helicopter Tactics Training Programme will be launched in 2010.  Upgrades: the Agency has presented upgrade packages for the Mi-17 helicopters. Under EDA coordination Member States concerned will now address cooperation models, with the aim of launching upgrade projects before the end of the year. Future Transport Helicopter: the German-French initiative for this helicopter has now become an EDA project, open to participation by other Member States. The aim of the FTH-project is to provide a solution for intra-theatre heavy lift capability in the years 2020+. “The Agency’s helicopters activities have already started to produce results through training. Upgrading proposals will offer additional opportunities and the Future Transport Helicopter is a very important project to find a common European solution in the longer term, perhaps even together with the United States”, said Javier Solana. The Multinational Space-based Imaging System for Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Observation (MUSIS) programme has been accepted as an EDA project in early March. Defence Ministers noted the progress made. The Agency’s involvement will focus on three elements, namely to support: (i) the extension of the programme to other Member States, in addition to the existing six MUSIS countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy and Spain); (ii) the definition of an EU requirement for space imagery, working together with the Council General Secretariat (including the EUMS); and (iii) creating synergies between MUSIS and related projects, such as the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES). The Steering Board approved a project on force protection against biological agents. This Biological Detection Identification Monitoring Equipment Development and Enhancement Programme (BIO-EDEP) is addressing an important shortfall in the CBRN Defence area, one of the 12 priorities stemming from the Capability Development Plan. Five Member States (Czech Republic, France, Germany, Netherlands and Spain) have launched the BIO-EDEP project and other Member States have expressed their intention to join. The aim of the project is to conduct a Preparation Phase, leading to a demonstrator programme and procurement of identified equipment. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2009/05/17/EDA_and_Commission_to_work_closely_together_on_research

Taking into account various stakeholder requirements, the workshop has demonstrated that the emerging area of UAS could definitely benefit from the use of multiple integrated space systems as enablers for cost-effective, sustainable and competitive UAS services. Focusing on UAS applications and satellite communications, as presented by Dr. Barnard from Barnard Microsystems Ltd, additional presentations were given related to the required C2/ATC over satellite capability by the European Space Agency (ESA), the European Defence Agency (EDA) as well as representatives of the space industry including Thales, Indra and Alenia Aeronautica on behalf of Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD). Participants were able to gain valuable insights regarding: the outcome of ESA-initiated studies in the area of Satellite-UAS cooperative missions; the outcome of the EDA-initiated Air4All initiative, and associated activities supporting the Air4All roadmap such as the EDA-led SIGAT study on spectrum issues; state-of-the art satellite communications in support of UAS; the benefits of satellite infrastructure to operators of UAS requiring BLOS (Beyond Line of Sight) operations, safety and air traffic authorities with respect to safety, security, performance and cost; the upcoming launch of coordinated feasibility studies by ESA and EDA in the area of UAS C2/ATC with a view to a demonstration mission in 2010/2011. EDA’s Armaments Director, Jukka Juusti, highlighted the cooperative spirit between the two organisations, stressing that by coordinating forces, technological challenges can be overcome and best value for money for the European taxpayer achieved.  (From left to right) Amnon Ginati, Head of ESA’s Integrated Applications Programme, Martin Stoussavljewitsch, Principal Armaments Officer, and Carlo Magrassi, EDA's Deputy Chief Executive - Strategy The strong interest triggered by this workshop and positive feedback received during the sessions are an encouragement for ESA and EDA to further exploit synergies and deliver concrete solutions for European end-users”, says Amnon Ginati, Head of ESA’s Integrated Applications Programme. The AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD) expressed its appreciation of the ESA/EDA initiative, stressing that industry recognises the importance of the communication link as a key-enabler to assure a full UAS exploitation with significant benefits for a wide range of applications in the civilian, security and defence domain. The Directorate of Telecommunications and Integrated Applications of ESA supports a number of activities related to the use of satellite systems for UAS missions. EDA has initiated the Air4All activity after being tasked by the Defence Ministers Steering Board in May 2007. Air4All is a consortium of major European aerospace companies involved in UAS activities that are working for the EDA and its participating Member States to put together a road map for the insertion of UAS in the European Airspace.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2009/05/26/Successful_outcome_of_ESA_EDA_Workshop_on_UAS_and_Satellite_Services
EDA_NEWS_1030	2009-06-12	NEWS	EDA Supported the Military Airworthiness Harmonisation Workshop	   Following the invitation of the European Union Council’s Presidency, more than 60 representatives from Military Airworthiness Authorities across Europe (EDA MAWA forum), institutional stakeholders as well as numerous aircraft industry delegates attended the Military Airworthiness Harmonisation Workshop, at Olomouc, the 5 and 6 June. This event was organised jointly by the Czech Ministry of Defence and by the European Defence Agency aimed at focusing on the way forward to harmonize the military air safety issues between the different European Union countries. “EDA’s Steering Board in Minister of Defence Formation has given to the EDA MAWA Airworthiness Forum a strong mandate to develop European Harmonised Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs). By developing and setting up common regulations and thus improving the air safety we will reduce the cost and decrease the time required for developing future air systems and as result strengthen the competitiveness of the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base”, said Jukka Juusti, EDA’s Armaments Director. Why Military Airworthiness Harmonisation? Today, each European Union Member State operates an aviation safety system independently from each other; in addition, each country is responsible for the regulation of own aircraft. As a result, all military airworthiness activities are conducted and regulated on a national basis, and any harmonisation is only achieved at individual project level.   This national approach generates many shortcomings and is the primary cause for delay and additional costs in multinational programmes. There is a unique opportunity to agree on an EU wide harmonisation and unification strategy on military airworthiness to be the benefit of governments and industry, and the overall strength of the European Defence Technology and Industrial Base (EDTIB). Stakeholder’s requirements expressed during the Workshop demonstrated that the EU wide Harmonisation of Military Airworthiness is the main interest of national Airworthiness Authorities. It is expected that a common approach will improve European military aviation safety and reduce the necessary investments and lead time for future multinational air system programmes; being thus the key enabler for cost-effective maintenance services. Focusing further on the development of a common set of European Airworthiness Requirements, the participants were able to gain valuable insights regarding the civil safety approach: EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency) policy towards civil Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and its relations to military developments in this field - presented by David Haddon; EUROCAE WG 73 (European Organization for Civil Aviation Equipment) and their airworthiness approach to civil UAS presented by Michael Allouche; EUROCONTROL (European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation) Air Traffic Management (ATM) and SESAR (Single European Sky ATM Research) activities  presented by Jorge Pereira; NATOs views on Airworthiness presented by Timothy E. Gowen; EDA’s Harmonised European Military approach to Airworthiness as tasked by the Defence Ministers in November 2008, presented by Jan Plevka, Chairman of the MAWA Forum. The workshop concluded with a final panel session compiling all participants, presenting the collected findings derived in the different work streams. The attendees received valuable feedback and views particularly from the aircraft industry, authorities and international organisations outside the MAWA Forum on the MAWA proposed approach. Some of the summarized key findings are: To determine how best to promote European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) concept; To seek quick wins based on lessons learned for promotion & collaboration; To determine when and how to engage with industry & other 3rd parties; To determine what level of trust for mutual recognition taking safety into account; Industry organisational approvals to account for civil organisational approvals where appropriate; Initiating a feasibility study associated with the formation of a European Military Joint Airworthiness Authority; Developing an equivalent MIL-HDB-516b document that points to the existing military/civil standards; Evaluate the feasibility to link MAWA procedures with the US military; Wider Engagement by EASA & EDA with NATO is seen as necessary regarding civil and Military Airworthiness harmonisation; Sense and Avoid - may become a critical issue with respect to certification and airworthiness; exchange of accident databases: Exchange of accident databases between civil and military users. (UAS only); to consider the feasibility of the exchange of information on accidents/occurrences amongst military authorities within pMS (all aircraft types).

EDA_NEWS_1031	2009-03-05	NEWS	New EDA Project on Space-Based Earth Surveillance System	 The EDA Steering Board has agreed to approve a project for the next generation European military earth observation satellites. This Multinational Space-based Imaging System (MUSIS) project has been launched by six European Union Member States: Belgium, Germany, Greece, France, Italy and Spain. The project has now become an EDA Category B project and will be open to participation of other EDA participating Member States, if their proposed contribution is acceptable to the existing contributing Members. The Agency’s Capability Development Plan (CDP) considers space-based imaging capacities essential for ESDP missions. The MUSIS project aims at establishing a multinational space-based imaging system for surveillance, reconnaissance and observation to ensure continuity of services from the current French Helios II, German SAR LUPE and Italian Cosmo-Skymed and Pléiades systems, from 2015-2017 onwards. “Space-based related assets are critical to improve European military capabilities, including for informationgathering. The approved project will be critical to ensure this capability in the longer-term and I welcome very much the initiative of the six EU Member States to bring it to EDA”, Javier Solana, Head of the Agency, said. One of the roles for EDA will be to seek synergies with earth observation programmes on the civilian side, in particular with the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme of the European Commission. “This is another example of how EDA is proving its added value, not only in bringing together participating Member States’ efforts, but connecting at the same time military to civil space agendas. We will liaise with the Commission and the European Space Agency to ensure complementarity of research and technology, and to seek other synergies“, Alexander Weis, EDA’s Chief Executive said.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2009/03/04/New_EDA_Project_on_Space-Based_Earth_Surveillance_System
EDA_NEWS_1032	2009-04-03	NEWS	Software Defined Radio Projects Presented at EDA	 Interoperability of communications between military of different nationalities, but also between military and civil operators is essential. Increasingly, the military and civilians are operating side-by side in ESDP crisis management operations. Also in support of civilian security operations (such as police, border control, disaster relief) interoperability between both user communities is needed. Software Defined Radio (SDR) technologies are developed to replace the existing radio equipment with a fully interoperable and reconfigurable radio system. The same technologies are needed for radios, used by both military and civilian users. Therefore, the European Defence agency (EDA) and the European Commission started to cooperate on SDR in 2006. The first results have been produced. During three days (from 30 of March to 1 April), the Software Defined Radio (SDR) stakeholders met at the European Defence Agency, in Brussels, under the auspices of both EDA and European Commission/DG ENTR to present the final results of the projects SCORED and WINTSEC. Complementarities between the civilian use and the military use of the SDR technologies were highlighted and new projects (as SECRICOM, ETARE, EULER, WOLF, ESSOR), which have just started, have been also presented. Up-to now, the EDA and Commission funding on this thematic area is up to (approx.) 50 million euros – this value excludes other pMS funded category B projects in the frame of EDA (like Enabling Technology for Advanced Radio in Europe, for example).	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2009/04/02/Software_Defined_Radio_Projects_Presented_at_EDA
EDA_NEWS_1033	2009-03-06	NEWS	EDA to Establish a European Satellite Communications Procurement Cell	 The European Defence Agency is preparing the establishment of a Procurement Cell to coordinate the EU Member States’ orders of commercial satellite communications services. Satellite communications are essential for ESDP crisis management operations. However, the military have to compete on a market dominated by civilian users (some 80%). Coordinating and combining EU Member States’ orders for satellite communications services will ensure better access to such services at competitive prices. The European Satellite Communications Procurement Cell will be a three-year pilot project (2010- 2012) in order to gain practical experience with centralising commercial SATCOM procurement at the EU level. The Cell’s activities could reach a business volume of at least € 30 million per year. A central booking office would initially be hosted at EDA’s premises. It would manage the technical and financial aspects of the requests and orders placed by the Member States with the capacity and service offers by satellite operators and telecom companies. After the end of the pilot period (2012) the SATCOM Procurement Cell activities are intended to be transferred to an appropriate entity for permanent operations for the EU Member States. The SATCOM Procurement Cell proposal was discussed at the Steering Board in Capabilities formation, which met on 6 March under the chairmanship of Major-General Pierre Hougardy, the Belgian Capability Director. “This is a major step in European collaboration under the roof of EDA to get better and cheaper access to commercial satellite communications services for our military crisis management operations”, Hougardy said. Capability Directors of EDA’s participating Member States also discussed the follow-on work to the Capability Development Plan, in particular the progress made with the 12 selected priorities. For most of these priorities the required activities have been identified, which will form the basis for commitments to collaborative capability improvement within the EU. “We are moving from theory to practice. Some Member States have already signed up for projects related to these priorities. Others might do this for future projects. I see increased willingness to improve European capabilities in areas like helicopters, CBRN defence, Counter- Improvised Explosive Devices and Logistics”, said Alexander Weis, EDA’s Chief Executive. The Steering Board also took stock of the progress made with the establishment of the European Air Transport Fleet, launched by the Declaration of Intent which was signed by 12 European Defence Ministers in November 2008. Capability Directors agreed a roadmap, with a Letter of Intent to be presented the near term for signature in the course of 2009.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2009/03/05/EDA_to_Establish_a_European_Satellite_Communications_Procurement_Cell
EDA_NEWS_1034	2009-03-20	NEWS	“GAP 09”: EDA conducts a multinational helicopters exercise	   A multinational helicopters exercise, conducted by the European Defence Agency and hosted by France took place from 6 to 20 March 2009 in Gap (in the Alps, South East of France). It brought together aircraft and crews from Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Hungary and Spain, as well as personnel from nine other EU Member States. At their bilateral Summit in March 2008, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and French President Nicolas Sarkozy underlined the need to improve the availability of helicopters for crisis management operations. Following this high-level meeting, the Steering Board of the European Defence Agency (EDA) selected “Increasing Availability for ESDP Operations” as one of the twelve priorities, when endorsing the Agency’s Capability Development Plan. The Agency’s work strand for near-term results is “training” to quickly improve helicopter availability. Helicopter crews in some European countries are not trained to fly in more austere conditions, such as mountainous terrain. The Agency is developing a “Helicopter Tactics Programme” (HTP) for such training at the European level. This HTP will become operational in 2010. In the context of preparing the HTP the Agency is conducting two practical exercises, with help from the two nations who started the initiative. France hosted “Gap 09” and the UK will conduct language training and operational field training in April. The aim of “Gap 09” was to develop interoperability through mutual understanding. As it was the first exercise of its type, lessons learned from the exercise will be important, in particular to assess such exercises can be organised in the future. Goals of the exercise Aircrew training, mainly on Support Helicopters (which are a specific shortfall), during their pre-deployment phase, focussing on interoperability (procedures, language and tactical skills, lessons learned and best practices sharing) and mountain flying (one of the main features of crisis management theatres of operations, where participating crews will be deployed);  Carrying out a test bed exercise with a view to building up future exercises and possible other initiatives adapted to aircrew training requirements, based on the gained experience and additional studies - currently ongoing through EDA. Participating Member States  The number of participating helicopters had been limited to fit with optimum results and facilitate a responsive exercise organisation in terms of logistics. Participating member states and helicopters were the following:  Belgium: one A 109;  Czech Republic: three Mi 17;  France: two Gazelles Viviane and up to three Tigre;  Hungary: one Mi 17;  Spain: one CH 47 and one Cougar. Moreover, “Gap 09” was supported by Luxembourg and hosted by France. Around 25 experts from Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Sweden and United Kingdom, as well as experts from other organisations (EAG, JAPCC), acting with specific roles in the exercise, also participated.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2009/03/19/GAP_09_EDA_conducts_a_multinational_helicopters_exercise

EDA_NEWS_1039	2008-12-17	NEWS	EDA Signs a Contract on Network Enabled Capabilities	   The European Defence Agency (EDA) signed today the contract for the Network Enabled Capabilities Implementation Study (NEC IS) that has been awarded to the EURONEC consortium. In an increasingly complex and challenging security environment, the European Union (EU) seeks a comprehensive approach in response to any crisis by exploiting the full range of civil and military instruments. Recognising ongoing efforts in the EU, in the Member States, and in industry, Network Enabled Capabilities (NEC) could facilitate this comprehensive approach through informed and timely decision-making and coherent execution, based on the seamless and efficient sharing and exploitation of information by competent personnel, properly tailored processes, and developed networks. Moreover, NEC is one of the 12 actions emerging from the Capability Development Plan as critical priorities for the European Union, as agreed in 2008 by the EDA participating Member States. The study will start early 2009 and will last 18 months; it will deliver a description of what future NEC will have to achieve in terms of users, information and technology (“NEC Vision”) with the overall aim of enabling a unified effort of civilian and military actors in ESDP crisis management operations. The value of the study is € 750.000. It will also deliver a “NEC Roadmap” with clear actions and milestones (2012, 2018 and beyond 2025) for an effective implementation of NEC. The EURONEC consortium consists of 6 European companies, all of which have already been successfully involved in past and present NEC initiatives in Europe: BAE Systems IST ltd (UK); EADS Deutschland GmbH (Germany); Indra Sistemas S.A. (Spain); SAAB AB (Sweden), administrative leader of the project; SELEX Sistemi Integrati SPA (Italy); THALES Communications SA (France).	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2008/12/16/EDA_Signs_a_Contract_on_Network_Enabled_Capabilities
EDA_NEWS_1040	2008-12-09	NEWS	EDA Supports European Commission’s Initiative On Anticipation of Change and Restructuring in the Defence Industry	 The European Defence Agency (EDA) participated in a Forum on 8 and 9 December 2008 in Brussels organised by the European Commission and devoted to Anticipation of Change and Restructuring in the Defence Industry. The Forum brought together the European institutions, governments, social partners, academic experts, regional and local authorities, as well as market development experts. The Agency’s Deputy Chief Executive, Adam Sowa, emphasised in his intervention the value of the initiative, complementing EDA’s efforts towards implementation of the Strategy for European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) – one of the EDA’s main goals. “We will support the Initiative mainly by providing information and expertise on the Agency’s EDTIB related work. Building on that, we can indirectly contribute to the identification of the most promising employment-related measures, particularly by giving indications on future capability needs and on where the development of human skills could be needed for the future EDTIB. However, at the end of the day it’s up to Member States, the Commission and Industry to take the right measures”, he said. On the occasion of the Forum, a “European Partnership for the Anticipation of Change in the Defence Industry” was launched. The Partnership aims at maintaining and strengthening the competitive position of EU defence industries, creating high levels of high quality jobs and reinforcing the employability of the workers of the sector, a pre-condition for sustainable growth and social cohesion.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2008/12/08/EDA_Supports_European_Commission_s_Initiative_On_Anticipation_of_Change_and_Restructuring_in_the_Defence_Industry

EDA_NEWS_1043	2008-11-12	NEWS	EDA Hosts a Chemical, Biological and Radiological Agents Exercise	 The European Defence Agency hosts an exercise on how to deal better with the effects of Chemical, Biological and Radiological or Nuclear (CBRN) agents, in Jambes, Namur, from 11 to 13 November, bringing together about 100 experts from its participating Member States. Chemical or biological agents have been used in attacks against military personnel and civilians in recent years and the threat of these weapons is likely to increase in the future. The European Defence Agency is meeting this challenge head on by running an exercise at the operational and tactical level to examine all of the issues involved with CBRN agents. Having worked for two years to develop procedures and practices, they are now being put into practice at a high level headquarters based exercise. Military experts from across the European Union are gathered to refine these procedures and to exchange ideas on the best way to address an attack of this nature. Although primarily focused on deployed operations, the exercise takes the opportunity to share ideas on homeland defence from different European institutions and other agencies. Representatives from NATO are also sharing their experiences and ensuring that their work goes hand in hand with that the European Defence Agency. The exercise runs from 11 to 13 November and three scenarios are examined in order to test simulating different combinations of chemical, biological and radiological substances to enhance agents’ capabilities. Each scenario runs through several mock headquarters set up to test reactions and procedure to incidents. The exercise has tactical level demonstrations of mock incidents dealt with by the Royal Belgian Army, who has significant experience in dealing with chemical weapons left over from World War 1. This is a unique platform for experts from both the CBRN arena and the Explosives Ordnance Disposal (EOD) or bomb disposal communities to share their ideas and experiences. The result should produce a robust template for the management of incidents which will allow procedures to be developed for operational level headquarters for multi-national EU led operations. Recent EDA work includes a concept for the EOD containing CBRN materials. A concept for the Detection Identification and Monitoring of Biological agents and work on a dual protection of Individual Protective Equipment (IPE) against both explosives and CBRN agents for bomb disposal operators. More recently work has started on a programme for the development of a biological agent detection equipment programme.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2008/11/11/EDA_Hosts_a_Chemical_Biological_and_Radiological_Agents_Exercise
EDA_NEWS_1044	2008-11-10	NEWS	European Air Transport Fleet Launched	" European Defence Ministers, meeting in the Steering Board of the European Defence Agency, launched today concrete initiatives and projects for improving European military capabilities. Decisions were taken on programmes related to air transport, maritime surveillance and helicopters, amongst others. ""This is the concrete follow-up to the discussions which took place at the Informal EU Defence Ministers meeting in Deauville early October. We are seeing today that the Agency can very quickly translate political intentions into concrete proposals. These programmes will create tangible European capabilities and improve the capacity for crisis management operations”, said Head of the Agency Javier Solana, who chaired the meeting. European Air Transport Fleet European Defence Ministers launched today EDA work on establishing a European Air Transport Fleet (EATF). A Declaration of Intent on participation in the initiative was signed by Defence Ministers of Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Spain. The EATF aims at reducing European air transport shortfalls by pooling aircraft such as the A400M and C130. Participation can take different forms: making aircraft available; purchasing, providing or exchanging flying hours; or to provide and benefit from shared and/or pooled support functions (training, maintenance, etc.). Milestones have been set with the aim of reaching EATF initial operational capability by the next decade. “The EATF Declaration is most welcome, as pooling European aircraft and services will improve the lift capabilities and alleviate a significant European shortfall”, said Alexander Weis, the Agency’s Chief Executive. Maritime Mine Counter-Measures The Steering Board also launched two other projects. Ten Member States (Belgium, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Sweden) plus Norway will work closely together in an EDA project for the future replacement of their maritime mine counter-measures capabilities in an EDA project. Activities will commence with an assessment phase, leading to recommendations for the selection of systems solutions and addressing all relevant aspects. Mine counter-measures in littoral sea areas has been identified as one of the initial 12 prioritised actions in the context of the Agency’s Capability Development Plan (CDP). Future Unmanned Aerial System Another project, related to Maritime Surveillance, is the launch of work for a Future Unmanned Aerial System. Based on common requirements, seven Member States (Finland, France, Germany, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden) will begin the preparations for the development of an unmanned aerial system, which will be able to take off and land on a ship’s deck. This future system will increase the capability for wide area surveillance in support of ESDP operations, a need which has been identified in the Capability Development Plan. Space-based Earth Surveillance System Five Member States (Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Spain) signed a Letter of Intent on the second generation of space-based imaging capacity. This Multinational Space-based Imaging System for surveillance, reconnaissance and observation (MUSIS) project aims at continuity of service from 2015 onwards. The MUSIS partners intend to launch an EDA Category B project on the basis on their initiative, which will be open for other Member States' participation. Helicopters The Steering Board endorsed a roadmap for the Helicopter Tactics Training Programme, part of the Agency’s work to improve availability of helicopters for ESDP operations. The contents of this programme will be defined in the course of 2009, based on the results of two studies – focussing on the requirements – and the lessons learned from an exercise, to take place in France in spring 2009. The Programme itself will start in 2010. “The Agency is quickly progressing with its helicopter work. The Helicopter Tactics Programme is proving that in some cases training can provide additional capabilities in the short-term. Improving ESDP capabilities does not always require new equipment”, said Alexander Weis, EDA’s Chief Executive. Ministers also took stock of the progress made on the Agency’s work on upgrading helicopters, with the aim to offer a detailed menu with upgrade options by spring 2009. Germany and France informed the Steering Board of their intent to bring their bilateral initiative for a Future Transport Helicopter into the Agency in the near future, opening up the project to other interested Member States. The project aims at developing intra-theatre transport helicopter for the 2020+ timeframe. European Defence Research and Technology Strategy Ministers endorsed the European Defence Research and Technology (EDRT) Strategy to enhance and develop more effective research collaboration to deliver timely the right technologies in support of military capabilities. The Strategy defines “ends” (key technologies to invest in), “means” (how to invest better, such as through improved R&T collaborations) and “ways” (roadmaps and action plans). Four of the 12 priority actions of the Capability Development Plan have been chosen for identifying potential R&T projects: Counter-Man Portable Air-Defence Systems (C-MANPADS), Mine Counter- Measures, Counter-Improvised Explosive Devices (C-IED) and Chemical, Biological and Radiological or Nuclear (CBRN) - specifically detection of biological weapons. The EDRT Strategy completes the EDA work on its strategic framework. With the CDP as the overall strategic tool this framework consists of the EDRT Strategy, the Armaments Cooperation Strategy (endorsed in October 2008) and the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base Strategy (endorsed in May 2007). Innovative Concepts and Emerging Technologies Ten Member States (Cyprus, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain) plus Norway signed the Programme Arrangement for the Joint Investment Programme on Innovative Concepts and Emerging Technologies (JIP-ICET). The Programme aims at promoting basic research cooperation, for example on an integrated navigation architecture and on nanotechnologies for soldier protection. Forum for Military Airworthiness Authorities Ministers decided to create a European Union-wide Forum for Military Airworthiness Authorities. This Forum will be used to harmonise the different national military airworthiness regulations within the European Union in order to stop duplication of work, to reduce costs and to shorten timelines for multinational procurement. Work Programme The Steering Board approved the Agency’s Work Programme for 2009. The focus of the Work Programme is on concrete projects, in particular related to the 12 prioritised actions stemming from the Capability Development Plan. The Agency will have a 2009 budget of € 30m, including € 8m operational budget for studies, and will recruit ten new staff. The budget was adopted by the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Defence Ministers formation. Defence Data 2007 Ministers were informed on the results of the Agency’s defence data-collecting for 2007 and on the assessment of the collective benchmarks for Defence R&T and equipment procurement. A dedicated brochure has been released."	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2008/11/09/European_Air_Transport_Fleet_Launched
EDA_NEWS_1045	2008-10-16	NEWS	EU Governments Agree on an Armaments Cooperation Strategy	" European Union National Armaments Directors (NADs) yesterday endorsed a strategy to promote and enhance effective European armaments Co-operation in support of the ESDP. The Strategy has three aims: firstly, it will help to generate, promote and facilitate co-operation through a dedicated programme preparation phase. This phase is crucial, as early decisions are needed in order to reduce overall programme costs, to realise shortest possible timescales and have maximum performance. The second aim is related to the European Defence Industrial and Technological Base. A solid EDTIB is a prerequisite for effective European armaments co-operation. This includes greater transparency and mutual understanding between governments and industries. And a third strategic aim builds on the previous work of the Agency in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the armaments co-operation more generally. ""The Agency has worked together with its shareholders in preparing an Armaments Strategy that provides a solid foundation for improving the way we conduct armaments cooperation in Europe. Applying the ‘Guide to the Conduct of a Programme Preparation Phase’ is a major step in translating the many facets of the Strategy into tangible action,"" said Eero Lavonen, who chaired the meeting. An intrinsic part of the Strategy is the Europe Defence Test and Evaluation Base (DTEB). The Steering Board approved a Conceptual Guide for DTEB to target priority areas, coordinate investments, encourage reciprocal use of facilities and create a network of Test and Evaluation capabilities, with the aim of having a consolidated and coherent European DTEB by 2030. The National Armaments Directors further underlined that Small and Medium-sized Enterprises are vital for an innovative and competitive European Defence Technological and Industrial Base. The EDA Steering Board therefore agreed on developing a number of measures aimed at supporting increased involvement of SMEs and non-traditional suppliers in the EDTIB. Contracting policies that will enhance SMEs opportunities to win contracts will be further analysed, and an experts’ working group will develop Common Guidelines for simplification and harmonisation of tendering and contracting processes related to lower value contracts. In addition the Agency will develop an armaments cooperation driven IT platform to enable industry to propose solutions to pMS priorities. One key enabler is the Code of Best Practice in the Supply Chain which will be promoted more vigorously by Governments. They will also decide on a new publication threshold for the EBB in support of SMEs at their next meeting in the spring 2009. ”I think it is of great value that the NADs fully recognise the importance of SMEs for a competitive EDTIB. It is necessary to create conditions allowing SMEs and non-traditional suppliers to fully exploit market possibilities. EDA, supported by industry experts, has identified the right kind of measures.” said Chief Executive Alexander Weis. The EDA Steering Board also reviewed today the report in the implementation of the Code of Conduct Regime on Defence Procurement which, together with its IT tool the Electronic Bulletin Board (EBB) came into effect on 1 July 2006. The assessment of the overall implementation of the Regime is positive and, in general, subscribing Member States (sMS) have adapted their procurement practices to the CoC’s provisions. The volume of Government contract opportunities posted on the EBB has steadily grown. By 1 September 2008, 18 of the 26 sMS had published more than 340 contract opportunities. As of the same date, 127 out of the 340 Contract Notices published by the sMS for competition had already been awarded for a total value of €2.3bn (excl. VAT), 28 being cross-border awarded contracts. There is still limited cross-border bidding by industry – only in one-third of the opportunities which is a main explanation to the relatively low number of cross-border awards. Nevertheless, in 70% of the cases when there are cross-border bidders, the contract is cross-border awarded. EDA has been also informed by 1 September 2008 of 222 government contracts falling under the exceptions to the CoC for a total value of €2.5bn (excl. VAT), mostly for “supplementary goods and services” and “follow-on work”, which seems to be a reasonable and relatively restrictive use of the follow-on exceptions. The Code of Best Practice in the Supply Chain (CoBPSC) and its EBB associated part (Industry-to-Industry contract opportunities) is still experiencing a slow growth in terms of publications, although it enjoys support by industry as a beneficial tool. The Agency continues its activities to increase awareness on the EBB2, including through the recently launched Call Centre which has already contacted about 2,000 defence-related companies. The Steering Board reviewed ongoing EDA work on improving the availability of helicopters for ESDP operations. The NATO Assistant Secretary General for Defence Investment, Peter Flory, briefed the Steering Board on NATO’s ongoing activities on helicopters."	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2008/10/15/EU_Governments_Agree_on_an_Armaments_Cooperation_Strategy
EDA_NEWS_1046	2008-07-08	NEWS	EU Governments Endorse Capability Plan for Future Military Needs, Pledge Joint Efforts	   European Union governments today endorsed a Capability Development Plan (CDP) defining the future military needs and priorities of European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) and agreed to use it to guide future national defence investment decisions and to seek opportunities to collaborate so as to address their short-to-longer-term military requirements coherently. The CDP, developed over the past 18 months by the European Defence Agency, its 26 participating Member States (pMS), the EU Military Committee and the EU Council General Secretariat, contains a significant body of analysis from which conclusions and an initial tranche of practical proposals for action have been derived. It was presented to a meeting of the EDA’s Steering Board, made up of directors of capability planning from the 26 pMS. “The CDP provides the picture all Member States need to take into account when planning future capability development agendas and finding the right balance between ambition and resources. Linking theory to practice is a job for everyone,” said Javier Solana, Head of the Agency. “It is quite clear, however, that the CDP is not a supranational military equipment or capability plan which aims to replace national defence plans and programmes. It should support, not replace national decision-making,” he added. The CDP is an attempt to address the well-documented fragmentation in demand for European military capabilities, caused in part by a lack of coordinated military requirements and comprehensive priorities. It builds on the EDA’s Long-Term Vision report, published in 2006. Among its principal conclusions are the importance of intelligence and information-sharing during operations in complex environments; the need for flexible and agile responses to unpredictable threats; the requirement to coordinate military and civilian activities in crisis management operations; and the challenge of recruiting talented and well-qualified personnel for the armed forces. As part of the effort, Member States contributed to a database of the national programmes and priorities, which has initially revealed a large number of different areas where more than one country was working on similar ideas. The meeting agreed with the Agency’s proposals for how the appropriate collaboration could be encouraged in each of these areas. The Steering Board agreed on 12 topics for specific action, such as countermeasures against improvised explosive devices, computer network defence and medical support, and asked the Agency to prepare a detailed way forward for each set of priorities. “A capability-driven Agency means: investing in and delivering those capabilities which the CDP has listed as the needs for tomorrow, both in the short and the longer term,” said EDA Chief Executive Alexander Weis. Separately, the Steering Board also reviewed progress on existing initiatives designed to address capability needs whose importance was underlined by the CDP. To improve the availability of helicopters for EU operations, the meeting agreed to a series of measures on helicopter training, which would allow cooperation between Member States and increase the operational availability of aircrew, and on upgrading existing aircraft. The Steering Board considered a report on Network-Enabled Capabilities – the use of information technology to link all actors in an operation together so that information can be reliably shared – and agreed that the Agency should fund a study on how the NEC concept could be implemented. The NEC concept described in the report lays particular stress on the potential such technologies to support a unified effort of civilian and military entities involved in operations. Protection against sea mines, maritime surveillance, biological agent detection and combating terrorist bombs were among the force protection issues discussed as areas where the Agency is developing significant capabilities to enhance the operational effectiveness of European military forces. Following an EDA conference this year on the role of third-party commercial support for logistics, the Steering Board agreed to set up a trial of a European Support Platform for connecting industry with planners and commanders to provide help to meet the logistics requirements of EU operations. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2008/07/07/EU_Governments_Endorse_Capability_Plan_for_Future_Military_Needs_Pledge_Joint_Efforts
EDA_NEWS_1047	2008-06-11	NEWS	EDA Holds Symposium On Biological Detection, Identification And Monitoring	 Experts in Biological Detection Identification and Monitoring have held a unique gathering to underline the European Union’s commitment to protecting forces deployed on ESDP operations from biological attack, with the aim of addressing this key capability requirement through European collaboration.   A symposium organised by the European Defence Agency and hosted by the Bundeswehr Research Institute for Protection Technologies and NBC Protection from 9-11 June in Munster, Lower Saxony, Germany, provided an opportunity for all stakeholders to examine issues and challenges and identify potential collaborative solutions. “Our armed forces must be prepared to operate in all threat environments and the discussions at this symposium should lead to concrete actions to improve their ability to counter the biological threat,” said EDA Chief Executive Alexander Weis. The event brought together key European industrial and military actors, including senior members of the armed forces in CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear) issues, to share information on concepts, operational requirements and current and future capability development for enhancing individual and unit protection against biological attack. Experts from the European Commission Directorate of Justice, Freedom and Security also took part in the debates, looking for synergies with the military in enhancing the protection of civilians from biological asymmetric attack. North American observers attended to share their experiences. “The capability to detect threats and to respond to them is the key to determining where and how we should invest our resources,” said Rear Admiral Heinrich Lange of the German Ministry of Defence in his keynote speech at the symposium. Jon Mullin, EDA Capabilities Director said he hoped the symposium would be the kick-off for a process leading to an operational Biological Defence Capability in the field, through European collaboration. It was agreed that a high level of expertise exists within the EU and that the most effective way to enhance capability in the CBRN arena was to harness that expertise. This led to recognition of a common interest in developing collaborations between Member States in this area.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2008/06/10/EDA_Holds_Symposium_On_Biological_Detection_Identification_And_Monitoring

EDA_NEWS_1049	2008-05-26	NEWS	EDA Agrees on Norway’s Participation in Regime on Defence Procurement	 European Union Defence Ministers agreed today to allow non-EU member Norway to participate in the Regime on Defence Procurement, under which governments and industry voluntarily commit to more open cross-border competition for defence equipment contracts. The decision was taken at a ministerial Steering Board meeting of the European Defence Agency (EDA), to which all EU members except Denmark belong. The EDA administers the Regime and operates the Electronic Bulletin Board (EBB) portal on which contracting opportunities are advertised. “We are delighted that Norway will be participating in the Regime, which will help our efforts to open the European Defence Equipment Market and further strengthen our Defence Technological and Industrial Base,” said Head of the Agency Javier Solana, who chaired the meeting. Norway has an Administrative Arrangement for cooperation with the EDA. Although not a member of the EU, it participates in its European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) in many ways, contributing troops to ESDP operations and forming part of the EU Nordic Battle Group. “It is a privilege for Norway, as the first country outside the European Union, to be able to participate in the Regime on Defence Procurement and its Code of Conduct, fostering transparent and integrated defence markets,” said Norwegian Defence Minister Anne-Grete Strom-Erichsen. “By committing ourselves to the level playing field of the Regime, and on the basis of our relatively high defence expenditure and competitive defence industry, I am sure that the development of the European Defence Equipment Market will benefit from our participation,” she added. The non-legally binding Regime has been in effect since 1 July 2006 and has two main parts: a Code of Conduct for government procurement contracts, which requires equal treatment for companies from all countries subscribing to the regime according to clear and transparent criteria; and a Code of Best Practice in the Supply Chain, under which the defence industry applies the same principles to sub-contracting opportunities. That part of the EBB portal was implemented in March 2007. The Norwegian Defence and Security Industries Association (FSi), representing the country’s defence industry, has endorsed the Code of Best Practice in the Supply Chain and will work with companies to ensure that it is implemented. The Steering Board also welcomed a report on the operation of the Regime and noted that the overall assessment was positive. Governments have so far published more than 260 contract opportunities based on open competition, worth more than €10 billion. Although only in its early stages, the supply chain code had seen 12 different companies posting 30 formal sub-contracting notices on EBB2, and 13 more companies had advertised a further 123 potential opportunities. The Steering Board asked the Agency to continue monitoring the implementation of the Regime, particularly to see whether high value contracts would be awarded across borders by governments and suggested possible improvements in a number of areas which might lead to an increase in cross-border bidding. “The decision by Norway to participate in the Regime, following a similar decision by Bulgaria last month, shows the strength of commitment to the concept,” said EDA Chief Executive Alexander Weis. “A cultural change towards transparency and publication for cross-border competition is being achieved.”	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2008/05/25/EDA_Agrees_on_Norway_s_Participation_in_Regime_on_Defence_Procurement
EDA_NEWS_1050	2008-05-26	NEWS	EDA Establishes New Joint R&T Programme on Disruptive Defence Technologies	" European governments agreed today to establish a new Joint Investment Programme (JIP) for research into emerging technologies which might have a disruptive effect on the battlefield, using an innovative structure devised by the European Defence Agency to boost collaborative European efforts on defence Research & Technology. A ministerial meeting of the EDA’s Steering Board approved the new two-year programme, building on the experience from first JIP launched in 2006 which focuses on the protection of armed forces. 11 European countries will contribute to the new initiative, which will be funded by a common budget of €15.5 million. ""I am delighted to see that this new way of collaborating in a more integrated and efficient way has proved its worth and is being repeated,” said Javier Solana, the Head of the Agency, who chaired the meeting of defence ministers.  “Investing more in Defence R&T and spending more together will be achieved only through this kind of pragmatic approach."". The new JIP on Innovative Concepts and Emerging Technologies will look into technologies such as nano-materials and structures, remote detection and health monitoring. The JIP structure features a management board which decides how funds are to be allocated for individual projects with no pre-determined formula about how much will be spend in each contributing country."	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2008/05/25/EDA_Establishes_New_Joint_R_T_Programme_on_Disruptive_Defence_Technologies
EDA_NEWS_1051	2008-02-20	NEWS	EDA, EU Satcen Demonstrate Potential for System to Integrate Intelligence Imagery	   “The European Defence Agency and the EU Satellite Centre today demonstrated how intelligence images from many sources and in multiple formats could in the future be delivered to a single workstation at headquarters or in the field, in support of EU operations. The demonstration of the initial functionalities of the Tactical Imagery Exploitation System (TIES) system took place at the EU Satellite Centre (SatCen) in Torrejon, Spain, which is expected to be one of the main potential EU users of any such system in the future. “Geospatial intelligence is a key enabler for effective ESDP operations. The TIES workstation is a major step forward in bringing that capability to operational decision-makers,” said Frank Asbeck, Director of SATCEN. “We are delighted to be working with EU Satellite Centre on this initiative, which demonstrates how this kind of European collaboration can produce real practical benefits both for our Member States and the institutions responsible for supporting EU operations,” EDA Chief Executive Alexander Weis said in Torrejon. The project is the result of a decision by the EDA Steering Board in May 2006, which recognised the need for a workstation for Imagery Analysis, capable of receiving imagery data in different formats and fusing it into one usable and workable Intelligence product. It aims to compensate the for lack of interoperability between imagery-producing I SR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) systems and ground terminals. Currently many systems can link only to a single, dedicated ground terminal that is not able to receive and process any data coming from other sources. The demonstrator will remain available at SatCen so that individual participating Member States will be able to evaluate the product. They have offered to provide trained imagery analysts or have made available tactical imagery data to be used to test the system. The trials will end in September 2008. A separate Ad Hoc Project Management Group on TIES has been established to discuss the results, and to propose any modifications if necessary. Demonstration Day of the Tactical Imagery Exploitation System (TIES). Officials from the European Defence Agency, the EU Satellite Centre and European governments attending a Demonstration Day of the Tactical Imagery Exploitation System (TIES) at SatCen in Torrejon, Spain, on 20 Februrary 2008. TIES Project Background The aim of the contract is to deliver a TIES demonstration/experiment based at EU SatCen in order to spur wider adoption of such capability within the EU ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition And Reconnaissance) community, with the following specific sub-objectives: To reduce technical risk and identify organisational and operational consequences associated with the introduction of TIES to Deployed Force structures, so as to encourage procurement of a capability which improves operational efficiency, effectiveness and interoperability. To prove the basic functionality of an EU Imagery Architecture. Trial Objectives The trial is a Concept Capability Demonstrator (CCD). The objectives of the trial are to demonstrate: The utilities of TIES for tasks in all phases of a developing crisis, simulating the use of TIES at the EU SatCen, at an Operational HQ, at a Field HQ preparing for deployment, and then in the field close to an FHQ or to tactical ground receiving stations. That a bespoke, tailored Imagery Product Library (IPL), based on EU SatCen library product, can be uploaded into an imagery management system within TIES. That an imagery analyst working on the TIES can manipulate and analyse imagery, using both the IPL and imagery from tactical sensors, to produce tailored imagery products (e.g. annotated imagery) and intelligence text reports, in response to specific Requests for Information (RFIs) from a commander or other customer. That the TIES can import and process a representative range of current tactical imagery data formats. This importation should be direct, via a network, or via various electro-optical/electro-magnetic media (e.g. DVD, CD and floppy discs) and legacy wet-film products digitised internally within the TIES system. That IPL updates and other imagery data can be transmitted from the EU SatCen to the TIES, and that the tactical imagery data imported onto the TIES can be transmitted to the EU SatCen for further exploitation and manipulation. That intelligence reports (including annotated imagery) and RFIs can be both received and sent from and to the TIES workstation via for demonstration purposes the EU OPSWAN. EU Satellite Center Background The European Union Satellite Centre (SatCen) is an Agency of the European Union which works in the frame of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, especially in support of the European Security and Defence Policy. It provides geospatial intelligence products and services to the Council of the EU, the Member States, the Commission, Third States1 and international organisations. EU SatCen works complementarily to, and in cooperation with, the geospatial intelligence resources of Member States. 1 Third States' are non-EU European NATO members and other States which are candidates for accession to the EU	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2008/02/19/EDA_EU_Satcen_Demonstrate_Potential_for_System_to_Integrate_Intelligence_Imagery
EDA_NEWS_1052	2008-04-25	NEWS	Bulgaria Joins Code of Conduct for European Defence Equipment Market	 The European Defence Agency announced today that Bulgaria has joined the inter-governmental regime for defence procurement taking the number of subscribers to 25 out of the EDA’s 26 Member States. The voluntary regime is designed to increase transparency and competition, offer armed forces and taxpayers better value for money, broaden business opportunities for defence-related companies of all sizes and help to strengthen the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base. Since the regime came into force in mid-2006, governments have advertised more than 260 contract opportunities on the European Bulletin Board online portal (www.eda.europa.eu/ebb), which is operated by the Agency. Last year, 60 of the published opportunities were also awarded with a value of more than 600 million euro and more than 25% of them being cross-border awarded. Since March 2007, the EBB has also displayed industry-to-industry sub-contracting opportunities for defence equipment under the Code of Best Practice in the Supply Chain, which extends the benefits of a more transparent and competitive market to smaller companies and suppliers across Europe. To date, some 150 such opportunities have been advertised on the EBB with a value of approximately 150 M euro. “We are very pleased that Bulgaria has decided to join the regime. New Member States and their defence industries have an important role to play,” said EDA Chief Executive Alexander Weis. “The regime is designed to deliver better value for customers in all countries and to provide new opportunities for industries from all parts of the EU and for companies large and small.”	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2008/04/24/Bulgaria_Joins_Code_of_Conduct_for_European_Defence_Equipment_Market

Against that background, the role of the Steering Board is vital – to guide and encourage the Agency, and to ensure the continued commitment and support of the participating Member States.” Lind said: “I appreciate the importance of this assignment and I will do everything to help the Steering Board in R&T Directors formation deliver on the high expectations of the Head of the Agency and the participating Member States.” Lind will chair his first R&T Steering Board on 8 April.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2008/03/06/Jan-Olof_Lind_Appointed_to_Chair_EDA_Research_and_Technology_Directors_Steering_Board
EDA_NEWS_1054	2008-05-06	NEWS	EDA Chief Executive Alexander Weis Outlines EDA Agenda at a Colloquium in Helsinki	 Thank you for inviting me to this Colloquium. I feel at home in Helsinki, because Finland has been a staunch supporter of the European Defence Agency from the beginning. It actively contributes to many EDA activities and projects, and we have several excellent Finnish nationals working at EDA, including since January this year Jukka Juusti as new Armaments Director. And, of course, I have to mention your National Armaments Director, Eero Lavonen, who continues to serve the Agency as the Chairman of our Steering Board in NADs formation. So, I am very happy to explain to you what EDA is about and what we are doing. In the simplest terms, EDA is the “back office” for the European Security and Defence Policy – ESDP. Its task is to improve the military capabilities needed to carry out ESDP operations. So, let me say a few words on EDA in general – its functions, how it operates and how it fits in the family of European institutions. I will then point to our achievements so far and our 2008 agendas. EDA General The European Defence Agency is an intergovernmental Agency. It can only function and succeed in close cooperation with its participating Member States. They are the key shareholders. This implies that EDA has a limited role, but an important one. It coordinates, it stimulates and promotes cooperation between the Member States, and it provides the common tent under which European collaborations can take place. Logically, the Agency is controlled by the Member States. In our case it is not the Council but the Agency’s Steering Board. That is the place where decisions are taken and guidance is given. The Steering Board is composed of 26 Ministers of Defence and meets at least twice per year, normally back-to-back with the half-yearly meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Defence Ministers composition. Javier Solana is the Head of the Agency and chairs the Ministerial Steering Board meetings. Furthermore, the Steering Board meets at sub-ministerial levels: Capability Directors, National Armaments Directors and Research & Technology Directors. The EDA is small in size and budget. We have just under 100 staff and our functional budget is around € 20 million. In addition we have a few million to spend on studies, mainly to investigate potential for future collaborations between the Member States (what we call pre-feasibility studies). Nevertheless, EDA has a wide set of functional responsibilities. Our four functional areas are: Harmonisation of military requirements, Promoting Joint Defence Research and Technology, Promoting Armaments Cooperation, and Creating a European Defence Equipment Market and strengthening the European Defence Industrial Base. The founding fathers of the Agency have given us these four functional areas because we need to make progress on all four of them together to improve military capabilities. For you it may sound simple and logical. But I can tell you that in many European countries, military planners, research establishments, Industry & Markets experts and those responsible for acquisition (the Armaments Directorates) still live in separate worlds. So, what we call the Integrated Way of Working, with representatives of these four disciplines working closely together at the European level, is in fact breaking with the past. It is crucial to our success. But let me underline that EDA will remain a capability-driven Agency. The Agency works closely with defence industries, but will not become a tool they can steer as they want. Rather, it will work in the opposite direction. Any projects or programmes we launch must be viewed through the lens of the capabilities needed by the military. EDA – Achievements and 2008 Agendas I would now like to focus on our achievements which are quite notable considering that we have been operating for barely three years. Taking up the last remark on a capability-driven Agency with a particular focus beyond the near term, one of the first notable outputs of the EDA was the Long Term Vision, a report which was endorsed by European Defence Ministers in October 2006. It describes in general terms what sort of challenges Europe will face in 10 to 20 years from now and what these challenges mean for the capabilities we need. You can find the complete Long Term Vision on our website. The LTV is now being elaborated into a more detailed Capability Development Plan (the CDP), to be approved in early July this year. It is not a plan in the traditional sense. It will not subscribe the numbers of tanks, aircraft and ships the Member States should have. That is Cold War defence planning. Rather, the CDP will provide a global picture of capability needs, capability trends and capability shortfalls. At the same time it will provide “actionable conclusions”, setting the agendas for real programmes and early opportunities for collaborations between the Member States. And, naturally, we expect the Member States to take the CDP into account when developing or adjusting their national defence plans. On Defence Research & Technology, we have actually made more progress with concrete results than with the theoretical basis. We hope that in November this year Ministers will approve a European Defence Research & Technology Strategy, describing both the ends – the technologies European countries should invest in -- and the means -- how they should invest more effectively and do more together. And, in a few weeks from now, we hope to get approval from Defence Ministers on a list of key technologies Europe needs to preserve or develop so that we are not dependent on non-European suppliers for these critical elements. But, as I said, we have made a great breakthrough in the practical field, namely by launching the Defence R&T Joint Investment Programme on Force Protection (the ‘JIP’). It was approved in November 2006, with 19 of the Member States plus Norway joining the Programme. We are very pleased that Finland is among the participants. Together they have made some € 55 million available, to be invested in technology research in support of specific Force Protection capability aims. The programme is an excellent example of close cooperation between the military and researchers. It also is a breakthrough in another sense. In traditional collaborative research efforts, contributors sometimes seemed as concerned with ensuring that their share of the funds was spent on activities in their countries as on the final results of the efforts. Under the JIP, projects are allocated to bidders by a management board of all contributors, based on competition. And the R&T institutions or laboratories have to create consortia with others to be able to bid, including at least one SME-type institution or industry. In that way the JIP also helps to generate more R&T networking in Europe. In short: the JIP is a great success and, in 2008, we hope to launch a second Joint Investment Programme, demonstrating that we are making progress in spending better and spending more together on Defence R&T. On the Industry and Market side, the biggest achievement is the Regime on Defence Procurement and its Code of Conduct. The Code has created a step-change in opening up the European Defence Equipment Market, which until recently was exempt from the normal single market competition rules under Article. 296 of the European Communities Treaty and was therefore effectively a series of national markets, not a European one. The Code has now been up and running for more than a year-and-a-half. Governments have advertised about 260 contract opportunities on our online portal, the Electronic Bulletin Board, with a value over €10 billion. Finland[A1]  is an active contributor to the EBB. We have seen so far 16 cross-border awards of contracts and, naturally, we would like to see that number increasing in support of our aim to make the EDEM more transparent and more competitive  [A1]Check how much advertised by Finland and whether any cross-border awards. Also in this area, last May Ministers approved the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base or the EDTIB Strategy, which gives direction towards realising a stronger, more competent and more competitive EDTIB. There is now consensus on the need for more interdependence in the European DTIB as well as less dependence on non-European key industrial capabilities. Of course, the question is “how to get there?” We are working on the basis of a set of roadmaps to take the work forward in a practical sense. A crucial activity is to define the key industrial capabilities in Europe, which will also contribute to improving long-term Security of Supply, and, therefore, to increasing European autonomy. The first sector we will focus on is “Future Air Systems”, simply because discussions with our Member States have shown that most views converge on the future importance of this key industrial capability in Europe. A major specific item this year is EDA work on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or UAVs. We hope to realise a breakthrough in a topic that nobody so far has tackled in an all-inclusive way, namely the insertion of UAVs into normal air space. This is an issue with many dimensions: legal and regulatory elements – not for the Agency to arrange but the Agency might bring them to the fore; certification procedures – a standard for certification could be developed by EDA; and, of course, new technologies needed to ensure that UAVs can fly in regulated air space with the same safety guarantees as manned aircraft – such as ‘Sense and Avoid’ technologies, an area where the Agency has early results from a study conducted in the recent past. This coming spring, another study will deliver the full picture of what is needed for insertion of UAVs into regulated air space. Based on the study results EDA will define a business case. This business case will be used to spend € 6 million, which have been earmarked in the Agency’s 2008 budget. And UAVs form a good example how we work closely together with the European Commission. Why? Because the Commission is investing money under the European Security Research Programme for future needs of UAVs for civil use (for example for border control, disaster relief, and so on). It would be foolish to miss the opportunity to harmonise civil and military requirements. And it would be even worse to spend money twice on developing comparable technologies. And there are other areas where we are coordinating closely with the Commission to seek civil-military synergies (for example on Software Defined Radio and Maritime Surveillance). An output-oriented Agency A final remark. Ultimately, the success of the Agency will be measured by more and better European capabilities becoming available to the EU. But such success will not come naturally. The Agency will do whatever it can, but we depend absolutely on our participating Member States. First of all, we need them to bring forward suggestions for real projects which are important to them and which can bring real results and deliver real capabilities. Even more important, it is national governments who have to decide how to spend their money and what to spend it on, so they invest in the right capabilities and increase cooperation with others. As I said at the beginning of my talk, here, in Finland, I feel at home and I am preaching to the converted. But I call on all of you to assist the Agency and in your contacts, both inside and outside Finland, to convince others of the need to work more closely together in Europe for the benefit of all. Thank you very much for your attention. Now I would be happy to address any questions you might have.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2008/05/05/EDA_Chief_Executive_Alexander_Weis_Outlines_EDA_Agenda_at_a_Colloquium_in_Helsinki
EDA_NEWS_1055	2008-04-09	NEWS	EU Governments ask EDA for Armaments Strategy, agree Steps for More Defence Collaboration	 EU governments today asked the European Defence Agency to produce an Armaments Strategy to help meet future military needs, ensure interoperability and standardization, and share the ever-increasing costs of developing and procuring high-technology defence equipment. A two-day meeting of the EDA Steering Board also agreed a number of specific measures to intensify defence collaboration, including work on key technologies and industrial capabilities to be retained or developed in Europe, rules to help greater sharing of testing facilities, actions to encourage more cross-border bids for defence equipment contracts, and further investments in the Agency’s work on Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs). “The Agency and its shareholders have done a great job so far in developing strategies and policies, and significant progress is visible in R&T and the defence market,” said Eero Lavonen, who chaired the meeting’s second day with National Armaments Directors. “It is high time to boost armaments cooperation under EDA’s auspices. We have a tool at our disposal and we must use it fully.” Jan-Olof Lind, who chaired meeting of R&T Directors on the first day, was satisfied that good progress has been made in implementing the Framework for a Joint European Strategy in Defence R&T, adopted by the Steering Board last November.  He also stressed the need for the Agency’s 26 participating Member States (all EU members except Denmark) to share information on specific initiatives they were planning or developing. “This can only enhance transparency and increase potential for cooperation – which is part of the Agency’s overall objective. It is time to see new and more significant cooperative projects and programmes under the Agency,” he said. The Armaments Strategy, which will focus in particular on how to convert agreed defence capability needs into collaborative programmes, will be presented in November to a ministerial meeting of the Steering Board, the Agency’s highest decision-making body on which governments and the European Commission are represented. Among the other steps agreed during the meeting were rules and procedures for governments to share test and evaluation facilities for military equipment, which have traditionally been developed and operated on a purely national basis.  Lavonen welcomed the fact that France had last week announced plans for a test programme for integrated equipment on aircraft and encouraged other governments to share information about future testing projects. The meeting heard a report on the first full year of operation of the Code of Conduct to encourage cross-border defence procurement and the associated online portals (see Appendix 1 for highlights). The Steering Board said the overall implementation had been positive, with subscribing Member States adapting their practices to conform with the Code. The Code had brought real change to the way procurement happens. The volume of government contract opportunities posted on the EDA’s Electronic Bulletin Board (EBB) had steadily grown, with 18 of the 24 subscribing governments publishing more than 260 contract opportunities. In 2007, 60 contracts worth €616 million were already awarded as a result of competition and 16 of them were cross-border, although there was still only limited cross-border bidding by industry. The largest opportunity published had an estimated value of €1 billion. The report said the parallel Code of Best Practice to encourage greater competition in the supply chain and the online portal were now recognized by a number of the most active companies as beneficial tools allowing them to easily reach out to potential new suppliers in Europe. Together with the Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD), whose President Åke Svensson addressed the Steering Board meeting, the Agency plans a series of initiatives and marketing actions to increase awareness of the EBB to more defence-related companies in Europe to develop a critical mass of users. Svensson told the Steering Board that industry fully supported the defence procurement regime, but to make the initiative reach its full potential required continued effective leadership starting at the highest levels in governments and industry. “From an industry perspective we also need more common requirements that lead to more common development and procurement, especially of complex and advanced systems,” he said. On the subject of UAVs, the Steering Board noted with satisfaction the work already done by the Agency for a Road Map to integrate the unmanned craft into conventional airspace and asked it to come up with further proposals in four areas: integration and coordination; standardisation and harmonisation; R&T projects into high-priority technology areas where immediate investment is needed; and initial areas for demonstration and validation. In response to a proposal by the United Kingdom about the general issues raised by the need for every country to certify the airworthiness of new military UAVs, the Agency was tasked to start investigating the idea of an EU-wide forum on military Airworthiness to save time and money. The meeting also heard a presentation on the MIDCAS project involving Sweden and France on collision-avoidance systems for UAVs and encouraged other Member States to share relevant R&T initiatives in this way. “I am delighted to see Member States bringing suggestions for collaboration to the Steering Board,” said EDA Chief Executive Alexander Weis. “The Agency wants to see many more joint projects but we need inputs and support from governments so we can make a difference,” he added. Main Points of EDA report into workings of Regime on Defence Procurement The assessment of the overall implementation of the Code of Conduct is positive and, in general, subscribing Member States (sMS) have adapted their procurement practices to the CoC’s provisions; The volume of Government contract opportunities posted on the European Bulletin Board 1 (EBB1) has steadily grown. By 1 April 2008, 18 of the 24 sMS had published more than 260 contract opportunities; During 2007, sMS published on EBB1 60 Contract Award Notices (CAN) with competition for a total value of €616M (excl. VAT), 16 being cross-border contracts and 32 awarded to SMEs. It should be taken into consideration that there is still limited cross-border bidding by industry; The EDA has been informed for 2007 of 112 government contracts falling under the exceptions to the CoC, mostly for “supplementary goods and services” and “follow-on work”, which seems to be a reasonable and relatively restrictive use of the follow-on exceptions; The EDA continue to work on a number of aspects which still affect fair competition across borders (e.g. Security of Supply); The EBB2 (for sub-contracting opportunities) enjoys support by industry, where it is considered as being an important step in the right direction from both buyers and suppliers towards changing behaviours in the supply chain; During EBB2’s first year of operation, it has started to be recognized by a number of the most active companies as a beneficial tool that was missing until now, allowing them to easily reach out to potential new suppliers in Europe and increase the efficiency of their supply chains; and The Agency has launched a number of initiatives and marketing actions across the 24 sMS aimed at increasing awareness of EBB to the broader European defence-related industrial base (E-newsletter, Local Partners network, Call Centre).

EDA_NEWS_1056	2008-01-08	NEWS	EDA Awards Contract for UAV Air Traffic Insertion Road Map	" The European Defence Agency announced today that it had awarded a contract worth Euro 500,000 with a consortium of defence and aerospace companies to develop a detailed roadmap for integrating Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) into European airspace so that they can fly routinely with other air traffic by the end of 2015 at the latest. The contract was awarded to the Air4All consortium, consisting of BAE Systems with BAE Systems Operations Platform Solutions, Alenia Aeronautica, Dassault Aviation, Diehl BGT Defence, EADS CASA, EADS Defence & Security Germany, Galileo Avionica, QinetiQ, Rheinmetall Defence Electronics, SAAB AB, Sagem Defence Systems and Thales Aerospace as Co-contractors.   The project will help European stakeholders such as airworthiness authorities, air traffic management bodies, procurement agencies, industry and research institutes to develop a joint agenda for common European UAV activities, leading to specific projects addressing security and commercial -- as well as defence -- uses of UAVs. ""This is a key initiative for Europe that provides a nucleus for setting realistic goals that will lead to Unmanned Aircraft Systems operating in total harmony with other airspace users,” said Project Director Dave Kershaw on behalf of the Air4All consortium. “We have an established, highly talented and qualified team with a total of over 350 years of relevant experience in the field of civil and military certification, qualification and operations. The team looks forward to working with the EDA and key European stakeholders, such as regulatory authorities (EASA and EUROCONTROL), EUROCAE and the European Commission, to deliver a quality strategic route map that put Europe at the forefront of creating safe routine use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems,"" he added. EDA Chief Executive Alexander Weis said: “We are very pleased to see so many of the leading companies in Europe taking part in this consortium, which gives us confidence that we  are well on the way to making real progress in this critical area, which is of great interest to our participating Member States.”"	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2008/01/07/EDA_Awards_Contract_for_UAV_Air_Traffic_Insertion_Road_Map
EDA_NEWS_1057	2008-01-10	NEWS	EDA Chief Executive Alexander Weis Outlines EDA Agenda to European Parliament Security and Defence Subcommittee	 Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Members of the Subcommittee, It’s a pleasure to be here with you, so early in the New Year. So, first of all let me wish you all a very happy 2008. My predecessor, Nick Witney, used to visit the Subcommittee regularly to discuss with you the ongoing and future activities of the European Defence Agency. I am glad to continue this tradition and I thank you, Chairman, for the early invitation. I say “early” because it is barely three months since I started my job as the second Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency, on 1 October last year. This has two implications: One – I don’t start from scratch, as I build on the results which have been realised in the first three years of the Agency’s existence. So, you will see a lot of continuity – and I will come back to some of the major agendas running from 2007 into 2008; and Two – as a newcomer I will also try to make a few changes. The theme here is: to make the Agency even more operational, in particular by launching big collaborative programmes and projects. I will mention a few potential new projects later on.  Continuity Let me start with continuity. First, it is important to recall that the Agency’s activities will remain capability-driven. Some commentators might have expected that with me at the steering wheel – in my former job I was the Deputy National Armaments Director in Germany – the EDA would now become “an Armaments Agency”. Let me be very clear: EDA remains a Defence Agency, capability-driven and it will continue to work on the basis of the integrated approach, connecting capability requirements, Research & Technology, armaments cooperation and the Industry and Market agendas. We have seen positive early results of this approach already, with the example of the Joint Investment Programme on Force Protection (the ‘JIP’ as we call it). In that programme future capability requirements have been the drivers for joint R&T investment in a crucial capability area – the protection of our soldiers in dangerous environments, as we can see on TV daily. Late last year the first contracts were signed for spending the first tranche of about €15 million, out of the total of just over €55 million. The JIP is a great success and in 2008 we hope to launch a second Joint Investment Programme, also proving that we are progressing with spending better and more together on Defence R&T. Four ‘Strategies’ In 2008, work on the ‘strategic issues’ will continue. A few words on each of them: First, the Capability Development Plan. We are nearly half way between launching the elaboration of the CDP in June 2007 and the delivery of the initial version by mid- 2008. Work is progressing well. The Capabilities Steering Board will meet mid- February to take stock and to provide guidance for the remaining activities. What will the CDP look like? Certainly not a telephone book, describing the numbers of tanks, aircraft and ships the Member States should have. That is Cold War defence planning. Rather, the CDP will provide a global picture of capability needs, capability trends and potential capability shortfalls. It will connect what we call short-term needs 3 (Headline Goal 2010) with the longer-term capability needs, based on the Long-Term Vision, endorsed by European Defence Ministers in 2006. But the CDP will provide “actionable conclusions” by summer this year. These will set the agendas for real programmes and early opportunities for collaboration, which the Member States will have to launch and implement. The CDP will also form a sound basis for future work of the Agency in driving R&T, Armaments Cooperation and Industry activities. This brings me to the second strategic item, the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base or the EDTIB Strategy. Ministers approved the Strategy in May last year, giving direction towards realising a stronger, more competent and more competitive EDTIB. There is now consensus on the need for more interdependence in the European DTIB as well as less dependence on non-European key technologies. The question, of course, is how to get there? The Steering Board in National Armaments Directors formation agreed on a set of roadmaps last September to take the work forward in a practical sense. A crucial activity is to define the key industrial capabilities in Europe, which will also contribute to improving long-term Security of Supply, and, therefore, to increasing European autonomy. The third item, directly connected to EDTIB work, is the European Defence Research & Technology or EDRT Strategy. In the Ministerial Steering Board of 19 November last year the Framework for such a Strategy was approved. It defines broadly what should be elaborated in the EDRT Strategy, both in terms of ‘ends’ (in which R&T to invest) and ‘means’ (how to invest). A central element is the definition key defence technologies, to be preserved or developed in Europe. The list of these key technologies is expected this spring. The full Strategy will be approved by Ministers in the May Steering Board. Fourthly, we need the last piece of the strategies puzzle, an Armaments Strategy. We need this Strategy to develop a clear process how we move from agreed capability needs to cooperative armament programmes. And we also have to look at other aspects, such as to define how a concept for through-life management can be best integrated into such cooperation. Work has started, building on the results of the Cooperative Lessons Learned study, which was financed by the Agency’s operational 4 budget. In 2008, a series of studies and workshops will be organised to elaborate the Strategy, which hopefully can be approved by the autumn Ministerial Steering Board. Concrete Projects Strategies are needed – they provide direction and define aims – but, naturally, they themselves do not deliver capabilities. We need concrete programmes and projects to turn theory into practice. This is where I want to see change. Yes, there are examples of early projects. Let me just mention three of them: Software-Defined Radio or SDR, where the Agency is making a significant contribution by connecting the military and civilian efforts to ensure that in the medium-to-longer term this future communication tool is fully interoperable, not only between the military but also between civilian and military users. For that purpose, EDA provides the link between the six European countries working together on military SDR in the so-called ESSOR project and the Commission, which is investing funds under the European Security and Research Programme for civil SDR use; Unmanned Air Vehicles or UAVs have been in the Agency’s Work Programme since the start in 2005. But 2008 will be a milestone year. Why? Because we hope to realise a breakthrough in a topic that nobody so far has tackled in an allinclusive way, namely the insertion of UAVs into regulated air space. This is an issue with many dimensions: legal and regulatory elements – not for the Agency to arrange but which the Agency might bring it to the fore; certification procedures – a standard for certification could be developed by EDA; and, of course, new technologies needed to ensure that UAVs can fly in regulated air space with the same safety guarantees as manned aircraft – such as ‘Sense and Avoid’ technologies, an area where the Agency has early results from a study conducted in the recent past. This coming spring another study will deliver the full picture of what is needed for insertion of UAVs into regulated air space. Based on the study results, EDA will define a business case. This business case 5 will be used to spend €6 million, earmarked in the Agency’s 2008 budget (for the first time ever); and Maritime Surveillance: again a work strand where military and civil needs have to be brought together. The Agency is working both on connecting national networks at the European level but also on defining military requirements for new future assets, such as Maritime Unmanned Air Vehicles. But, as I said at the beginning, we need more projects to underline that the Agency has started to deliver. I have engaged myself directly to bring two of them under the wing of EDA: Firstly: heavy helicopters. An excellent example where we see a need, both arising from current short-term needs (the continuing shortages in real-life operations) and longer-term requirements to replace the existing fleet beyond 2015. In my former national capacity, I was involved in the German-French cooperation for a future transport helicopter programme. But Germany and France alone cannot afford such a huge programme anymore. So, logically, the bilateral programme – which is an excellent start – has to be brought to the European level to look for more partners. This will help, both to increase standardisation and interoperability but also to share the burden for a much-needed and expensive capability. I am glad to say that both countries have responded positively to my request to bring the programme to EDA; and Secondly: space, in particular observation. A limited number of European countries have observation satellites for military users. The current generation of military observation satellites will come to its end of life in the 2015-2020 timeframe. So, now is the time to look at the next generation and to make an attempt to harmonise requirements. Six European countries are cooperating in the so-called MUSIS group for that purpose. Again, I have suggested bringing the effort under the umbrella of 6 EDA, with the potential to broaden the club. First reactions of the MUSIS countries are positive and I am looking forward to the next steps. Final Remarks I haven’t addressed many other works strands of the Agency, such as the implementation of the Code of Conduct on Defence Procurement or Logistics, the theme of the annual EDA Conference this year. If you wish I can go into more detail during the discussion period. A final remark on deliverables. I have mentioned two projects, for which I have taken the initiative. But, naturally, I am telling the Member States that they should propose other projects for which they see a need to start collaborations with other European partners. Clearly, when bringing such initiatives to the Agency we need to check if they fit in the capability-driven approach. But we don’t have a shortage of capability shortfalls in Europe. What we lack most is solutions at the European level, instead of continuing along the path of finding purely national answers. That is the Agency’s mission and I will engage myself fully in the next few years to increase European cooperation on capabilities, R&T, armaments and industry.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2008/01/09/EDA_Chief_Executive_Alexander_Weis_Outlines_EDA_Agenda_to_European_Parliament_Security_and_Defence_Subcommittee
EDA_NEWS_1058	2007-12-05	NEWS	EDA welcomes Commission Communication on EU Defence Industry and Market	 The European Defence Agency welcomes the efforts of the European Commission to further support the development of a true European Defence Equipment Market (EDEM). The Defence Package published today is complementary to the Agency’s own agenda for creating a more effective EDEM and a stronger European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB). The EDA is pleased that the Commission is taking into account the specific features of defence and security, since this cannot be treated as a fully commercial market. “Everyone is aware that sensitive issues of national sovereignty are involved in defence procurement and that has driven much of our work in this area,” said EDA Chief Executive Alexander Weis. “The European market for tanks does not operate in the same way as the market for washing machines.” With regard to procurement, the Commission’s initiative is complementary to the EDA Code of Conduct on Defence Procurement launched in July 2006, which covers contracts placed outside EU internal market directives on the basis of Article 296 of the EC Treaty. This area accounts in practice for the bulk of core European defence procurement. The Agency believes that competition is one key tool in a larger set that includes other important initiatives such as agreements on Security of Supply and Security of Information, issues on which the EDA is currently working. Competition is not a cure-all and cooperation is in some instances more appropriate to shape the EDTIB of the future.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2007/12/04/EDA_welcomes_Commission_Communication_on_EU_Defence_Industry_and_Market
EDA_NEWS_1059	2008-02-15	NEWS	EU Governments Seek to Improve Air Transport Capacity for Military Operations	 European Union governments today agreed to pursue two initiatives to address the shortfalls in transport aircraft and helicopters which have created challenges for existing and future EU military and crisis management operations under the European Security and Defence Policy. A meeting of the Steering Board of the European Defence Agency agreed to create an EDA Project Team to investigate how to develop the concept of a European Air Transport Fleet through some form of pooled ownership of A400M transport aircraft, which several governments have ordered or plan to acquire. The meeting of Capabilities Directors of the 26 EDA participating Member States also agreed to pursue a U.K. initiative to share information about helicopters available for missions under European Security and Defence Policy, which could lead to cooperation among countries operating the same type of helicopters and improve their availability. “These issues are at the heart of the challenges Europe faces if it is to match its ambitions with the capabilities required,” said Lo Casteleijn, who chaired the meeting on behalf of the Head of the Agency, Javier Solana. “The EDA has a crucial role to play by helping Member States to identify where they can collectively be more effective through collaboration.” The European Air Transport Fleet Project Team will gather information from countries interested in the initiative and develop a Common Staff Target, the first step towards pooling resources. The team will look into the commercial and legal issues as well as how such a pool could be managed and its missions prioritised. “For governments with smaller budgets, this could offer a way for them to meet their strategic requirements within their resources, while for those with larger budgets, it could offer a way to maximise the efficiency of their investments,” said EDA Chief Executive Alexander Weis. EU operations, such as in Chad and the Central African Republic, and NATO missions such as Afghanistan, have suffered from a lack of helicopter availability. This is primarily due to the assets of European countries having limited deployability and sustainability on expeditionary missions. The EU and NATO have a common interest in addressing the problem so governments will provide to the EDA data on helicopters already submitted for a NATO study. The Agency then will investigate the potential for cooperation of Member States who operate the same types of helicopters, to create upgrade and/or support programmes to enhance deployability. It will also investigate the opportunities for Member States to share training and maintenance facilities for existing and new helicopters. An EDA conference (“Commercialising Logistics”) scheduled for 27 February on the role of the private sector in providing logistical support to EU operations will provide a further forum to examine the problem. In addition to any short or medium-term remedial action by NATO and the EU to improve the situation, the Agency is looking into longer-term solutions, including a possible broadening of the emerging Franco-German Future Transport Helicopter project to include other countries. On other issues, the Steering Board heard a progress report on work on the Capabilities Development Plan (CDP), a comprehensive study of the capabilities required in the future and practical measures to improve cooperation to help deliver them. The CDP is due to be published in the middle of this year. The Capabilities Directors welcomed the results being achieved by the Tactical Imagery Exploitation Station project, conducted by the EDA in cooperation with the EU Satcen in Torrejon, Spain, with the aim of developing a technological demonstrator for the analysis of images from multiple sources, another important capability gap. “There are no quick answers to the problems of capability shortfalls,” Weis said. “But today’s meeting demonstrates again that there is widespread agreement that while each government will decide how and how much to spend on defence, many of these problems may be better addressed by working together.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2008/02/14/EU_Governments_Seek_to_Improve_Air_Transport_Capacity_for_Military_Operations
EDA_NEWS_1060	2007-12-14	NEWS	EDA Signs First Contracts Under R&T Joint Investment Programme on Force Protection	" The European Defence Agency today signed the first three contracts under its R&T Joint Investment Programme on Force Protection (JIP-FP). These contracts represent a total investment of 13.1 million Euros, including co-funding from industry, and were selected from proposals worth more than 100 million Euros received through a call for projects issued in May 2007. The three successful projects aim at the development of individual protective armour, a multi-sensor anti-sniper system and stand off detection of CBRNE devices. Each of them will be sustained by a highly skilled pan-European industrial consortium including SMEs, research centres and universities. More detailed information on the selected projects and contractors is attached. ""The EDA is delighted that the first contracts under the JIP have been awarded barely six months after the programme was officially launched,” said EDA R&T Director Bertrand de Cordoue. “This demonstrates that the innovative model of the programme can make a real difference to promoting collaboration in European defence R&T."" This JIP-FP initiative, dedicated to technologies for protecting deployed armed forces against threats such as snipers, booby traps or improvised bombs, was agreed one year ago at a ministerial meeting of the EDA Steering Board with a budget totalling 55 million Euros over three years. The formal Programme Arrangement was signed by the 20 contributing Member States last May. Among the ground-breaking management rules, designed to overcome some of the drawbacks of traditional R&T collaboration in defence, are: Opting out, to allow Member States which are not interested to withdraw from the programme; Competition among consortia of research entities from all contributing Member States (cMS); Access to the programme outputs granted to all cMS; Selection of projects not based on strict industrial return criteria for cMS; and Management of the programme by a Committee where representation of each cMS is weighted according to its contribution to the programme budget. The 20 cMS are Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.

EDA_NEWS_1061	2007-09-29	NEWS	Javier Solana, EU High Representative for the CFSP, pays tribute to Nick Witney, outgoing Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency	 Javier Solana, Head of the European Defence Agency (EDA), today paid tribute to the outstanding achievements of outgoing EDA Chief Executive Nick Witney, who was the driving force of the agency during the first three years of its existence. Speaking at an informal meeting of EU Defence Ministers in Evora, Portugal, Javier Solana said it was hard to think of any other new body which had made such a big impact in such a short time. Among the Agency’s achievements there has been the introduction of a Code of Conduct to promote transparency and cross-border competition in defence procurement; the Long-Term Vision report describing the trends that could shape ESDP operations and the military capabilities required in the future; a strategy to strengthen Europe’s Defence Technological and Industrial Basel; and the innovative Joint Investment Programme to encourage more collaborative spending on defence Research & Technology. “As head of the Agency Establishment Team in 2004, Nick Witney took the wish of EU leaders to build up Europe’s defence capabilities, laid out a vision for what was required and then, as the EDA’s first chief executive, turned that vision into reality”,  Javier Solana said. “Nick Witney painted a bold and clear picture showing why we needed to change. He used his intellect and creativity to come up with specific and practical proposals and argued tirelessly and persuasively for Member States to put them into effect”, added the High Representative. Nick Witney will be succeeded as Chief Executive on October 1 by Alexander Weis. “As Germany’s Deputy National Armaments Director, Alexander Weis has been an active supporter of the Agency’s agenda and is ideally placed to build on Nick Witneys’s achievements. I wish them both the very best for the future”,  Mr Solana said.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2007/09/28/Javier_Solana_EU_High_Representative_for_the_CFSP_pays_tribute_to_Nick_Witney_outgoing_Chief_Executive_of_the_European_Defence_Agency
EDA_NEWS_1062	2007-11-05	NEWS	New EDA Directors for Capabilities and Armaments appointed	 Javier Solana, Head of the European Defence Agency, today announced the appointments of Jonathan Mullin as EDA Capabilities Director and Jukka Juusti as Armaments Director. Mullin, currently Assistant Director, Force Protection, in the UK Ministry of Defence, and Juusti, Chief, Armaments Division J10, Defence Command, Finland, will take up their duties in January.   “I am delighted that the nominations have been approved by the EDA’s participating Member States,” Solana said. “Both men are admirably suited to these critical roles: capabilities development is at the heart of the Agency’s mission, while intensified cooperation on armaments projects will be a key theme of its work in 2008.” Solana paid tribute to Pierre Hougardy, who returns to the Belgian Armed Forces after three years as the Agency’s first Capabilities Director. “Pierre has made an enormous contribution to the Agency’s success. Thanks to him, we have a solid foundation on which to build a joint Capabilities Development Plan,” Solana said. Juusti succeeds Carlo Magrassi, who will take up his new position as one of the EDA’s Deputy Chief Executives from 1 January. “I am confident that Jonathan and Jukka will be very effective members of the Agency Management Board and I look forward to working with them,” said EDA Chief Executive Alexander Weis.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2007/11/04/New_EDA_Directors_for_Capabilities_and_Armaments_appointed
EDA_NEWS_1063	2007-09-25	NEWS	EDA Steering Board Agrees Path to Implementing Defence Industrial Strategy	 European Union governments today agreed a series of specific steps and timetables for implementing a strategy to strengthen the Defence Technological and Industrial Base (DTIB) by strengthening competition and cooperation in Europe and focussing more deliberately on the needs of the future. A meeting of the Steering Board of the European Defence Agency, held at the level of National Armaments Directors, reviewed a series of roadmaps for delivering the ground-breaking strategy agreed by defence ministers last May. “Ministers have recognised that individual Member States can no longer sustain their separate DTIBs on a purely national basis, and that we need to specialise and become more dependent on each other at a European level,” said Eero Lavonen, who chaired the meeting on behalf of Javier Solana, Head of the Agency. “The roadmaps agreed today provide the key milestones to implement successfully the policies and approaches set out in the strategy,” he added. In keeping with the EDA’s mandate to try to integrate different aspects of the defence agenda, the roadmaps cover a broad range of activities, including identification of key industrial capabilities, security of supply between countries, increased competition in the defence equipment market, deepening and diversifying the supplier base, and improved armaments cooperation. The Steering Board agreed that rapid progress was needed before the new EDA Chief Executive presents the first annual report on the progress of the strategy to ministers next spring. A key element of the implementation is pressing ahead with the successful market initiatives already undertaken, such as the Code of Conduct for Defence Procurement. In that context, the Steering Board agreed that, despite the substantial volume of business (an estimated €10 billion) now advertised on the Agency’s Electronic Bulletin Board (www.eda.europa.eu/ebbweb), more needed to be done to increase cross-border bids and contract awards. “Creating a European market is a joint endeavour by industry and governments and it is understandable that the supply side should take some time to adapt to a world in which, for the first time, defence procurement is being done on a pan-European basis,” Lavonen said. The Steering Board also approved a Code of Conduct for coordinating investment in the Defence Test and Evaluation Base (DTEB), designed to avoid duplication and encourage the sharing of these expensive facilities. The code, modelled on the framework for the defence equipment market, aims at promoting transparency and encouraging coordination of new investments in the field of defence Test & Evaluation facilities. The basic principle of the code, which will be operational on 1 January 2008, is mutual disclosure among the subscribing Member States of any planned DTEB investment worth more than €1 million - to enable a coordinated investment, or reciprocal use of such facilities. On other matters, the National Armaments Directors: reviewed the plans for taking forward the initiative for inserting Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) into regulated air space and noted with pleasure the emergence of promising collaborative technology demonstrator projects; (including work on Sense Avoid technologies by Sweden and France, and Germany); took stock of the work being done by the Agency for certification and standardisation in Software Defined Radio, agreeing the need for such capabilities in Europe; approved the setting-up of an ad hoc EDA Materiel Standardization Group and Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Defence Materiel Standards. The Directors also noted with satisfaction the Agency’s cooperation with the Commission on many of its agendas. Finally, the Steering Board expressed its thanks and deep appreciation for the outstanding contribution made by the outgoing EDA Chief Executive, Nick Witney, who was attending his last meeting of the Agency’s governing body before handing over to Alexander Weis on 1 October. “It is impossible to overstate Nick’s part in the success of this enterprise, as head of the Agency Establishment Team which mapped out the new institution and as its first leader,” Lavonen said. “He has consistently set out the facts about European defence, reminded us of what we have said we want to achieve, presented specific and practical proposals, and cajoled and encouraged us to reach agreements. He can be very proud of what the Agency has accomplished.” “It has been a privilege to lead the Agency during its first years and to work with such a dedicated and talented team inside the EDA, and such a diverse set of stakeholders within Brussels, and across Europe. In the participating Member States, in other institutions and in the defence industry, the EDA is lucky to have so many supportive friends.” Witney said. “I know that, with their help, Alexander Weis will be able to take the work of the Agency forward with confidence and great success,” he added.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2007/09/24/EDA_Steering_Board_Agrees_Path_to_Implementing_Defence_Industrial_Strategy
EDA_NEWS_1064	2007-11-19	NEWS	EU Ministers Adopt Framework for Joint European Strategy in Defence R&T	 European Union governments today adopted the framework for a joint Strategy on Defence Research & Technology describing why and how they intend to invest collectively on technologies that are crucial for future military capabilities and industrial capacities in Europe. EU Defence Ministers, meeting as the Steering Board of the European Defence Agency, agreed on the objectives and methods for achieving a better collective performance from national defence R&T budgets. This further strengthens the foundations of European defence, following the adoption last May of a Strategy for Europe’s Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB). “Investing in the right technology is critical for the future of European defence and the Strategy is exactly in line with the absolute requirement for us to spend more, spend better and spend more together,” said Javier Solana, the Head of the EDA, who chaired the meeting. “Thanks to a great deal of work by the Agency and our Member States, we can now see clearly what needs to be done and how we are going to do it,” he added. Within this framework Member States will define what technological and industrial capabilities they want to develop and strengthen in Europe by their R&T investments and how these investments can be harmonised and provide the best equipment for the armed forces to fulfil their crisis-management missions under the European Security and Defence Policy. The framework lays out both the “Ends” for the strategy – for example, preparing a list of key technologies to invest in – as well as the “Means” to deliver them, such as different forms of collaboration, technology watch and coordination with other European R&T organisations. The Agency was tasked to report on progress, including the list of technologies in spring 2008. In a further effort to improve overall EU performance on defence, ministers approved four benchmarks to increase investment for future needs and to encourage collaborative spending: Equipment procurement (incl. R&D/R&T): 20% of defence spending (currently 19.4%) European collaborative equipment procurement: 35% of equipment procurement expenditure (currently 21%) Defence R&T: 2% of defence spending (currently 1.2%) European collaborative defence R&T: 20% of defence R&T expenditure (currently 10%) “These are collective benchmarks – applying to the combined spending of all of the Agency’s 26 participating Member States – and they are voluntary,” Solana said. “But annual monitoring by the Agency will support the Member States’ efforts to transform Europe’s armed forces together.” On other matters, the Steering Board approved the Agency’s work programme and budget for 2008. The budget of €32 million, compared with €22 in 2007, includes €6 million earmarked for work on Unmanned Air Vehicles which can be spent only after a further decision by the Steering Board. The work programme adds a long-term strategy to boost the number of cooperative programmes on Armaments to the existing strategies for Capabilities Development, the EDTIB and R&T. Major initiatives include looking for new Joint Investment Programmes in defence R&T, using the model pioneered this year for Force Protection, and further work on a more open and competitive European Defence Equipment Market. “Today’s decisions have put in place further building blocks for our common work of making Europe’s armed forces and military budgets fit for the challenges of the 21st century which we must face together,” said Alexander Weis, attending his first ministerial Steering Board since taking over as EDA Chief Executive. “Approval of the R&T strategy, benchmarks, work programme and budget show the confidence of Member States in our agenda and we look forward to working with them to deliver on it,” he added.

EDA_NEWS_1065	2007-11-13	NEWS	EDA Turns to Rainer Schuwirth to Lead Effort on Network Enabled Capability	 The European Defence Agency has contracted Rainer Schuwirth, a retired German Army General to produce a draft concept for the European Union to exploit Network Enabled Capabilities (NEC) in support of crisis-management operations. Before his retirement, General Schuwirth’s final tour in NATO was as Chief of Staff at SHAPE. He previously held the position of Director General of the EU Military Staff.   The EDA Steering Board agreed on 28 June to appoint a “Wise Pen” to lead the initial effort on NEC, which ministers consider to be fundamental for such operations in the “information” age, as opposed to the “industrial” age.

EDA_NEWS_1066	2007-06-28	NEWS	EU Governments Set Timetable for Initial Plan to Strengthen Defence Capabilities	 The EDA Steering Board today agreed a roadmap and a timetable to produce a comprehensive Capability Development Plan (CDP), which will help EU governments identify the key capability areas that they must work together to develop to meet the security threats of the future, and to target  possible areas for collaboration to deliver the necessary capabilities. The meeting of senior defence planners from the 26 EU governments participating in the European Defence Agency asked for an initial element of the CDP to be delivered early next year and a full draft of the plan to be ready for the Steering Board to review next July. “We have now clearly set out what we want and when we want it by,” said Lo Casteleijn, who chaired the meeting on behalf of Javier Solana, the Head of the Agency. “The CDP must deliver ‘actionable conclusions’: agreed capability development priorities, initial action plans and identified cooperative opportunities, which participating Member States may choose to pursue individually or in combinations inside or outside the EDA environment,” he added. The work on the CDP builds on the EDA’s Long-Term Vision report of last year, which set out possible contexts for EU crisis-management operations under the European Security and Defence Policy in 2020 and beyond - and described the sort of military and other capabilities which would be required to carry them out effectively. The CDP will make that analysis more specific and thus more useable, identify priorities and areas for collaboration and give guidance to industry. The four work strands of the CDP, led by the EDA and the EU Military Committee, involve identifying shortfalls from existing goals, doing capability studies on key issues to develop the LTV guidance, building a database of current national defence plans and programmes, and drawing lessons from current experience for future capability needs. The Steering Board said the CDP would not be a supranational military equipment or capability plan replacing national defence plans and programmes, but would support national decision-making. It should ensure that emerging technology opportunities influence capability development and provide a focus for R&T activity and investment, thus helping to strengthen the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base by making clear to industry what will be needed in the future. On other issues, the Steering Board welcomed the launch of a new 5 nation - Spain, Italy, Germany, France, and Sweden - collaboration effort on personal equipment for infantrymen, aiming at increasing interoperability and commonality of this increasingly high-tech equipment in the next decade. Three further nations - Poland, Finland and Austria - expressed their interest in joining the programme. The Steering Board also agreed to commission a report – to be written by an expert known as a “Wise Pen” – on a European approach to Network Enabled Capabilities. Defence Ministers have already agreed that “Network-enabled capability must be fundamental development priority for ESDP operations”. The concept paper will outline the aims, the required capabilities and how these capabilities could be delivered, address the civil and the military dimension ESDP operations, and propose high level guidance. It will focus in particular on how to create greater capacities in bringing all necessary civilian resources to bear in crises and on enabling the best possible situational awareness and deployment of assets and capabilities in-theatre. The meeting also considered a series of reports on strategic lift, focusing on how to address the known shortfalls in the capacity to rapidly transport military equipment and forces to EU operations. The EDA reported that the situation would have to be addressed by using a combination of military transport, assured civilian contracted capability and a more efficient approach to the spot market. It also recommended setting up a project team with government representatives to look into possible combinations of air and sea transport, including new “fast ship” capabilities.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2007/06/27/EU_Governments_Set_Timetable_for_Initial_Plan_to_Strengthen_Defence_Capabilities
EDA_NEWS_1067	2007-06-19	NEWS	Spain to Join Code of Conduct for European Defence Equipment Market	 The European Defence Agency today welcomed the announcement that Spain will join the inter-governmental regime for defence procurement on 1 July, taking the number of subscribers to 24 out of the EDA’s 26 Member States. Hungary announced on 14 May that it would join the regime from 1 July. Bulgaria and Romania, which joined the Agency this year, are evaluating the regime and the principles of its two main instruments, the Code of Conduct and the Code of Best Practice in the Supply Chain, and may decide to join at a later stage. The voluntary regime is designed to increase transparency and competition, offer armed forces and taxpayers better value for money, broaden business opportunities for defence-related companies of all sizes and help to strengthen the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base. In the year since the regime came into force, governments have advertised nearly 200 contract opportunities worth approximately €10 billion on the European Bulletin Board online portal (www.eda.europa.eu/ebbweb), which is operated by the Agency. Since March, the EBB has also displayed industry-to-industry sub-contracting opportunities for defence equipment under the Code of Best Practice in the Supply Chain, which extends the benefits of a more transparent and competitive market to smaller companies and suppliers across Europe. So far, more than 100 such opportunities have been posted there. “We are delighted that Spain and Hungary have decided to join the regime,” said EDA Chief Executive Nick Witney. “This is further evidence that governments recognise the benefits of the Code of Conduct and of more open, cross-border competition in this vital sector of the economy.”	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2007/06/18/Spain_to_Join_Code_of_Conduct_for_European_Defence_Equipment_Market

EDA_NEWS_1069	2007-06-06	NEWS	EDA's Witney says defence R&T must match pace of civil technological change	   Defence Innovates Symposium Soesterberg, 6 June 2007 The European Defence Market Address by Nick Witney, Chief Executive, EDA I’m particularly glad to be able to join you for your Symposium here today. First, because it gives me a chance to acknowledge, and in a small way reciprocate, the strong support that The Netherlands has given to the EDA enterprise during its short life. You have understood and assisted our various agendas, and in many ways offered an example to others – in, for example, the strong capability focus you bring to your defence planning, and indeed in your readiness to step forward when words must be followed by deeds, and operational deployments have to be undertaken. The Netherlands is amongst the leading European nations in terms of the proportion of your military manpower that is actually out there in the field, bearing the risks and burdens of crisis management operations. The second reason I am glad to be here is to express particular appreciation for the seriousness with which you treat defence research and technology. This is obvious not only in the amount of money you devote to it – 5th in the European league table, I believe – but also in the excellence of your research institutions, with TNO pre-eminent. I am not a scientist. But I have in recent years, and indeed in a previous life, spent a lot of time talking to people who understand research and technology better than I – so I feel I can offer you today some thoughts with a certain amount of confidence. For example, I do not think you need an advanced degree in quantum mechanics to conclude that, today, Europe as a whole is massively under-invested in defence R&T. Our main competitors are the Americans (though tomorrow they will be the Chinese and Indians as well) – and I do not think we should hesitate to describe the United States, our indispensable ally, as our competitors in defence industrial matters. And they are currently outspending us at the rate of 6:1 in both research and technology, and research and development. It was a shock to do the sums, and realise that the combined total of everything European ministries of defence spend on research and technology – something under €2.5bn a year – is less than the annual DARPA budget. If we mean what we say about sustaining a healthy and globally competitive defence technological and industrial base in Europe (DTIB in the jargon), then we simply have to do better than that. Fortunately, it is no longer just me saying this, but 26 European Defence Ministers. Last month, when they met as the EDA Steering Board in Brussels on 14 May, they agreed an important document – a Strategy for a European DTIB. You can read it on our website – . It offers a fairly comprehensive analysis of the challenges we face, and what we must do if we are to stay in business in Europe. It says in terms that, whatever excellences we may retain today, we are living on past investment. The message is clear – we must spend more on defence R&T in Europe, and we must spend more together. That second point is worth a moment’s pause. The potential benefits of working together are obvious, in terms of getting more for our money. But the Strategy document to which I referred also makes the point that working together on R&T can make a critical contribution to a wider theme of the Strategy – the need to converge our military requirements, and make decisive progress towards the long-recognised goal of fielding more common equipments and systems amongst European armed forces. Partly this is necessary to achieve the economies of scale that we all know our industries need, but it is also because interoperability is key to safety and success in multinational operations, and there is no form of interoperability in the domain of equipment better than actually using the same kit. Now the lesson has been painfully learned in Europe over many years that the best collaborations start “up-stream” – at the point where thought is being given to what a desired new capability will be for, and how it will be used. So, if I may quote the Strategy “this emphasis on the early conceptual stage underlines the importance of a step-change in defence R&T collaboration in Europe as a key to ‘up-stream’ convergence of requirements thinking, and the point where the possible applications of new technologies are explored”. More broadly, the message of the Strategy is stark – that we can no longer afford to do the business of defence in 20-something separate national boxes, but must, like it or not, encourage the evolution of a truly European DTIB, as something more than the sum of national parts. This implies a European DTIB which is less duplicative, more specialised, and more interdependent – and one in which centres of excellence evolve which others rely upon rather than try to replicate. Greater competition in defence procurement, and the progressive move towards a genuine defence equipment market, will add a powerful dynamic to that process. I do not think there is anything in this which this audience will be afraid of – indeed, your representatives have been amongst the new Strategy’s foremost supporters. Strategies are fine – but implementation is better. So it was a pleasure to see, at the same Ministerial meeting, 19 Defence Ministers signing the Programme Arrangement for an innovative new Joint Investment Programme (JIP) for research into technologies relevant to the protection of deployed forces. The Netherlands is a substantial shareholder in this enterprise. The virtue of this scheme is not just that it has resulted in a sizeable joint fund – some €55m – being got together, and got together much more rapidly than the traditional pace with which defence R&T collaborations have come together in Europe. It is also that it has brought into the business a wide range of European Member States who have not previously had a vehicle through which they could invest relatively modest sums to good purpose. Second, it promises a significant broadening of the supply base. The first call for proposals under the JIP has been issued to almost 300 entities across Europe: about a third of them familiar defence companies; another third SMEs and non-traditional suppliers; and the last third universities, research institutions and laboratories. I am glad to see that a dozen Dutch concerns, mainly SMEs, are on this list. The ground rules of the fund specify that no-one can bid unless they are in a consortium, meaning a minimum of two entities from two different Member States. So we have set up a ferment of networking and mutual discovery, which we have every confidence will flush out new sources of innovation across our continent. Europe is not so rich in human capital, especially scientific human capital, that it can afford to waste any contribution of this kind. Also good about this scheme is that it introduces some genuine competition into the process. Not as much as I would like – across the entire programme we have to achieve some sort of global balance, which means that towards the end of the series of calls for proposals we may have to be more directive about the national origin of potential suppliers. But at least it is a start. And when I say start that is what I mean. The old arrangements, dating from the early 1990s, also spoke of competition as being the normal means of procurement in R&T collaborations – but it seems that these words were first agreed and then quietly ignored. I think I can state categorically that there has never been an R&T collaboration in Europe so far where the work has not been divided on an exact “fair shares” basis between the chosen national contractors of each of the participating governments. Money, in short, has never crossed a national frontier. Whilst this is understandable, it is also a great way to fossilise the supply base. So there is the basic recipe – to spend more, and spend more together and, one must add, to spend better. Partly, this means ensuring a strong focus on capability need – there is, after all, ultimately no future for defence industries or research institutions in Europe which do not produce what the armed forces of tomorrow will actually want to buy. I know that in the world of Dutch defence this is well-understood consideration. And, again, I am grateful for Dutch support on the work our Capabilities Steering Board is over-seeing – under the Chairmanship of course of Lo Casteleijn, your MOD Policy Director – to work up a Capabilities Development Plan for ESDP. But “better”, I suggest, also implies quicker. Too often, we continue to manage the business of defence R&T as though we were still living in the Cold War. But the adversary, as we see everyday in Iraq and Afghanistan, exhibits no such ponderousness in adapting and adopting technologies and using them against us. We must become similarly agile, and match the pace of the ever-shortening cycle time of technological advance in the civil world. You do not need me to tell you that the line between defence and civilian technologies is growing every day more blurred and that nowadays much more is spun into defence than is spun out. This is why a particular focus for our Agency’s work in Brussels is to look for synergies between the defence R&T that our Member States fund and the substantial sum now being spent by the European Union under the banner of security research. We have already established a good marriage between military and civilian investment in Software Defined Radio technologies – and we hope soon to achieve the same in responding to the challenge – again, recognised by our Ministers in our Steering Board last month – to get UAVs inserted into regulated aerospace. I have spoken for long enough. But I hope I have given you at least a flavour of the consensus that is developing amongst our participating Member States on how to tackle the required step‑change in our collective R&T efforts. As the Strategy document notes, only this way can we hope to preserve and indeed develop our defence technological and industrial base, as a major source of jobs, exports and technological advance – something which in turn helps to maintain public support for defence. Even more important, however, is the key goal - to ensure that the men and women whom we deploy on operations have the best which world-leading technology can provide for them, and come home successful and safe. So I finish by congratulating you on the leading role the Netherland already plays in this vital area, and look forward to today’s discussion of how you and we can do even better.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2007/06/05/EDA_s_Witney_says_defence_R_T_must_match_pace_of_civil_technological_change
EDA_NEWS_1070	2007-06-12	NEWS	EDA's Witney says European defence collaboration is economic necessity, not just political goal	 On the Way to Reality EDA - EDTIB Conference Berlin Panel 1: Interests and Objectives of the European Defence Policy I will begin, if I may, with an anecdote. In a previous life, I was a diplomat; and in the late 1970s served as Chef de Cabinet to the British ambassador in Washington, with all the most fascinating cable traffic of the British Foreign Office flowing across my desk. It was the time of the 4-power summit which Jimmy Carter hosted in Guadeloupe; and one particular piece of the diplomatic record impressed itself on my memory. The main business of the summit was theatre nuclear weapons. But the three European leaders – Chancellor Schmidt, President Giscard, and Prime Minister Callaghan – took time out for some European discussions. I forget now who it was who raised the state of the European defence industry – but all readily agreed that the duplication of different national armaments programmes was wasteful and absurd. There should be a division of labour: one nation leading on land systems, another on ships, the third on combat aircraft. And then, with almost equal readiness, the agreed conclusion – “nice idea, but all too difficult”. And we live with the consequences today. Rival combat aircraft committing fratricide in export markets. A pot-pourri of armoured vehicles deployed on multinational operations, unable to exchange air-filters and all requiring their separate logistic chains back to Europe. And industry struggling for orders and production runs of a viable scale. This is bad economics. But, as the title of this first panel implies, there are now other interests at stake as well. Because we have today, what did not exist in 1979, a European Security and Defence Policy. A policy which, over the last four years, has increasingly manifested itself in action – with crisis management operations completed or in train from the Balkans, to the Congo, to Indonesia, to the Middle East. The EU has agreed a European Security Strategy which commits the Union to be an increasingly active, coherent and capable contributor to global security. Our armed forces, it turns out, are not just for deterrence – they are also for use. And, across Europe, we find they are not configured or equipped as well as they need to be for the real-world operations they are now called upon to undertake. This, of course, is a key reason why the European Defence Agency was created – to work with the Member States on capability development or, as I sometimes paraphrase it, on making sure we spend our defence budgets on the right things and not the wrong things. Following up last year’s Long-Term Vision analysis, we are now working with our Member States on a Capability Development Plan. But, today, I must focus on the other half of the EDA mission – the effort to ensure that our armed forces are supported, and indeed that the strategic aims of European defence policy are underpinned, by a strong and globally competitive defence technological and industrial base. And the root of the problem of course is fragmentation. Over 50 years, the rest of European industry has been transformed by the internal market. But defence is “special” – in the Brussels jargon, it has certain “specificities”, which demand special treatment. And, of course, at one level, this is true: tanks are not washing machines, and governments do stand in a very special relationship to the defence industry, as customers, regulators, investors and sometimes owners. At another level, the “specialness” of defence has been used to justify often indiscriminate use of the famous Article 296 – or, to say things as they are, for fundamentally protectionist purposes. Ultimately, of course, such a policy is self-defeating. Like any other industry, the defence industry will only thrive if it produces what its customers want to buy. And if defence procurement is operated with the focus on national industrial policies rather than on anticipating and meeting the user’s future needs, then the user will not want the product and the industry will eventually lose its market. The solution is as simple to state as it is too difficult to achieve. We can no longer afford the fragmentation – so we must encourage the development of a proper defence equipment market in Europe, as a key means of encouraging the consolidation of both the demand and the supply sides, and thus creating a truly integrated European defence technological and industrial base. The money is no longer there to operate on any smaller scale. This audience will I know be familiar with some of the steps the EDA has so far been able to take towards this objective – notably the agreement of now 23 of our Member States on a Code of Conduct on defence procurement, to open national markets to suppliers from each others’ countries on a voluntary and reciprocal basis. The Electronic Bulletin Board on the EDA’s website, through which this agreement is operationalised, now carries nearly 200 contracting opportunities for suppliers across Europe, with a total value now pushing €10bn. Industry support for this initiative has been manifested in the recently-opened second section of this Bulletin Board, carrying industry-to-industry offers – thus driving the benefits of cross-European competition down the supply chain. At this point, I would like to pay tribute to the support we have enjoyed in these efforts from the Commission. We share, I believe, the same analysis, and are travelling the same road together. Of course, as different institutions, our responsibilities are different – they look for community solutions, we for essentially inter-governmental arrangements. But we have already I believe demonstrated that these approaches can be entirely mutually reinforcing. And, in a city where cooperation between institutions is not necessarily the norm, it has been a real pleasure for me in the last few years to find how easily and constructively we have been able to work in partnership with the Commission. But, as I just remarked, the nature of the EDA enterprise is fundamentally intergovernmental – so the development to which I attach the most importance, the EDA achievement in this area which I regard with the greatest satisfaction, was the agreement last month by 26 European Defence Ministers in our Steering Board to a joint Strategy for the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base. It is an unusually trenchant document. Europe today has widely capable, and in many sectors world-leading, defence industries and technologies. “But” – and here I am quoting the Ministers’ words - “we recognise that is largely the result of past investment.... The point has now been reached where we need fundamental change in how we manage the ‘business aspects’ of defence in Europe – and time is not on our side.... The essence of the change is to recognise . . . that we must therefore press on with developing a truly European DTIB, as something more than a sum of its national parts”. The Ministers state that to continue with a predominantly national approach to the business of defence in Europe “is no longer economically sustainable – and in a world of multi-national operations it is operationally unacceptable, too”. The strategy then lays out the characteristics of this “truly European” DTIB. It must be more integrated, more specialised, less duplicative, and more interdependent. It must draw on skills, technology and innovation from beyond the traditional defence sector – and from all across the enlarged Union. It must be driven by consolidation on the demand side – more pooling of efforts and resources amongst European ministries of defence – and encourage greater consolidation on the supply side too. More competition must be introduced into the European defence equipment market – and where that is not appropriate cooperative approaches must be more effectively conducted. All this is accompanied by a full and frank account of the challenges, of policy and practice, to be overcome in achieving this vision – and a clear expression of determination to meet and overcome them. Well – will it work? Or should it just be filed under “empty rhetoric?” Here, in short summary, are my three main reasons for optimism: First, the Ministers have directed us to work with national armaments directors (and indeed the industry) on a specific action-plan – and will themselves review progress in one year’s time, on the basis of an Agency report. Second, important actions have preceded the Strategy. I have referred already to the first practical manifestation of the proper defence equipment market we seek, i.e. the Code of Conduct and its Bulletin Boards of concrete cross-border competitive opportunities. Member States have, for the first time, pledged mutual help on materiel supply in operational emergencies. 19 of our Member States have put together over €50m for the first cross-Europe exercise in jointly commissioning research and technology work. In different combinations, other groups of Member States have embraced new projects in areas as various as software-defined radio, unmanned air vehicles, and soldiers’ personal equipment. Practical pooling of efforts and resources on a European scale is really starting to happen. Third, the Strategy is a statement not just of political will, but also of economic necessity. If we want a future European defence industry which amounts to more than niche producers working increasingly for US primes, then the Guadeloupe answer is no longer acceptable. In short, Europe is too small a place for us not to integrate our efforts. And the sooner we do so, the better the outcome will be.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2007/06/11/EDA_s_Witney_says_European_defence_collaboration_is_economic_necessity_not_just_political_goal
EDA_NEWS_1071	2007-05-24	NEWS	New Chief Executive of European Defence Agency Appointed	 Javier Solana, Head of the European Defence Agency, announced today that the EDA Steering Board has appointed Alexander Weis of Germany as the Agency’s Chief Executive from 1 October, succeeding Nick Witney, who has led the Agency since its creation in July 2004. The Steering Board also decided that, from 1 January 2008, there will be two Deputy Chief Executives. Carlo Magrassi, currently Armaments Director of the Agency, will be in charge of strategy and Adam Sowa, the Deputy National Armaments Director in the Polish Ministry of Defence, will handle Agency operations. They will succeed Germany’s Hilmar Linnenkamp, who has served as sole deputy since the creation of the EDA. “Nick Witney has done an outstanding job as the first head of the Agency,” Solana said. “He led the team which laid the foundations for the EDA in 2004 and, since becoming its first Chief Executive, has created a vibrant institution which has delivered substantial results and made a real difference to European defence cooperation.” “During this time, we have seen the opening of the European defence equipment market through the Code of Conduct, the publication of the thought-provoking Long-Term Vision report, the launch of a new framework for joint R&T (the Joint Investment Programme), agreement on a strategy for the defence technological and industrial base and the start of work on a new Capabilites Development Plan,” he added. “My deep thanks also go to Hilmar Linnenkamp, whose wisdom and experience have made a decisive contribution to the Agency’s success.” Weis, 47, is currently Deputy National Armaments Director in the German Ministry of Defence. “Alexander Weis has been closely involved in the work of the Agency. The Steering Board is confident that he is the right person to take forward the work which Nick Witney has started. I know that he will receive excellent support from Carlo Magrassi and Adam Sowa,” Solana said. “It has been a privilege to lead the European Defence Agency during its first years and to see it mature so quickly into a major player on the European defence scene,” Witney said. “But the Agency will only continue to thrive if its staff are regularly interchanged with the national Ministries of Defence who are its shareholders. I could not wish for anyone better to hand over to than Alexander,” he added.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2007/05/23/New_Chief_Executive_of_European_Defence_Agency_Appointed
EDA_NEWS_1072	2007-03-29	NEWS	Introductory comments by EDA Steering Board chairman Eero Lavonen	 Today we have reached another milestone for the European Defence Agency with the launch of the second phase of the European Bulletin Board portal, which will extend the benefits of a more open Defence Equipment Market to businesses across Europe. Since the new regime was introduced last July, we have seen more than 6.5 billion Euros of contract opportunities advertised on the EBB across the full range of defence equipment – the first time such contracts have been systematically opened up to cross-border bidding. But only the major defence equipment suppliers can serve as prime contractors for big orders. The Code of Best Practice in the Supply Chain, which drives the principles of competition enshrined in the Code of Conduct, is a vital element of the regime on defence procurement.  It encourages prime contractors to advertise sub-contracting opportunities openly and to consider bids from companies in all 22 subscribing Member States equally and according to objective criteria. Small- and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, will now be able to look at business opportunities with major contractors in one place – on the EDA’s Electronic Bulletin Board. This will be a real benefit for them, addressing one of the main issues faced by smaller companies, and it will bring benefits for the prime contractors too by broadening their supplier base. We are very grateful to the AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe for its cooperation in launching this initiative and for the support of industry, without which it cannot succeed. I was very pleased to welcome the ASD President, Mr Charles Edelstenne, to talk to the Steering Board about the project and to attend the launch and this press conference. I would also like to thank Nick Witney and his staff at the Agency for bringing this project to fruition. Because of the long lead times in defence contracting, we have not yet seen a big increase in cross-border contracts as a result of the EBB and the Code of Conduct. But the initial progress report for the first eight months is very encouraging. The launch of phase two, and the refinements to the regime agreed by Member States, make us even more confident that we will achieve our goal of strengthening the European defence industry by creating a transparent, open and competitive defence equipment market with increased opportunities for all.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2007/03/28/Introductory_comments_by_EDA_Steering_Board_chairman_Eero_Lavonen
EDA_NEWS_1073	2007-05-03	NEWS	"European Defence Industry Must Break Out of ""National Boxes"", EDA Chief Executive Nick Witney says"	 9th International Exhibition of Defence & Security Technologies, IDET 2007 The European Defence Market Intervention by Nick Witney, Chief Executive, EDA It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to be back in the Czech Republic, and to visit this important international exhibition of Defence and Security Technologies. I shall spare you my standard lecture on the European Defence Agency – our formal roles and responsibilities. I would just invite you to think of us as the “back office” of the European Security and Defence Policy – the guys tasked to work with the Member States so that Europe has stronger defence capabilities to call on, and a stronger European defence technological and industrial base. To achieve this, our consistent message is that Europeans must pool their efforts and resources. We cannot continue to conduct the business of defence in separate national boxes. The money is just no longer there, even in the biggest national defence budgets. Picking up that phrase of the business of defence, as in all businesses there is a demand side and a supply side. On the demand side, pooling of efforts and resources means more joint procurements, and more cooperative programmes. This will provide not just economies of scale, but also interoperability benefits in a world in which all our military operations are now multinational.  But this sorts of harmonisation of military requirements depends on our military planners sharing the same conception of what future operations will be like, and what capabilities will be required – in short, wanting the same things. To assist this process we have already reached agreement with all the Agency’s Member States on an important conceptual document – the Long Term Vision for European Defence Capability and Capacity needs. We are now taking that forward, again working with all the Member States, on a more detailed Capability Development Plan. This work on the demand side is vital, because of the obvious truth that there is ultimately no future for a defence industry in Europe which does not produce the equipments and systems that our future armed forces will want to buy.  But governments are heavily involved on the supply side too – as main customer, as regulator, as investor, sometimes as owner. And here too we need to follow through the imperative of pooling and sharing, and recall that the days of effective production inside a national box are over. European industry will not remain globally competitive if we continue to operate as 20-something separate national technological and industrial bases. We need – and the Member States have accepted – to integrate our efforts into a truly European DTIB – a DTIB which is less duplicative, more specialised, and more interdependent. This is what in another context is being called an inconvenient truth – but it is true nonetheless.  The concerns of Member States are understandable. But I am here today to tell you that the EDA has been very strong on this point – we have clearly said, and constantly repeat, that the vision of an integrated European DTIB and a true European Defence Equipment Market will not be realised if it turns out simply to be a bonanza for the big Western European prime contractors.  Everyone must have the opportunity to find their own place in such a European DTIB.  Excellent second- and third-tier companies must have full and fair opportunities in the new European-sized market.  Non traditional suppliers, and especially SMEs, must be actively promoted. Old Europe, if I can use that phrase, must not ignore the tremendous human capital to be found in “New Europe” – in the recently-enlarged European Union. We would like to see more sub-contracts and more investment, coming from the big Western European prime contractors into Member States such as the Czech Republic. This concern with opportunity for all is more than just words – we have taken several important steps.  As you may be aware, 22 of our Member States began last year to advertise their defence contracting opportunities to suppliers across the European Union on a special section of the EDA website – the so-called Electronic Bulletin Board.  If you have not done so - please check it out at . You will find advertised there some 160 contracting opportunities, with a value conservatively estimated at € 7 billion, provided by Ministries of Defence across Europe and open to all European suppliers in the 22 Member States. Perhaps even more relevant to smaller industries, you will also find a newly opened second section, in which industry-to-industry offers are advertised. There are about 80 of those posted at the moment, from 14 different major European defence companies.  This represents a wonderful opportunity to win sub-contracts, and to establish profitable new relationships up the supply chain. A second practical point - come back and visit the website in the third week of May.  All being well, we shall by then have launched the first call for proposals under our new Research and Technology Joint Investment Programme. 19 Member States have between them contributed €55 million to jointly fund research in technology relevant for protecting deployed forces. Again, we have taken specific steps to ensure that this is not a bonanza just for the big, traditional suppliers. Indeed, we have insisted that bids against these proposals should always be made by a consortium consisting of at least two different entities from two different Member States. This should provide a great opportunity for excellent but not well-recognised small companies, or research institutes, to team up with larger defence companies elsewhere in Europe in order to respond to this request for proposals. So please do visit our website, and check out the opportunities in the two sections of the Electronic Bulletin Board and, as from second half of May, from the Research and Technology Joint Investment Fund. The successful integration of all Member States into a flourishing European DTIB is an imperative. This is a mission which we, at the EDA, deeply believe in. We know that we have only started – so if you see ways for us to do better, to help further with the difficult transitions ahead, please do not hesitate to contact us and give us the benefit of your advice.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2007/05/02/European_Defence_Industry_Must_Break_Out_of_National_Boxes_EDA_Chief_Executive_Nick_Witney_says
EDA_NEWS_1074	2007-06-05	NEWS	EDA's Witney says no viable alternative to more common spending on defence	 Defence Partnerships Conference London, 5 June 2007 Examining the EDA’s Long-Term Vision report: What are the implications for European Defence Planners? Keynote Address by Nick Witney, Chief Executive, EDA I would like, if you allow me, to begin with a few general remarks about the EDA. It is, after all, a rather unusual organisation, still relatively new, and not always well understood. It is basically a child of the European and Security and Defence Policy, or ESDP in the jargon. You will recall the basics: ESDP was conceived at the Anglo-French Summit at St Malo in 1998; has nothing to do with the territorial defence of Europe – that was and remains NATO’s business; is rather directed towards encouraging Europe to be a more effective contributor to global security, by undertaking crisis management operations; and has shown its utility in such ways as taking over from NATO responsibility for keeping the peace in Bosnia, and last year’s deployment to the Congo to back up the UN peacekeepers over the critical period of the first Congolese general election for 40 years. Indeed, ESDP now has some 17 operations to its credit, though the majority have been civilian in character – police training, supporting the administration of justice, or overseeing disarmament processes. Indeed, it is a particular value-added of ESDP that it can deploy judges, policemen and administrators as well as soldiers. The next two operations on the horizon are a police training effort in Afghanistan, and a substantial operation to take over from the UN their responsibilities for civil administration in Kosovo. So, without setting the Thames or even the Seine on fire, the policy has proved its utility – and, after a bumpy few years at the start of the decade, now seems to have bedded down comfortably alongside NATO. Though institutional frictions remain, earlier worries about this European effort undermining NATO seem generally to have receded. I tend to think of the EDA as the “back office” of the ESDP. The front office is staffed by the diplomats and the policy-makers who set up the institutions, negotiated the arrangements with NATO, agreed the 2003 European Security Strategy – a rather good and sensible document, by the way. It is also staffed by the generals and administrators who run the operations. The purpose of the back office is to support the front office – by working with the Member States to try to ensure that the tools are available to do the job, and that the necessary infrastructure (a robust industrial and technological base) is in place. Working with the Member States is the key concept. It is not only Brits who are allergic to the notion of being bossed around by some Brussels institution in matters of defence. 26 out of 27 Europe’s Member States belong to the EDA (the Danes have an opt-out) - and they are, without exception, determined to retain their sovereign control over how they spend their national defence budgets, and over if and when their men and women are deployed into harm’s way. To make the point, they fund the Agency directly by annual subscription from the 26 national Defence Ministries, not out the general EU budget. They are my shareholders, and I do what they tell me. They tell me to do quite a lot. The Agency is tasked to work across a broad waterfront: military capabilities development; armaments; research and technology; and industrial and market issues. They look to the Agency to provide analyses and proposals; to act as an incubator of ideas and as a think-tank; to perform the role of conscience and of catalyst. For that, we have a hundred staff and an overall annual budget of €22 million. So how, you may ask, can such a small Agency, with little money and no decision-taking authority, hope to affect such a wide agenda? The answer lies in our governance arrangements. The shareholders meet very regularly in the Agency Steering Board – and when the 26 Defence Ministers occupy the seats, as they did 4 times last year, then my boss, Javier Solana, is in the chair. But between-whiles the Board meets in the composition of national Armaments Directors, national military Capability Directors, and so on. Beneath that we have an ever-growing network of working groups, extranet forums, and so forth. In short, we are engaged in a constant and persistent dialogue with the key decision-makers in 26 national ministries of defence. So we have the access: and if our ideas and proposals are good enough, and the national ministries of defence are ready for them, then we can make progress. Worth noting, by the way, that a basic operating principle is variable geometry: if everyone wants to do something, that is fine; if only 6 want to do something, or 15 want to do something else, then that is fine too. We will help and support as best we can. So what does this mean in practice? Perhaps I can start by translating our formal mission statement into something more down-to-earth. The basic problems that drove the Agency’s creation are recognition that Europe’s armed forces are generally ill‑adapted to the new post-Cold War, post-9/11, international security environment; and that the hard facts of economics and indeed operational necessity - recalling that our operations are now multinational - require us to collaborate more closely. So you might say our real mission is to work with the Member States to help them to spend their defence budgets on the right things and not the wrong things; and to do better at pooling our efforts and resources. At this stage, just over two years into the enterprise, I discover that we are really proceeding by trying to build a bridge from both ends. Over on the far bank, we try to help the Member States achieve consensus on the longer term view: what sort of military capability should we all be trying to prioritise a decade, or two decades, hence? What sort of strategy is going to help us maintain globally competitive defence industries in Europe? How can we raise our game – a particularly urgent concern – on defence research and technology? And, on the near bank, we aim to put in place specific practical cooperations – to deliver near-term results which move us out in the direction of the longer term goals. The major pier we have so far established over on the far bank of our bridge is the Long Term Vision of my title. You can find , agreed by 24 Defence Ministers in Finland last October, on our website. Its starting point is that the lead-times in defence are such that the capabilities and capacities we will or will not have in 20 years time are in practice being determined by decisions being made now, on a daily basis. So if we hope to have what we need for the EDSP operations of the future, then we need, despite all the difficulties, to formulate some vision of the future context and nature of those operations. Even if we cannot hope to penetrate the fog of the future, we must at least establish an initial direction of March. The document begins with a look at the reasonably predictable economic and demographic trends which mean that we must reckon with a Europe in 20 years time which is older, relatively poorer and living in a difficult neighbourhood – that is to say, surrounded by regions which may not be coping at all well with globalisation. It draws attention to the problems an aging population will pose for defence recruitment, and defence budgets. It looks at social attitudes towards the use of the military, and suggests that defence planners face two great challenges: first, to adapt to the changing role of force in operations as we now find they have to be conducted – and since I hope a number of you have already read Rupert Smith’s recent book entitled “The Utility of Force”, I shall leave that unelaborated for now; and Second, to adapt to the ever-quickening technological revolution, with its attendant opportunities and threats. The vision then focuses on what this may mean for ESDP operations – less clear-cut, more politically constrained, conducted under 24/7 media scrutiny, and challenged by opponents who are asymmetric not only in structure and methods, but probably in aims and values as well. Against this background, the vision suggests the characteristics that we must embody in our future capabilities - synergy, agility, selectivity, and sustainability – and translates these characteristics into a “future capability profile” across each of the main accepted domains of defence capability. It notes that military activity always requires a mix of kinetic energy and intelligence, and suggests that in the future we will need much less of the former and much more of the latter. It rounds off with some key issues upon which defence planners working towards this capability profile must concentrate: knowledge exploitation; interoperability; the manpower balance (how to ensure enough “boots on the ground” whilst at the same time devoting more of our defence budgets to investment); rapid acquisition; industrial policy; and flexibility for the unforeseen. I do not claim that anything in this vision is especially revolutionary – indeed, the Comprehensive Political Guidance issued a month later at NATO’s Riga Summit points in just the same direction. But I suppose the main point about this document is that it established a baseline – from Valletta to Helsinki and from Lisbon to Bratislava, European Defence Ministries are now all on the same page. We are now working to construct on this baseline a set of more detailed strategies. First amongst them is the strategy for the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base – or DTIB – which the Defence Ministers agreed in our Steering Board last month. That, too, is available on our website. Its message is a clear one – that today’s defence industrial and technological excellence in Europe is the product of past investment; that we are falling badly off the pace; and that – I am quoting here – “we recognise that the point has now been reached when we need fundamental change in how we manage the ‘business aspects’ of defence in Europe – and that time is not on our side. The essence of this change is to recognise that a fully adequate DTIB is no longer sustainable on a strictly national basis – and that we must therefore press on with developing a truly European DTIB as something more that the sum of its national parts”. Continuing to do the business of defence in 20-something separate national boxes is – again I quote – “no longer economically sustainable – and in a world of multinational operations it is operationally unacceptable, too. We need therefore to achieve consolidation on both sides of the market in Europe: aligning and combining our various needs and shared equipment requirements; and meeting them from an increasingly integrated European DTIB”. The strategy has a good deal more of interest to say – especially on the importance of getting more competition into cross-border defence procurement in Europe, and doing something radical about defence R&T – but I must move on. For the Capability Planners of my title, the next step is work on a shared Capability Development Plan. Put simply, we are aiming to develop together the Long Term Vision’s analysis of the required capabilities of the future, so as to produce something which is more detailed and therefore more useful; and at the same time we are seeking to increase mutual transparency between defence ministries in Europe about what their current plans and programmes contain, to flush out the opportunities for doing more things cooperatively. By this we do not just mean the traditional collaborative armaments projects, but options such as shared basing or support, or shared upgrades, or pooled purchases or forces, or indeed mutually complementary role specialisation. As with everything else we do in the Agency, no obligation is involved – the final product, available we hope in about a year’s time, will be in no sense a directive. It will simply be the best analysis that the combined wisdoms of our Defence Ministries can come up with, and a menu of next steps which those who so wish can choose to take. In concluding, let me turn to the near end of the bridge, and quickly run through a short checklist of some of the more tangible results we have delivered – or, to be more exact, we have been instrumental in helping the Member States to deliver: First, in pursuit of the opening of the European Defence Equipment Market, we have secured agreement from 23 of our Member States to open their tendering processes to suppliers from each others’ countries, on a voluntary and reciprocal basis. This arrangement is operationalised through an Electronic Bulletin Board, to be found on our website. You will find there about 180 contracting opportunities for industry, with a total business value pushing €10 billion. There is also a more recently opened, but already thriving, section devoted to industry-to-industry offers – the larger companies have so far posted about a hundred notices for potential subcontractors and suppliers across Europe. Second, we have launched a new joint investment vehicle for defence R&T. Nineteen of our Member States, plus Norway as an EDA associate, have put together over €50 million for jointly commissioning research into technologies relevant to the protection of deployed forces. Nearly 300 entities across Europe have received the first call for proposals – familiar defence companies, SMEs and non-traditional suppliers, universities, research institutes and laboratories. The deal is that they can only apply in consortia involving at least two entities from different Member States – so a ferment of networking and mutual discovery is now in progress. Third, we assisted six of our Member States to put together a joint effort, worth over €100 million, to develop technologies for Software Defined Radio. This revolutionary marriage of computing and communication technologies has huge civilian commercial potential too – which is why the European Commission is also investing substantially in it. We have worked to ensure that these separate civilian and military efforts are mutually reinforcing. Fourth, we have engaged our shareholders on the challenge of getting UAVs flying in regulated airspace. This is an interesting test case for Europe’s ability truly to get its act together. Here is an important new area of military capability which, typically, the Americans have pioneered – and to which Europe has responded so far in a typically fragmented fashion. But if the obstacles – and they are formidable – to operating UAVs alongside manned aircraft can be overcome, than a scale of demand will appear which will not only be hugely important for the aerospace sector in Europe, but will also lead to better and cheaper systems for the military. There is a great deal else I could describe. We now have, for example, around 40 small-scale R&T collaborations, with a combined value of nearly € 200 million, under management on behalf of the different groups of collaborators. We should shortly be able to announce an important step forward towards finally getting some uniformity into the increasingly high-tech personal equipment of the individual infantryman. We have started up an online system for work on new standards. We think we now have a good way forward for our efforts to rationalise the defence equipment testing infrastructure in Europe (just how many wind tunnels do Europeans really need?). Work is underway on SatCom, on maritime surveillance, on non-lethal weapons, and others too numerous to mention. Quite a lot of this is still at the stage of promise rather than realisation. In the final analysis, success on any of the EDA’s agendas will depend on practical and sometimes difficult decisions, taken in 26 different capitals, to follow the logic of agreed analysis and start spending at least a proportion of defence budgets a bit differently. I am entirely confident that this will happen, to the benefit both of Europe’s ability to act as a force for good in the world, and to the benefit of its industries. My confidence is based on the reflection that there is no really viable alternative. But, of course, time will be the judge.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2007/06/04/EDA_s_Witney_says_no_viable_alternative_to_more_common_spending_on_defence
EDA_NEWS_1075	2007-05-14	NEWS	Background on New EDA Initiative on UAVs	 Unmanned Air Vehicle systems are an important ‘breakthrough technology’ which can contribute significantly to meeting the objectives of ESDP operations. A range of aviation companies and research institutes are now investing in the development of UAVs and their related technologies. However, these efforts have been fragmented, with many projects spread across many European countries. The initiative launched today -- the result of extensive consultation between the Agency, the European Commission and the Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD) -- aims to establish a joint and complementary co-operation agenda. The main target of the joint agenda is to address the challenge of enabling UAVs to operate alongside conventional air traffic. This is the key to expanding the use of UAVs beyond the purely military into the security and ultimately commercial domains and to creating the scale of demand around which European industry can unite. Starting with an EDA-funded roadmap study, the proposed approach aims at progression from the current state of affairs, in which military UAVs can fly in segregated airspace, to a situation in which civilian and government-operated UAVs could operate alongside other manned aircraft in integrated airspace by 2012. This will require innovative technology development and system demonstrations for UAVs to be considered fully airworthy and for the right regulatory framework to be in place for this integration. The initial study for a more detailed road-map has a budget of some €500,000. The Agency will work with participating Member States, the Commission and industry on ideas for joint financing and an organisational model for future phases of this initiative. Working together on these issues at a European level can help to generate coherent projects for both security-oriented and commercial UAVs, as well as addressing their military use. This approach will also encourage the development of multi-purpose technologies, supported by budgets of the Commission as well as investment by industry. It will reduce fragmentation and duplication of UAV components which civil and military applications have in common. It has the potential, if properly exploited by all stakeholders, to move Europe quickly to a leadership position in a field which is of prime importance for European armed forces and the European aerospace industry alike.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2007/05/13/Background_on_New_EDA_Initiative_on_UAVs

EDA_NEWS_1077	2006-12-14	NEWS	EU Governments Launch New Plan to Build Defence Capabilities for Future ESDP Operations	 European Union governments agreed today on the principles of a Capability Development Plan, which will provide a systematic and structured approach to building the capabilities required for operations under the European Security and Defence Policy far into the future. The Plan should also assist Member States to develop their national plans and programmes, balancing forces appropriately against ambition and resource. The decision by the Steering Board of the European Defence Agency, which will coordinate work on the CDP, will build on the Long-Term Vision report endorsed by governments in October. The LTV reviewed geopolitical, demographic, economic, technological and military trends over the next 20 years, and set out a high-level view of the defence capabilities which will be required to respond to this changing world. “The LTV is an excellent foundation for our future work, but we now have to make its capability guidance more specific and, therefore, more useful,” said Lo Casteleijn of the Dutch Defence Ministry, who chaired the meeting. The Steering Board, the decision-making body of the Agency on which its 24 participating Member States and the European Commission are represented, was meeting in Capabilities formation, involving senior defence planners from national ministries. “As well as identifying areas for capability improvement, we have to bring out opportunities to pool efforts and to cooperate by sharing information about our national plans. We must also ensure that we give the guidance our defence industries need to help with their research and development efforts,” Casteleijn added. The Steering Board stressed that the CDP was not intended to be an over-arching, supranational plan and that national defence planning and investment decision-taking would remain subject to the sovereign processes of each Member State. The work on the CDP will cover four main areas: Establishing the baseline of shortfalls and their relative priority, from the Headline Goal 2010 exercise, a set of goals agreed by governments in mid-2004 to enable the European Union by 2010 to be able to carry out humanitarian and rescue and peace-keeping tasks in crisis-management operations; Developing the LTV capability guidance , by testing the main hypotheses against “alternative futures” and by a series of capability studies on key issues; Collating a database of Member States’ current defence plans and programmes; Harvesting lessons for future capability from current experience. The process will involve the Agency, Member States, the EU Military Committee, the EU Military Staff and the Council of Ministers. The EDA will establish a team of experts to lead some of the elements and to maintain an overview of all four work strands. The Steering Board emphasised its determination to maintain close involvement with the work, meeting again on this subject in the first half of next year. “One of the reasons the EDA was created was to help provide a systematic and end-to-end approach which would identify ESDP’s capability and capacity priorities, from current urgent operational requirements to longer-term challenges and opportunities. The CDP will provide a framework of agreed capability priorities well beyond the Headline Goal 2010 horizon,” said EDA Chief Executive Nick Witney. “But it should also be a vehicle to promote dialogue and transparency among Member States on defence planning and investment and what their medium- to long-term defence planning looks like, so that opportunities can be identified and pursued for joint investment and collaborative projects, for pooled acquisition of capabilities or for anything else where working together promises better value for money for constrained defence budgets,” he added. The Steering Board also reviewed the range of capability development efforts already underway within the Agency’s structure of Integrated Development Teams, and agreed that a small increment to the Agency’s staff was needed to fully exploit the emerging opportunities and handle the extra work. The Steering Board also directed the Agency to take forward work on Network Enabled Capabilities (NEC) for ESDP, working closely with all relevant Council actors, and stakeholders. It finally took note of the analysis of Member States’ responses on the UK’s Strategic Airlift Initiative and directed the Agency to further explore with the willing Member States possibilities to pool acquisitions of additional aircrafts, to partner in contracting transport services, and to pool maintenance and training in case of additional A400M procurement, – noting that, for some Member States, battlegroup airlift needs in particular are unlikely to be fully met unless on a pooled basis.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2006/12/13/EU_Governments_Launch_New_Plan_to_Build_Defence_Capabilities_for_Future_ESDP_Operations
EDA_NEWS_1078	2007-02-01	NEWS	Solana, Verheugen, Svensson at EDA Conference - Radical Change and True European Market Needed to Secure Future of European Defence Industry	 Senior government and industry representatives warned that the survival of an autonomous European defence industry was at risk without radical change - to create a genuine market on a continental scale, focused on mastering key technologies and delivering what Europe’s armed forces will need in the future. At a conference in Brussels organised by the European Defence Agency on strengthening the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB), more than 300 participants from government, industry and academia heard both a bleak assessment of current trends and specific proposals to encourage investment and overcome fragmentation. “None of us can any longer afford to sustain a healthy and comprehensive DTIB on a national basis,” said Javier Solana, Head of the EDA, in his keynote speech. “The future health, maybe even survival, of Europe’s defence industry requires a European approach, and a European strategy.” He said action was required soon to bring to fruition the vision of a future European DTIB, endorsed by EU Member States last autumn, which would be integrated and inter-dependent. “We must develop greater mutual reliance on diverse centres of excellence, and less dependence on non-European sources for key defence technologies.” Solana urged a shift in defence spending towards research and development and equipment procurement, as well as alignment of national requirements into consolidated orders to create economies of scale. He also called for measures to take advantage of the human capital of newer EU Member States, and a focus on producing equipment needed for the very different security challenges of the future. The conference also heard that the European Commission is planning a number of initiatives to improve competitiveness, starting with a project to map the EDTIB and provide decision makers with accurate data on the economic situation of defence industries at EU level. Commission Vice-President Günter Verheugen also outlined a proposal for a Defence Procurement Directive, which could complement the EDA’s own voluntary Code of Conduct on Defence Procurement. Both initiatives aim at opening up markets by introducing more transparency and competition. The Commission also advocated a Regulation on intra-EU transfers of defence equipment. He said the visible and invisible costs of current obstacles amounted to over €3 billion a year. “Building a European DTIB has many facets. Much of the practical, daily work is undertaken by the EDA. Commission initiatives can also act as a catalyst in the process. But a lot will depend on the political will of the Member States,” Verheugen said. “The question is: for how long can the DTIB survive if Europe continues to postpone reforms which are generally accepted as unavoidable?” Åke Svensson, President-designate of the Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD), agreed that the creation of an efficiently functioning European Defence Equipment Market was the essential foundation for shaping the EDTIB. Market forces would be complemented by increased investment in key technologies and competencies. But more effort was required because Europe still lacked a coherent Defence Strategic Research Agenda comparable to the common Strategic Research Agenda in civil aeronautics. “We see the need for a “Group of Wise Men” to propose the agenda and conceptualize the framework in which Europe will be able to define and provide funding for important Key Technologies and Competencies,” Svensson said. EDA Chief Executive Nick Witney said the Agency would build on the strong consensus at the conference to further refine the “vision” of the future EDTIB, and to work with the EU Member States, the European Commission and the defence industry on the specific actions required to make it a reality. “No one thinks this will be easy. But the consensus on the need for action, and on the direction in which we must move, is increasingly strong. As Javier Solana reminded us: this is not merely a matter of economics, but of the infrastructure of Europe’s essential security.” 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2007/01/31/Solana_Verheugen_Svensson_at_EDA_Conference_-_Radical_Change_and_True_European_Market_Needed_to_Secure_Future_of_European_Defence_Industry
EDA_NEWS_1079	2006-12-07	NEWS	EDA Welcomes European Commission Clarification on EU Defence Procurement	 The European Defence Agency welcomes the new European Commission guidelines on defence contracts published today as complementary to the Agency’s own agenda for creating a more effective defence equipment market in Europe. Article 296 of the EC Treaty allows Member States to derogate from internal market rules if that is necessary for the protection of their essential security interests. Since July, our voluntary Code of Conduct, to which 22 European Union Member States subscribe, has covered such contracts and has for the first time brought competition into this “Article 346 of the TFEU area”, which in practice accounts for the bulk of European defence procurement. The Commission’s Interpretative Communication seeks to clarify the borderline between Article 346 of the TFEU and the internal market The Agency is sure that its participating Member States will find the Communication helpful in that context. “Every initiative that contributes to the breaking down of protectionist barriers in European defence procurement is to be welcomed. Getting a better market going is vital for the preservation of an internationally competitive defence technological and industrial base” said Nick Witney, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency. The Code of Conduct on Defence Procurement requires Ministries of Defence to advertise their procurements on the EDA website and welcome bids from across Europe, treating bidders from all subscribing Member States equally. Today, some 85 contract opportunities with a value approaching 5 billion Euros are posted on the electronic bulletin board at http://www.eda.europa.eu/ebbweb/.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2006/12/06/EDA_Welcomes_European_Commission_Clarification_on_EU_Defence_Procurement
EDA_NEWS_1080	2007-02-14	NEWS	EDA success in interests of U.S. as well as Europe, EDA Chief Executive Nick Witney says	 The EDA’s goals: strengthening Europe’s capabilities and defence industrial base   Let me first try to put the European Defence Agency in context, by speaking briefly about European defence. Next month we mark the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome – the moment when the original six set up the Common Market. So it is a time for recollection – and few recollections of those early post-war years are as intriguing as how close Europe came, back in the early 1950s, to establishing a European Defence Community. Forget the sort of carefully nuanced initiatives which proceed under the banner of European defence today – this would have been real, full-blooded common defence, with a standing European army under central command, sustained by a common budget. Even more intriguing, President Truman was all for it – and so was Eisenhower, after the change of administration. But eventually it came to nothing, NATO got going, and defence rather disappeared from the specifically European agenda for the next half century. It reappeared as the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), as recently as 1999. And I think it fair to say that the welcome it got on this side of the Atlantic was less than wholehearted. Okay, so the Brits were in there from the beginning, determined to ensure that this new policy developed only in ways compatible with NATO. But would there not be others pursuing different agendas, dreaming of using the policy to separate Europe from America? And was there not more than a dash of pretentiousness about this new European enthusiasm – particularly in light of the then-recent Balkan campaigns? True, the Europeans had adopted the so-called Helsinki Headline Goal for improving their military capabilities – but there was a long history in NATO of trying, without conspicuous success, to get Europe to share more of the military burden. And I guess it is at this last point – the bit where people point to the gap between the ambition and rhetoric on the one hand, and actual capability on the other – that the European Defence Agency comes in. I like to think of the EDA as European defence’s “back office”. The “front office” came first, at the beginning of the new policy. It is staffed by diplomats and generals. The diplomats worked their way through the creation of new institutions, and the negotiation of the Berlin+ arrangements with NATO. Then, in 2003, they agreed the European Security Strategy – a remarkably clear, and blessedly short, document which tells you in effect what the ESDP is for. It analyses the post-Cold War (and post-9/11) world in terms with which I think Americans should be comfortable – pointing out that the new threats and challenges are not the conventional adversaries of the past, but such less tractable yet equally menacing dangers as terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, state failure, regional conflict and organised crime. It acknowledges that Europe has a responsibility to take a greater share of the burden of sustaining global security. And it asserts without equivocation that “The transatlantic relationship is irreplaceable. Acting together the European Union and the United States can be a formidable force for good in the world. Our aim should be an effective and balanced partnership with the USA”. The “front office”, as I have noted, is staffed by generals as well as diplomats. They have run Europe’s crisis management operations – a surprising 16 of them to date, from the Balkans, to the Congo, to the Middle East, to Aceh in Indonesia. True, many of these operations have been very small, and the majority have been civilian in character, involving not soldiers, but judges, policemen, observers, experts in civil administration. Indeed, Europe senses that it has a rather specific brand of crisis management capacity to offer, which fuses hard and soft power and focuses as much on preventing conflicts, and sorting out their aftermath, as it does on dousing the blaze. Relative peanuts you may think, but it all adds up, and it may surprise you to know that in recent years there has been a fairly consistent level of about 70 thousand European troops deployed outside the continent, whether under UN, EU, NATO, or national flags. This, I suggest, is not nothing. On the other hand, it is also less than 5% of the nearly two million men and women that we keep in uniform in Europe – and the fact that some 80% of this total are simply not deployable outside their national territories tells you that the modernisation of Europe’s defence capabilities still has a very long way to go. It also tells you that Europeans collectively are not getting proper value from what they spend on defence – about $ 250 billion a year, less than half US expenditure but in absolute terms a pretty substantial input, particularly in relation to the achieved output of usable military capability. There is nothing like operations to bring you face to face with your deficiencies and limitations – so it is no surprise that it was just as the ESDP was beginning to become operational that the European presidents and prime ministers decided, in 2003, that they had better complement the “front office” with a “back office” – an agency focused on the tools needed for the job. Tools and infrastructure – because the European leaders were becoming equally concerned about the condition of Europe’s underpinning defence technological and industrial base. The evidence was accumulating (and I shall come back to this) of steady erosion of Europe’s competitiveness and capacity on the industrial side. So, just over two years ago, the EDA opened its doors for business – with the mission of supporting the Members States in their efforts to improve their defence capabilities for crisis management operations. Our terms of reference range over military capabilities, defence research and technology, armaments, and industry and market issues – in other words, pretty much everything except the policy issues and the operations which the front office handles. To address this wide-ranging agenda, we have one hundred staff (drawn from 20 different nationalities) and an annual budget of less than $30m. National Defence Ministers hold on to their money, and their decision-making authority: in matters of defence, no-one is prepared to be bossed around by some powerful supranational body in Brussels. So to change things we have to get the Member States to agree and – the bottom line – to spend their defence budgets in rather different ways than they might otherwise have done. Fortunately, we have wonderful access – our Steering Board, chaired by my boss Javier Solana, comprises the Defence Ministers in person, and met 4 times last year. And we are ultimately working with the grain – the Member States want to do the right thing, even if, like Saint Augustine, they may not always want to do it right now. They do want to stop spending their money on the wrong things and spend it on the right things instead; and they do recognise the necessity of increasingly pooling their efforts and resources. Because everybody knows that if Europeans want to preserve effective military clout, and a globally competitive industry, they have no choice but to cooperate. The era in which the business of defence could effectively be managed in 24 separate national boxes in Europe is now over; none of us can any longer afford it. The only way forward is, to express it in business terms, to consolidate demand, encourage the consolidation of the supply side, and create a continental scale of market in which demand and supply can meet. So how are we doing? We have a wide range of specific projects in hand, from Software-Defined Radio (which is going rather well) to an effort to rationalise equipment test facilities across Europe. We have under management a portfolio of over 40 individual research & technology collaborations. But we think it is at the strategic level that we can ultimately add most value – which is why arguably our most important output to date is a document called the Long Term Vision, published last October, which attempts to look forward over the next two decades and draw some conclusions about the environment in which ESDP operations will take place, and what that means for the sort of military capabilities and industrial capacity we will need. This Long-Term Vision majors on the changing role of force in today’s world, and the accelerating advance of science and technology. It concludes that we must decisively break with the old concepts of warfare which obtained in the last century, which were all about unloading as much ordnance as possible on conventional opponents. It underlines that application of force will have to be increasingly modulated with what is happening in the political arena; that operations will likely take place in constrained and ambiguous circumstances, under tight rules of engagement and 24/7 media scrutiny. It emphasises that the decisive capabilities of the future will be less heavy metal and high explosive, and more the capabilities that provide situational awareness, and allow rapid communication and decision-taking. Operations will be expeditionary, and multinational, placing a premium on interoperability, deployability and sustainability. Perhaps not a wholly original analysis – but 24 Ministers of Defence are now on this same page. In passing, I think more surprise was created by some of the demographic and economic analysis the document contains – when you realise that in 2025 European will comprise only 6% of the world’s population and that the average European will be 45 years old, it makes you think. This year, we will be taking the analysis down one level, and working towards more detailed guidance on where we should all be concentrating our investment – on network-enabled capabilities, on strategic lift, and so on. Analysis never fixed anything in and of itself – but we can at least make Ministries of Defence feel increasingly uncomfortable if they persist in prioritising the purchase of main battle tanks and combat aircraft. On the industrial side, I think we have made more conspicuous progress. I referred earlier to the traditional way of doing defence procurement largely on a national basis. A security get-out clause in the European treaties has allowed more than half of European defence procurement to be sheltered from the competition rules of the Common Market. Without abandoning that clause, almost all Member States have now agreed, on a voluntary and reciprocal basis, to offer the bulk of their new procurement opportunities to suppliers in each other’s countries. The Electronic Bulletin Board on the EDA’s website on which these offers are posted went live last July – and now advertises around $9 billion of business. In passing, I should emphasise that this has nothing at all to do with “Fortress Europe”. It is purely about how Europeans deal with one another. It leaves the position of US exporters unaffected. More competition will make defence budgets go further. But we are just as interested in how greater play for market forces can help the European defence technological and industrial base (DTIB). At a major EDA conference earlier this month bringing together top government officials and industrialists from across Europe, there was striking consensus on this. As Commissioner Verheugen expressed it: “The question is: for how long can the DTIB survive if Europe continues to postpone reforms that are generally accepted as unavoidable?” We need more competition in Europe, and we need more cooperation; if governments can consolidate demand – offer to the market more joint programmes – the supply side will respond. Anything else is economically unsustainable. And it makes operational sense too – there is no form of interoperability better than different national contingents on multinational operations using the same kit. And I should note that this logic of European cooperation gets a helpful assist from the difficulties European industries find in accessing the US defence market and in technology exchange across the Atlantic. We hope to crystallise all this into a top level European DTIB strategy for the Defence Ministers to consider this summer. In closing, a quick word on Research and Technology. For the first time we have put together the data – and it is not so much data as writing on the wall. Since the year 2000, the US has increased its spending on defence R&D by over 9% a year; collectively, Europeans have increased by less than 1.5%. So you now out-spend us by 6 to 1, and the DARPA budget exceeds the entire sum of European MoDs’ R&T expenditure. We are eating the seed corn. Part of the problem is that only 6 or 7 European nations have ever gone in for defence R&T. So last year we devised and launched a new vehicle for joint investment, providing a way into the business for nations who had not previously been able to spend money effectively on defence R&T on a national basis. The fund totals $70 million, with 19 of our 24 Member States contributing; as a sign of the times, one of the major contributors is Poland. So is our glass half empty or half full? If I were you, I would reserve judgement; Europe has promised so much in these areas in the past, to so little effect. But I would wish the enterprise well. On the capabilities side, this is absolutely not a zero-sum game with NATO: our activities are complementary, and if Europeans do manage to raise their game on defence, it seems to me to matter not a jot whether this is done on a NATO or an EU ticket. On the industrial side, we need to succeed if there is to be any sort of European defence industry to give the US primes a run for their money – ultimately, I suggest, in your interest as much as ours. Personally, I have no doubt that the enterprise will succeed, since there is simply no alternative. The key question is how long will it take and what will be lost if the results do not come through sooner rather than later. But, from a US perspective, I suggest that NATO’s recent Riga Summit declaration had it right: “A stronger EU will further contribute to our common security”. So, fingers crossed.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2007/02/13/EDA_success_in_interests_of_U_S_as_well_as_Europe_EDA_Chief_Executive_Nick_Witney_says
EDA_NEWS_1081	2006-11-13	NEWS	EU Defence Ministers Club Together to Research Better Protection for Armed Forces	 European Union Defence Ministers agreed today to launch a new joint research programme into technologies for protecting their armed forces against threats such as snipers, booby traps and improvised bombs, establishing a ground-breaking mechanism for collaborative action to help boost Europe’s efforts in Defence Research and Technology. A ministerial meeting of the Steering Board of the European Defence Agency, which will coordinate the new scheme, formally approved a three-year Joint Investment Programme (JIP) worth € 54.23 million and involving 19 European governments1. “If Europe is to maintain an effective defence technological and industrial base and develop the military capabilities we will need in the future, we simply have to spend more on R&T and do much more together,” said Javier Solana, the Head of the Agency, who chaired the meeting. “Today’s decision represents a major step in that direction and demonstrates the creativity and the political will of EU governments. As I reported to the Council of Ministers, the Agency has now begun to deliver substantial results – and this is prominent among them,” he added. Unlike previous collaborations on defence R&T, which involved governments negotiating financial and industrial shares for each individual project, the JIP sets up a common budget to fund the whole programme with a management committee representing the contributors to oversee the selection and financing of individual projects. The votes of the contributors are weighted according to the size of their contributions, though decisions will be taken by consensus wherever possible. The programme will focus on a limited number of specific R&T priorities driven by agreed capability requirements for future operations: collective survivability, individual protection, data analysis, secure wireless communication and mission planning and training. In a further boost to collaborative action, the Steering Board also welcomed new initiatives for joint work on Software Defined Radio (SDR), a technology for secure communications with important potential applications for civilian and military use. Five countries – Finland, France, Italy, Spain and Sweden – announced an ad-hoc joint research project (ESSOR) under the EDA umbrella worth an estimated 100 million Euros aimed at enhancing interoperability (in Europe and with the U.S. and NATO) of medium-term national SDR projects and at promoting a European technological and industrial capacity of strategic importance. A related EDA study focuses on specific military SDR requirements for the longer-term. Both of these initiatives complement the WINTSEC project announced in October by European Commission Vice President Günter Verheugen, who is also a member of the Steering Board. The project will study wireless interoperability for civil security purposes. The role of the Agency will be to coordinate its study on longer-term military specifications and the medium-term ESSOR ad hoc project and ensure that these efforts are complementary to the civil technology work strand of the Commission Security Research Programme. “This is an excellent example of how we can maximise the return from our investments thanks to governments, the EDA and the Commission working closely together,” Solana said. The Steering Board, the decision-making body for the EDA, also approved the Agency’s Work Programme for 2007. Its major directions are related to the Long-Term Vision report which was presented to the Steering Board in October. Major initiatives for 2007 include establishing an ESDP Capability Development Plan; developing a European Defence R&T Strategy to identify at the European level key defence technologies to be developed and preserved in Europe; elaborating the characteristics of the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base of the future and the way to achieve it; and identifying practical opportunities for collaboration by exploiting a “cooperative armaments process”, starting with the Armoured Fighting Vehicles and 21st Century Soldier areas. “Today’s meeting is probably the most productive we have yet had. It is great to feel that the Agency is picking up momentum and starting to show some really substantial results,” said EDA Chief Executive Nick Witney.

EDA_NEWS_1082	2006-10-17	NEWS	EDA Hosts Seminar With Industry On Defence Test Facilities	 The European Defence Agency hosted a seminar today at which high level representatives from national defence ministries and industry discussed how to increase cooperation between public and private test and evaluation facilities with a view to rationalising the European Defence Test and Evaluation Base (DTEB). The seminar was organised jointly with the Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD). “Action to reduce duplication in the European DTEB is an important part of the Agency’s work programme, but it is obvious that this rationalisation cannot take place without industry consultation and participation,” said EDA Deputy Chief Executive, Hilmar Linnenkamp, who introduced the event. Industry participants noted that Test & Evaluation was an essential step in any development for technical and contractual reasons and to reduce risk, and there are current overlaps and gaps in national testing capabilities. In defence electronics, typical T&E costs can range from 7% to 13% of the total programme cost. There are currently 40 000 people employed in the testing sector. “This event has been an excellent opportunity for the EDA, governments and industries to join forces to contribute to a barrier-free European Defence Equipment Market,” said ASD Secretary General, Francois Gayet during his presentation. The participants considered the DTEB rationalisation as a long term objective of strategic importance and agreed to strengthen the dialogue between the EDA, its participating Member States and industry in this area with a view to establishing a joint action plan in due course.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2006/10/16/EDA_Hosts_Seminar_With_Industry_On_Defence_Test_Facilities
EDA_NEWS_1083	2006-10-26	NEWS	EDA Hosts Workshop to Help New Member States Benefit From European Defence Equipment Market	 The European Defence Agency today hosted a workshop bringing together National Armaments Directors and officials from countries which joined the European Union in 2004 and Romania and Bulgaria with representatives of the European defence companies which often act as prime contractors for major defence equipment purchases. The aim of the workshop was to support the new Member States whose defence industries have to undergo a significant transformation so that they can better integrate into the new European Defence Equipment Market. Specifically, it aimed to help contractors and small and medium-sized enterprises from those countries to find future business opportunities, particularly with the established major European prime contractors and first tier suppliers, and to become more competitive. There was also a discussion about how to ensure that specialist competencies from across Europe are included in the future Defence Technological and Industrial Base. The meeting was part of the EDA’s work to share widely the benefits of the new European defence equipment market, operated on the basis of the Code of Conduct on Defence Procurement and Code of Best Practice in the Supply Chain, which came into effect on 1 July. The Code of Conduct commits subscribing Member States (sMS) to maximising fair and equal opportunities for all suppliers based in other sMS by setting transparent and objective criteria for selecting bidders and awarding contracts. The Code of Best Practice in the Supply Chain is about driving the same principles down the supply chain and influencing the appropriate behaviour. The meeting, which was organised in conjunction with the Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD), allowed the new Member States to talk about their experiences of working with contractors and dealing with different technologies. The contractors explained how they identify and assess potential competitive advantages and how countries could attract inward investment in these areas. “It is clear that the EDA participating Member States who joined the EU most recently and those who will join next year have a special transformation process to go through in their defence industries,” said Ulf Hammarström, the EDA’s Director for Industry and Market. “Today’s workshop has helped to show the importance of the ongoing creation of the true European Defence Equipment Market where there are significant opportunities for innovative companies, whatever their size. The Agency will do all it can to help them take advantage of these opportunities.” he added. The participants warmly welcomed the initiative. General Adam Sowa, Poland’s Deputy Armaments Director, described it “as a very useful opportunity and an excellent example of how the EDA can add value”. We see the EDA as the most important platform for facilitating our integration into the developing European Defence Technological and Industrial Base,” he said.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2006/10/25/EDA_Hosts_Workshop_to_Help_New_Member_States_Benefit_From_European_Defence_Equipment_Market
EDA_NEWS_1084	2006-10-03	NEWS	EDA Steering Board News Conference Opening Remarks by Head of Agency Javier Solana	 A good meeting – many thanks to our Finnish hosts for their hospitality and organisation. The main business was a good discussion of a very fascinating document produced by the Agency – a “Long-Term Vision of ESDP Capability and Capacity Needs”. In other words – the document attempts to address such questions as: What will the world be like in 20 years time? What will ESDP operations be like? What tools will we need to support the European Security Strategy? What problems and dilemmas must our defence planners confront? It is vital to have this kind of 20-year perspective, given the lead times typically involved in developing defence capability. Decisions we take, or fail to take, today will affect whether we have the right military capabilities, and the right capacities in Europe’s defence technological and industrial base, in the third decade of this century. Of course, the document does not provide, and does not pretend to provide, a comprehensive route map into the future. It needs to be thought of more as a compass bearing to help us advance into the fog of the future – a line of march that we will need to check at regular intervals. The document will be released to you shortly. It is the condensation of a very great deal of wisdom and advice harvested from, amongst others, the Institute of Security Studies in Paris, the EU’s own Military Committee, and eminent scientists and technologists across Europe. The output is concise and – I hope you will agree – both stimulating and readable. It is not a “consensus document” – so not every Defence Minister in our Steering Board has necessarily subscribed to each and every thought and expression in it. What the Steering Board have done, however, is welcome it as a solid foundation on which to build the next stage of the EDA’s agendas. To go back to my image of a compass, the Ministers agreed that this document is pointing in the right direction, as far as any of us can discern. We also took stock in the Steering Board of progress towards establishing a new joint investment programme for defence research and technology efforts in the force protection area. Those of you who have followed the EDA’s affairs will know that we have been working on this for nearly a year, from the point when the Hampton Court summit identified the need to increase defence research and technology spend in Europe, and to do more of it collaboratively. We are very close to achieving the first such joint programme – with a substantial majority of our Member States taking part, and a joint fund to apply to the research objectives amounting to some tens of millions of euros. We noted that one last push is necessary, to get the last details nailed down in a way which suits the maximum number of potential contributors. But we directed the Agency to conclude its efforts with the participating Member States and to produce its “best and final” proposal for us to decide on in the Steering Board when next we meet, in Brussels in mid-November. Finally, we looked at the medium-term perspective for the Agency – what should its priorities be, and what financial framework should it have, over the next three years. That is formally a decision for the Council to make at the end of the year. Today we agreed on the priorities. Some further work on the Financial Framework is still needed for a Council Decision in November. Altogether, then, an interesting and productive meeting, underlining how the Agency is increasingly fulfilling our hopes that it should “make a difference” in the development of the capabilities we need to support our agreed policies.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2006/10/02/EDA_Steering_Board_News_Conference_Opening_Remarks_by_Head_of_Agency_Javier_Solana
EDA_NEWS_1085	2006-10-20	NEWS	EDA Chief Executive Witney Addresses Chairmen of Parliamentary Defence Committee	 Perhaps I may begin by affirming how pleased I am to be here with you today. I never come to Helsinki without reflecting that it was here that, at the Helsinki European Council of 1999, that the European Security and Defence Policy, ESDP, was born. Today, you have only to look at where the Union is undertaking its now characteristic brand of crisis management operation to realise that, during the intervening seven years, ESDP has come of age. As we speak, the Union is running no fewer than 12 such operations, in locations as far afield as South-East Asia, the Balkans, and Africa. Most of them, of course, are civilian in nature. But the current peace support operations in Bosnia and the Congo are significant military undertakings. And to this list may shortly be added responsibility for Kosovo, following the expected transfer of responsibility from NATO – and one thinks also of the major European deployments taking place in South Lebanon which, though not formally an ESDP operation, bear the hallmark of collective European action. Indeed, whether under the Union or some other flag, an average of more than 70,000 European service personnel were deployed outside Europe in the course of 2005. On that basis, we may fairly claim to be beginning to live up to the promise of the European Security Strategy – that the Union would make a more effective and proportionate contribution to the task of maintaining global security. But a start is only a start. 70,000, after all, is less than 4% of the men and women we maintain in uniform in Europe. And, sadly, it is all too obvious that the present demand for European crisis management assistance far outstrips what we are able to provide. There remains, in short, a big gap between what we say we would like to do, and what we actually can do. Which, of course, is where the European Defence Agency comes in. This Agency, the EDA if you will allow me the acronym, is a child of the ESDP. Its mission is broad, to work with the Member States on developing defence capabilities, understood to mean not just more relevant and effective militaries, but also a strong industrial and technological infrastructure. We have, if you like, been charged with working to ensure that the tools are available to do the job – the job being the one described in the European Security Strategy. This makes us a thoroughly unusual kind of Agency. Agencies are normally created to discharge some rather specialist function: they tend to be set up with clearly delineated powers and responsibilities, and probably a significant budget, in order to deliver some specific product or service. The EDA could not be more different. Its functions are wide-ranging, embracing working with defence planners on armed forces modernisation; trying to encourage more collaboration in armaments and research and technology in Europe; and working to strengthen the defence technological and industrial base. On the other hand, the Agency has only a tiny budget, and virtually no delegated powers. And defence being what it is – a subject that lies close to the heart of concepts of national sovereignty – decision-taking on the various subjects I have mentioned is reserved for national defence ministries. So it is through 24 national defence ministries that the EDA must achieve its results. The Agency must act as a conscience, and a catalyst. And it will accomplish its mission only to the extent that national ministries engage with it, and ultimately act in accordance with our guiding principles – which I sometimes summarise as spending defence budgets on the right things and not the wrong things, and increasingly pooling our European efforts and resources. The saving grace in all this is our governance arrangements – the fact that I answer directly to Javier Solana as the Head of the Agency, and that he chairs a Steering Board on which all the Defence Ministers sit in person. This Ministerial Board has met three times already this year, and will meet for a fourth time in Brussels next month. In between-whiles, it meets in other compositions – as National Armaments Directors, or senior capability planners. Through the Steering Board, we have a persistent and continuous dialogue with the top levels of decision-making in the national Ministries of Defence. This is our chance to influence. So, how are we doing? We are now approaching our second anniversary as a going concern – and I am at last beginning to breathe a little easier. The early days of this kind of enterprise are a bit like a ballistic missile launch. There is a countdown, a button is pressed, and vast amounts of energy are visibly released in the form of flame and smoke – but there is a disconcerting pause before lift-off actually occurs. Happily, decisive movement is now apparent. First, we have taken a long stride towards the creation of a genuine market for defence equipment in Europe. Since, I suppose, the dawn of time, the armaments business has been conducted on a strictly national basis – the King’s troops have been equipped from the King’s arsenals. For some decades now, it has been increasingly apparent that this approach, as is usual when industries are protected, leads to an inefficient supply side, bad value for the customer, and a situation which, given increasing pressures on defence budgets, is ultimately unsustainable. Of course, in deference to national security the European treaties exempt the business of defence from the normal rules of the internal market, under the famous Article 296. So our approach has been to seek an accord amongst our Member States that, not withstanding this exemption, they will agree on a voluntary and reciprocal basis to offer defence contracting opportunities to suppliers in each others’ countries. This is the essence of the Code of Conduct on Defence Procurement which 22 of the 24 Member States participating in the Agency agreed a little under a year ago – and which has its practical embodiment in the new Electronic Bulletin Board, a part of the Agency’s website, on which contract opportunities are now advertised which previously have been protected under Article 296. The Bulletin Board has been going for about three months, and now comprises 50 such opportunities with an aggregate value that we estimate at over €3 bn. We all recognise that offering contracting opportunities across borders is one thing, and actually awarding contracts to a non-national supplier is another. We nonetheless feel heartened by the early progress made. It may not be too optimistic to believe that a crucial psychological watershed has been crossed. For decades past, the automatic assumption about procurement of defence equipment was that it should be done on a national basis. That assumption is now replaced by one of Europe-wide competition. And the benefit will be felt not only by the customer – the taxpayer, and the armed forces – but by Europe’s defence technological and industrial base as a whole. Because, as much as anything, this market initiative is about adding the impulse of market forces to the restructuring that Europe’s defence and technological industrial base must undergo if it is to remain globally competitive. There is, quite simply, no longer enough money in defence budgets in Europe for us to continue to attempt the business of defence in 24 separate national boxes. The future success of the sector depends critically on consolidation, on both the demand and the supply sides. Consolidation will mean an increased readiness for Europeans to abandon the notion that each can do everything, and therefore to accept increased interdependence – and this underlines the particular importance of the further agreement reached by our Steering Board in September, on Security of Supply. For the first time, 22 European Member States have explicitly promised to come to each other’s assistance in matters of defence materiel supply in times of operational urgency. The same Steering Board meeting also agreed that Europeans need to work to become less dependent for key technologies on non-European sources. These two developments suggest to me a real growing sense of mutual solidarity in the European defence business. The second evidence of progress to which I would like to refer is the endorsement earlier this month, at the first Agency Steering Board meeting to be held inside the Arctic circle, in Lapland, of our “Long-Term Vision”. This has been a year-long exercise to develop a picture of what ESDP will need in 20 years time. The outcome is a 25 page document, accessible on our website. With the help, I should emphasise, of authorities and experts from across Europe, we have attempted to pick out some of the key trends which will determine the security environment we face in the middle of the third decade; to deduce some implications for the nature of ESDP operations; and from that to take lessons about the sort of capabilities we must already, now, start to develop, if they are to be ready at the time that we need them. Additionally, this Long-Term Vision document highlights some of the key challenges that defence planners will have to face, getting from here to there. The document aspires to provide a compass-bearing, or line of march or sense of direction, for all those who, day by day, take decisions which will in practice determine what military capabilities we have, and what we do not have, twenty years hence. And, for the Agency, it provides an essential foundation for the next phase of work we must initiate with our participating Member States – that is, to work together on an ESDP Capability Development Plan. As you will know, the horizon of our collective planning of capabilities is currently bounded by the Headline Goal for 2010. Also as you will appreciate, 2010 is, in relation to the lead times for developing new defence capabilities, effectively tomorrow. So the idea of an ESDP Capability Development Plan is that we should work together to define the capability priorities we must develop over the next two decades. The process will inevitably require a degree of mutual transparency amongst European Ministries of Defence – disclosure, in at least broad terms, of what national forward defence plans look like. This will have the additional advantage, we hope, of highlighting opportunities for cooperation – whether joint procurement of new systems, or the pooling or sharing of some desired new capability which may be unaffordable on an individual national basis. Finally, beyond the defence equipment market and the Long-Term Vision initiatives, I should briefly mention defence research and technology. This was rightly thrust into prominence at the summit meeting at Hampton Court during the UK Presidency, a year ago. In consequence, research and technology has been a particular focus in the Agency’s second year of activity. It has been sobering to collect the data, and realise that the combined spend on defence R&T of all the Ministries of Defence in Europe is less than the annual budget of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA. Propelled by the EDA’s first major conference in February, defence research and technology rose sharply up the political agenda – so that Defence Ministers in our Steering Board embraced the conclusion that we must “spend more, spend better and spend more together” on R&T. What does this mean in practice? We have worked with the Member States on the design of a new form of joint investment programme, with the pilot scheme focussed on the force protection area – all those technologies with potential to reduce the risks to our young men and women when we send them into harm’s way. We still have two or three more weeks’ work to do on this before we can be sure that all the details – and all the contributors! - are nailed down. But I am increasingly confident that, by the time of our next Steering Board meeting in November, we will be in the position to announce the launch of a programme with a substantial common budget, to which most of our Member States will have chosen to subscribe. If this works, we envisage it as being only the first in a series of joint investment programmes which will provide the primary vehicle for defence ministries in Europe to pool their efforts and resources in defence R&T. And, I cannot stand here in Helsinki without paying tribute to how strongly supportive Finland has been of this initiative, as indeed of other Agency agendas, both during its current Presidency but also before. So, what with the equipment market, the Long-Term Vision and shortly I hope our first major R&T initiative leaving the launch pad, I feel increasingly satisfied that the Agency is beginning to demonstrate that it can indeed make a difference. Looking ahead, I am excited at the prospect of addressing the Capability agenda more systematically than we have so far been able to, on the basis of the Capability Development Plan to which I have referred. I think we shall also need to address the issue of the defence technological and industrial base more directly in the coming year – reflecting with our Member States on just what sort of base we collectively want to achieve in coming years, and how we can get from here to there. So there is plenty to tackle in the year ahead; and the impact we can have is really only limited by the amount of energy and attention that defence ministries are prepared to give to the sort of cooperative opportunities which EDA offers. Sometimes, engagement with the Agency’s work can seem unfamiliar, and therefore uncomfortable, to national staffs. Sometimes – and I do actually sympathise with this! – it can seem like just one more burden in an already overburdened working life. But I do believe we are already demonstrating that investment of a little more effort and attention in the affairs of the Agency is likely to produce a substantial dividend. And, of course, I very much hope that you, in your key roles, will be prepared to give your national ministries appropriate encouragement in this regard!	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2006/10/19/EDA_Chief_Executive_Witney_Addresses_Chairmen_of_Parliamentary_Defence_Committee
EDA_NEWS_1086	2006-05-22	NEWS	22 EU Member States to Take Part in New European Defence Equipment Market	 The new European defence equipment market will be launched on 1 July, with the participation of all but three of the 25 EU Member States. The market will operate on the basis of the , approved by Ministers on 15 May, which is intended to extend the benefits of greater competition to smaller companies who may not be able to bid for contracts directly but could act as sub-contractors. This set of principles has been developed in close consultation with industry. Only Hungary and Spain exercised their option by the 19 May deadline not to join the Code of Conduct regime initially, although both have indicated the possibility of doing so later. Denmark, which has a general opt-out on European Security and Defence Policy, is not part of the EDA. “We are delighted that the overwhelming majority of Member States have confirmed that they will be subscribing to the Code of Conduct regime from the start,” EDA Chief Executive Nick Witney said. “This regime will create new opportunities for companies across Europe, strengthen our defence technological and industrial base and offer better value for money to the armed forces and to taxpayers,” he added. The Code of Conduct commits subscribing Member States to maximising fair and equal opportunities for all suppliers based in other subscribing Member States by publicising procurement opportunities through a new Electronic Bulletin Board, which will be operated by the Agency, and setting transparent and objective criteria for selecting bidders and awarding contracts. The Agency’s reporting and monitoring system will help to ensure mutual transparency and mutual accountability among subscribing Member States, so that they can be confident that the regime is working as intended. Data will be collected for contracts awarded under the Code. For cases where Member States decide not to apply it, explanation would have to be provided. The 22 subscribing Member States are: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, and United Kingdom.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2006/05/21/22_EU_Member_States_to_Take_Part_in_New_European_Defence_Equipment_Market
EDA_NEWS_1087	2006-09-20	NEWS	European Governments Gear up to Address Defence Technological and Industrial Base	 European Union governments today held their first comprehensive review of the future of Europe’s Defence Technological and Industrial Base and agreed to work together to make it effective and globally competitive. The Steering Board of the European Defence Agency, meeting at the level of National Armaments Directors, heard that pressure on European defence budgets and the continuing fragmentation of both demand and supply sides of the European market meant that defence industries faced a challenging future. They agreed in outline the sort of across national borders. Member States subscribing to the regime have now committed themselves to try to meet requests from another Member State for goods and services during an emergency, crisis or armed conflict, including from their own stocks if necessary. They also agreed rules governing the security of classified information relating to defence procurement. These are important steps towards ensuring that governments can buy from defence suppliers across Europe, on the basis of fair competition, with full confidence. The meeting also considered an Agency report on various national initiatives to upgrade the equipment of the individual soldier or “21st century Warrior”, with a particular focus on technology to improve communication, protection and firepower. It found that the programmes had limited commonality and that interoperability – an important factor in multinational operations -- remained a major challenge. The Agency was asked to define to what degree these new systems should be interoperable, identify possible areas for cooperation on sub-systems which the programmes have in common, and to work on military requirements for the next generation of systems beyond 2015. “The 21st Century Warrior programmes illustrate once again that fragmented national efforts can cause operational problems as well as economic inefficiencies,” said EDA Chief Executive Nick Witney. “If we are to sustain the Defence Technological and Industrial Base in Europe which everyone would like to see, we are going to have to build on the excellent first step of the Code of Conduct to ensure that, more and more, we plan, develop and procure defence equipment together,” he added.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2006/09/19/European_Governments_Gear_up_to_Address_Defence_Technological_and_Industrial_Base
EDA_NEWS_1088	2006-10-03	NEWS	EU Defence Ministers Welcome Long-Term Vision for European Capability Needs	 European Union Defence Ministers today welcomed a report from the European Defence Agency, designed to serve as a compass for defence planners as they develop the military capabilities the European Security and Defence Policy will require over the next twenty years in an increasingly challenging environment. The report – the product of 11 months of study involving officials and experts from governments, defence bodies, academia and industry across Europe – was debated by the EDA Steering Board, the decision-making body on which the Defence Ministers of the Agency’s 24 participating Member States, and the European Commission, sit. “This fascinating document offers planners, working their way through the fog of the future, a shared and stimulating analysis of some of the major trends that will shape that future,” said Javier Solana, the Head of the Agency, who chaired the ministerial meeting. “It provides shared views on the state of the world in which European Security and Defence Policy operations will take place and on what kind of capabilities will be needed to conduct those operations successfully,” he added. “Given the lead times typically involved in developing defence capability, decisions we take, or fail to take, today will affect whether we have the right military capabilities, and the right capacities in Europe’s defence technological and industrial base, in the third decade of this century,” Solana said. The report paints a sobering picture of an older and relatively less prosperous Europe in 20 years’ time which will be living in a less stable world. Defence will need to adapt to accelerating technological challenges and to changing attitudes towards the use of force, placing greater emphasis on the careful and precise use of military power. It says ESDP operations are likely to be expeditionary, multinational and multi-instrument. Information will be critical against opponents whose tactics, aims and values will often be radically different. In such circumstances, the military will be only one of a range of instruments applied to achieve campaign goals. Complementarity of civil and military effort will determine success. While the Steering Board endorsement does not include agreement of all particulars, the Ministers agreed that the Long-Term Vision (LTV) should be the basis for the Agency to present new proposals on an ESDP Capability Development Plan. “The best way to prepare for this future is through greater mutual transparency about medium- to long-term defence planning, so we can identify all those areas where the pooling of efforts and resources promises better value for money from tight defence budgets,” Solana said. The LTV should also be the basis to pursue work on a European Defence R&T Strategy and related priorities, and to set an appropriate agenda for strengthening the European defence technological and industrial base. Ministers also took stock of plans for a Joint Investment Programme (JIP) on Force Protection, an innovative approach to meeting one of the key objectives outlined by EU leaders of spending more, and more together in the critical area of Defence R&T. They urged the Agency to finalise the plan for decision at the next Steering Board meeting on 13 November and expressed their hopes for a programme with wide participation and a substantial budget. The ministers also discussed the Agency’s priorities under a financial framework for the next three years which will be fixed by the Council of Ministers in November. The framework envisages the possibility of a modest increase in the size and budget of the Agency, with significant joint investments by Member States in the future taking place through mechanisms such as the JIP. “It is clear that the future context for European defence is very challenging. It will be more expensive to recruit and equip our armed forces. And they will have to be flexible enough to handle complex and sensitive operations,” EDA Chief Executive Nick Witney said. “But the shared analysis of the future set out in the Long-Term Vision provides a solid foundation on which to build the work of the Agency. And progress on the Joint Investment Programme is encouraging evidence that Member States are ready to work more closely together, as the best hope of preparing successfully for what lies ahead,” he added.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2006/10/02/EU_Defence_Ministers_Welcome_Long-Term_Vision_for_European_Capability_Needs
EDA_NEWS_1089	2006-04-25	NEWS	EDA Hosts Seminar on Network-Enabled Capability	 The European Defence Agency hosted a seminar on 24-25 April at which more than 100 experts from national ministries, armed forces, EU institutions, NATO and industry debated network-enabled capability (NEC) concepts and how they might support ESDP capabilities for crisis management operations. NEC capabilities could improve the effectiveness of such operations by linking all EU bodies, Member States, and international and local actors, to provide them with better situational awareness. “In the information age, NEC is a tool which will enhance the scope, speed and quality of the decision-making process. We must consider, on a national level and especially a multinational level, how to assess what capabilities we will need, taking into account costs and benefits”, said Pierre Hougardy, EDA Capabilities Director. The seminar sent a strong signal that the European Union needs to look seriously into the potential of this new technology and it has helped to prepare the ground for defining the EU’s ambitions and future strategy in the NEC area. “The seminar has been a very good venue to exchange national experiences and perspectives, which is a good basis for future efforts”, said Colonel Tapani Hyötyläinen of Finland. He added that the forthcoming Finnish presidency was willing to contribute to this work. The seminar was organised as a series of panel discussions so that representatives from Member States, who are the key actors for the future of NEC issues within ESDP, were given as much opportunity as possible to express their opinions. “The EU’s multidimensional approach to defence and security, which encompasses a wide range of diplomatic, economic and military instruments, presents a particular challenge to Member States who will have to go beyond familiar military applications of information-age technology,” said EDA Deputy Chief Executive Hilmar Linnenkamp, who chaired the seminar.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2006/04/24/EDA_Hosts_Seminar_on_Network-Enabled_Capability
EDA_NEWS_1090	2006-03-07	NEWS	Ministers Welcome EDA Proposals to Boost Defence R&T Cooperation	 European Union Defence Ministers today welcomed new ideas for boosting EU joint spending on defence Research & Technology and asked the European Defence Agency to prepare detailed proposals for their meeting in May on a joint programme of investment in R&T, and funding arrangements to support it. Meeting as the EDA Steering Board in Innsbruck, Austria, the Ministers also called for a pilot R&T programme using a new approach which could serve as a model for turning military capability objectives into specific technology priorities. “Everybody accepts that Europe has to raise its game on defence as a whole and on pursuing the new technologies which will give us the capabilities we need in the future and strengthen our industries and research institutions,” said Javier Solana, the Head of the Agency, who chaired the meeting. “Today’s discussions have helped to establish a framework for identifying the most important objectives and the right funding mechanisms to ensure that we spend more, spend more together and spend more effectively in this crucial area,” he added. The discussion at the Steering Board, the principal decision-making body of the EDA on which the 24 participating Member States and the European Commission are represented, was the latest stage of work on the agenda to bolster the EU’s defence capabilities and improve its R&T performance, following up the Hampton Court Summit of EU Heads of State and Government summit last year. The Ministers were able to review the results of an EDA Conference on defence R&T in February, at which representatives of governments, industry and research bodies discussed how to achieve a breakthrough in European multinational and national efforts in this area. The Ministers reviewed three possible approaches to increasing spending and collaboration on defence R&T: more ad-hoc projects between groups of EU countries; increasing the EDA’s own budget for R&T spend on behalf of Member States; and establishing a special EDA programme of joint R&T investment, with an associated budget provided by a coalition of contributors. Ministers asked for detailed proposals on the third option for their meeting in May, ahead of the next Summit of EU leaders in June. At its meeting in May, the Steering Board will also review plans to develop an overall European Defence R&T (EDRT) strategy, which will combine this initiative with the results of a wide consultation aimed at identifying key emerging technologies worth backing because of military needs and their economic importance for Europe. “The ideas discussed today are central to the of taking urgent action to support the defence technological base in Europe and improve the EU’s military capabilities. We will be working flat out to prepare for decisions in May,” said EDA Chief Executive Nick Witney.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2006/03/06/Ministers_Welcome_EDA_Proposals_to_Boost_Defence_R_T_Cooperation
EDA_NEWS_1091	2005-12-16	NEWS	EDA picks up EU leaders’ aim to boost European Defence R&T Efforts	 The Steering Board of the European Defence Agency, responding to orientations considered byleaders of the European Union at this week’s Brussels summit, today endorsed plans to make 2006 a year of particular focus on promoting European defence Research & Technology. At their informal meeting at Hampton Court on 1 November, the EU leaders had asked Javier Solana – High Representative for European Security and Defence Policy and Head of the EDA – to report to the summit on how to improve defence capabilities by increasing levels of research spending, finding opportunities for research collaboration and tackling capability gaps. “The Steering Board is fully behind this agenda and intends to take it forward with vigour,” said Dirk Ellinger, Research & Technology Director in the German Defence Ministry, who chaired the meeting on behalf of Solana. The Steering Board, the principal decision-making body of the EDA which was meeting in the formation of R&T Directors of its 24 participating Member States, discussed how to achieve a comprehensive strategy for defence R&T in Europe. Historically, European defence R&T cooperation has worked by looking for common ground between approaches and priorities which are set nationally. The Steering Board agreed that, as a further dimension, such cooperation required a top-down, jointly-developed view of where Member States collectively should be going, and which technologies had to be preserved or developed in Europe. The Steering Board also highlighted a number of technology areas which will be critical for helping the European Union to develop the capabilities it needs for future peace-keeping and crisis management operations under the European Security and Defence Policy. These cover areas such as robotics, information fusion, fuel cells and unmanned land, sea and air vehicles. The Steering Board agreed that these areas should be prioritised for new joint R&T projects. “The United States is out-spending Europe by a ratio of five to one in defence R&D, and less than five per cent of what we do spend in Europe is spent collaboratively,” said EDA Chief Executive Nick Witney. “The engagement of the European Heads of State and Government on this issue represents an unprecedented opportunity,” he added. As part of that process the European Defence Agency is organising a defence R&T conference in Brussels on 9 February 2006.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2005/12/15/EDA_picks_up_EU_leaders_aim_to_boost_European_Defence_R_T_Efforts
EDA_NEWS_1092	2006-03-03	NEWS	EDA Awards Second Contract for UAV Technology Study on 'Sense and Avoid Technologies'	 The European Defence Agency awarded a contract on 16 February to a consortium headed by SAGEM Défense Sécurité to carry out the second Technology Study for the Agency’s work on Long Endurance Unmanned Air Vehicles (LE UAVs), covering “Sense and Avoid Technologies”. LE UAVs, which are likely to play an increasingly important role in surveillance and intelligence, are one of the Agency’s four flagship programmes. A number of different national initiatives on UAVs are under way in EU countries, and the Agency has been tasked to encourage European collaboration in this field. “Sense and Avoid Technologies” were one of the two technology areas selected from an initial listing of more than 10 critical technologies of interest to the participating Member States for technology demonstration studies funded by the Agency. The growing number of the various missions conducted using LE-UAVs requires the safe use of these vehicles and the insertion of the UAVs into civilian airspace. The ‘Sense and Avoid Technologies’ are key issues for the operation and training of the UAVs. The technology demonstration study will map the various national and international regulations concerning the insertion of UAVs into civilian airspace, define the requirements for this task and offer the potential technical solutions. The proposed solutions will be tested by simulation and their impact on Air Traffic Management (ATM) procedures will be assessed. The Consortium, which includes co-contractors TNO Defence, Security and Safety, Office National d'Etudes et de Recherches Aérospatiales (ONERA) and Especialidades Eléctricas SA (ESPELSA), offers extensive technical background and experience in the area of the study, facilities for development, production, integration, testing and maintenance, and qualified personnel and completed project references.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2006/03/02/EDA_Awards_Second_Contract_for_UAV_Technology_Study_on_Sense_and_Avoid_Technologies
EDA_NEWS_1093	2005-12-14	NEWS	EDA Awards First Contract For Unmanned Air Vehicle Technology Study	 The European Defence Agency today signed a contract with a consortium headed by Patria Oyj to carry out the first Technology Study for the Agency’s work on Long Endurance Unmanned Air Vehicles (LE UAVs), covering “Digital Line of Sight & Beyond Line of Sight Data Links”. LE UAVs, which are likely to play an increasingly important role in surveillance and intelligence, are one of the Agency’s four flagship programmes. A number of different national initiatives on UAVs are under way in EU countries, and the Agency has been tasked to encourage European collaboration in this field. “Digital Line of Sight (LOS) and Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) Data Links” were one of the two technology areas selected from an initial listing of more than 10 critical technologies of interest to the participating Member States for technology demonstration studies funded by the Agency. The success of the surveillance and intelligence missions conducted using LE-UAVs is extremely dependent on the availability of robust and reliable communication data links connecting the LE-UAV with the ground infrastructure. Those links are used to control the flight of the LE-UAV during the mission, to configure its on-board equipment and, most important of all, to transmit the collected intelligence data to the ground in near-real time. As the operating scenarios of the LE-UAV include long-distance missions, the communication links must assure this connectivity independent of radio conditions that may vary from one geographical location to another. That means that the data links need to operate in direct Line of Sight configurations as well as in Beyond Line of Sight scenarios, using satellite or relay connections. The Consortium led by Patria Oyj with co-contractor Instrumentointi Oy offers extensive combined technical background and experience in the area of the study, facilities for development, production, integration, testing and maintenance, and qualified personnel and completed project references. The members of the Consortium have worked for more than 20 years with the Finnish Air Force Data Link Programme. They have also worked together within the Finnish Unmanned Vehicle Systems and Joint Network Centric Warfare Architecture technology programmes. A procurement process for another LE UAV Technology Study, “on Sense and Avoid Technologies”, is currently under way.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2005/12/13/EDA_Awards_First_Contract_For_Unmanned_Air_Vehicle_Technology_Study
EDA_NEWS_1094	2005-12-06	NEWS	EDA Welcomes European Commission Move on Defence Procurement Rules	 The European Defence Agency today welcomed the European Commission’s announcement on improving EU rules for the procurement of defence equipment. The Commission today outlined its proposals for future initiatives in the sector, including plans for an Interpretative Communication on the scope of Article 296 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community, which restricts cross-border competition by allowing Member States to claim an exemption on national security grounds from normal EU public procurement rules. The Commission also said it would propose a specific Directive covering defence procurement where Article 296 does not apply. “Today’s announcement by the Commission is a welcome complement to the ,” said EDA Chief Executive Nick Witney. “Both the Agency and the Commission are concerned to see more competition in defence procurement to give better value for money and strengthen the competitiveness of the European defence industry.” EU Defence Ministers, meeting as the Steering Board of the EDA, agreed in November to introduce a voluntary Code of Conduct next year which would for the first time introduce competition into defence procurement contracts for which Member States claim exemption under Article 296. The Code of Conduct is an EDA initiative and will be implemented and monitored by the Agency.  “The Commission is focusing on injecting more competition in areas of defence procurement not covered by Article 296 and on defining the application of the derogation. But where exemptions are invoked, which is the case today for more than 50% of the defence equipment purchases by EU governments, the EDA Code of Conduct will help to ensure that there is transparent and fair competition,” he added. The EDA believes that an Interpretative Communication might help clarify in what circumstances the Commission would consider Article 296 to be legitimately invoked, and thereby assist MS in their judgements in this regard, without prejudice to their prerogatives under the Treaty, in particular in relation to the protection of the essential interests of their security. A Directive, as a legal instrument, requires thorough knowledge about the nature of the market, including the segment where article 296 applies. The historic lack of transparency in this sector means that this knowledge is currently limited, so a Directive should be seen as a longer term solution to establish a level playing field for fair competition in areas where Article 296 does not apply.  The EDA has been working closely with the Commission and stands ready to continue working in partnership on common efforts to support the creation of an internationally competitive EDEM, including the strengthening of the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2005/12/05/EDA_Welcomes_European_Commission_Move_on_Defence_Procurement_Rules
EDA_NEWS_1095	2006-02-09	NEWS	Research & Technology Conference - Keynote Speeches	 RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY – AN IMPERATIVE FOR EUROPEAN DEFENCE Brussels, 09 February 2006 Javier Solana High Representative for the CFSP Head of the European Defence Agency Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear friends, It is a real pleasure to open this conference. It gives me a chance to share with you some reflections on the importance of European defence research and technology. I would like to begin by putting defence research and technology, and the work of the European Defence Agency, in a broader context. It is worth stressing that our work in these areas serves a larger purpose, which is to enhance Europe's ability to deal with a complex and uncertain security environment. Or to promote “a secure Europe in a better world”, as the European Security Strategy put it. There is a clear need and an opportunity to work for that goal. It is what our citizens demand. And it is what the rest of the world increasingly expects. So I am pleased that every day our ability to contribute to global security is increasing: from the Balkans, to the Middle East, from Indonesia to Africa and elsewhere. But, every day, I also feel the frustration of knowing how much more we could do. If only we had a bit more political will and greater means at our disposal. The biggest change - and improvement - in recent years has been that we have become much more operational. We have more than ten operations underway as I speak. Some civilian, some military. All are proof of our comprehensive approach to tackling insecurity. But the more we do, the more we are asked to do. And for that we need the right tools to do the job. This is where the European Defence Agency comes in. The creation of the Agency has been an enormous step forward. Its main task is to support the member states in developing the capabilities they need for modern crisis management operations. Clearly, research and technology must be at the heart of its work programme. We all know that acquiring the right defence capability means many things. We need the right forces, the right doctrine, and the right equipment. But we also need to develop our technological base. That is why today's conference is so important. There are two impulses behind this conference. In the first place, it launches what should become an annual series of such meetings between the Agency and the European defence R&T community. But there is also a particular reason for today’s event. As you know, at the Hampton Court Summit, European leaders asked me to come forward with ideas and proposals on how we can boost European defence research and technology. The short answer, it seems to me, is that we should spend more, spend better and spend more together. I will come back to this with more details in a minute. European Defence Ministers will focus on this challenge when they meet as the EDA’s Steering Board in Innsbruck in early March. I am sure that today’s debate will provide many ideas and proposals that will help us to prepare for that meeting. Why are we focusing so much on Research and Technology? The answer is simple: because it is the key to the transformation of our armed forces. As we move into the 21st century, we face a radically changed strategic environment. New threats and challenges, requiring new roles and new missions of our armed forces. Today's and tomorrow's operations are vastly different from what we planned for during the Cold War. Previously the aim was to unleash the maximum possible destructive power on opposing conventional forces. Now our operations must be characterised by restraint, precision, and the need to minimise the resultant damage. We are working under tight rules of engagement and 24-hour global scrutiny. In ambiguous circumstances, where the opponent will often be hard to identify and isolate. In everything we do, we must bring together civil and military instruments, and protect our own people as never before. This is a huge challenge. And of course technology is not all we need to transform our armed forces and the way they operate. But it will play a central role. Technology is also fundamental for the health of our European defence industry. We can debate just how much of that technology we should generate in Europe, for reasons of autonomy, and how far we can rely on the global market. But we clearly need much of it under our own hands. And for that we need a globally competitive European defence industry. Not only as a key part of our economies. But also as a fundamental contributor to the political consensus that supports the role of defence. But we will not sustain strong technological capabilities unless we invest in them. And there is now real concern that we are beginning to eat the seed-corn. It was natural that after the end of the Cold War, people expected a “peace dividend”. But cutting back on Research and Technology has too often been seen as an easy option. Comparisons with the US are not always relevant. Still, we should all be concerned that the US now outspends Europe in defence Research and Development by a ratio of five to one. The budget of a single US agency, DARPA, stands at over $3 billion. This is more than the combined total of European expenditure on defence Research and Technology. Europeans do not lack the skills or the talent for innovation. A European invented the World Wide Web; Airbus stands as an exemplar of what we can do in aerospace when we work together. And Europe is strongly placed in many areas of civil technology. Increasingly these must be “spun-in” to defence. Mobile communications is an obvious example. But “spin-in” is no panacea. Especially not when Europe’s wider research, development and innovation efforts are also stumbling. There is widespread recognition that current levels of European investment in research and development are insufficient. In the defence sphere, we can only meet the challenges we face if governments discuss and address them together with industry. For governments it may be a matter of strategy to remaining internationally competitive. For industry, it is a matter of survival. Ultimately, of course, the defence industry is there to meet the future needs of our armed forces, and not vice-versa. But in a world of ever-accelerating technological change, our military establishments cannot decide what they may want unless industry tells them what they could provide. So it is good to see so many companies represented here today – and to have Tom Enders, the current President of ASD, up here on the platform. So how can we bring about a step-change in our defence R&T efforts? I am convinced we must do three things: First, spend more. I know this is difficult in a world of tight national finances. But it is an imperative nonetheless. Where defence budgets as such cannot be increased, we must work on redeploying funds within those budgets. Manpower costs currently account for more than 50% of European defence spending. But do we really need more than two million men and women in uniform in Europe? Much of our defence infrastructure is duplicative - between countries and between governments and industry. So let us find savings from rationalisation, to increase the proportion of money spent on investment. Second, we must spend better, so that we get more output per euro spent. Above all, this requires a focus on key technologies of the future. Concretely, this means finding more flexible ways of doing business, particularly at the intergovernmental level. It also means looking at how we can embed new technologies quickly in existing platforms. And it involves matching the ever-shortening cycle times of the civilian world. We should also look at ways how we can harness the ingenuity of companies and universities that are not traditionally seen as part of the defence industry. The same goes for small and medium-sized firms which are often the source of innovation. Third, and perhaps most important, we must spend more together. This is a fundamental issue and the main raison d’être of the Agency. Last year, there was an excellent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. It reminded us that integrating Europe’s defence efforts should no longer be seen as an interesting idea. It is an absolute necessity. Industry has urged that the proportion of R&T expenditure in Europe which is spent collaboratively should increase from the current level of less than 5% to 20%. I am convinced that they are right – and we must now, urgently, decide how best to achieve this aim. Some argue that it can be done by increasing the pace and scale of ad-hoc collaborations – the traditional approach, but done better. Others argue that this leaves cooperation at the mercy of different national budget cycles, and diverging national priorities. They stress that the necessary step-change will only come about if some funding is pooled, readily available for joint R&T endeavours. Following this logic, there are arguments for a substantial R&T budget for the Agency. This would certainly be one way. But there could be others. A joint European Defence R&T Fund, for example, managed within the Agency but controlled directly by its contributors. Personally, I think the principle of a joint fund matters more than the mechanism. And what matters even more is that we address the issue with urgency, and decide our way ahead. Let me make one final point. It is clear that the traditional boundaries between defence and the wider world of research and technology are disappearing. Technologies that the Commission will be promoting under its new programme for European Security Research may be indistinguishable from those we need for more conventional “defence” purposes. We are already working with the Commission on software-defined radio, the next revolution in communications technology. As the respective agendas of EDA and the Commission’s Security Research Programme take shape, we must work hand-in-hand to maximise synergies. I know Günter Verheugen shares that ambition. Ladies and Gentlemen, let me close. In European defence we have made enormous progress in a short period of time. But to respond to growing demands and expectations we need more usable defence capability. And for that we need a step change in defence R & T. I wish you a productive and successful conference. And I look forward to hearing your views and suggestions on how we can, collectively, continue the success story of European defence and improve the contribution that defence R & T can make. Thank you very much. Günter Verheugen - Vice President, European Commission Mr Chairman, Dear Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen, For the first time the European Commission, the European Defence Agency, industry and representatives from the Member States are meeting to discuss together a joint approach to security research. Some years ago this would not have been possible. I am happy to be invited to give an opening statement today, and I would like to thank the European Defence Agency for having taken this initiative. Why does security rank so high on the European political agenda today? And why, at Hampton Court, did heads of State and Government underline the importance of research and express the need for increased spending and more co-operation in this area? Europe is mostly known for its economic and social policies and identity, but Europe is also increasingly developing a security identity. The roots of this development can be found in the shocking security incidents that have occurred over the last few years notably in New York, Madrid, and London. The citizens of the European Union have a growing awareness of threats to their lives, their wealth, and their common values. Threats are global, so the solutions cannot only come from the Member States. Security solutions are expected on the national, European, and global levels. Our American friends have a very clear-cut political approach to security. For them, the notion of “homeland security” covers a wide range of areas and activities. The boundaries between “Internal” and “external” security are blurred under this single notion. For the European Union, the situation is more complex. It is the historical development of the European Union that established three different pillars of political decision making for different strands of “security”. We also find disperse responsibilities both on the European level as well as the Member States level. Thus the framework of security policies is very delicate. Nevertheless one has to realise that in real life, operations of the civil security sector and the military sector resemble each other – and increasingly so. Thus the current split of research domains appears sometimes artificial, especially when viewed at the technology level. However, the policy missions are different. There are several examples which make clear the dual or multiple use character of security technologies both in the civil and defence domain (like vehicles used for border control or the protection of infrastructures; or interoperability of secure communication systems). We have to join our forces. Both the Commission and EDA are currently working on long-term strategic research agendas for “their” security research domains. They bring together the end-users who define the strategic requirements, and the industrial community, who will be required to meet those requirements. The agendas need to define clear research and investment priorities. In research, we need innovative approaches, we need to avoid harmful research gaps and unnecessary duplication. What we need is co-ordination between the security research agendas. We also need a permanent dialogue between the demand and the supply side to shape this strategy and to make it operational. We need a dynamic balance between “pull” and “push”. For the Commission, advice on this, and other issues, is the task of the European Security Research Advisory Board, which was established in order to guide the structure, content and priorities the future security research programme. I am pleased to say that on the European level interaction between the Commission and the European Defence Agency works in an excellent way by involving EDA staff in Commission working parties as well as vice versa. We will have two long-term security research agendas, but they will be related to each other. This will give more research value for the money. Apart from European level security research, a lot of research work of high relevance for the security domain is performed on the national level – with resulting overlaps and fragmentation. The Commission will make every effort to overcome this fragmentation. We need to co-ordinate not only between the civil and the defence-related security research domains but also between the national and the European level. No appropriate mechanism exists to undertake such co-ordination and this must be jointly developed over the coming months. Why? Because we need more co-ordination and more money for research. Civil Community security research in the future 7th Framework Programme will receive a significant budget allocation. Nevertheless, the Commission will by no means be in a position to cover all research needs with that budget. European security research will have to focus on issues of clear European added value compared to security research carried out in the Member States. The Community is not the “26th Member State”. An example for a security research mission area of clear European added value is the external border of the Union. After abolishing our internal borders, securing one particular part of the external borders of the Union is no longer the concern of one Member State alone, it is the concern and responsibility of all European citizens together. Hence it is the responsibility of the Community to invest into its protection. Promoting the required research into a border security mission area is the logical consequence. Another example may be the Trans European Networks (TEN), a joint European infrastructure which needs to be protected. Here again the Community has a responsibility. A new European security and defence policy is taking shape. It needs instruments. It needs an industrial network. And it needs a strong and competitive technology basis. Technology and research are not targets per se. They are instruments which serve political objectives. Technology itself cannot guarantee security but security without the support of technology is impossible. Europe is at the dawn of establishing its own security identity and security culture. No Member State will have to abandon part of its sovereign rights, but all Member States will have to contribute to building this European security culture together. While working on it, we must respect human rights and ethical values, which are part of our European heritage, identity and common values. We in the Commission are confident that our efforts will encourage others in pursuit of a more secure Europe in a more secure world. Being myself a member of the Steering Board of EDA, I intend to work hand in hand with the Agency on this great endeavour. Tom Enders President of ASD and CEO, EADS   1. Introduction Good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen: It is good to be here with you this morning to discuss what we can do together for Europe, its security and its technological capabilities. Surely today’s conference is a milestone for everybody working for the success of the European Defence Transformation. An effort that has started with the creation of the European Defence Agency. During 2005, the agency has successfully established itself. The approval for the “Voluntary Regime for Defence Procurement” is a first success. A good, though not in and by itself sufficient reform initiative. EDA now is trying to make 2006 the year of the “paradigm shift” in Defence R&T. An initiative I think we all should fully support. It is high time we get something done in this field. Because unfortunately, and if we are straightforward about it, the objectives that were spelled out in the Agency Charta are so far largely dead letters. Let us remind ourselves what the Agency’s shareholders desire to achieve through EDA: Namely the enhancement of the effectiveness of European Defence Research and Technology (R&T), in particular by: Promoting research aimed at fulfilling future defence and security capability requirements, strengthening Europe's industrial and technological potential in this domain; promoting more effectively targeted joint defence R&T coordinating and planning joint research activities; catalysing defence R&T through studies and projects; managing defence R&T contracts; working in liaison with the Commission to maximise synergy between defence and civil or security related research programmes. I emphasize: these are dead letters still today, by-and-large. However, we all know very well: Europe must change the way it invests in future military capabilities. We must achieve significant gains in “investment productivity”. And the timing for this initiative could not be more appropriate, just as the European Union is preparing its civil research programme for the next 7 years. At the same time and not surprisingly, there are strong, entrenched ways of “business as usual”. Entrenched ways of protecting perceived “national interests”. You all know them – so I just briefly spell out a few examples: Almost intuitive 296-type behaviour: if an issue concerns defence it is by definition not a community subject. 17 years after the Berlin wall was dismantled another one has to come down in the European interest. Of course this will not happen, unless and until all Member States recognize the benefits that can be harvested by implementing a well-measured degree of mutual dependence. Little helpful also is the wide disparity of means attributed to defence investments across all Member States. It stands to reason that a disparity of effort does not foster the willingness to find cooperative arrangements. Furthermore, the EU today takes a much too cautious approach in harvesting the benefits of “dual technologies” And last but not least a lack of recognition that setting defence policies (be they R&T, industrial or commercial) has to be done in a holistic manner throughout Europe. Doing a little bit on the European level and the rest 25 times in an isolated national environment is a fig leaf (for change) that is too small to hide our deficiencies. Those are ways of thinking and acting that have to be overcome for the sake of achieving a common purpose. All in all as you can see, we are still confronting a major challenge. Yet we must be well aware: Failure will be fatal for Europe’s political ambitions and our industrial competitiveness. Therefore failure is not an option. 2. Vision Which then are the pillars of the much-needed paradigm shift regarding defence R&T in Europe? I consider three issues to be of overriding importance: Establishing the necessary Policy Foundations Creating the Instruments for Implementation Setting Targets and monitoring their achievement As for the policy tools, despite ESDP, we are still lacking the policy foundations to provide the yardstick by which the efforts undertaken can be measured. What is it that I am aiming for? First, the worthy top-level goals of the European Defence & Security Policy have to be translated into more concrete requirements. Only such concrete requirements can serve as drivers for action in the different fields. The role of technology as a provider of superior security & defence related capabilities, i.e. as a means to fulfil the political requirements, has to be clearly expressed. Then R&T becomes a relevant ingredient of ESDP. Second, we need to generate a “holistic” space for R&T in Europe. This means we need to map our expenditures and capabilities at EU-level and at national level in a transparent and comprehensive fashion. Third, once the analytical part is done, a comprehensive Strategic Research Agenda has to be developed. This agenda should be based on a sound principle of European subsidiarity and spell out in a transparent way who takes responsibility for which part of the recommended R&T activities. Such an Agenda needs to be linked to clearly defined and expressed operational needs. Fourth, a coherent funding plan drawing from all relevant sources has to underpin the Strategic Research Agenda; it has to be embedded in legislation at EU and national level and it has to be enforceable! Fifth, a thorough determination of the required key technologies, through which Europe will ensure its strategic autonomy of action, must be achieved rapidly. Identification of existing means and capacities will then determine short to medium term needs as well as long term capability requirements. Sixth, Defence and Security Research have to be clearly identified and recognized as drivers of the “Lisbon objectives”at the same level as other technological domains. While applications may be specific, technology is by-and-large generic. We should, I think, be as mature as our competitors on the world stage and stop “segregating” “dual-use” research (and we may have to find a better expression) as if it were a different domain. So much for the policies. Now, policies have to be accompanied by the right instruments for implementation. Let me offer you a few observations on four instruments I consider as especially important if we want to realize our vision. We need an EU-level Defence Science & Technology Board We need an EU-wide network of Technology experts We need a technology “incubator” to generate breakthrough approaches And we need an EU-wide network of commonly recognized Centres of Excellence The Defence Science & Technology Board should have the task to set the right objectives for EU defence technology research. It would be a group of high level, competent stakeholders, inspired by both ACARE that has been successfully setting the Strategic Agenda for European Research in civil aeronautics, and by the US Defence Science Board that has been playing such a major role in US technology policy. The network of European Technology Experts exists today; I am referring to EDA’s CapTech Network. We might just need to adjust its effectiveness a little in order to provide the focused support necessary especially for the implementation of some short-term research objectives. As for the Technology Incubator the EU should consider institutionalizing an instrument to foster research in this area. A European derivative of the US DARPA could be such an instrument. Let us not forget DARPA has a USD 2bn budget for such upstream research. As of today, we cannot credibly claim to match such amounts – but we have to get going! Last but not least, Europe has to eventually start to rationalize its technological capabilities, avoid duplication and concentrate its resources on those research capabilities that are essential to sustain key technologies. I therefore suggest that discussion on the core network of Centres of Excellence around those key technologies begin immediately. Why should Members States not compete for locations of Centres of Excellence and obtain approval based on the attractiveness of conditions offered, like existing capabilities, future funding support, etc.? Probably each capability will necessitate its own technology support network throughout a number of Member States. Still, we should apply a clear lead nation principle here. Lastly, visions will stay just that if there are no targets set to turn them into reality. Therefore, as in the civil research domain, spending commitments must be the foundation for the Strategic Defence Research Agenda. Taking into account the level of subsidiarity in defence R&T spending, those targets must cover national and EU-level research spending in a coherent way. A couple of principles that come to (my) mind are the following: a.much effectiveness can be gained by investing in cooperation with other Member States; thus the majority of national spending in defence R&T should eventually be cooperative – way above the target of 20% cooperative spending we are discussing today. In substance, all R&T investments into domains that are commonly recognized as belonging to areas of “European deficits” should be cooperative; if for various reasons one Nation decides to invest in these domains on a national level, they must be opened for cooperative approaches at a later stage. Let me recall for our benefit what was said when EDA was created: Europe needs to spend more on defence and spend better; if it continues to be difficult to spend more, spending better is the only alternative! And spending cooperatively on defence research is the only way to spend better in the absence of common spending. Another strong reason to do more jointly resides in the fact that, as you know, Research & Technology has been kept outside of the Voluntary Regime. The potential therefore exists that the present “national approach” to R&T creates a distortionary effect on the Regime’s operation, since there will not a “level playing field” in defence procurement without more coordination and cooperation in R&T. b.As in other research areas (like aeronautics, space), common funding through a joint instrument is the most efficient way to ensure a future for European defence technological capabilities. The instrument to do this exists today, we know it all and I only have to refer you back to what the Agency Charta says about allowing ad-hoc/opt-in projects. Now EDA must get the means to assume its role in defence R&T. Here and there we hear that EDA should not be given budgets to invest in R&T because it does not have the credibility and capability to make the best use of public money. I fear, I do not understand the logic of this argument: the Member States as shareholders of EDA are in total control: if they do not transfer the adequate management capabilities together with the budgets and the responsibilities, EDA will forever stay an (almost) empty shell (like all its predecessors on the European scene) – now who’s credibility is at stake? And since in my view this does simply not make sense, I propose in a first step to create a common EDA Research budget of say €50 million as soon as national budget procedures allow, but certainly not later as 2007. 3. Solutions How then can we start bridging the gulf that separates present day conditions from the vision laid out before? Modifying policies and agreeing them at the European level inevitably will take time. Time that we basically do not have. In order to advance in the short-term, EDA must get (back) on track with “promoting more effectively targeted joint defence R&T, drawing on the experience of relevant elements of the WEAG and the WEAO” as the Joint Actions predicates. This is urgent and if it has to be done with only a streamlined CapTech process, so be it. We have recently seen interesting proposals being put on the table by the L.o.I. Research Directors; they should quickly be put into action. Moreover, we see the need for a top-level group. Let me call it “Group of Personalities Defence & Security” with a reference to the approach that has been used previously for the European Security Research Programme. This group should be a “policy-level” precursor to the “Defence Science & Technology Board” that I suggested previously and should comprise decision makers from national governments, EU-level institutions and industry. Among its tasks should be the identification of short & medium term drivers for joint investments in defence research and top-level drivers for long-term R&T investments, among which should figure Investigating and establishing the relationship between technologies and threats (external/internal) Potential contributions of alternative and innovative funding instruments applicable to government-funded research A thorough analysis of and relevant proposals for an evolution of the institutional framework and structures under which defence research is conducted. This “GoP Defence & Security” could render its conclusions at the end of 2006 with initial implementation starting soon thereafter. Ladies and Gentlemen: At the beginning, I said: this conference will be a milestone towards a more efficient, more flourishing European defence R&T landscape. Can we achieve a breakthrough? That will very much be up to you. The issues that you will be debating have a direct bearing on realizing our vision. Let me now wish you a very successful conference day. And as always: a fruitful and –why not – controversial debate of those issues will advance the European “State of the Art”.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2006/02/08/Research_Technology_Conference_-_Keynote_Speeches
EDA_NEWS_1096	2005-11-21	NEWS	EU Governments Agree Voluntary Code for Cross-Border Competition in Defence Equipment Market	 European Union Defence Ministers today agreed a voluntary Code of Conduct for defence procurement in order to encourage competition in the European defence equipment market, where contracts are currently exempt from normal EU internal market rules. At a meeting of the Steering Board of the European Defence Agency, Ministers decided that the new regime would cover contracts worth more than one million Euros and would take effect from 1 July, 2006. “This is a landmark decision” said Javier Solana, the Head of the Agency, who chaired the meeting. “It will mean a better deal for European taxpayers, and for their armed forces. And it is a vital step for ensuring that our defence industries remain globally competitive.” “The need for this breakthrough has been recognised for years – decades, even. I am delighted that we have got there in the EDA’s first year of operation,” he added. An EDA study earlier this year established that the majority of defence procurement by EU governments was done outside the framework of internal market rules on public procurement because of the exemption allowed under Article 346 of the TFEU establishing the European Community. Member States who subscribe to the new voluntary, inter-governmental regime will commit to maximising fair and equal opportunities for all suppliers based in other subscribing Member States by publicising procurement opportunities through a single online portal and setting transparent and objective criteria for selecting bidders and awarding contracts. The key principles underlying the code are transparency and mutual accountability: regular EDA data-collecting and reporting will allow all participants to satisfy themselves that the regime is working as intended and that all are moving forward together. Special attention will be given to small and medium sized enterprises. Assessing the first year of the Agency’s operations, Ministers expressed satisfaction to see it up and running so quickly and starting to make a real difference. They noted that important advances have been achieved, such as today’s decision on defence procurement -- one of the EDA’s flagship projects for 2005 -- and an initiative to address Europe’s capability shortfall in air-to-air refuelling. “As I reported to the Council of Ministers, the Agency has become an effective and credible instrument,” Solana said. “The challenge is now to exploit its full potential and meet growing expectations, in particular to generate new collaborative investment projects.” On another flagship – Command, Control and Communications (C3) – an important step forward was taken when Ministers agreed that the Agency should test the viability of a collective European approach to developing a next-generation Software Defined Radio (SDR) as a joint civil/military endeavour. SDR brings together computing and communications technologies and could eventually allow military radio systems that can securely deliver voice, data and video in a variety of different formats. It could enable forces to communicate at all levels and between all levels, the key to interoperability which is a crucial requirement for multi-national ESDP operations. Ministers also approved the EDA budget and the Work Programme for 2006. Work will continue on the 2005 flagship programmes, but much of the Agency’s further work will flow organically from the systematic capability development processes now established by EDA. Some new areas will certainly be addressed, such as strategic lift, space-related capabilities and combat equipment for dismounted soldiers. In 2006 the Agency will also tackle some big strategic issues: developing a Long-Term Vision for European Capability and Capacity Needs; developing thinking on the Defence Technological and Industrial Base in Europe as one entity; and tackling the issue of defence R&T spending. Javier Solana, in his role as Secretary General of the Council of Ministers and High Representative, has been invited by EU Heads of State and Government to report to their December summit his first thoughts on a number of specific issues bearing on the European Security and Defence Policy, including how to raise levels of spending and collaborative spending on defence R&T, and ways of tackling key capability gaps. 	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2005/11/20/EU_Governments_Agree_Voluntary_Code_for_Cross-Border_Competition_in_Defence_Equipment_Market
EDA_NEWS_1097	2005-10-13	NEWS	Ten EU Governments Launch New EDA Initiative to Fill Air-to-Air Refuelling Gap	 European Defence Ministers, meeting informally today at RAF Lyneham (U.K.), were given a demonstration of air-tanking capability and launched a new effort to fill the gap in tanking capability which constrains Europe’s Rapid Reaction aspirations. Following their meeting in the European Defence Agency’s Steering Board, the Ministers of 10 Member States (Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and Belgium and Portugal) issued the following joint announcement: “Initiatives to build European air-to-air refuelling capabilities, whether in NATO or the EU, have not made the necessary progress in recent years, despite the efforts of some individual EU Member States. ESDP’s new Headline Goal 2010, like the Helsinki Headline Goal before it, will fall short unless we can find a new approach to filling this key capability gap. At Javier Solana’s initiative, therefore, we reviewed current air to air refuelling national capability plans. As a result of our discussion, we have decided to instruct our national staffs to work together, in an EDA-supported ad hoc group, to monitor current developments and consider possible new approaches to filling the capability gap.” Background on Air-to-Air Refuelling The EU Headline Goal process has identified confirmed the importance of air-to-air refuelling (AAR) capability for European crisis-management operations. The current requirement is in the range of just over 70 strategic tankers. Six Member States contribute to this capability: the UK, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain. There is a major shortfall based on what is currently available or planned. The current contributions make up less than half the agreed requirement. The role of strategic tankers is growing while European fleets are getting older. Operations in the Balkans and Afghanistan have shown the importance of these assets. They have undertaken over 30% of the total flying sorties, ensuring that attack and support aircraft can get to and from their targets and enabling fighters to stay airborne to protect friendly civilian populations and military forces. All lessons identified from recent operations have highlighted AAR assets as a ‘force multiplier’ - allowing more efficient and effective use of expensive and scarce fighter and attack aircraft within the theatre of operations. There are currently European based initiatives in the UK, Germany and Italy. Germany is taking delivery of 4 converted A-310 aircraft and Italy is acquiring 4 new KC 767 to replace their ageing B707TTs. In both initiatives the aircraft will be configured to be Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) capable. The UK is currently in contractual negotiations to provide a replacement to their VC-10 and Tristar aircraft through a Public Finance Initiative (PFI) solution. The European Capability Action Plan (ECAP) and NATO’s Prague Commitment Conference (PCC) have considered various ways forward. The new initiative co-ordinated by the EDA will enable Member States who are willing to commit resources to adopt a more integrated and comprehensive approach to remedying the shortfall. For example, a way forward incorporating the MRTT principle, providing a significant transport capability (both cargo and personnel), could address another significant ESDP capability shortfall - strategic airlift - for both intensive combat situations and in support of civilian operations such as humanitarian assistance. The EDA co-ordinated Ad Hoc Project Team will examine the UK Private Financing Initiative (PFI) model. This considers the provision of a ‘capability service’ - airborne refuelling stations supplied by a commercial consortium - rather than a classical procurement of aircraft. But it will also review other acquisition options, such as joint procurement, and look at such approaches as pooling of assets. (1) - The Netherlands has also joined the ad hoc group, which therefore now consists of 11 participating Member States.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2005/10/12/Ten_EU_Governments_Launch_New_EDA_Initiative_to_Fill_Air-to-Air_Refuelling_Gap
EDA_NEWS_1098	2005-11-21	NEWS	Q&A on European Defence Equipment Market	   What is the purpose of the Code of Conduct? The purpose of the Code is to inject transparency and competition into defence procurement, an area where, on the basis of the application of Article 296 of the EC Treaty, a majority of defence contracts are currently exempt from cross-border competition. Why does this matter? No EU country can any longer sustain a national Defence Technological and Industrial Base (DTIB) to meet all of its needs. An open market is a vital instrument for the long-term competitiveness and strength of the European DTIB, and a fundamental aspect of support for the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). When will the Code come into effect? Ministers agreed to implement the Code from 1 July 2006. How many EU Member States will be covered by it? The 24 European Defence Agency (EDA) participating Member States (pMS) (all EU members except Denmark) have until 30 April 2006 to decide whether or not to participate. What kind of defence contracts are covered by the Code? All defence procurement contracts, except those specifically excluded from the Code, with a value of at least one million Euros, for which the conditions for application of Article 346 of the TFEU are met. Is anything excluded from the Code? Some areas will be excluded from the Code: procurements of chemical, bacteriological and radiological goods and services, nuclear weapons and nuclear propulsion systems and cryptographic equipment. Some others, exceptionally and for obvious reasons, might not follow the rules of the Code: cases of pressing operational urgency, follow-on work or supplementary goods and services and for extraordinary and compelling reasons of national security. In these exceptional cases, an explanation must be provided to the EDA, in its capacity as monitor of the regime. How exactly will procurement contracts covered by the Code now work? All relevant new defence procurement opportunities will be published on a single online portal operated by the Agency. Fair and equal treatment of all companies will be assured through evaluation of the offers on the basis of transparent and objective standards. The fundamental criterion for the selection of the contractor will be the most economically advantageous solution for a particular requirement, taking into account, among other things, considerations such as compliance, costs (both acquisition and life cycle), and security of supply. What role will the EDA play in implementing the Code? The EDA will act as an instrument of the subscribing Member States to monitor the implementation of the Code and to report back to the Agency Steering Board on its achievements and make proposals for improvements. If the Code is not legally-binding, why will it have any effect? The Code of Conduct will operate on the basis of sovereign Member States voluntarily choosing to align their policies and practices, on a reciprocal basis. Regular reports by the EDA will help to show whether the Code is being interpreted and implemented on a uniform basis and, if not, why not. That will allow for “peer pressure” to be exercised. How is this related to the work of the European Commission on the defence equipment market? The EDA welcomed in March of this year the efforts of the Commission through their Green Paper on Defence Procurement, as it identifies a number of important reasons for the creation of a European Defence Equipment Market (EDEM) and it illustrates the limits of the existing legal framework. The Commission is now in the process of analysing the responses to its questionnaire with regard to the two proposed community instruments -- an interpretative Communication and a Directive – which the Agency considers as complementary actions to the Code. Does this mean that non-EU firms will not be able to compete for EU defence contracts? There is nothing in this plan about “European preference”, or denying access to any third party defence companies. The aim is to get each Member State to accept bids to satisfy its defence equipment requirements from other EU countries, and then to evaluate them on a par with bids from its own national suppliers. Whether the Member State concerned also wishes to invite any third-party to a competition will remain entirely a matter for the individual Member State to decide. How can governments be sure that supplies are secure if contracts are won by companies in other EU Member States? The Code includes within its key principles the idea of mutual support: in return for the privilege of improved opportunities to sell into each others’ defence markets, there is a reciprocal obligation to do everything possible, consistent with national legislation and international obligations, to ensure, assist and expedite each others’ contracted defence requirements. The full effective operation of the regime will depend on strong mutual confidence and interdependence and each government will work to improve the predictability and dependability of its regulations and policies. They will also support efforts to simplify amongst them intra-community transfers and transits of defence goods and services. The Agency has been tasked to work further on Security of Supply and to present for adoption roadmaps for this work to the next meeting of the EDA Steering Board in National Armaments Directors formation. How will small companies and the defence industries of smaller Member States benefit from the Code? The Code recognises, as part of the key principle of mutual benefit, that an important part of this benefit is the expansion of opportunities for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) from across Europe to sell into a continental-scale market. The Code will seek to ensure that fair competition and the benefits of the regime are driven down the supply chain. The Steering Board has also directed the Agency to develop a Code of Best Practice in the Supply Chain to ensure fair opportunities, especially for SMEs, for adoption at the same time as implementation of the regime and as an integral part of it. The Code of Best Practice will be about influencing behaviour through improving the quality, effectiveness and efficiency of supply chain relationships. It will enhance opportunities for specialist companies, in particular SMEs. It will also provide for appropriate benchmarking and observance and will be regarded as complementary to any similar codes that may apply at national level. Will additional initiatives be developed to support the regime? The Steering Board has directed the Agency to work further with participating Member States and other stakeholders to keep the operation of the regime under continuous review, to consider adaptation and possible expansion of the regime and to pursue progressively closer alignment of participating Member States policies and practices over time. In particular, the Agency has been tasked to work on security of supply, harmonisation of offset requirements at a European level and on common minimum standards for the security of information, and to present roadmaps for this work for adoption at the next meeting of the Steering Board in National Armaments Directors formation.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2005/11/20/Q_A_on_European_Defence_Equipment_Market
EDA_NEWS_1099	2005-11-29	NEWS	EDA's Witney Says Main EU Defence Actors Share Commitment to Transformation Agenda	" The main actors in European Union defence have a shared commitment to enhancing global security and the safety of EU citizens by working together to transform Europe's military forces to meet the new threats of the future, EDA Chief Executive Nick Witney said today. In a speech to the ""Défense 2006"" Economist Conference in Paris, Witney said the different roles of industry, national governments, the European Commission and the EDA mattered much less than the fact that they had a common agenda. ""Not only that, but there is a high degree of mutual interdependence – we are trying to climb the same mountain and we are all roped together,"" Witney said. ROLE OF THE DIFFERENT ACTORS: INDUSTRY, NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS, EUROPEAN COMMISSION, EUROPEAN DEFENCE AGENCY Economist Conference – “ Défense 2006” Paris, 29 November 2005 - Nick Witney, EDA Chief Executive - Not for the first time, when I began last week to prepare for this event, I was taken aback to see the subject which I had earlier, in a moment of inattention, committed myself to address. I can speak with authority on the role of the European Defence Agency; and, having worked in part of one for a number of years, I can say at least something about the role of national governments. As for the Commission, as a relative newcomer to Brussels, I am still learning to understand this large, powerful, and many-faceted institution. And when it comes to industry – well, who am I to attempt to lecture the people in this room about their role in European defence? But a commitment is a commitment, and you evidently wanted someone to address this topic of the roles of the different actors, so let me at least try. I will begin with something extremely simplistic, since I think it is interesting to look at the simple picture and work out what is wrong with it. The simple account would begin by straight-forwardly ruling out the Commission from further consideration. Defence is, in the jargon, not a Commission competence. Indeed, defence is an area where the Member States have consistently declined to pool any part of their national sovereignty, or to cede any power of proposal or decision to the Brussels institutions, whether Commission or European Parliament. The only institution that “does defence” in Brussels is the Council, where Member States meet and decide what they may be prepared to cooperate on, and what they are not. So it is national governments who are in the driving seat on defence – and they have decided to create the European Defence Agency, as an agency of the Council, to be their instrument or tool for taking forward what they begin to sense must be, increasingly, their shared agendas. So the simple account is that the interests of the Agency are identical with those of the Member States, and that the Agency’s role is to do what the Member States want it to do. Governments want security and prosperity for their citizens. As one aspect of security, they want capable and well-equipped armed forces, at the minimum possible cost. They can always think of better things to do with their revenues than to increase defence budgets. As for prosperity, they want jobs, and the technology that breeds the jobs of the future. Some have large defence industries, important to the national economy, and adopt various routes to foster or, one might even say, protect them – routes that may not necessarily run through defence ministries. Finally, industry. I suppose – you will tell me if I am wrong – that what the industry side wants is to run successful, profitable businesses, with full order books today and the prospect of being able to achieve full order books tomorrow. For many, this means staying, or becoming, internationally competitive. So that is the simple picture – and you only have to enunciate it to realise that the world is not actually quite like that. Let us start again with the Commission. Like national governments, they too are interested in the security and prosperity of people – all the people of Europe. They are fully aware of the importance of the defence sector to the wider economy of Europe, and to the ambitious but necessary aim of ensuring Europe’s future as a knowledge-based economy. They also have money to spend, lots of it – and plan in the years ahead to spend substantially increased amounts on space and security research. I have heard security research distinguished from defence research in a variety of different ways. But I think the fundamental difference is really who controls the money – in the case of defence research, national defence ministries, in the case of security research other national authorities and now, too, the Commission. Turning to where the Agency fits in, it is certainly true that the Agency’s job is to do what Defence Ministers want. But the 24 of them working together in the Agency do not always want quite the same thing. Nor do they necessarily want it consistently. On Monday they may be very clear. On Tuesday they may be confronted with a conflicting priority, which can dilute the desire. And then, of course, defence ministries, like the rest of national governments, are human enterprises. So the Minister may want it, the State Secretary may feel lukewarm about, and somewhere down the hierarchy there may be the one colonel who truly understands the subject and happens not to want it all. So you could describe the Agency’s job as to find things that the Defence Ministers, all or some, will embrace on their ambitious days, and then to pursue such agendas on their behalf with insistency, indeed impatience. This is what I mean when I refer to the Agency’s role as a conscience and catalyst. None of this, of course, alters the ineluctable fact that decision-making power, and the money, rests with the 24 defence ministries. Nor, I suppose – pursuing my theme of why the simple account does not quite work - is the industry a typical supplier. It is sometimes owned, or part owned, by the national governments, who are also its main customer. Governments then control to whom the industry is allowed to sell what it does not sell to them. And the same government may often have to provide the initial investment funding if the relevant project is to be economically viable. A further complication is to know what the industry is. Clearly, it is the big prime contractors. But, these days, it may also be a computing or telecommunications specialist. It may be the small Slovenian plastics company which happens to be the European market leader in masts for sailboards, and is using its skills for some interesting work on ballistic protection. So, what do I conclude from this rather inadequate survey? First, that roles matter less than agendas; and that there is actually a very large degree of congruence between the agendas of all the different actors. Not only that, but there is a high degree of mutual interdependence – we are trying to climb the same mountain and we are all roped together. Let me try and be a bit more specific about where I see the commonality of agendas: First, we all want to see a Europe that is an effective and credible actor on the international stage, contributing to global security and ensuring the safety of its citizens; But, second, we all recognise the continuing gap between that ambition and our actual collective military capabilities – a gap which some may argue results from under-funding, but which I tend to believe has much more to do with the ineffective use we make of the €180 billion that the European Member States collectively spend each year on defence. Third, we all recognise that the solution lies through pursuing what is called the transformation agenda – accepting that the world and the nature of the operations in which our armed forces will in future be engaged have fundamentally changed, and spending our money on addressing the threats of the future rather than sustaining the legacies of the past. Fourth, we all recognise that transformation is necessary, but not sufficient – that Europeans need also increasingly to pool their efforts and resources. This is an operational imperative; the future is multinational, deployed operations, and the more commonality we can achieve in the equipment and systems we use the more effective and safer our service men and women will be. It is also an economic imperative – we simply can no longer afford the duplication entailed in each national military staff deciding upon a different way to meet fundamentally the same requirement, and running separate national programmes. And the supplier is feeling the pinch as much as the customer; no national defence budget in Europe is any longer big enough to sustain a comprehensive set of defence industrial capabilities on a national basis. So – fifth - we must achieve convergence on the demand side of the defence business – more collaborative spending, offering contracting opportunities to industry on a scale which makes economic sense, and which may often be needed to support or precipitate the process of industrial restructuring. Because, although much consolidation has already taken place in the European defence industry over the last decade, there is more to do – something which in its turn requires governments to recognise that it is no longer good enough to think just in terms of the national defence technological and industrial base, and that we must all start to think about the European industrial base as an entity in its own right. We need to work our way forwards on the principles of eliminating duplication, recognising and building upon specialist strengths and centres of excellence, and accepting the greater degree of mutual interdependence which this will entail. Then – sixth - if we must think increasingly of the demand side and the supply side in continental terms, then so too must we think of the market. So I am particularly pleased that we were able, one week ago, to achieve the agreement of our 24 Defence Ministers to take a long stride down the road of liberalising defence trade in Europe. From time immemorial, the bulk of national defence procurement has been sheltered from external competition. Certainly, since the foundation of the European Union, the usual rules of the internal market have been dis-applied to most defence procurement. Now, the 24 Member States cooperating in the Agency have agreed to invite bids from industries based in each others’ territories as well as from national suppliers, and to treat all bids on a fair and equal basis. This is a voluntary regime, based on a code of conduct. It still allows exceptions, in certain defined categories – and it will no doubt take time before the in-built mutual accountability and transparency, delivered by a reporting and monitoring system, ensure that the Code operates in a fully effective and consistent fashion. But the key point is this – that, for as long as anyone can remember, the default assumption has been that governments would source their defence needs from their own territories if at all possible – and now, for the first time ever, there will be a presumption that the great bulk of defence procurement will be open to bids on a Europe-wide basis. I see this as a landmark decision, which over time should deliver not only the familiar benefits of competition – value for money, and stimulus to innovate – but will also inject an invaluable dynamic which can only assist the process of industrial restructuring to which I referred earlier. Nor will it do any harm at all that the Commission, with European Parliament support, will continue to patrol the borderline between the normal internal market and defence procurement under our Code, seeking to ensure that the application of internal market rules is as wide as it reasonably can be. My final, and seventh, point, where I think all can agree – and that is the need to find ways to devote more of our scarce defence resources to investment, and investment in R&T in particular. Today, more than half of the €180 billion to which I alluded earlier goes on personnel costs – the costs of keeping two million men and women in uniform. This situation is unsustainable, for various reasons – including the demographic trends, which indicate that in future the recruits will simply not be there. Today, it squeezes the resources available for our investments, in particular on research and technology. Yet R&T is the seed corn of the future. How can European industries remain internationally competitive when we are outspent by the US on R&D by a ratio of five to one? Some three weeks ago, at the informal summit held at Hampton Court in London, the European Heads of State and Government recognised the challenge – the challenge to invest more, and invest more collectively. And they tasked my boss, Javier Solana, to report back to them when they meet again in Brussels in mid-December with some “initial orientations” on how this problem might be tackled during the Austrian Presidency. That means by the early summer of next year. So, I will close by noting that, if the issue of opening the defence market within Europe has been the particular preoccupation of the EDA during the early months of its life, we can now look forward to addressing the R&T agenda with equal intensity in the early months of the coming year. And I would very much encourage anybody here who has ideas to contribute to the debate to offer them today, or to send me an e-mail. Catching the attention of the Heads of State and Government is not an opportunity that comes around very often – so we must make sure that we make maximum use of it."	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2005/11/28/EDA_s_Witney_Says_Main_EU_Defence_Actors_Share_Commitment_to_Transformation_Agenda
EDA_NEWS_1100	2005-10-13	NEWS	EDA Steering Board Reviews Agency's Plans for 2006	 European Union Defence Ministers agreed today that spending on defence-related Research & Technology needs to increase and to be more effective through greater collaboration between EU countries. At a meeting of the Steering Board of the European Defence Agency at RAF Lyneham in the United Kingdom, the Ministers reviewed the Agency’s plans for 2006. Ministers agreed that the Agency should move into launching ad-hoc projects as soon as possible. Ministers witnessed a demonstration of U.K. air-to-air refuelling capabilities and 10 countries issued a statement announcing that they had agreed to create an ad hoc group, supported by the EDA, to consider possible new approaches to solving the EU’s shortfall. “I very much welcome this step. It is a good example of the way forward” said Javier Solana, Head of European Defence Agency. “We need more projects like this to address the military shortfalls which are still there in many areas, six years after the start of the European Security and Defence Policy. We need commitments to allocate resources. We need multinational initiatives in smaller or larger groups,” he added. The ministers also reviewed the principles for a voluntary to bring more cross-border competition in the European Defence Equipment Market and confirmed their commitment to take a final decision on the initiative at their Steering Board meeting next month. The Steering Board considered moves to rationalise testing and evaluation of defence equipment, where there may be scope for significant savings by creating centres of excellence in specific technologies in different EU states, and said such work should be pursued energetically. The ministers also looked at suggested indicators and strategic targets for measuring progress on the EU’s agenda to transform its military capabilities to meet the requirements of ESDP and asked the Agency to prepare formal proposals for a decision at the next meeting. “In the end, this transformation can only be done by national governments,” said Solana. “The EDA will do everything it can to help, but the Agency does not deliver capabilities itself. Its participating Member States will have to. But they can now use the EDA instrument to support their efforts to improve Europe’s defence performance.”	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2005/10/12/EDA_Steering_Board_Reviews_Agency_s_Plans_for_2006

EDA_NEWS_1102	2005-06-21	NEWS	Steering Board Sets Direction for Agency’s Efforts to Build European Defence Capabilities	" The most senior planners from the defence ministries of the European Union, meeting as the Steering Board of the European Defence Agency, held their first review today of the Agency’s proposals to help build the defence capabilities that will be needed under the EU’s plans to respond quickly and effectively to future crises. The Steering Board, the decision-making body of the Agency on which the 24 participating Member States and the European Commission are represented, was meeting for the first time in “Capabilities” formation, involving national Capabilities and Defence Planning Directors. “This community is crucial to the work of the Agency because of our role in determining the speed and direction of transformation and defence reform in each nation, and the priorities for defence expenditure,” said Lo Casteleijn, Director of the General Policy Directorate of the Defence Ministry of the Netherlands, who chaired the meeting on behalf of the Head of the Agency, Javier Solana, know what we have today and are already planning to acquire, and then work together to address the gaps,” he added. The Steering Board reviewed the Agency's proposals for a way of working which will ensure that the future needs of ESDP operations provide the main orientation for all EDA activity. This innovative ""matrix"" approach will marry military priorities to industrial and technological possibilities to ensure that Europe's future military needs are addressed in a comprehensive, systematic and realistic fashion. It also ties together the Agency's different agendas, covering military capabilities, armaments programmes, research and technology and the strengthening of Europe’s defence industries. Central to this approach will be the use of integrated development and project teams, bringing together military, armaments and research expertise from within the Agency and from a wider community of stakeholders, including industry. More specifically, the Steering Board discussed initial priorities for the Agency's R&T agenda, laying particular stress on the importance for future operations of minimising casualties. “We must focus our research efforts on the technologies that our crisis-management operations will require in the future,” said Nick Witney, Chief Executive of the Agency. “We need to look at whatever technology can offer to improve force protection and to limit the damage, human or material, of military operations which will often be conducted among civilian population.” The Board also approved a wide-ranging agenda for the Agency in the critical area of Command, Control and Communication (C3), one of the Agency’s four flagship programmes for its first full year of operations. This agenda includes: work on improving the capacity, security and interoperability of communications for ESDP operations, starting with the battle groups which are at the heart of the EU’s future plans; work to converge European thinking on how best to apply the concepts of network-enabled operations to the context of crisis-management operations; the pursuit of European convergence and cooperation on the emerging technologies of software defined radio."	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2005/06/20/Steering_Board_Sets_Direction_for_Agency_s_Efforts_to_Build_European_Defence_Capabilities
EDA_NEWS_1103	2005-04-22	NEWS	European Defence Agency Steering Board Agrees Transfer of WEAG/WEAO Activities to EDA	 The Steering Board of the European Defence Agency agreed today on the aim that the Agency should gradually take over the activities, in particular those covering Research & Technology, of the Western European Armaments Group (WEAG) and the Western European Armaments Organisation (WEAO). The Steering Board, the principal decision-making body of the EDA on which the 24 participating member states are represented, was meeting for the first time in the formation of Research & Technology Directors. The meeting, the fourth Steering Board session since the Agency was created, was chaired by Mr Dirk Ellinger, R&T Director in the German Defence Ministry, on behalf of .” WEAG, established in 1993 as the successor to the Independent European Programme Group, and WEAO, created in 1996 as an executive body to manage joint research projects, have until now been the main focus for defence research and technology co-operation in Europe. Member States have already agreed to close WEAG from next month and the Steering Board agreed on the need for early complementary legal decisions within WEAO by the Member States concerned to allow the transfer of its functions to the EDA. The Steering Board decided that the EDA should aim to take over the relevant activities of WEAG and WEAO progressively during 2005 and the first quarter of 2006, when additional resources should be available to EDA to handle transferred contracts. “Absorbing the work of WEAG and WEAO into the EDA will give R&T collaboration a much stronger political impulse,” said EDA Chief Executive Nick Witney. The Steering Board also approved a set of principles governing the Agency’s Research & Technology functions, including plans to establish networks of experts from governments, research centres, industry and international bodies to collaborate in specific areas. The “operational concept” for R&T defines the operating principles and internal organisation which will allow the Agency to absorb existing valuable activities such as those from WEAG and WEAO, manage future collaborative projects, put R&T contracts to industry, monitor progress and allow the Steering Board to define and oversee a European defence R&T strategy. “The R&T Directors emphasized their commitment to supporting the work of the Agency in this field and intend to remain closely involved in it,” Ellinger said. The Steering Board also reviewed the Agency’s work to date on the technology required for Long Endurance Unmanned Air Vehicles for intelligence and surveillance, one of the Agency’s four flagship projects for 2005. The aim is to encourage collaboration within the European industry to demonstrate the technologies required for such UAVs. “There are three major and at least five smaller national programmes under way in this area within the EU,” said Witney. “By studying some of the critical technology elements for UAVs together at a European level, we can ensure that research money is spent in the most effective way – one of the central aims of the Agency.” The Steering Board also heard a presentation from the European Commission on the European security research programme, part of the 7th Framework Research Programme. The EDA will be represented on the European Security Research Advisory Board to identify synergies between the defence R&T work of the Agency and the civilian-oriented security research programme.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2005/04/21/European_Defence_Agency_Steering_Board_Agrees_Transfer_of_WEAG_WEAO_Activities_to_EDA

EDA_NEWS_1105	2005-09-23	NEWS	EDA Steering Board takes further step towards injecting competition into defence procurement	 European Union governments took a further step towards injecting more competition into the European Defence Equipment Market today, agreeing that a voluntary, non-binding would be fastest way to make progress. The Steering Board of the European Defence Agency, meeting at the level of National Armaments Directors of the 24 participating Member States, examined a set of principles drawn up by the Agency and instructed it to turn the ideas into a draft Code of Conduct for possible approval by defence ministers in November. “The Agency’s work to date suggests that the introduction of the proposed intergovernmenta lregime would be a major step forward, bringing a real European Defence Equipment Market intobeing,” said Eero Lavonen of the Finnish Defence Ministry, who chaired the meeting on behalf of Javier Solana, the Head of the Agency. The Steering Board considered the results of an EDA fact-finding study into the use by participating Member States of Article 296 of the EU Treaty to exempt purchases of defence equipment from the normal internal market rules requiring cross-border competition, and agreed that it underlined theneed to inject more competition into this area. The Steering Board stressed that any Code of Conduct would have to contain provisions covering the security of supply for one Member State purchasing vital equipment from a company based inanother member state, the protection of classified information, and opportunities for small-and medium-sized enterprises with specialist capabilities. “The essence of the Code of Conduct would be transparency and mutual accountability,” said NickWitney, the EDA’s Chief Executive. “More opportunities for companies to do business across EU borders would be a major boost for Europe’s Defence Technological and Industrial Base.” – headded.	https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2005/09/22/EDA_Steering_Board_takes_further_step_towards_injecting_competition_into_defence_procurement
