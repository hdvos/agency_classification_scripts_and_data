It was not only his first official visit since he took office in March but also the first of a \u2018tour des capitales\u2019 which will see him paying visits to all Member States in the coming months. \u00a0Mr \u0160ediv\u00fd was received at the French Ministry of Defence where he had meetings with Alice Guitton (Director General for International Relations and Strategy), General Fran\u00e7ois Lecointre (Chief of Defence Staff), Lieutenant General Eric Bellot des Mini\u00e8res (Deputy Chief of Defence Staff for Defence Planning), General Eric Charpentier (Capability Director at the Defence Staff) as well as Thierry Carlier (National Armaments Director and Director for International Relations at the Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'armement, DGA). Mr \u0160ediv\u00fd also had meetings at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with Philippe Setton (EU Director) and David Bertolotti (Director for Strategic Affairs, Security and Disarmament). \u201cWe are at a key moment in the implementation of EU defence initiatives: the PESCO strategic review is underway, the first CARD report will be published in November and important aspects related to the European Defence Fund will have to be decided upon later this year. The challenge is further exacerbated by the ongoing Covid-19 crisis and its potential repercussions on defence planning and spending in our Member States. These difficult circumstances call for more European defence cooperation, more joint planning and more pooling and sharing of resources and capabilities. During my \u2018tour des capitales\u2019 in the coming months, I will listen to all our Member States\u2019 specific ideas and suggestions and exchange views on how we can further improve collaborative capability development in Europe and strengthen the Agency\u2019s role in it. My first stop today in Paris was a very good and promising start\u201d, said Mr \u0160ediv\u00fd. Director General Alice Guitton stated \"The year 2020 will be a milestone in strengthening European defence. The COVID-19 crisis has shown the need for deeper European cooperation, decreasing our dependencies, and more efficiency in defence spending, and many critical projects must now be completed. EDA\u2019s work will be critical to help the EU Member States identify, prioritize and develop the key capabilities needed to face future crises and to strengthen European strategic autonomy, in a deteriorating security context, including by ensuring the success of the most recent initiatives, such as the EDF programme and PESCO.\u201d ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2020/07/01/chief-executive-starts-tour-des-capitales-with-visit-to-france"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0002", "date": "2020-07-17", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Chief Executive opinion editorial: Now, more than ever", "text": " However disruptive the economic and financial impact of Covid-19 might be, it will not not obscure the need for Member States to strengthen Europe\u2019s full spectrum of defence capabilities, and to do it through cooperation. On the contrary: this crisis makes collaborative capability development even more indispensable and urgent, argues Ji\u0159\u00ed \u0160ediv\u00fd, the European Defence Agency\u2019s (EDA) new Chief Executive, in the following opinion editorial. This pandemic is far from over and the full scale of its repercussions still unpredictable. Yet, there are lessons to be learned already now as Europe must adjust to a new post-Covid reality. Defence is no exception. The budgetary shockwave caused by the pandemic may heavily weigh on some Member States\u2019 ability to sustain existing national defence programmes, let alone launch new ones. Which in turn threatens to further curtail Europe\u2019s security and defence clout.\u00a0 There could be a plus side to the crisis as well, though: some of its effects might help speed up the process towards genuine EU defence cooperation. Looked\u00a0at from this angle, this emergency offers a unique and unexpected opportunity for making collaborative capability development the new norm in Europe. Rather than weakening national defence forces one by one, the new reality imposed by Covid-19 could advance advance the Europe of Defence as a whole. \u00a0 Making a virtue of (budgetary) necessity The follow-up costs of the pandemic are likely to squeeze national public spending across the board and for years to come, including spending on defence. What\u2019s more, the fiscal downturn hits at a time when Europe needs to invest more and better in its security and defence. The many good reasons that led the EU and its Member States to raise the Union\u2019s level of ambition on security and defence in 2016 and to work towards European strategic autonomy as a long-term goal, are still valid. To drop or even lower this ambition is not an option, even under today\u2019s exceptional circumstances, as this would seriously undermine Europe\u2019s security role in the world. \u00a0 How to square this circle? Defence cooperation is the answer. Europe needs more joint defence planning and capability development. The call for Pooling & Sharing of resources and capabilities is not new, but it has become more pressing today. When defence budgets come under pressure, the smartest way for Member States to safeguard or even increase their military resilience is to plan, develop, procure, maintain and operate their defence equipment together. Multinational capability development \u2013 be it under PESCO, EDA or any other format involving several EU countries \u2013 is more cost-efficient and impactful than national solo efforts done in isolation. Money saved through EU cooperation can compensate for expected cuts in defence spending, at least in the long run. Beyond the financial benefits, cooperation also pays off thanks to increased operational effectiveness and interoperability, for the benefit of EU, NATO or other multinational operations. Joining forces will allow those Member States under budgetary strain to do more, for their own defence and that of Europe. \u00a0 Tools ready and fit for purpose The other good news is that we don\u2019t have to start from scratch. All instruments and processes needed to enable and manage EU defence cooperation are already in place and ready to be used: updated European Capability Development Priorities, the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD), the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the\u00a0European Defence Fund (EDF). If Member States don\u2019t use the toolbox\u2019 full potential now, then when will they? The same applies to EDA, the EU hub for collaborative research and capability development which currently hosts more than 110 research and capability programmes as well as some 200 other activities. Here too, Member States still have some leeway available if they want to use EDA\u2019s expertise and potential to the full extent. \u00a0 Stronger emphasis on CBRN\u00a0 The Covid-19 pandemic has also brought to light, indirectly of course, the enormous disruptive potential of biological substances. Although Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) threats have been on our radar for some time \u2013 the European Capability Development Priorities reviewed in 2018 under EDA guidance explicitly refer to the need to strengthen European capabilities in the CBRN domain \u2013 this crisis has nevertheless highlighted the urgent need to do more in order to be better prepared and equipped to deal with these kind of threats in the future. This is another important lesson to be learned from this dramatic experience. Given the magnitude of the challenge, it can only be mastered together, i.e. through cooperation. Another example of why EU defence cooperation matters now more than ever. The same is true for other military assets which proved extremely helpful for our Member States during the most acute phase of the pandemic, such as medical and logistics support or cybersecurity. They, too, must stay high on our priority list for future cooperation. \u00a0 A fresh look at strategic autonomy Finally, and this is a third lesson, Covid-19 has shown the importance of maintaining strategic local production capacities able to provide critical material of high quality and in sufficient quantities when crises hit \u2013 in this case relatively basic commodities such as masks or other protection utilities. This has served as a reminder to all of us, including the defence sector, that European strategic autonomy cannot only refer to high-tech, high-end capabilities but also to basic but indispensable industrial expertise and production capacities. Maintaining critical industrial production capacities in Europe is thus a crucial prerequisite for building a Europe of defence and moving towards strategic autonomy. Here too, cooperation is the way forward as Europe\u2019s key strategic activities can only be sustained together. \u00a0 Special Report in European Defence Matters.

The first part of the magazine is devoted to an analysis of the impact the Covid-19 crisis might have on the wider European defence sector, including national and EU defence spending and the implementation of the EU defence cooperation tools. It features exclusive opinion editorials of and interviews with the Agency\u2019s new Chief Executive, Ji\u0159\u00ed \u0160ediv\u00fd, the European Commission Director General of DG Defence Industry & Space (DEFIS), Timo Pesonen, the Secretary General of the AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD), Jan Pie, and the Security and Defence Editor at the EU Institute for Security Studies (EUISS), Daniel Fiott. The magazine\u2019s cover story then provides readers with a detailed insight into the various collaborative training & exercise activities the Agency is running since many years with great success with the aim of increasing Member States Armed Forces\u2019 interoperability. The magazine also drills into the fascinating topic of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and speaks to Christian Hedelin, the Chief Strategy Officer of SAAB, about how AI has already made its way into defence equipment. Moreover, it puts a spotlight on a new promising project launched in cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) related to CBRN detection. Last but not least, NATO Deputy Secretary General Mircea Geoan\u0103 shares his assessment of the current state of play of EU/NATO cooperation. Have a look immediately and enjoy your reading!

Back in 2011, the European\u00a0Defence\u00a0Agency started an initiative to address the long-standing European shortfall in the air-to-air\u00a0refuelling\u00a0capacity. Since then, this initiative has grown into a mature\u00a0programme\u00a0handed over to and\u00a0managed by the NSPA on behalf of the\u00a0participating countries\u00a0and supported by OCCAR\u00a0for\u00a0the acquisition phase.\u00a0 The MMF\u00a0programme\u00a0stands as an example on how European countries can cooperate, pooling and sharing resources to get access to state of the art capabilities that would be difficult or impossible to access individually. All the countries involved, independently of their size and the number of flying hours, have access to the MMF capabilities.\u00a0 EDA\u2019s Chief Executive\u00a0Ji\u0159\u00ed\u00a0\u0160ediv\u00fd\u00a0said:\u00a0\u201cThe Multinational Multirole Tanker and Transport Fleet is a prime example of European\u00a0defence\u00a0cooperation done in close coordination with NATO, which shows that once a capability shortfall has been jointly identified, European nations can pull\u00a0together, work on a common project aimed at filling the gap, and eventually deliver \u2013 as they do with today\u2019s\u00a0delivery\u00a0of the first aircraft.\u00a0It\u2019s\u00a0Pooling & Sharing at its best. The European\u00a0Defence\u00a0Agency stands ready\u00a0to assist additional Member States which\u00a0are in need of\u00a0AAR capabilities to explore their potential participation in this important project\u201d.\u00a0 NATO\u00a0Assistant Secretary General for Defence Investment,\u00a0Camille Grand, said:\u00a0\u201cThe MRTT fleet\u2019s versatility in providing several critical capabilities simultaneously is nothing short of impressive. The aircraft can help respond to crises such as the COVID-19 emergency, by moving medical supplies and conducting medical evacuations. However, the fleet will probably have the most profound impact within the air-to-air\u00a0refuelling\u00a0mission, an area where historically many European Allies have lacked capacity. Therefore, the MRTT fleet will help contribute to a fairer transatlantic burden-sharing at NATO. It is also a successful pilot multilateral cooperation project, bringing together a number of Allies and multiple NATO and EU institutions and agencies in support of the delivery of a major capability\u201d.\u00a0 \u00a0 Background\u00a0 The Netherlands and Luxembourg initially launched the\u00a0programme\u00a0in July 2016, with the first one as the lead nation of the project. Germany and Norway joined in 2017, Belgium followed in early 2018 and Czech Republic lastly joined the MMF\u00a0programme\u00a0in October 2019.\u00a0 The MMF aircraft will be operated by the Multinational Multirole Tanker Transport Unit (MMU) comprising of military personnel of the participating countries. The unit is based in two permanent operating bases, the Main Operating Base\u00a0in\u00a0Eindhoven\u00a0and the Forward Operating Base in Cologne-Wahn. Among the eight MMF aircraft, five will be based in Eindhoven, and three in Cologne.\u00a0 \u00a0 More information:\u00a0 Related NATO web story (30 June 2020) ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2020/06/30/first-mrtt-aircraft-delivered-to-eindhoven"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0005", "date": "2020-07-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Multinational Helicopter Training Centre (MHTC) sets course for Sintra", "text": " Having to let go of something close,\u00a0doesn\u2019t\u00a0need to\u00a0have a sense of loss. When the European Defence Agency (EDA) sees its home-grown Helicopter Exercise Programme, its Helicopter Tactics Course and its Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course move to the new permanent Multinational Helicopter Training Centre\u00a0(MHTC) in Portugal by the end of 2022, after many successful years at EDA, it does so with a feeling of \u2018mission accomplished\u2019. \u00a0 This article as well as the following interview with Jo\u00e3o Gomes\u00a0Cravinho, the Defence Minister of Portugal, have first been published in EDA's 'European Defence Matters' magazine N\u00b0 19 published in June 2020.\u00a0 It is a basic principle underlying all training activities run by EDA: as soon as a programme reaches a sustainable level of\u00a0support, maturity and output, the aim becomes to transfer it to a permanent facility hosted and managed by one of Member States involved. For the Agency\u2019s ambition is not to become a permanent training institute but to serve as a catalyst and facilitator\u00a0for collaborative training activities which later on will be taken care of by a Member State or an organisation \u2013 allowing the Agency to free resources and engage in other training projects. \u00a0 The move in June 2017 of EDA\u2019s European Air Transport Fleet training programme to the new permanent European Tactical Airlift Centre (ETAC) in Zaragoza/Spain, after six years of busy activities at EDA \u2013 87 aircrews trained, 50 tactical instructor pilots graduate, 94 European transport aircraft involved \u2013 stands out as\u00a0a shining example of this policy. \u00a0 It will be followed soon by the Agency\u2019s three multinational rotary-wing training programmes:\u00a0the\u00a0Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP), the Helicopter Tactics Course (HTC) and the Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC). Launched in 2009 and supported by 15 countries (Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Finland, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Slovenia, Norway as well as the United Kingdom \u2013 up\u00a0till Brexit), this trio has since become one of EDA\u2019s most dynamic and successful training activities, highly appreciated in Europe\u2019s rotary wing community. \u00a0 By the end of 2022, their new home will be\u00a0Sintra/Portugal:\u00a0that\u2019s\u00a0what the Agency\u2019s Steering Board decided in August 2019 when it green-lit the setting-up of a new Multinational Helicopter Training Centre (MHTC).\u00a0 \u00a0 A new permanent home\u00a0 The objective is to make this MHTC a permanent European centre of excellence for advanced helicopter training. It will deliver administrative and training functions to serve both as a central hub for the coordination of helicopter training across Europe, but also as the provider of the next iteration of the HEP, HTC and HTIC programmes currently run by the Agency. \u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0centre is expected to reach initial operational capability (IOC) by the end of 2022, although the Covid-19 crisis impact may alter this date, and it is estimated it will operate for a period of 15 years, which can be extended to 30 years following the agreement of its contributing Member States.\u00a0 The next major milestone in the preparation is the harmonisation of the MHTC Technical Agreement, expected by the beginning of 2021, and the build-up of the infrastructures in\u00a0Sintra\u00a0which should be finished before the IOC MHTC.\u00a0 \u00a0 Gradual hand-over starting this summer\u00a0 The move to\u00a0Sintra\u00a0will be gradual, starting soon \u2013 this summer with the transfer of EDA\u2019s helicopter training centre from its traditional location, RAF airbase Linton-on-Ouse in the United Kingdom (in the process of being dismantled), to\u00a0Sintra\u00a0Air Force airbase which will already be operational, on a provisional basis, between mid-2020 and the end of 2022 when it will fully take over its new MHTC role. The full set of training equipment will be moved from Linton-on-Ouse to\u00a0Sintra, except the helicopter simulator which is being replaced with a new one. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \"An opportunity to strengthen European cooperation\"\u00a0 Portugal is actively preparing to host the MHTC which it considers a priority and \u201cstrategic investment\u201d, says the country\u2019s Minister of Defence, Jo\u00e3o Gomes\u00a0Cravinho, in an exclusive interview with European Defence Matters.\u00a0 \u00a0 How are preparations going for the transition of\u00a0the current EDA helicopter programmes to\u00a0Sintra\u00a0in 2020 and for the creation of the MHTC in 2022?\u00a0 Currently, and until 2023, EDA helicopter programmes will take place in\u00a0Sintra\u00a0as part of a transition process for MHTC while ensuring the continuity of all\u00a0EDA helicopter training. Portugal has received the helicopter simulator formerly based in the UK and will provide support for academic and simulator courses in existing infrastructures, specially adapted for that purpose, while the MHTC project is under development. Since November, multiple site surveys have been made in\u00a0Sintra\u00a0to check the current infrastructures. The flight simulator hardware is already in Portugal, waiting for INZPIRE representatives to be able to travel to Portugal and start the required assembly as soon as possible. Of course, we and all the other countries involved in the Agency\u2019s helicopter training have also been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic which has required partial and full lockdowns, including in Portugal. This resulted in the cancellation of two courses, planned for May and June 2020. Nevertheless, Portugal has been actively engaged with EDA and Member States to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 in the helicopter programmes. In close coordination with Member States a contingency plan has been agreed that should allow these courses to take place in the future. \u00a0 \u00a0 What makes\u00a0Sintra\u00a0the perfect site for it?\u00a0 Sintra\u00a0is being turned into the rotary wing hub of the Portuguese Air Force that is expected to be fully operational by 2023.\u00a0We hope this will provide relevant synergies, and this is\u00a0in itself proof\u00a0that we believe\u00a0Sintra\u00a0is indeed a great location for this type of infrastructure. There are large modular spaces adapted to the needs of a structure like this. The accommodation, the courses and the simulator area will, of course, be in accordance with EDA\u2019s requirements and will all be within easy walking distance of catering and leisure spaces. Additionally, because there is more to life than work, the air base is very close to the historic town of\u00a0Sintra, to Lisbon and to the beaches of Cascais, meaning there is no lack of opportunities for leisure or physical exercise in the vicinity.\u00a0 \u00a0 How big an effort (infrastructure, staff, budget, etc.) is this for Portugal to become the host\u00a0nation of this important training activity?\u00a0 The Portuguese government is committed to a responsible management of the State budget, but we are also committed to strategic investments. We see the MHTC project as an opportunity to strengthen European cooperation in addressing a key operational capability that has often been found lacking and is vital to provide\u00a0support to ongoing and future CSDP missions. Once Full Operational Capability is achieved, Portugal has committed, through the Portuguese Air Force,\u00a0to support not only the infrastructure exclusively dedicated to the MHTC academic and simulator courses, but also all student logistical support (lodging, meals). Regarding staff, the MHTC will have ten permanent positions, plus temporary personnel responsible for the academic and simulator courses. In principle, the Portuguese Air Force will be responsible for about 50% of these permanent posts, with full time dedicated personnel. We are currently assessing the best options for hosting our foreign partners involved in permanent posts in the MHTC. In conclusion, this is a significant effort, but we see it as a priority, as a strategic investment.\u00a0 \u00a0 How will this influence Portugal\u2019s own involvement in EDA\u2019s helicopter programme where it currently participates in the Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP) and the Helicopter Tactics Course (HTC). Any plan to join the Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC)?\u00a0 The involvement of the Portuguese Air Force in EDA\u2019s helicopter programmes (HEP and HTC) has been\u00a0very successful\u00a0in developing and consolidating rotary wing operational capabilities. Portugal is currently not involved in the HTIC, but this is an interesting programme and will be considered in future discussions regarding available investment in this area. \u00a0 \u00a0 Portugal is a very regular host of the BLADE multinational helicopter exercises, at least during the 2012-2022 period. Will you remain central and host of this exercise even beyond 2022?\u00a0 We are working on it. As you know, we are the organiser of the BLADE exercise in 2021. And Portugal in fact holds the record as the host country for BLADE exercises. I believe this is the result of Portugal\u2019s ability to organise these exercises effectively, as well as the fact that it has, in relative terms, a very flexible airspace and ideal meteorological conditions. Portugal has made clear its availability for hosting the BLADE helicopter exercises in 2024, 2027 and 2030. Now it is up to EDA and the other Member States to decide, but Portugal is very committed to continuing to invest in cooperation with its European allies and partners in this vital operational capability.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2020/07/29/multinational-helicopter-training-centre-(mhtc)-sets-course-for-sintra"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0006", "date": "2020-06-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Defence Ministers focus on sustaining EU capability development", "text": " The European Defence Agency\u2019s (EDA) Steering Board in the composition of Defence Ministers discussed today how to sustain EU capability development in times of disruptive challenges. Defence Ministers pointed to the need for more collaborative projects, efficiency gains and economies of scale as the most effective way of navigating the current crisis while ensuring that Europe\u2019s armed forced are ready for the future.\u00a0 In addressing an ever more dynamic security environment, including the impact of COVID-19, Ministers underscored the need for even more multinational cooperation in capability planning and development to overcome an unprecedented and diverse set of challenges. Ministers agreed that the EU defence initiatives advanced since 2016 need to be implemented with more decisiveness than ever before. They stressed the importance of delivering on the binding commitments under PESCO, implementing the EU Capability Development priorities, based on a fully-fledged defence review (CARD), and making full use of the European Defence Fund (EDF) as a powerful incentive at the EU level. Ministers also discussed how to better ensure that Europe has highly resilient and responsive armed forces, which are able to prevent, detect and respond to multiple threats and scenarios. The meeting, held via videoconference, was chaired for the first time by Head of the Agency, Josep Borrell. It was also the first opportunity for recently appointed EDA Chief Executive, Ji\u0159\u00ed \u0160ediv\u00fd, to address the EDA Steering Board comprising the Ministers of Defence of the Agency\u2019s 26 Member States. Head of the European Defence Agency, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission, Josep Borrell said: \u201cWhether we are prepared or not to respond to today\u2019s security threats depends on our ability to pull together our resources and act. Today, more than ever, it is crucial to spend better together, rationalise, strengthen our capabilities and deploy effectively to address crises and promote stability. The EU defence initiatives are in place, but to realise their full potential they must be fully integrated into Member States national defence policies and planning processes.\u201d EDA Chief Executive,Ji\u0159\u00ed\u00a0\u0160ediv\u00fd, said: \u201cThe key priority for European defence will be staying the course and maintaining the EU\u2019s level of ambition on defence, especially now, facing up to unprecedented challenges, including COVID-19. Europe has spent the last few years developing a comprehensive toolbox with the new EU defence initiatives. These tools are now to be put to work to enable deeper cooperation. EDA, as the hub for EU defence cooperation, is there to serve as the preferred platform for Member States defence cooperation\u201d. \u00a0 Full use of EDA's potential Ministers also looked into how the Agency can speed up the process of project generation and implementation at European level, and how it can best support more Member States in cooperative projects and programmes so that these become operational in a timely manner. EDA will examine how to further improve its service to Member States especially in terms of enabling processes and procedures, capability development, training, joint procurement, as well as R&T and innovation. \u00a0 Next steps: CARD Report The next EDA ministerial Steering Board will take place in November, when the first CARD (Coordinated Annual Review on Defence) Report will be presented. CARD provides an overview that will allow Member States to better coordinate their defence planning and spending and engage in collaborative projects, improving consistency in Member States defence spending and overall coherence of the European capability landscape. The report will act as a pathfinder to inform future investment decisions on the most promising, most needed and most pressing opportunities for multinational cooperation. \u00a0 \u00a0 EDA press contacts: Elisabeth SCHOEFFMANN Head of Media & Communication elisabeth.schoeffmann@eda.europa.eu T+32 470 87 01 65 Paul QUINN Media & Communications Officer paul.quinn@eda.europa.eu T+32 2 504 28 24 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2020/06/16/defence-ministers-focus-on-sustaining-eu-capability-development"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0007", "date": "2020-06-12", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA work on MALE-type RPAS Air Traffic Integration backed by French test flight", "text": " EDA\u2019s\u00a0groundwork to\u00a0help\u00a0Member States move\u00a0towards\u00a0the integration of MALE-type Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) in\u00a0civil air traffic in\u00a0non-segregated airspace\u00a0received a\u00a0significant\u00a0boost recently when a\u00a0live\u00a0MALE RPAS\u00a0flight test carried out by the French Air Force (FAF) contributed to\u00a0paving the way for\u00a0the validation\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0risk analysis previously\u00a0done\u00a0in an Agency study carried out in\u00a02018/19\u00a0as well as the EDA and EASA guidelines.\u00a0 To date, the conclusions of EDA\u2019s study on the \u2018Accommodation of MALE-type RPAS: scenarios and safety case\u2019, delivered in February 2019,\u00a0had only been\u00a0tested through simulations\u00a0but never under real flight\u00a0conditions.

The purpose of the workshop is to provide industry with a deeper insight into the Strategic Context Case (SCC) 10 (Integration of military air capabilities in a changing aviation sector) and develop a common understanding by gathering industry proposals on new R&D and validation activities needed within the Single European Sky (SES) domain. This call for papers is part of a broader approach to SCC 10, and aims to initiate and consolidate cooperative projects in the following domains: Military access to airspace, in particular in a Single European Sky context. The aim is to improve, for existing and future manned and unmanned air capabilities, the ability to train and conduct security and defence missions particularly in peacetime, but also in crisis and conflict. Protect the confidentiality of mission critical information and ensure a resilient and robust data sharing network in the changing context of the civil aviation sector. Coordination with civilian aviation authorities and structures, infrastructures and procedures while maintaining military-to-military interoperability to enable the effective contribution to operations in multinational coalitions. The adaptation of Military AIR/SPACE C2 capability and Communication Navigation Surveillance (CNS) capability to the changing context of the civil aviation sector including the deployment of ATM technologies and the development of the U-Space concept. The responses to this call for papers will drive the ideation of potential project proposals during the second formal workshop which will take place at EDA on\u00a02 December 2020*.

Detection, identification and monitoring of biological material are critical to enhancing situational awareness in a timely manner, supporting decisions, and enabling military commanders to take the most appropriate decisions in a recognized chemical and biological environment. Despite the importance of biological DIM, Europe still lacks coordination and harmonisation of the technical requirements for Member States\u2019 test and evaluation (T&E) equipment. This makes it difficult to compare and exchange T&E results both within and between European countries as well as NATO members. It also causes duplication of effort and reduces the cost-effectiveness of both national and international military and civilian T&E efforts, e.g. by limiting the burden-sharing and cost-reduction potential that could have been realised.\u00a0 In Phase 1 of the project, a general framework (in the form of a set of commonly defined requirements and criteria) was developed for T&E of biological DIM equipment.

These two new joint projects have been authorised by the ESA Council and Steering Board of EDA. They are the latest in a long history of cooperation enabled by the ESA-EDA Administrative Arrangement, originally signed in 2011 and recently extended for a second time. \u00a0 Innovation in disaster response Space-based services have fast become essential to Europe\u2019s safety and security. In 2017, a previous ESA-EDA Implementing Agreement demonstrated the use of space-based assets to respond to threats from toxic and hazardous materials. The project showed that space systems were beneficial to fast and accurate response to such threats in terms of situational awareness, early warning, detection and response planning. Based on this success, the two agencies decided to extend their cooperation in this area, and in December signed an implementing agreement to carry out a next-stage demonstration project called Autonomous Drone Services (AUDROS). By integrating space assets in sectors such as telecommunications, navigation and Earth observation, the partners will demonstrate the benefits of using autonomous and/or remotely piloted aerial vehicles to both detect toxic material and carry out rapid response to large-scale disasters. This activity will lead to the development of operational services that will deliver support to defence and security users on a permanent basis. \u00a0 Flying into the unknown ESA and the EDA are also cooperating in the development of new AI-based capabilities in the field of guidance, navigation and control (GNC) \u2013 knowing where an asset is and steering where it is going. Advanced, autonomous GNC is set to become an indispensable element of ambitious future space missions such as rendezvousing with asteroids and comets or the active removal of hazardous space debris from orbit.\u00a0 This joint project, dubbed ATENA, will develop AI-based systems with the capability of flying safely over unknown territory, such as an asteroid, to achieve enhanced navigation performance compared to current vision-based techniques based on feature tracking. \u00a0 Deepening ESA-EDA cooperation Through the two partners\u2019 deepening cooperation, Europe is better equipped to implement priority objectives across cyber and maritime security, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, remotely piloted aircraft systems, secure satellite communications, autonomous access to space and ongoing Earth observation. \u201cThe role of space-based services for security and defence actors is a recognised priority for Europe. The importance of space assets and applications for defence capabilities is reflected in the revised Capability Development Plan (CDP) approved by Member States at the EDA Steering Board in June 2018\u201d,\u00a0said EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq. \u201cESA is a natural and trusted partner for us.

EDA\u2019s report also finds that Member States are not meeting spending commitments in key areas.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Total defence expenditure returns to pre-financial crisis levels\u00a0\u00a0 The year\u2019s report finds that overall defence spending by the 27 EDA Member States has almost returned to pre-financial crisis levels, \u20ac225 billion in 2007 compared to \u20ac223.4 billion in 2018. This level of spending represents 1.4% of GDP and 3.1% of total government expenditure. Although overall spending fell by 11% between 2007 and 2013, since 2014 Member States defence expenditure is increasing in line with economic growth.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is extremely positive that defence budgets have almost fully returned to pre-financial crisis levels, with 2018 marking the fifth consecutive year of increased spending. Our report is evidence that Member States have put a renewed impetus into defence spending after suffering heavily in the years following the financial crisis. Nevertheless, EDA\u2019s findings do paint a mixed picture in terms of European collaborative defence, with a worrying fall in both equipment procurement and R&T spending in a European context. While European collaborative defence R&T still remains significantly below 2008 levels, it is encouraging that the value and number of ad-hoc R&T projects under EDA is increasing\u201d, Jorge Domecq, EDA\u2019s Chief Executive, commented.\u00a0 \u00a0 Shortfalls on collective spending commitments\u00a0\u00a0 Despite the rise in total defence expenditure, spending on fulfilling collective benchmarks has failed to keep pace. Spending on areas where collective benchmarks have been agreed namely: Defence Investment; Defence Research and Technology; European Collaborative Defence Equipment Procurement; and European Collaborative Defence R&T all still remain below 2008 levels. EDA\u2019s report provides detailed analysis of how current spending relates to these four collective benchmarks agreed at the EDA Steering Board in 2007, as follows: \u20ac44.5 billion on Defence Investment (procurement of new equipment and R&D), representing 19.9% of Total Defence Expenditure against a collective benchmark of 20%;\u00a0 \u20ac6.4 billion on European Collaborative Defence Equipment Procurement, representing\u00a0 17.8% of Total Defence Equipment Procurement against a collective benchmark of 35%;\u00a0 \u20ac2.1 billion on Defence Research and Technology, totalling 0.9% of Total Defence Expenditure against a collective benchmark of 2%; and,\u00a0 \u20ac153 million on European Collaborative Defence R&T, totalling 7.3% of Total Defence R&T against a collective benchmark of 20%.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Key findings\u00a0\u00a0 However, among the 27 EDA Member States some disparities in achieving these benchmarks can be observed:\u00a0\u00a0 14 Member States spent 20% or more of their defence budget on investment in 2018, up from 7 states in 2014;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 21 Member States now dedicate more than 10% of defence budget on investments;\u00a0\u00a0 8 Member States combined account for 96% of total defence research and technology spending, with the largest four accounting for 85%.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Background\u00a0 EDA collects defence data on an annual basis, and has done so since 2006, in line with the Agency\u2019s ministerial Steering Board decision of November 2005.

Belgian forces are active in several areas throughout Africa, including: Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger.\u00a0 In Niger, they are delivering training and operational advice to the Forces Arm\u00e9e Nig\u00e9riennes (FANER) and operate in austere conditions with only limited medical support facilities. To provide appropriate medical oversight, the deployment provides an aircraft based, primary life support capability, available 24/7 throughout the designated operational theatre, to move injured personnel from the main Damage Control Surgery Unit in the city of Maradi to definitive care facilities in neighbouring Gao, Chad or, in extremis, for repatriation to Europe. EDA is no stranger to providing direct support to operations and maintains an entire unit dedicated to operational support, training and exercises. The niche services provided by the Agency, such as those within the EU SatCom Market, offer an attractive and easily accessible turn-key capability to many Member States\u2019 planners. In national and CSDP operations and missions, the provision of certain key capabilities can be challenging. Typically operations or missions are deployed on short notice, in remote areas. In many cases, capabilities are not available and outsourcing is necessary to provide services from private companies. Experience has shown that contracting on the spot under time pressure is not a cost-effective solution. Having in place ready-to-use arrangements is very beneficial in order to reduce the administrative burden and achieve economies of scale. \u00a0 Framework contracts In 2019, EDA concluded several framework contracts with international aeromedical providers to cover fixed and rotary wing AIRMEDEVAC services in Africa and Europe. The project\u2019s objective was the provision of in-theatre AIRMEDEVAC services to evacuate patients from the point of injury to an initial Medical Treatment Facility (Forward AIRMEDEVAC normally conducted by rotary wing platforms) or fixed-wing transfer between in-theatre Medical Treatment Facilities (Tactical AIRMEDEVAC) to be used in frame of national and/or international defence and/or security operations.

The project currently involves four participating Member States (AT, BE, DE and NL)\u00a0 but is also attracting interest from other EU agencies and bodies and look set to grow with further work in hand to examine the provision rotary wing Forward AIRMEDEVAC services later in the year. The Belgian Defence Staff offered their own comment on the new capability: \u201cThis type of contractual vector offers \u2018ready-to-use\u2019 solutions allowing quick response to operational needs. EDA is advantageously taking care of procurement process, contracting, invoicing, etc. whilst the customer still keeps the right to take part in the evaluation of tenders by each reopening of competition and also remains responsible for controlling the performance of the contract once signed. The process with EDA is highly professional and quick, offering time and budget savings\u201d. Aside from direct support to operations, the unit also supports fixed, rotary and unmanned training and exercise activities.\u00a0 Since 2009, it has developed a wide portfolio of advanced tactics courses for\u00a0 European helicopter crews, employing simulator based and live training events covering hot and cold weather operations, both day and night, including weapon drops and support to special forces. Similarly, the Agency continues to support fixed-wing air transport operations under the banner of the European Air Transport Force (EATF) Programme, including capacity building activities for specific fleets (C-295, C-130) and initial training of Medium Altitude, Long Endurance (MALE) drone pilots and operators.\u00a0 \u00a0 More information: Contracts signed for the provision of aero medical evacuation services in Europe and Africa (EDA webnew, February 2019) EDA factsheet on AIRMEDEVAC \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2020/01/08/eda-deploys-first-civilian-fixed-wing-aeromedical-evacuation-services"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0035", "date": "2020-01-22", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA bids farewell to Chief Executive Jorge Domecq", "text": " On 17 January, EDA staff together with senior representatives from Member States, EU institutions/bodies/agencies, NATO, industry as well as the wider European defence community bid farewell to Chief Executive Jorge Domecq. Mr Domecq will depart from the Agency at the end of this month when his term comes to an end after five years.\u00a0 Deputy Chief Executive Olli Ruutu thanked Mr Domecq for his relentless, hard work and commitment at the helm of the Agency over the last five years. During this period, especially after the presentation of the EU Global Strategy in 2016, \u201cthe EU defence cooperation environment changed fundamentally\u201d with the setting up of unprecedented cooperation tools such as the Coordinated Annual Review of Defence (CARD), the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the European Defence Fund (EDF). \u201cIn this cooperation with our colleagues in Member States and in European institutions, you have put your mark on developing EU defence initiatives for a structure whose purpose is to make Europe more capable (\u2026) Europe\u2019s ability to provide added value to our security, and to tangibly support our defence capabilities, is more important than ever. For putting this commitment and conviction into action, your work must be truly commended\u201d.\u00a0 Under Mr Domecq\u2019s leadership, the Agency expanded its activities considerably across the areas of capability development, research and critical enablers. Mr Domecq leaves behind him an Agency that is \u201csolid, administratively sound and accountable\u201d and therefore fit for purpose to play its role in the development of a Europe of Defence, Mr Ruutu concluded.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Five defining years for the Agency Mr Domecq, a senior Spanish diplomat with previous experiences in NATO, OSCE and UN, joined the European Defence Agency on 1 February 2015 for a first mandate of three years which, following a proposal by then Head of the Agency Federica Mogherini, was extended for an additional two years, until 1 February 2020.\u00a0 With the Global Strategy triggering the launch by Member States of the EU defence initiatives (CARD, PESCO, EDF) and calling on Member States to make \u201cfull use\u201d of the Agency\u2019s potential, Mr Domecq led the Agency\u2019s work to provide a fundamental contribution to advancing and implementing defence cooperation in line with a new level of ambition.\u00a0 Within this context, the Agency\u2019s Long Term Review (LTR) in 2017 led to a significant reinforcement of EDA\u2019s tasks: as the main intergovernmental prioritisation instrument at EU level in support of capability development; as the preferred cooperation forum and management support structure at EU level to engage in technology and capability development activities; and with regard to EU funded defence-related activities and military voice in wider EU polices. The LTR adjustments subsequently allowed EDA to adapt quickly and smoothly to the fast-changing European defence landscape and the new requirements stemming from CARD, PESCO and the EDF.\u00a0 \u00a0 Mr Domecq also successfully oversaw adaptations in the Agency\u2019s activity portfolio to reflect changing threats (hybrid warfare) and new emerging technologies, such as 3-D printing, cyber and artificial intelligence. Within his mandate, EDA\u2019s cooperation with industry and its relations with EU institutions and agencies, other organisations such as OCCAR, ESA and NATO have considerably developed.\u00a0\u00a0 As of 1 February 2020 and until the new Chief Executive takes office, EDA's Deputy Chief Executive, Olli Ruutu, will exercise ad interim the duties of the Chief Executive. \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2020/01/22/eda-bids-farewell-to-chief-executive-jorge-domecq"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0036", "date": "2019-12-02", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Focus on EU defence initiatives: the new EDA magazine is out!", "text": " The latest European Defence Matters magazine (N\u00b018) is now available, with a special focus on the state of implementation of the new EU defence initiatives (CARD, PESCO, EDF).

The signing took place during a meeting with EDA Chief Jorge Domecq at the Agency\u2019s premises. Initiated by EDA, the CFM was negotiated over the past three years. It is designed to overcome the recurrent problem of unsynchronised defence budgets in participating Member States which can hinder or impede the launch of collaborative defence projects.\u00a0 So far, 10 participating Member States (Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain) have already signed the Programme Arrangement or declared their intention to join the programme. More countries signalled their willingness to join the programme in the coming weeks. Developed as a so-called \u2018Category A\u2019 programme of the Agency, the CFM is entirely voluntary. Member States can freely decide if they wish to participate, contribute and support projects.\u00a0 Today, the launch of collaborative defence capability and research projects is sometimes delayed or hampered by the fact that defence budgetary availabilities might differ among partners, for instance for an unexpected budgetary restriction or a shift in national priorities. As a result, it happens that countries interested in a collaborative project cannot join or have to postpone their participation because the required funding is not approved or available at a particular moment. The CFM, acting as trusted platform offering mutual inter-state help, or alternatively outside support from the EIB, was established to mitigate this problem. It will enter into force at the date of the signature of the last country having declared its intention to join. EDA Chief Jorge Domecq stated: \u201cThe Agency\u2019s role is to promote and incentivise collaborative defence projects in Europe and to help create the right conditions for that. The CFM adds a very powerful instrument to our toolbox in the context of an enhanced momentum for defence cooperation fostered by the EU defence initiatives. In future, mismatching budgetary cycles or provisional gaps in funding should no longer exclude member states from participating in multinational programmes\u201d.\u00a0 EIB Vice-President Alexander Stubb commented: \u201cEurope has to be at the forefront of the development of key strategic defence technologies, including AI and digitalisation. With cooperation we can improve EU efficiency and innovation ability and strengthen EU capacity to prevent and respond to hybrid threats. A lack of access to suitable financing solutions allowing to better synchronize joint resources is seen as one of the major impediments to the launch or implementation of defence related cooperative projects. This is where the EU bank comes into play. Via the CFM, the EIB can strengthen its lending in support of public sector projects, with, inter alia, potential investments in the fields of dual-use RDI of defence or cybersecurity technologies, including projects envisaged under the EU\u2019s Permanent Structured Cooperation PESCO.\u201d \u00a0 Two pillar structure The CFM will be structured in two pillars: the first pillar foresees the European Investment Bank (EIB) as the sole lender through the conclusion of bilateral framework loan agreements between EIB and the interested Member State having joined the CFM arrangement (CFM Member). To obtain the EIB\u2019s financial support, projects submitted must respect the eligibility requirements set by the Bank\u2019s lending policy, while the volume of the lending facility and the interest rate applied are negotiated on a case-by-case basis by the EIB and the interested CFM Member. The EIB involvement is supported and facilitated by the EDA which will act as the \u2018Facility Agent\u2019 on behalf of EIB under its instructions and responsibility, serving as a primary point of contact between the EIB and the beneficiary CFM Member in the technical assessment of the feasibility of each project; the second pillar provides for a State-to-State support facility, through a system of reimbursable advances and deferred payments. It can be used to support any defence related project. The facility is structured as a set of individual bank accounts which are opened and managed by the EDA under the control of the CFM Members. Within that pillar, any CFM Member can submit a request for financial support to other CFM Members being part of a same collaborative project. While the Programme Arrangement provides the overarching legal framework setting the general requirements and conditions for State-to-State support, the specific conditions of each advance will be set out in separate agreements to be concluded between the supporting CFM Member, the beneficiary CFM Member and the EDA, as facilitator. The administrative and operational costs of the CFM will be covered by existing EDA resources meaning CFM Members will not have to bear additional costs for the management of the mechanism. Notwithstanding any financial support granted under the CFM, projects or programmes subject to such financial support will remain at all times governed and managed according to their own rules. \u00a0 More information: European Defence Agency and European Investment Bank sign cooperation agreement (Feb 2018) \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/12/09/eib-signs-cooperative-financial-mechanism-(cfm)-arrangement"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0038", "date": "2019-11-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Cyber agencies assess future cooperation opportunities", "text": " EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq today hosted a meeting of the principals of the cyber organisations signatories of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) concluded in May 2018: the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) and the Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU Institutions, Bodies and Agencies (CERT-EU).\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of the meeting was to assess the progress achieved since the 2018 MoU and to plan the future cooperation activities for 2020-2021. The MoU provides a comprehensive cooperative framework through which civil-military synergies can be promoted, ultimately aiming to improve cybersecurity of all stakeholders and support Member States\u2019 cyber defence programmes.\u00a0\u00a0 In 2019, quadrilateral cooperation was further enhanced with various activities, regular exchanges on topical cybersecurity aspects and participation in respective events of interest.\u00a0 Looking ahead, the collaboration roadmap prepared by the MoU working group envisages concrete activities on cyber training & education, technology development. The updated roadmap sets ambitious objectives for the coming year, effectively taking the level of cooperation to a new level. As part of the cooperation, the four partners are planning to organise a major event in the second part of 2020, improve their cooperation along the lines of major cybersecurity policy implementation (notably, the Cybersecurity Act) and the update Cyber Defence Policy Framework. They also commit to pay additional attention to improving incident response mechanisms and processes as well as increased joint contributions to high visibility events on Cybersecurity and Cyber Defence. EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq said: \u201cThe efforts required by the implementation of the Cyber Defence Policy Framework and, in general, by our contributing Member States in the cyber defence domain are consistently increasing, and require specialised and committed resources. The collaboration enabled by the MoU is a key factor of our efforts to harmonize these efforts, avoid duplication and support Member States in their capability development programmes\u201d.

However, everything will depend on how efficiently and coherently they are implemented, and to what extent Member States will actually use and embed these tools into their national defence thinking and planning, the EDA Chief Executive stressed, reflecting a general assessment expressed throughout the conference.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Main takeaways Mr Domecq singled out a number of commonalities expressed during the conference which could serve as the main takeaways of today's event, such as: the sense of urgency to use the current window of opportunity to push ahead with the Europe of Defence; the need to deliver quick results by ensuring an efficient, coherent and output-oriented implementation of the tools; the importance of following an integrated approach which includes all the actors on EU level (EDA, EEAS, EUMC, EUMS, Commission, Council) as well as national Ministries of Defence; the priority of the operational military needs and requirements which have to guide the industrial needs, not the other way around the need to safeguard and invest in Key Strategic Activities to make the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base more sustainable, as a key aspect of strategic autonomy.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Lively and interactive panel discussions\u00a0 Throughout the day, between the various keynote speeches (see other related webnews on the opening speeches\u00a0and the ministerial debate), conference attendees also enjoyed two lively, interactive and highly interesting panel debates, each of them focusing on a specific aspect of European defence. Moderated by EUISS Director Dr Gustav Lindstrom, the first panel entitled 'CARD, PESCO, EDF: taking stock and looking ahead' featured Admiral Rob Bauer (Dutch Chief of Defence), Dirk Hoke (CEO of Airbus Defence & Space), Herald Ruijters (Director at the European Commission's DG MOVE), Esa Pulkkinen (Director General of the EU Military Staff) as well as Benedikt Zimmer (German State Secretary for Defence Procurement). The panelist focused on the need to ensure a smooth and hands-on implementation of the new EU defence cooperation tools, and to always keep in mind the armed forces' real capability needs and priorities. The key driver of all cooperation must be the capability requirements and needs of our forces, and nothing else, said Mr Zimmer. He also called for \"proper and fair partnerships\" between the European defence industries and countries to unleash the full potential of defence cooperation. In this respect, Dirk Hoke (Airbus) raised the importance of solving the sensitive issue of intellectual property rights. \"As long this question is not solved, we will see duplication\" in the development of capabilities, he said. The current fragmentation of Europe' capability landscape is not sustainable, stressed Admiral Bauer. Capabilities, such as for example military helicopters, can be produced by different industries in different countries\u00a0\"but please build just one type of them, not 28\", he said.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The second panel, moderated by EDA's Industry, Synergies & Enablers Director, Emilio Fajardo, discussed the 'Technological and industrial dimension of the EU's new level of ambition on defence'. It featured\u00a0Thierry Carlier (Director International Development, Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'Armement), \u00c9ric B\u00e9ranger (CEO of MBDA),\u00a0 Steven Blockmans (Head of the EU Foreign Policy Unit at the Centre for European Policy Studies CEPS), Micael Johansson (President/CEO of SAAB Group) Paula Queipo Rodriguez (Director of Business Operations, IDONIAL Centro Tecnol\u00f3gico),\u00a0 Dr Margriet Drent (Senior Research Fellow at Clingendael). A strong focus was put on\u00a0Europe's so-called Key Strategic Activities (skills, technologies, manufacturing capabilities) which should be safeguarded to maintain and increase Member States armed forces' freedom of action and allow the EU to move towards strategic autonomy. \u00a0 More information: Welcome speech by EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq Speech by Michel Barnier (European Commission Chief Negotiator) Speech by General Claudio Graziano, Chairman of EU Military Committee Speech by NATO ASG Camille Grand ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/11/28/annual-conference-closes-with-call-for-coherent-implementation-of-eu-defence-tools"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0040", "date": "2019-11-28", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "AI-driven decision aid project wins EDA Defence Innovation Prize", "text": " EDA today announced the winner of the 2019 EDA Defence Innovation Prize which, this year, rewards the most innovative idea or application for the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in defence. The trophy goes to epic.blue, a young Belgian company specialised in Location Intelligence Systems, for their idea to use AI-driven tactical decision aids to provide commanders of military operations with accurate and seamless positioning data of teams in GNSS-denied environments. The Prize was handed over by EDA Deputy Chief Executive Olli Ruutu at a ceremony in the margins of the Agency\u2019s Annual Conference today in Brussels. The availability, in all circumstances, of precise, reliable and constantly updated data on the current operational status and environment of an operation is crucial and helps military commanders to speed up and improve their decision-making. The benefits for military operations using new AI-based location intelligence tools are increased situational awareness, safety and operational effectiveness.\u00a0 The starting point for the winning idea was the fact that commanders are more and more overwhelmed by a deluge of information, driven by the continuous rise of available sensor data and the increased inter-connectivity of deployed systems. By contrast, a long-standing information gap still exists: accurate positioning of teams in GNSS-denied environments. The solution proposed in the winning project is thus to create a range of AI tactical decision aids (TDA) which, together with humans in the loop, can considerably augment commanders\u2019 thought processes and speed of decision-making, thanks to accurate and seamless positioning of their troops, even in GNSS-denied environments.\u00a0 The proposed AI decision aids would use 4D data generated and collected during trainings and operations: movement of forces, time and location of hostile encounters, theoretical planning and movement, etc.. All that 4D data captured by the system is stored with timestamp and location to create a storyboard for post-mission analysis. Using this data, AI can then be made to learn which are normal movement and timing patterns of safe operations. This creates an understanding of the normal situation, without needing a lot of human intervention. If the AI detects deviations of the norm, alerts are raised and alternate courses of action can be proposed. Prediction capacities could also be included in the future. The resulting capability would be an AI-driven tool which can observe current operations and propose alternatives as required by the operational circumstances.\u00a0 \"We are very pleased to receive EDA\u2019s Defence Innovation Prize. epic.blue\u2019s mission is to ensure the safety, security and effectiveness of field teams.

Moderated by EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq, the debate showed a common understanding on the fact that all EU Member States' armed forces have a lot to gain from enhanced defence cooperation and a more coherent and integrated capability planning and development framework in Europe, both in terms of efficiency (cost savings) and interoperability. \"We lack efficiency and could be much more effective and save money if we worked closer together\", said Minister Bausch. All the required tools for moving into that direction are now in place with the revised Capability Development Plan (CDP), the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD), the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the European Defence Fund (EDF), \"but the crucial task laying ahead of us now is to create a smooth and efficient workflow among them\", including with the European Commission's new DG on Defence Industry & Space, \"and to implement and use them in the right way\", said Minister Starlinger. Three aspects are particularly important in this respect, the Austrian Defence Minister added: first, that Member States remain in the driving seat when it comes to prioritisation of the defence capabilities needed; second, that we don't reinvent the wheel and, instead, use the tools, processes and assets we have already in place; and third, that we ensure there is coherence among the various EU defence initiatives and the actors driving them. Portuguese Minister Gomes Cravinho thought that the successful setting up of CARD, PESCO and the EDF showed that the EU was \"on the right track\" at a technical level.On the political level, however, more needs to be done to move towards a more common defence policy in Europe, he stressed. The need for progress on the political level, especially with a view to shaping a common defence policy, was highlighted by all participants. Things are moving into the right direction with the new EU tools which show that, in the capability domain, \"we are going from a national, industrial driven process to a multilateral, European approach\", said Minister Starlinger. The three Ministers also agreed that EU defence cooperation was in no way directed against NATO,\"which will remain the cornerstone of our collective defence\"\u00a0as Minister Bausch put it, but that, on the contrary, a stronger European defence will also strengthen NATO. \"NATO's efficiency will also rely on how successfully EU countries can strengthen their respective defences\", said the Luxembourg Minister. Asked what the most urgent next steps would be in order to move the Europe of Defence forward, the three Ministers agreed once more: it is the need to develop a common defence policy in Europe which goes beyond purely national interests, \"because no country alone can face the new challenges ahead of us\".\u00a0 \u00a0 More information: Welcome speech by EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq Speech by Michel Barnier (European Commission Chief Negotiator) Speech by General Claudio Graziano, Chairman of EU Military Committee ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/11/28/annual-conference-ministers-join-high-level-debate-on-future-of-eu-defence"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0043", "date": "2019-11-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Helicopter Tactics Symposium drew lessons from past operations", "text": " Around 50 helicopter tactics specialists from 11 EDA participating Member States as well as representatives of the Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC), the Joint Air Power Competence Centre (JAPCC), and European Helicopter industry met recently in the Air Manoeuvre, Training and Exercise Centre (AMTEC) situated in Celle, Germany, for the 10th Helicopter Tactics Symposium, organised under the EDA\u2019s Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP).\u00a0 \u00a0 Participants of the Helicopter Tactics Symposium \u00a0 This annual event proved once more to be a unique occasion for European helicopter crews to discuss and share expertise and best practices related to helicopter tactics and to learn about\u00a0 training opportunities under the Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP).

Addressing a 400-strong audience representing the whole European defence spectrum - governments, armed forces, industry, EU institutions, NATO, think tanks and media - Ms Mogherini said she had been honored to lead EDA over the past five years. She recalled the first steps and the \"shared goal\"\u00a0 set at the time, namely to make European cooperation the norm \u2013 not the exception \u2013 on defence matters. \"And we took the commitment to stubbornly work on this path\", she said in her message to the audience.\u00a0 \u00a0 Federica Mogherini: \"European defence cooperation has expanded like never before\" Devoting this year's Annual Conference to taking stock of what has been achieved since then, especially with the new EU defence initiatives - revised Capability Development Plan (CDP), Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD), Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), European Defence Fund (EDF) - proved a good choice because during that short timeframe, \"European defence cooperation has expanded like never before\u201d, Ms Mogherini said.\u00a0\u00a0\"Five years ago, no one imagined how far we would have come. But we made it (...) And the Agency has been at the core of our work and of all the progress we have achieved together\". Importantly, all this impressive work has been done while strengthening cooperation with NATO, \"because a stronger European Union makes NATO stronger\", Ms Mogherini said. EDA made \"essential contributions to crafting these initiatives all along the way, and now plays a central role in their implementation\", the Head of the Agency stressed. \"The Agency is the secretariat for both CARD and PESCO, together with the European External Action Service and the EU Military Staff. It is also a central operator for EU-funded defence activities. The Agency is today in a unique position to contribute to coherence among the various initiatives, efficiency and a steady focus on our capability priorities\". She also insisted on the importance of ensuring a good and efficient cooperation between the EU institutions and bodies involved (EDA, EEAS, Commission, Council) but also with the Member Stares. \"This will be even more crucial in the years ahead, to make the most of all the tools we have set up together\", Ms Mogherini concluded. \u00a0 Michel Barnier: \"We want the UK to be our closest an most strategic partner in security and defence\" Ms Mogherini\u2019s intervention was followed by a keynote speech delivered by Michel Barnier, the European Commission\u2019s Chief Negotiator, Head of the Task Force for Relations with the United Kingdom and former chair of the 2002 European Convention\u2019s Working Group on Defence which laid the foundation for the creation of EDA. Brexit is an immense challenge and will have consequences, sometimes underestimated ones, on our citizens and businesses, including our defence industries, Mr Barnier said. This has to be dealt with in an \"international context which is more challenging than ever with instability becoming the new norm\", he stated. Against that backdrop, \"Europe must be the shaper of a better global order\", and in order to do that, \"Europe must upgrade its cooperation if it wants to uphold its values\". The UK must be integral part of this endeavor because even if it leaves the European Union, it will not leave Europe, Mr Barnier said.Therefore, the EU wants the \"closest possible partnership\" with the United Kingdom, also in foreign and security policy, including to build cutting-edge defence capabilities and interoperability among our Armed Forces. \"Cooperation is Europe's DNA. Therefore, we want the UK to be our closest and most strategic partner\", as a member of NATO and as a member of our \"European family of Security and Defence\"\u00a0, stated Mr Barnier. \u00a0 Jorge Domecq: \u201cWe need a complete change of mindset\u201d\u00a0 Previously, in his welcome speech, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq had recalled the huge progress EU defence cooperation has made over the past three years, as well as the role EDA plays in the implementation of all new EU defence tools. \u201cEven though much has been achieved over the last years, even more needs to be done. If we want EU defence initiatives to lead towards a more coherent and integrated European defence landscape with a more capable, deployable, interoperable and sustainable set of military capabilities and forces that are able to deliver on these strategic priorities, we need sustained efforts and unfaltering political commitment\u201d, he said.\u00a0 A key factor for success of the new EU defence initiatives\u2019 success will be the extent to which Member States will actually use and embed the new cooperation tools into their national defence planning processes, Mr Domecq stressed. \u201cThis is certainly not an easy task. In my discussions in capitals I have seen that embedding the EU defence initiatives into national processes not only puts a burden on financial and human resources but it also requires a complete change of mindset, sometimes even a change of culture\u201d. \u00a0 More information: Welcome speech by EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq Speech by Michel Barnier (European Commission Chief Negotiator) Speech by General Claudio Graziano, Chairman of EU Military Committee Speech by NATO ASG Camille Grand ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/11/28/annual-conference-takes-stock-of-eu-defence-initiatives-and-looks-ahead"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0045", "date": "2019-11-21", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Largest EU funded defence research project tested in the Mediterranean Sea", "text": " Today, the OCEAN2020 project, managed by a 42 partner consortium from 15 EU countries, has successfully launched its first sea demonstration in the Gulf of Taranto, Italy. The OCEAN2020 Live Sea Demonstration involves a total of 9 unmanned assets and six naval units from Italy, Spain, Greece and France. The deployment of manned and unmanned systems, when integrated with satellite and communication networks, aims to enhance overall maritime situational awareness and build a comprehensive picture of developing situations for military decision-makers.\u00a0\u00a0 Pierre Delsaux, Deputy Director General, DG GROW - European Commission, said, \u201cToday Ocean 2020 is demonstrating its technical achievements, but also that joint research and development at the EU level works. With the preparatory action on defence research we started small. But it helped us to gain valuable experience for the fully-fledged European Defence Fund in place in 2021 to further strengthen the competitiveness of our defence industries.\u201d\u00a0 Led by Leonardo, the OCEAN2020 (Open Cooperation for European mAritime awareNess) maritime initiative brings together technical specialists in the maritime domain covering the observing, orienting, deciding and acting operational tasks. In the Mediterranean Sea Demonstration, OCEAN2020 brings together data and information from a variety of sources; 9 unmanned assets \u2013 four aircraft, three surface and two underwater, six naval units, five satellites for communication and surveillance, four National Maritime Operations Centres (MOC), two ground communication networks and a prototype of a European Maritime Operations Centre (EU MOC) to build a comprehensive maritime picture. The two-day live demonstration is the latest phase in the ambitious project which aims to demonstrate enhanced situational awareness in a maritime environment through the integration of legacy and new technologies for unmanned systems.\u00a0 OCEAN2020 aims to achieve operational and technical objectives, these range from enhanced situational awareness, autonomy, cost effectiveness and increased interoperability for joint missions also using protocols compatible with NATO standards. The variety of assets involved in OCEAN2020 highlights how collaborative autonomy between multi-domain unmanned vehicles can provide a force multiplier. Giovanni Soccodato, Chief Strategic Equity Officer at Leonardo, speaking on behalf of OCEAN2020 Consortium, said: \u201cOCEAN2020 is an incredibly ambitious project. To deliver it, we are bringing together a pan-European team of experts, each of which is contributing its own area of world-class capabilities. Operationally, this project is important demonstrating the possibility to enhance maritime surveillance \u2013 of vital interest to European defence \u2013 integrating unmanned platforms with traditional systems.

The aim of the Cyber R&T AHWG was to analyse emerging new cyber defence technologies with a twofold objective: firstly to get feedback from participants as regards the development of future technology roadmaps; and secondly to review the updated Cyber Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) and ensure it is complete. The EDA Cyber R&T AHWG is composed of cyber defence research experts and cyber specialists coming from participating Member States, industry and academia. Their task is to develop and update the cyber defence SRA within EDA\u2019s Overarching Strategic Research Agenda (OSRA) framework. Since its establishment in 2016, the Cyber R&T AHWG has promoted EU collaborative research projects on cyber defence including work on emerging technologies with cyber implications. During its mandate, the working group has provided expertise for two ongoing EDA Cat B projects notably on \u201cCyber Situation Awareness Packages\u201d and on \u201cEnhanced Malware detection\u201d. The Cyber Technology Landscaping Study - commissioned by EDA in 2018 and awarded to ISDEFE, AIT and CEIS \u2013 analyses the implementation aspects of the SRA and provides additional inputs which complement the findings on the state-of-the-art technology and related cyber threats. At the second workshop devoted to innovation, which is part of the OSRA value chain and toolbox, participants discussed cross-cutting cyber defence aspects related to land, maritime, air and space domains as well as modelling and simulation in order to develop new ideas that have the potential to increase cyber defence effectiveness and efficiency. One of the objectives here was to identify potential new projects to be launched in a longer capability perspective, up to 2028.\u00a0 Both events took place in Madrid at INDRA and ISDEFE premises respectively.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Background In November 2018, the European Council adopted an updated version of the EU cyber defence policy framework (CDPF) which calls for considering cyber defence issues in the calls of the Preparatory Action on Defence Research and in the topics called for in the European Defence Fund. Cyber R&T\u2019s primary focus is to reduce risks when addressing future military capabilities. Researchers in this field are encouraged to explore new avenues because of its novelty and the likelihood of getting quick applications. The military is taking steps towards a better understanding of the implication of recognising cyberspace as an operational domain. Therefore, mature solutions shall always count on well-structured research, development and testing\u00a0 prior to fielding. Cyber R&T is one important work strand of the Capability Development Priority \u201cEnabling capabilities for cyber responsive operations\u201d. The OSRA - which provides a necessary link between R&T efforts and the military tasks and long-term capability needs of the Capability Development Plan (CDP) -\u00a0 identified a number of Research and Technology areas, the so-called Technology Building Blocks (TBBs), in which a cooperative approach at the European level would bring an added-value to support the development of defence capabilities. The Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) on Cyber Defence developed within the relevant EDA Ad Hoc Working Group in compliance with OSRA requirements provides informed prioritisation on cyber-related technologies necessary for the military, while at the same time identifying opportunities for dual-use efforts and investments - be it in national, multinational or EU-funded contexts.\u00a0 \u00a0 More information: Cyber defence (EDA factsheet) ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/11/12/cyber-defence-r-t-working-group-boosts-innovation"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0049", "date": "2019-11-12", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA to take forward PESCO project on CBRN surveillance", "text": " Today, the European Defence Agency (EDA) has for the first time been chosen to support the development of a PESCO project as an Agency initiative, in line with the PESCO commitment to use EDA as the European forum for project capability development. The Austrian-lead project, CBRN Surveillance as a Service (CBRN SaaS), will provide a rapidly deployable 24/7 chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) surveillance capability. The project aims to maximise the use of unmanned ground systems and aerial drones which will be equipped with a variety of sensors to deliver a real time CBRN surveillance, detection and incident management capability for both civilian and military purposes.\u00a0 CBRN SaaS involves four contributing Member States (cMS), Austria (lead), Croatia, Hungary and Slovenia. Following a request from the project lead, on behalf of the cMS, CBRN SaaS will be taken forward as an EDA project. The transfer was formalised today during a signing ceremony in the margins of the EDA Steering Board. Speaking at the event, Thomas Starlinger, Minister of Defence of Austria said, \u201cCBRN SaaS will be designed for use in the military and civilian domain. For the Austrian Armed Forces it constitutes another means to increase force protection for operations in Austria as well as abroad. National project partners may also benefit since the project will most probably be eligible for funding from the European Defence Industrial Development Programme. Through this, Small and Medium Sized Enterprises and Research Institutes will profit through a financial return from the EU.\u201d The high strategic value of assets that provide 24/7 CBRN surveillance is proven by their ability to survey critical infrastructure and borders, augment situational awareness and support not only\u00a0 military commanders but also national disaster management in dealing with CBRN incidents. CBRN SaaS will establish an unmanned sensor network consisting of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and Unmanned Ground Systems (UGS) that will be interoperable with legacy systems. When combined with communications and data networks it will deliver a Recognised CBRN Picture that enhances knowledge-based decision making by leaders and supports the mission of saving lives. In focusing on the deployment of unmanned systems, operational flexibility will be increased and reduces the risk to the operators.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cEDA is delighted to take this project forward and support our Member States. CBRN SaaS will benefit from EDA\u2019s extensive experience of delivering defence cooperation projects, especially the insights gained from the EDA CBRN Joint Investment Programme. CBRN agents and weapons are a source of great concern, effective surveillance is therefore a crucial capability. As endorsed by the EU\u2019s Capability Development Plan, developing enhanced CBRN capabilities based on newly available technologies such as unmanned systems is a priority that will enhance Europe\u2019s resilience and preparedness to deal with CBRN threats.\u201d EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq commented. The CBRN SaaS main deliverable will be an operational plugin module for widely varying civilian missions and CSDP or NATO military operations. As a capability and technology development project, CBRN SaaS aims to provide suitable mobility (e.g. aerial, ground, unmanned) to mount CBRN sensors that will collect and send data to be processed through a secure network to the decision maker. In addition, the generated Recognised CBRN Picture can be offered as a power by the hour service to others in need of CBRN surveillance. The project will run until 2022, and will mainly deliver a demonstrator that provides a proof of concept; a Cooperation Roadmap which identifies what future modules could be developed in what format and with whom; a concept of operations and a service availability concept.\u00a0 \u00a0 Background CBRN SaaS was approved and initially launched as a PESCO project within the second batch on 19 November 2018.

The ESSOR project will provide a secure military communications system, improving voice and data communication between Member States\u2019 Armed Forces on a variety of platforms. In addition, it will deliver guidelines related to the validation and verification of waveform portability and platform re-configurability, setting up a common security basis to increase interoperability between the forces. By ensuring that military radios are fully accessible, shared and used by all Member States, the effectiveness of joint operations can be increased substantially.\u00a0 To that end, the Member States participating in the ESSOR project - Belgium, Germany, Spain, Finland, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Portugal (with Estonia and Ireland as observers) - have moved forward to implement a common architecture analysis of software radios in Europe.\u00a0 The ESSOR project activities are currently performed by the consortium A4ESSOR through a contract managed by OCCAr.\u00a0 A4ESSOR is a joint-venture of the following companies: Thales (FR), Leonardo (IT), Indra (SP), Radmor (PL), Bittium (FI) and soon Rohde & Schwarz (DE).\u00a0 The ESSOR PESCO project presents exceptional technological characteristics: it is based on the state-of-the-art technology in the radio field, and it aims at developing the most advanced concepts and solutions for communications applicable to several waveform layers.

The CONOPS aims at describing the operational needs, visions and expectations of the operational users (from tactical level to component command) on the new waveforms to be developed in the context of the PESCO ESSOR project. It analyses operational scenarios using vignettes and identifies categories of architectural information which are further developed into operational requirements and technical requirements.

The event, co-organised by the Finnish MoD and EDA, was attended and supported by experts from several contributing countries (Finland, Estonia, Sweden, Latvia) as well as the European Space Agency (ESA).\u00a0 Two and a half years after the launch of the Cyber Ranges Federation project (the first ever cyber defence pooling & sharing project initiated by the Agency), the objective of the live demonstration was to showcase the practical implications and benefits of connecting and jointly using Member States\u2019 cyber ranges in order to improve and expand each one\u2019s cyber training capabilities. The event allowed participants to witness first-hand what the project aims to achieve and how it has already enhanced the cyber expertise and skills of each of the contributing Member States.\u00a0 Practically speaking, the event consisted of a live fire exercise, based on a fictive but realistic training scenario, in which one team had to respond to and defend itself against cyber attacks from another. The exercise used SD-WAN technology as the backbone network technology. The participating national cyber ranges as well as the European Space Agency\u2019s were all interconnected and interacting in real time, with and each of them having its own particular role to play in the exercise. The demonstration event was part of the \u2018European Union\u2019s combined Cyber and Hybrid Week\u2019 which is currently being held in Helsinki under the auspices of the Finnish EU Presidency. The aim of the week is to create synergies by combining three independent events: EDA\u2019s Project Team Cyber Meeting (5-6 November), EDA\u2019s Cyber Ranges Demo Event (6 November) and the Cyber Power in Hybrid Warfare-symposium organised by the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats (7-8 November). \u201cFinland, as an active player in Cyber domain, has been honoured to be in the lead of this project since Sept 2018. Finalizing challenging project is always a result of good and fruitful cooperation \u2013 in this case between 11 contributing member states. It\u00b4s very significant to continue developing just established Cyber Ranges Federation platform in the future\u201d, said Jukka Juusti, Permanent Secretary of Finnish Ministry of Defence. \u201cThere isn\u2019t probably a domain from which more new security threats are emerging than from cyber. Therefore, stepping up our common cyber defence is a matter of priority and urgency, as it is also reflected in the revised European Capability Development Priorities approved last year. By pooling and sharing their national cyber ranges, participating Member States will be able to improve their joint training conditions and, as a result, strengthen their cyber resilience. This successful exercise has shown that we are on the right path\u201d, said Jorge Domecq, EDA\u2019s Chief Executive.\u00a0 \u201cIt is now well ascertained that space systems play a crucial role in the security, wellbeing and economic success of Europe. Protecting space assets from cyber threats is therefore a key priority and technological challenge. ESA has a duty to protect its Member States\u2019 investments in space. Today we witnessed a successful demonstration of the ESA-EDA partnership. A partnership that will continue to be instrumental in increasing Europe\u2019s cyber resilience, namely through strengthening cyber response skills and capabilities in ESA. Todays` significant exercise illustrates our existing cyber resilience capabilities located in the European Space Security and Education Centre in Belgium. Cyber threats are constantly evolving. We must therefore maintain and strengthen our capabilities and have made the necessary funding proposals to the Council at Ministerial level to be held in late November. The vitality of our cooperation with EDA and its Member States will continue to play an important role in the future. This is therefore but a beginning, as we are currently considering the creation of a Joint ESA-EDA Cyber Resilience Task Force to further explore cooperation avenues, including with other European partners,\u201d added Jan Woerner, ESA\u2019s Director General. \u00a0 Background The aim of EDA\u2019s Cyber Ranges Federation project is to develop a more sophisticated and powerful platform for cyber training purposes connecting Member States\u00b4 national Cyber Ranges to one another and enabling other countries, which don\u2019t have their cyber ranges, to train and improve their cyber defence skills nevertheless. A European federation of cyber ranges, i.e. the availability of mutually accessible cyber defence training and exercise ranges, may in the future leverage other benefits, such as cyber research ranges and cyber simulation & test ranges. \u00a0 Contacts: Finnish MoD spokesperson: harri.reini@defmin.fi EDA spokesperson: elisabeth.schoeffmann@eda.europa.eu ESA spokesperson: florent.mazurelle@esa.int ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/11/07/eda-cyber-ranges-federation-project-showcased-at-demo-exercise-in-finland"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0055", "date": "2019-10-17", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Joint EDA-NATO AAR conference focused on interoperability", "text": " A joint EDA-NATO Air-to-Air Refuelling (AAR) Conference, the first of its kind in this format, was opened this morning by the Dutch Minister of Defence, Ank Bijleveld (who spoke via video message), NATO\u2019s Assistant Secretary General for Defence Investment, Camille Grand, and EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq. It followed a successful first European AAR conference organised by EDA last year. The event, moderated by the Chairman of the Aerial Refuelling Systems Advisory Group (ARSAG), General John Sams, brought together key decision-makers from the EU and NATO as well as the wider transatlantic and international AAR community, including industry, to discuss current and future challenges and coordinate efforts in this important domain. Among the high-level speakers of the conference were notably Major General Laurent Marboeuf, the commander of the European Air Transport Command (EATC), Major General Jose Maria Juanas from the Spanish Air Force, Colonel Juergen Wallwei from the German Military Aviation Authority and Dave Benson from the US Air Force Aerial Refueling Certification Agency (ARCA).\u00a0The list of all speakers is available in the conference agenda at https://aarconference.org/agenda. A special focus was put on ways and means to enhance euro-atlantic AAR interoperability. Throughout the day,\u00a0 the topic was presented, discussed and analysed in various sessions dealing with different aspects, from the optimisation of existing capabilities and the development of new capabilities to the operational and industrial implications of it. In his opening speech, Jorge Domecq praised the good cooperation between EDA, NATO and ARSAG in such crucial a domain than air-to-air refuelling. \u201cThis is yet another testimony of pragmatic cooperation, to ensure complementarity of efforts and avoid unnecessary duplications, as called for by the EU-NATO Joint Declaration\u201d, Mr Domecq said.\u00a0\u00a0 Over recent years, important progress has been made in order to mitigate the important capability gap Europe still has in the field of AAR (establishment of a Multinational MRTT Fleet, AAR exercises organised by the European Air Transport Command, gradual entrance into service of the A440M, successful clearance campaigns between A400M tankers and various receivers, etc.), \u201cbut it is not sufficient\u201d, the EDA Chief Executive stressed: \u201cWhat we really need is to ensure that the AAR shortfall, like capability gaps in other areas, is addressed in a more systematic way\u201d. Therefore, the fact that AAR was reconfirmed as one of the EU Capability Development Priorities (it is embedded in the wider Air Superiority priority) which were approved by EU Member States in 2018, in full complementarity with NATO\u2019s NDPP, will enable the continuation of this effort.\u00a0 Work is now underway to implement the priorities, including the AAR related one, through Strategic Context Cases (SCCs).\u00a0 \u00a0 Challenges in the short, medium and long term \u201cIn the short-term, the main challenge is to optimise the use of the existing AAR assets available in Europe, and we can do that through, for example, increased participation in annual European AAR Training (EART). But we can also increase interoperability by increasing AAR clearances - because a tanker without a clearance is not a tanker\u201d, said Mr Domecq who also stressed that the certification of AAR is clearly an airworthiness aspect. In this respect, he welcomed that airworthiness authorities in the AAR field now realise and agree on the fact that \u201cthe technical assessment of an AAR clearance is their responsibility\u201d. In the medium-term, the challenge is to cover the peak demand in AAR during the initial phase of an operation or conflict when air superiority is not yet assured, for instance by expanding the MMF fleet. \u201cEDA stands ready to assist interested Member States in the process to explore their potential participation in this important project\u201d, Mr Domecq said.\u00a0 And finally, in the longer term, the challenge is to close the remaining capability gap, both in strategic and tactical AAR, including by developing automated/autonomous air to air refuelling systems (A3R) as a useful complement to manned AAR capabilities. \u201cIt is evident that the future of AAR will be automated\u201d.\u00a0 EDA will organise a workshop on 28 January 2020 to bring together Member States and industry to discuss the way ahead on this topic. \u00a0 More information:\u00a0 AAR Conference paper Speech by EDA Chief executive Jorge Domecq Video message by Dutch Minister of Defence Ank Bijleveld Speech by NATO Assistant SG for Defence Investment, Camille Grand \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/10/17/joint-eda-nato-aar-conference-focused-on-interoperability"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0056", "date": "2019-10-10", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "First Defence Energy Managers\u2019 Course completed", "text": " After a test run in 2018, EDA has now completed the first fully-fletched Defence Energy Managers\u2019 Course (DEMC)\u00a0 in which participated a total of 17 students from eight EDA Member States.

Common airworthiness approaches and standards are viewed as critical enablers for enhanced European defence cooperation.\u00a0\u00a0 Over the two days, four main topics are being addressed through specific sessions: i) the impact of European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) on military aviation; ii) opportunities and challenges related to that; iii) lessons learned from EMARs implementation so far; iv) and the experiences made by third-party stakeholders. \u00a0 Good progress made over past 10 years In his opening speech, EDA Deputy Chief Olli Ruutu thanked the Lithuanian Armed Forces for hosting the event and for their strong interest in the work of the Military Airworthiness Authorities (MAWA) Forum and the harmonisation of airworthiness approaches.\u00a0\u00a0 Since work started ten years ago on the harmonisation of airworthiness approaches in Europe, much has been achieved, Mr Ruutu said.\u00a0 \u201cThe majority of EDA participating Member States have already implemented or are in the process of implementing European Military Airworthiness Requirements in their national regulations. But as you all are aware, the implementation of EMARs is not only about translating them in regulations but also about turning them into practice. And that makes EMAR implementation the most important phase in the harmonisation process and crucial for gaining the full benefits\u201d, he stressed. Implementing the EMARs often means a different approach to military airworthiness that requires a change in safety culture, the Deputy Chief Executive stated.\u00a0 Further progress is also required as regards the cooperation between the national military airworthiness authorities in Europe, a topic which is already in the focus of the MAWA Forum.\u00a0 \u201cSince last year when the MAWA Forum adopted a new airworthiness roadmap, the forum has started several activities to develop harmonised practices and procedures with the objective to increase the level of standardisation and cooperation in the area of initial approvals of and oversight over organisations that provide services in the military airworthiness domain\u201d, Mr Ruutu recalled. In parallel, Member States are engaged in mutual recognitions. \u201cAt this stage, 35 active recognitions are already in place between EDA pMS and several recognitions have been concluded with Military Airworthiness Authorities from other countries worldwide.

The final version of the CFM\u2019s Programme Arrangement (PA), negotiated over the past two years, has been sent out this week to Member States for signing. Eleven Member States (Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain) have already declared their firm willingness to sign and to join the CFM in the near future. More countries might join the programme in the coming weeks. The CFM will enter into force when the last country having declared its intention to join will have signed the PA.\u00a0 Developed as a so-called \u2018Category A\u2019 programme of the Agency, the CFM is entirely voluntary. Member States can freely decide if they wish to participate, contribute and support projects. The CFM will be structured in two pillars: the first pillar foresees the European Investment Bank (EIB) as the sole lender through the conclusion of bilateral framework loan agreements between EIB and the interested Member State. To obtain the EIB\u2019s financial support, projects submitted must respect the eligibility requirements set by the Bank lending policy, while the volume of the lending facility and the interest rate applied are negotiated on a case-by-case basis by the EIB and the interested MS and set out under each individual Framework Loan Agreement. The EIB involvement is supported and facilitated by the EDA which will act as the \u2018Facility Agent\u2019 on behalf of EIB under its instructions and responsibility, serving as a primary point of contact between the EIB and the beneficiary country in the technical assessment of the feasibility of each project; the second pillar provides for a State-to-State support facility, structured as a system of reimbursable advances and deferred payments. It can be used to support any defence related project, in full compliance with national and European law. The facility is structured as a set of individual bank accounts which are opened and managed by the EDA under the control of the CFM participating Member States. Within that pillar, any CFM Member can submit a request for financial support to the CFM programme. While the Programme Arrangement provides the overarching legal framework setting the general requirements and conditions for State-to-State support, the specific conditions of each advance will be set out in separate agreements to be concluded between the supporting CFM Member State, the beneficiary country and the EDA, as facilitator. The administrative and operational costs of the CFM will be covered by existing EDA resources meaning CFM members will not have to bear additional costs for the management of the mechanism. Notwithstanding any financial support granted under the CFM, projects or programmes subject to such financial support will remain at all times governed and managed according to their own rules. \u00a0More information: European Defence Agency and European Investment Bank sign cooperation agreement (EDA webnews February 2018) \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/09/26/cooperative-financial-mechanism-(cfm)-ready-for-signing"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0060", "date": "2019-09-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA expands work on autonomous underwater vehicles", "text": " EDA\u2019s Steering Board has just approved the launch of a 4-year CAT B project aimed at developing a swarm of biomimetic underwater vehicles for underwater intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (SABUVIS II). It builds upon previous collaboration carried out under the SABUVIS I project which was completed in 2019. So far, two Member States (Poland, Germany) are contributing to this new project for which a project arrangement is expected to be signed later next year. The new project is important for defence as Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) are being increasingly utilised for a variety of differing tasks in the maritime environment. They represent a viable alternative to the operation of manned platforms and are particularly well suited to the rigours of an inhospitable domain that places a premium on technical advancements.\u00a0 Taking the natural world as its template, this collaborative project seeks to replicate some of the key features of marine life, principally those of propulsion and behaviour, so as to ensure the successful completion of underwater operations. A key feature of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance missions (ISR) for example, is the necessity to undertake these missions covertly, and those systems that are difficult to detect, both visually and audibly, provide the optimum solution.\u00a0 \u00a0 Building on the findings of SABUVIS I This project is a continuation of the successful collaboration enjoyed between Poland, Germany and Portugal in the first SABUVIS project. In this first iteration, three different Biomimetic Underwater Vehicles (BUVs) were constructed with the resulting conclusion that BUVs can be designed with varying degrees of similarity with living organisms. Some of the identified benefits are that undulating propulsion consumes less electrical energy than conventional propulsion systems utilising screw based propellers, and different hydroacoustic signatures are produced with a corresponding lower noise level.\u00a0 This second phase will now expand upon, and investigate further, the swarm aspects with more tightly cooperating vehicles, moving in formations and consisting of vehicles having specific functions or tasks to perform. The project in particular will focus on the lead vehicles, who are responsible for the navigation function.\u00a0 The expected advantages of utilising vehicles in a swarm are reliability and efficiency. Firstly, the swarm system can incorporate redundant elements, essentially extra vehicles, which increases reliability in performing a task \u2013 the loss of one element does not result in the mission being abandoned. Secondly, the distribution of sensors and devices necessary to perform the mission across a number of vehicles makes it possible to reduce the size and complexity of vehicles and thus ensures simpler construction. Technological areas that the project will also focus on are in the area of navigation and principally in GPS denied areas, optical surface coastal navigation systems and new biomimetic drives.\u00a0\u00a0 The principle organisations planned to undertake this project are the Polish Naval Academy and also the Wehrtechnische Dienststelle f\u00fcr Schiffe und Marinewaffen der Bundeswehr, Maritime Technologie und Forschung (WTD 71) in Germany.

The European Defence (EDA) together with 18 of its Member States will now develop the technical arrangement (TA) for the opening of this new advanced tactical helicopter training facility by the end of 2022.\u00a0 Approval for the centre marks the latest milestone in a long line of important helicopter projects managed by the Agency since 2009.\u00a0 EDA currently hosts three collaborative helicopter programmes, which fill a helicopter training capability gap in Europe and are a key component of operational capacity building. The three programmes are aimed at improving European interoperability and increasing standardisation of helicopter aircrews through the adoption of common training activities and the use of common Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs). All tactics are developed refined and tested before being included in the Helicopter Exercise Programme Standard Operating Procedures (HEP SOP). \u00a0 Tactics Courses The Agency\u2019s helicopter work includes a Helicopter Tactics Course (HTC) and a Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC).\u00a0 The first project focusses on improving the tactical ability of crews through an integrated training course of classroom and simulator instruction that is currently conducted at RAF Linton-on-Ouse in the United Kingdom. The HTC provides a solid foundation for whole crew training and was later developed into the Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course, which takes experienced aircrew and further develops their skills in a \u201cTrain the Trainer\u201d course, delivering advanced helicopter tactics and the Helicopter Tactics Instructor (HTI) qualification. The HTIC includes a ground phase delivered in the UK, and a live flying element conducted in Sweden. \u00a0 Helicopter Exercise Programme The third element of EDA\u2019s helicopter activities is the Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP) which brings together multinational helicopter crews and an array of assets (fixed wing, Electronic Warfare, ground troops, Special Forces, etc) in an annual multinational training exercise covering the performance of complex missions in demanding environmental areas. The exercises are conducted under the BLADE banner. The next exercise will be SWIFT BLADE, to be delivered in Belgium and the Netherlands in April 2020. However, EDA does not have the vocation to be a long-term training provider, but rather a catalyst for cooperative training. The Agency launches initiatives that can provide added value to Member States and when these are consolidated and have reached a sufficient level of maturity, the Agency encourages Member States or multinational organisations to take over the administrative and organisational responsibility of the activities, allowing the EDA to free-up resources and focus on developing new initiatives. \u00a0 Multinational Helicopter Training Centre EDA has been successfully managing the three helicopter programmes for over a decade, and during the next five year period, they will progressively be transferred outside EDA to the future Multinational Helicopter Training Centre (MHTC). The MHTC will consist of office space for the technical, administrative and training delivery\u00a0 staff, simulator facilities and a dedicated accommodation block. In addition, it will also develop a more coordinated approach to European helicopter training and will try to harmonise national approaches and drive synergies with NATO doctrine. The concept development phase of the project was concluded in January 2019 and has now gained ministerial approval to develop the legally binding Technical Arrangement (TA), which will define the objectives, benefits, roles and capabilities of the centre together with agreement on budget and manpower allocation.\u00a0 The first MHTC project team meeting will be held at EDA in September with the signature of the Technical Arrangement targeted for the end of 2020. \u00a0 More information Helicopter Initiatives \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/09/06/development-of-multinational-helicopter-training-centre-moves-ahead"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0062", "date": "2019-09-17", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA and EATC further deepen cooperation", "text": " The European Defence Agency (EDA) and the European Air Transport Command (EATC) today established a new cooperation framework - through an exchange of letters - that will further strengthen the ties between the two organisations.\u00a0 The exchange of letters, which took place at the EDA premises in the presence of EATC Commander Major General Laurent Marboeuf and EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq, builds on the already existing, good cooperation between the two following the trilateral Letter of Intent concluded between EDA, EATC and OCCAR-EA in January 2018 and which focused on the joint optimisation and development of the A400M capability within the remit of EATC.\u00a0\u00a0 The letters exchanged today identify new areas for enhanced cooperation between the EDA and EATC, inter alia:\u00a0 Air Mobility\u00a0(including airlift,\u00a0 air-to-air refuelling, aeromedical evacuation, air dropping activity and\u00a0 logistical and technical supporting functions) Fixed-wing training cooperation in the domains listed above Military Aviation (including in the context of the Military Airworthiness Authorities Forum and the progressive introduction of a Total System Approach to Military Aviation) Military Mobility in the framework of the EU action plan (including ground handling and dangerous goods activities) Other cross-cutting activities subject to interactions.

The main topics discussed during the bilateral meetings included the state of play and way forward of the various EU defence initiatives (CARD, PESCO, European Defence Fund) and the implementation of the 2018 EU Capability Development Priorities (CDP). Particular emphasis was put on the need to ensure coherence among the EU defence initiatives and a steady focus on the agreed CDP priorities. The meetings also focused on Slovenia\u2019s participation in EDA projects and programmes. Minister Erjavec and Mr Domecq for example exchanged views on the next steps regarding the RES-HUB (Defence RESilience Hub Network in Europe) project, an innovative Slovenian project proposal on building a renewable energy harvesting and hydrogen (H2) energy storage capability within the EU. The project was elaborated in the context of the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector (CF SEDSS) with the support of EDA. \u201cSlovenia offers our continuous support to the Agency\u2019s role as the forum for prioritisation, project support and interface towards wider EU policies. Of special importance, we see the Agency\u2019s interactions with the European Commission in regard to its role in establishing the European Defence Industrial Development Programme (EDIDP) and European Defence Fund. We also believe that EDA as a part of the PESCO secretariat has been crucial in the development of projects, establishing dialogue between Member States and providing coherence between different defence and security initiatives on the EU level. A project which we will try to facilitate through the EDA format is the project RES-HUB. Further development of this project is essential for us in view of decreasing the carbon footprint in the defence sector. We see this project as a possibility to highlight our efforts during our Presidency in the second half of 2021\u201d, Minister Erjavec said during the meeting. \u201cIt is very important for the European Defence Agency to have a clear idea of what the Slovenian authorities expect from the Agency in this crucial moment of EU defence cooperation. After the successful launch of the different EU defence initiatives, the emphasis is now on the implementation of PESCO and CARD as well as the European Defence Fund. At the same time I welcome Slovenia\u2019s RES-HUB initiative as the project has the potential to contribute to more energy resilient European armed forces, said Mr Domecq.

This lack of interoperability has led to a severe shortage in ships and rescue divers which are indispensable assets in every national or international naval operation. To enable cooperation and enhance interoperability among Member States' military diving squads, EDA\u2019s Project Team Naval Training launched a \u2018Naval Training Support Study\u2019 (NTSS) in 2012, focused on three aspects: navigation training, naval mine warfare, and diving training. The aim of this study, the results of which were presented in 2014, was to provide a landscape of existing capabilities, propose possible common requirements, derive shortfalls based on a gap analysis, and propose recommendations to solve them. As regards Diving Training, the study made several recommendations, including to establish a doctrine concerning military diving (starting with air/ship diver), to establish a shared diving regulation to meet the operational needs, to standardise training & operational qualification criteria and to have a common certification process for diving centres. A follow-up to the NTSS study (phase 2) was commissioned in 2017 and completed in December 2017. It delivered, among others, a comprehensive set of data and analyses of Member States\u2019 national diving standards, a common requirements list for ship divers and minimum qualification standards for military divers. The results were presented to EDA\u2019s Project Team Naval Training in January 2018. Based on the extended NTSS study and the conclusions of a diving workshop held in La Spezia (Italy) in September 2017, EDA launched a new project in spring 2018 in order to design and conduct a course module to harmonise European ship diving and ship-based rescue diving standards and practices. The overall objective is the identification, recognition and mutual certification of common EU military diving standards. \u00a0 Showcase event held in Toulon As part of that ongoing project, and in order to test and confirm the practical implications involved in joint diving training and operation, an EDA \u2018showcase event\u2019 was held on 3 April 2019 in the harbour of St.Mandrier, near Toulon (France). Four diving teams from Germany, Spain, Poland and Romania participated in this exercise, as well as high ranking naval officers from Bulgaria, France, Germany, Spain, Ireland, Poland and Romania. The aim was to conduct joint interventions under real conditions based on realistic naval incident scenarios and to demonstrate how the proposed common standards would successfully work in practice. As an example: Romanian and Polish divers worked hand in hand to recover an anchor while Spanish and a German diving team jointly inspected a Frigate\u2019s hull and performed repair work on a pier using heavy underwater welding equipment. The practical part of the event was complemented by a static display of different equipment and procedures ashore.

The meeting allowed participants to have an informal high-level exchange of views between the main civil and military actors involved in this domain, with a particular focus on the challenges and opportunities for civil and military collaboration in on Single European Sky.\u00a0 One of the operational conclusions of the meeting was that the ESMAB agreed to support the document \u201cU-Space, Drones and Military Low-Level Flights\u201d including its annex \u201cOperations for traffic below 500ft AGL: a Military view\u201d and to use this document at national and EU level, as a basis to increase awareness of and support for the interests of military aviation in the framework of U-Space developments. This document will be updated as a living document on a regular basis considering other aspects enlarging the scope of the analysis. The Board also welcomed the EDA-EASA guidelines for the accommodation of military instruments flight rules (IFR) for MALE RPAS under GAT (airspace classes A-C) outside segregated airspace and agreed to use the guidelines as a reference for the accommodation of MALE-type RPAS within the European airspace.. Regarding Higher Airspace Operations, the ESMAB agreed to Support the European Defence Agency activities to monitor the work led by EASA as regard the regulatory framework and the work led by SESAR Joint Undertaking and EUROCONTROL as regards the concept of operations for Higher Airspace. The ESMAB management was also tasked, with the support of EDA, to further investigate the need to establish of a working group involving Member States representatives, as well as representatives of relevant civil and military organisations (NATO, ECTL, EASA, ICAO, etc.) with the objective to together address the cyber security challenges for the air domain, and to revert to the ESMAB (policy level) with a proposal. The next policy level meeting of the ESMAB is scheduled for end of January 2020. \u00a0 Background An EDA SES Military Aviation Board (ESMAB) was created by the European Defence Agency Steering Board on 30 September 2015. Ever since, ESMAB meets at two level : - management/expert level and executive/policy level. Rules and regulations of the civilian world can have an important impact on the military. Consequently, EDA is now recognised as the interface between Member States, EU institutions and agencies. A prominent example is the impact the Single European Sky and its related regulations have on the military. EDA, in its role of interface and facilitator of the coordination of military views is making the military voices heard in this important modernisation process through its successful cooperation with the European Commission, Eurocontrol, and other key EU bodies and agencies involved in SES. This is also achieved thanks to EDA participating Member States\u2019 commitment to the ESMAB which held its first meeting in May 2016. \u00a0 More information:\u00a0 EDA in Single European Sky (project page) The Military In SES / SESAR \u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/07/02/esmab-meeting-focussed-on-civil-military-collaboration-in-single-european-sky"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0072", "date": "2019-07-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Cyber defence organisations met at EDA", "text": " Senior officials of the four organisations signatories of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), the European Defence Agency (EDA), the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) and the Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU Institutions, Bodies and Agencies (CERT-EU) met today at the EDA premises. The purpose of the meeting was to update each other on relevant developments and to assess the progress made so far in the implementation of the MoU. The Memorandum, signed in May 2018, provides a framework for cooperation through which the four organisations can leverage synergies\u00a0 in order to achieve a safe and open cyberspace and to promote civil & military synergies.\u00a0 Significant progress has been achieved since the MoU entered into effect in June 2018, notably a continuous exchange of views on top cybersecurity aspects (including policy, technical, operational items), reciprocal participation to events and a better understanding by respective staff of how the four organisations can work together.. The collaboration roadmap prepared by the MoU working group, which contains concrete activities and deliverables scheduled throughout 2019, has been reflected in the signatories' respective work programmes, ensuring improved coherence. The main focus of the roadmap is on training and cyber exercises, building on the cooperation capacity and the improved exchange of information on respective projects and events. The aim is to complement the respective work of the four partners and avoid duplication of efforts, also taking into account broader EU initiatives in the cyber domain.\u00a0 \u00a0 As part of the cooperation, the four partners are planning to organise another major event in the second part of 2020.

The initiative is designed to compare test results obtained in different Member States laboratories working on ammunition safety. These multinational tests, organised on a yearly basis under the auspices of EDA, are a central tool established by the European Network of National Safety authorities on Ammunition (ENNSA) whose objective is to enhance cooperation and interoperability between national authorities in charge of ammunition safety.\u00a0 In a Round Robin Test (RTT), the results of different laboratories are all considered to be at the same level of quality: the intent is thus not to verify the accuracy of the results obtained from each and every laboratory by comparing them with the reference exact result, but rather to verify the dispersion of the data and the possibility of using a certain standard to obtain reliable results (within a certain range of errors considered tolerable), under different conditions. Therefore, what is evaluated in an RRT is the standard itself, not the performance of the laboratories. A successful RRT provides the assurance that the standard used is suitable to generate \u2018reproducible\u2019 results. A failed test, on the other hand, can help to highlight the need to amend and/or supplement the standard. Focus on Energetic Materials This year\u2019s RRT is focused on the characterization of Energetic Materials, which are key components of any kind of ammunition, and more specifically on propellants (single-base nitrocellulose) and high explosives (HMX). All nine participating laboratories will soon receive samples from the same explosive batch and will be required to perform identical tests, all referring to explosive sensitivity and thermal stability, in particular: impact sensitivity, friction sensitivity, Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Heat Flow Calorimetry (HFC), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). The test is led by one of the most experienced European laboratories in this field, the Polish Laboratory of Combat Assets Testing of the Military Institute of Armament Technology (MIAT), located in Zielonka, near Warsaw. Coordinator of this test is Agata Kamie\u0144ska-Duda, Head of MIAT\u2019S Ammunition Test Laboratory. \u00a0 Room for improvement Bogdan Krysi\u0144ski, the current chairman of ENNSA, is responsible in MIAT for testing ammunition after long-term storage. He insists on the substantial added value provided by the annual Round Robin Tests initiative but also believes it could be further improved.\u00a0 \u201cThe RRT initiative is very valuable in many aspects. First of all, it allows everybody to compare research capabilities among the institutes and exchange experience among the researchers. However, it would be wrong to claim this is enough. Science never stops. Better methods of ammunition performance should be continuously sought for in order to provide a more precise assessment of its safety and operational reliability\u201d, he commented.\u00a0 \u201cFor many types of ammunition and their components it will be probably necessary to introduce a broader scope of testing than that used within the current RRT. Another issue is the need to develop unambiguous templates of documents for the preparation of the tests, as well as for the recording and reporting of the test results. Recent experiences confirm the importance of this. Continuous improvement of the Round Robin Test programme is thus something we should keep in mind for the benefit of all\u201d, he stated. \u00a0 Background In 2010 the EDA Steering Board approved the establishment of the European Network of National Safety authorities on Ammunition (ENNSA) with the primary task to facilitate communication among the national bodies which are in charge of ammunition safety. The focus of ENNSA, as agreed by its members, was to explore the harmonisation of ammunition qualification to improve interoperability and increase cooperation among Member States, in parallel with achieving savings across the ammunition production/procurement cycle. One of the basic tools designed for this purpose is the Round Robin Test (RRT) programme.\u00a0 It serves to compare and validate test results obtained in different laboratories of the Member States working within the area of ammunition safety. \u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/07/05/new-round-robin-test-launched-to-enhance-ammunition-safety-standards"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0074", "date": "2019-06-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Strategic Context Cases approved for implementation of EU Capability Development Priorities", "text": " EDA\u2019s Steering Board in Capability Directors composition today endorsed the first edition of the Strategic Context Cases (SCC) which will guide the practical implementation of the 11 EU Capability Development Priorities approved by EDA Member States in June 2018. The SCC should ensure the priorities are implemented in a way that improves the coherence of the European capability landscape and leads to cooperative projects which contribute to close identified capability shortfalls. The 11 SCC \u2013 one for every priority agreed last year (*) \u2013 describe in concrete terms what the current capability situation is, including the activities planned or already ongoing at national and/or multinational level in order to address the shortfalls. The outcomes of the NATO Defence Planning Process and the activities undertaken in the context of the Framework Nations Concept (FNC) are also taken into account in order to ensure coherence of output and avoid unnecessary duplication. The SCC highlight in particular the major challenges to the coherence of the European capability landscape in each of these areas in the short, medium and long term. \u201cWe all know that there are pressing capability challenges across the whole spectrum. For example, there is a growing threat from the use of mini-drones to our military forces\u201d, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq commented. \u201cThe SCC will provide concrete and tangible gains across the Member States in addressing this issue in the short, medium and long term\u201d. They also provide guidance to address these challenges by offering \u2018avenues of approach\u2019 for potential cooperation between participating Member States that could help achieve the priorities and improve the coherence of the European capability landscape. The SCC are integrating documents: each of them also reflects the R&T priorities identified in the Overarching Strategic Research Agenda (OSRA) and related R&T activities linked to each capability priority. Cross references of the SCC to the Key Strategic Activities (KSA) which are considered important for the implementation of the priority such as technologies, skills and industrial manufacturing capacities will be added once the KSA reports are approved by the Steering Board. To prepare the SCC, EDA worked closely with Member States, the EU Military Committee (EUMC), the EU Military Staff (EUMS) and European industry which was consulted to collect their views on technological solutions to close identified capability gaps and face the new security challenges. The Agency also ran staff to staff meetings with NATO to ensure activities developed by participating Member States within NATO are correctly reflected. The next step in the elaboration of the first edition of the SCC will happen in February 2020 when EDA will present to the Steering Board part two of the SCC containing roadmaps of ongoing capability development activities and possible new ones which, subject to the necessary ad-hoc decisions by Member States, could be taken forward in the Agency framework. The SCC are living documents and will be updated by EDA over time, also on the basis of Member States\u2019 feedback, to make sure they always reflect the latest developments in the implementation of each and every priority. \u00a0 Background In June 2018, the EDA Steering Board in Capability Directors formation endorsed the 2018 Capability Development Plan (CDP) and approved the 2018 EU Capability Development Priorities. In their Council conclusions adopted on 25 June 2018, Member States agreed that \u201cthese priorities, as a key reference for Member States' and EU's capability development, will inform CARD, PESCO and the European Defence Fund, which bring a step-change in defence cooperation, thus contributing to coherence among these three distinct but mutually reinforcing initiatives\u201d. The June 2018 Steering Board also tasked the Agency to start the preparatory work for the implementation of the 2018 EU Capability Development Priorities, including with a view to the elaboration of SCC. In November 2018, the Steering Board tasked the Agency to proceed with the development of the SCC and to come up with a first edition by June 2019.

The announcement was made in the margins of the 4th CF SEDSS II Conference which is held under the Romanian Presidency of the Council of the European Union and hosted by the Romanian Ministry of National Defence.\u00a0 The EDA Chief Executive emphasised that \u201cthe Agency\u2019s interest in energy has been increasing in the last years, primarily because the Ministries of Defence have identified the importance of this topic, and because of how energy affects and will change our life in the future\u201d. As he pointed out, \u201cdisruptive technologies and new business models are reshaping the energy ecosystem and the defence sector needs to be part of this\u201d. New trends such as digitalisation, electrification, innovative energy technologies in battery storage, smart buildings, electric vehicles, artificial intelligence, integrated energy management systems as well as unknown malicious and hybrid threats require the defence sector not only to adapt to the fast-paced changing security environment but also to be able to recover when compromised. Mr Ristori remarked that \u201call strands of the EU\u2019s energy policy -energy efficiency, renewables, security of supply, interconnections- have an impact on our common European defence. That is why I believe the start of Phase III is an important step forward which reaffirms the Commission\u2019s strong commitment to address our common energy challenges in close cooperation with the European Defence Agency\u201d. He also said that \u201cby improving the way the defence and security sector uses energy, new real economic opportunities can arise, creating jobs and growth for all Europeans\u201d. Phase III will continue pursuing the implementation of the EU legal framework on energy and will reaffirm the Consultation Forum as the appropriate vehicle to share best practice, information and experiences among the EU Ministries of Defence. With the support of the European Commission the Forum will bring closer the defence and energy communities with a view to improving energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy sources, and the protection of defence energy-related critical infrastructures. Building on the know-how of the previous Phases and with the aim of adapting to future energy dynamics, Phase III will foresee the creation of a new ad-hoc transversal working group, which will cover the thematic activities on energy management and finance as well as a novel category on state-of-the-art technologies affecting the energy-defence dimension. Phase III is expected to enable economic, operational and strategic results within the context of project ideas, guidelines, and action plans that can assist Ministries of Defence to apply more affordable, resilient, and sustainable energy models at the national level. To address such objectives, the Agency will implement several multi-dimensional activities ranging from high-level conferences and thematic workshops to table-top exercises. Phase III will also be underpinned by the organisation of Energy Technology Solutions events engaging the civil sector, the industry and academia to ensure that the Forum keeps pace with the leading-edge developments in energy. With the support of the European Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Energy and the collaboration of the members of the Forum, the Agency will focus its work on how to better support Ministries of Defence to enhance strategic autonomy and resilience through a diversity of options within the nexus of the European Energy eco-system including the European defence dimension. \u00a0 More information: About CF SEDSS II\u00a0 Defence Energy Data 2016 & 2017 (EDA factsheet) ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/06/12/launch-of-the-consultation-forum-third-phase"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0077", "date": "2019-06-12", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Successful completion of the Second Phase of the Energy Defence Consultation Forum", "text": " Over 130 experts from 27 European countries and more than 20 different institutions and organisations participate in the 4th Conference of the Second Phase of the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector\u00a0(CF SEDSS II) in Bucharest.

Today\u2019s conference was officially opened by Mr Gabriel-Beniamin Le\u0219, Minister of National Defence of Romania, Mr Dominique Ristori, European Commission Director-General for Energy and Mr Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency (EDA). Mr Jorge Domecq, EDA Chief Executive, emphasised in his speech\u00a0that the \u201cBucharest conference marks the successful completion of a project which proved that sustainable energy matters for defence and that greener defence energy matters for the European Union\u201d. The Chief Executive expressed his satisfaction \u201cas the Consultation Forum has enabled directly or indirectly several Ministries of Defence to develop national defence energy strategies, implement Energy Management Systems, launch projects related to energy performance and consider initiating joint collaborative projects to address common energy challenges\u201d.\u00a0 European Commission\u2019s Directorate General for Energy (DG ENER) and the Executive Agency for SMEs (EASME) contributed to the work of the Forum by providing an EU long-term perspective on EU energy legislation, policy and action plans. With the support of the European Commission, the defence sector has come closer to the wider energy community and joined the Union\u2019s efforts to transit to an Energy Union. Mr Dominique Ristori, European Commission Director-General for Energy acknowledged in his introductory speech, \u201cthe substantial work of the Ministries of Defence to apply sustainable energy in the defence sector and to pursue the implementation of the EU legal framework on energy\u201d.\u00a0 The second Phase of the Forum developed a more practical defence-centric approach and focused on a range of activities such as improving energy management and energy efficiency of military building stock and fixed infrastructure, the integration of energy sources in defence infrastructure and the protection of defence-related critical energy infrastructure against hybrid threats. During Phase II the working groups collected more than 30 project ideas, of which 18 were elaborated to comprehensive project proposals. To support their realisation, the Agency applied an internal methodology called \u201cIdentiFunding for Energy\u201d, which matched these ideas with more than 30 eligible funding opportunities, enhancing the probability of their implementation. As a first step, the Agency is currently supporting Ministries of Defence to prepare three (3) applications for funding. Mr Domecq announced that \u201cEDA is ready to allocate additional budget to support at least five (5) other applications demonstrating the commitment of the Agency to meet the expectation of the Ministries of Defence in producing tangible results\u201d. \u00a0 Next Conference The Bucharest Conference marked the finalisation of the Second Phase of the Consultation Forum. Currently, EDA and DG ENER are preparing Phase III. It is expected that the first Conference of Phase III will take place during the first quarter of 2020. In the meantime, EDA and DG ENER are also organising a Joint Defence Energy Conference to be held at the end of 2019 in Brussels in preparation of phase III.

The event was organised by the Multinational Logistic Coordination Center (MLCC), a multinational sponsored centre for all issues related to multinational logistic cooperation. Some 3,400 troops from 31 countries (including 21 EU Member States) as well as representatives from 11 international organisations participated in this event. The exercise provided participants with a rare opportunity to test and train logistic procedures within a realistic multinational operational context under real life conditions. EDA was present at the exercise with two projects: the Sharing of Spare Parts project (SoSP) launched in 2015 by 12 EDA Member States. In a nutshell, it provides a simplified request-and-response mechanism for the exchange of military services and spare parts between the participating MoDs, based on agreed standards. It offers different ways to compensate for the loan of equipment, including through a barter mechanism. Using the SoSP process is cost-free for contributing Member States. A dedicated SoSP handbook has been developed, setting common standards and processes. The reason why SoSP was brought to the CAPABLE LOGISTICIAN 2019 exercise in Poland was to test and validate its accuracy and applicability, which was done with success.\u00a0 Now that it has been validated, the SoSP process handbook is considered \u2018mission proven\u2019 and ready to be used by the contributing Member States\u2019 MoDs. the Additive Manufacturing (AM) project. AM is widely considered as a potential game-changer as it could, inter alia, help reduce the logistic footprint of military missions. In 2018, EDA commissioned a feasibility study on AM with regard to EDA R&T activities. As a follow-up step to move onward from R&T to capability development, EDA proposed to Member States to test AM during a military exercise under real-life conditions. Together with France and Spain, EDA prepared the AM test which took place during the CAPABLE LOGISTICIAN 2019 exercise. Concretely, EDA deployed an AM Demonstrator in the form of a 20 ft standard container equipped with PolyJet and Fused Deposition Modelling technologies, 3-D scanner and appropriate software. Prior to the exercise, specific spare parts for military assets used at the exercise were identified by France and Spain. All of them could be printed during the exercise. Furthermore, the exercise showed that using a 20 ft container for the printing ensures logistical flexibility in the operational support and reduces the logistic footprint of a military operation. AM is thus a useful alternative to classical warehousing in military logistic supply chains, ensuring increased availability of spare parts, considerable time and cost savings as well as operational flexibility. During the CAPABLE LOGISTICIAN 2019 Visitors Days, EDA had the opportunity to present AM as a potential technology for military purposes and has received a lot of positive feedback. The discussions during the Visitors Days underlined the necessity of establishing a forum within EDA for subject matter experts to exchange experiences and discuss logistic processes, technology developments and legislative issues to further promote AM and support Member States in their efforts to better use the AM potential to develop a military capability, as also highlighted in the 2018 Capability Development Plan (CDP) and the subsequent Strategic Context Cases (SCCs). \u00a0 More information: EDA factsheet - Additive Manufacturing (3D-Printing) Feasibility Study & Technology Demonstration 3D-printing community explores applications for defence EDA\u2019s 3D-Printing project for Energetic Materials launched ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/06/21/eda-projects-involved-in-major-international-logistics-exercise"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0079", "date": "2019-06-25", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "A special edition for a special occasion: the new EDA magazine is out!", "text": " The latest European Defence Matters magazine (N\u00b017) is now available.

In a series of six articles, we then describe and assess what can probably be considered as EDA\u2019s main achievements over the past 15 years during which the Agency has established itself as: - the main architect of EU defence capability priorities; - the manager of European defence research; - the European hub for multinational capability development; - the military voice and interface for EU policies; - Europe\u2019s training pitch for enhanced interoperability; - the guardian of coherence among the newly set-up EU defence cooperation tools. In the \u2018Industry Talk\u2019 section, MBDA\u2019s new CEO Eric B\u00e9ranger shares his views on how European defence cooperation in Europe (and EDA\u2019s role in it) have evolved over the past 15 years and what the industrial prospects and challenges are for the future. He also touches upon the implementation of the recent EU defence initiatives (CARD, PESCO, EDF). The NATO view on European defence, EDA and EU/NATO cooperation is provided for this magazine by former NATO Assistant Secretary General for Defence Policy & Planning, Heinrich Brauss, who is now a Senior Associate Fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP).

European defence cooperation has expanded like never before. We have created the instruments to make European defence cooperation become the norm. And the Agency has been at the core of all our work and of all the progress that we have achieved together\u201d, she stated. \u201cAll this work wasn't just long overdue. It was urgent and necessary. All of our Member States, today, need European cooperation to guarantee the security of our citizens. European defence is first and foremost about the security of European citizens\u201d. With CARD, PESCO and the European Defence Fund (EDF), the EU has put in place the tools it needs to enhance defence cooperation and make it work for the benefit of a stronger and more efficient, coherent and interoperable European defence. \u201cThe European Defence Agency has made essential contributions to crafting these initiatives all along the way, and it is now central in their implementation. The Agency is the secretariat for both the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence and on PESCO, together with the European External Action Service and the EU Military Staff. And you are working with Member States so that their defence budgets incorporate our common Capability Development Plan\", Ms Mogherini said. \"In these years, I have seen this Agency grow and adapt to new tasks and challenges \u2013 and let me thank everyone who works here for your professionalism and flexibility.\u00a0Your role is now more important than ever, and it will be essential to ensure that EDA always has the means to fulfil its new tasks\", she added.\u00a0 The Head of the Agency concluded by saying: \"It was a privilege for me to be Head of the Defence Agency in this extraordinary moment for European defence. It has been an honour to lead the Agency in these five years, and up until its fifteenth birthday.\u00a0And whatever will happen next, I know that there are some great professionals here, working every day to make our cooperation more effective, our industry stronger, and our continent more secure.So let me thank you for these years together, and happy birthday to everyone at EDA\".\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cEDA is and will remain a central institution of European defence\u201d Previously, in his opening address as the representative of the rotating Presidency of the Council of the EU, Romanian Defence Minister Gabriel-Beniamin Le\u0219 commended the Agency \u201cfor its substantial contribution and support to European Defence efforts\u201d throughout the past 15 years. EDA is nowadays recognised as a \u201ckey player\u201d in advancing the EU\u2019s role in security and defence, he said. The Agency\u2019s Long-Term Review was \u201cnatural\u201d and necessary to keep it fit for purpose. The enhancement of the Agency proved relevant, especially when looking at the crucial role EDA plays nowadays as part of the CARD and PESCO secretariats and in the implementation of the EU defence initiatives in general, the Minister stated.\u00a0 \u201cWe encourage the Agency to continue to support the development of a common understanding regarding the new EU defence initiatives, including the possibilities of simplifying the processes and rules, to continue pursuing coherence of these initiatives and to further contribute to the coherence of output and timelines between relevant EU and NATO processes\u201d, Mr Le\u0219 stated. Member States, too, have to change and adapt the way they do defence planning, he said. \u201cPESCO, CARD, EDF are not just political initiative, but they need to become national defence planning instruments. We count on EDA support in this regard\u201d. The Minister, who thanked for the \u201cexcellent cooperation\u201d during the Romanian EU Presidency, concluded by saying: \u201cEDA is and will remain a central institution of European defence. As an intergovernmental organisation, it will continue to be closely attached to the needs of the Member States, and this is the main feature that we need to preserve. Romania will remain a strong supporter of EDA as it has always been. You can count on us\u201d.\u00a0 \u00a0 Working for more coherent European capability landscape In his welcome words to the 200 external guests and EDA staff, Chief Executive Jorge Domecq stressed that since its creation in July 2004, the Agency and the 700 colleagues who worked for it over the past 15 years were always (and still are) driven by one central commitment: to help Member States improve their defence capabilities through cooperation, by working together. \u201cOur mission is very clear: to support Member States in the development of their defence capabilities. All our work is geared towards making this mission a reality\u201d, he said. The Agency can be proud of what it has achieved so far in circumstances that were difficult at times, he said. Not only has it established itself as the \u201cmain architect of EU defence capability priorities\u201d thanks to the roles it plays in steering the Capability Development Plan process, the Overarching Strategic Research Agenda and the identification of Europe\u2019s Key Strategic Activities, but it is also recognised as Europe\u2019s central hub for multinational capability development and manager of collaborative defence research, as Europe\u2019s common training ground for common enhanced interoperability as well as the military\u2019s voice and interface in other EU policies. Most importantly, EDA is increasingly seen as the guardian of coherence among the new EU defence initiatives (CARD, PESCO, EDF). \u201cI am proud of the impact this house makes, in the interest of a more coherent European capability landscape owned and used by our Member States\u201d, Mr Domecq said, calling Member States to make \u201cfull use of EDA\u2019s potential\u201d. \u00a0 More information Special 15th anniversary edition of \u2018European Defence Matters\u2019 magazine Speech by Federica Mogherini, Head of EDA\u00a0(video) Speech by Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive 15th anniversary photo gallery\u00a0 ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/06/25/stakeholders-and-partners-gather-for-eda-s-15th-anniversary"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0081", "date": "2019-06-07", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "First Preparatory Action on Defence Research 2018 Calls project signed for \u20ac1.88 million", "text": " A grant agreement worth of \u20ac1.88 million was signed on 25 May 2019 for the Strategic Technology Foresight action called SOLOMON to be carried out under the EU Preparatory Action in the field of defence research.

A total of 29 air assets from Belgium (3 A-109 and 3 NH-90), Czech Republic (5 Mi-24, 6 Mi-171 and 4 L-159 \u201cAlca\u201d), Germany (3 CH-53), Hungary (3 Mi-24 and 2 Mi-27), Slovenia (1 AS-532) and Poland (1 W-3A) were involved in the exercise, as well as around 1,200 military staff. Observers from Serbia, the Netherlands, Sweden and the Joint Air Power Competence Centre (JAPCC) also attended. Furthermore, a multinational Joint Tactical Air Controller (JTAC) team and an Electronic Warfare (EW) emulator system were also involved. A mentor team encompassing helicopter tactics instructors from Austria, Sweden, the Netherlands and the UK supported the academic part of the exercise and provided mentoring and standardisation during the planning and execution phases of all Composite Air Operations (COMAO) missions. The main objective of DB19 was the performance of 8 day/night COMAO missions in a realistic, harsh and complex environment, as well as to carry out specific training as evasion training, live firing, formation flights, paratrooper and scuba jumps, rappelling and fast roping. In total, some 290 flights were performed amounting to around 500 flight hours.\u00a0 A Distinguished Visitors Day was organized on 28 May, attended by Czech Defence Minister Lubomir Metnar, the President of the Czech Senate, Jaroslav Kubera, as well as other military and civilian authorities. During the closing ceremony on 30 May, EDA\u2019s Project Officer Rotary Wing, Jos\u00e9 Pablo Romera, thanked the Czech Air Force, and in particular 22nd HAB N\u00e1m\u011b\u0161\u0165 Airbase Commander, Col Miroslav Svoboda and all his team, for the outstanding organisation and execution of the exercise. A special thanks also went to all the participants for their proactive involvement and cooperative mindset which resulted in the achievement of the expected training objectives. The next EDA helicopter exercise, \u2018Swift Blade 2020\u2019, will take place in April 2020 and will be jointly hosted by The Netherlands and Belgium, with Gilze-Rijen Air Base as the main location. \u00a0 Background A decade ago, the multinational helicopter training cooperation started in EDA with the aim of improving the European helicopter operational capability for crisis management operations and prepare helicopter crews for deployments by providing them advanced helicopter tactics training. Over time, requirements related to interoperability and training standardisation have been added to ensure that training does not only improve national readiness, but also supports multinational cooperation. Since 2009, 13 Blade exercises held in eight different European countries (France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Finland, Hungary and Czech Republic), 9 helicopter tactics symposiums, 63 Helicopter Tactics Courses, 6 Helicopter Tactics Instructors Courses and several other training activities, as COMAO planning courses and the EW courses have been carried out under EDA management and involving 15 EDA Member States. The outcome of all those trainings is a high level of operational interoperability and helicopter cooperation among a large number of EDA member states. The next important step will be the transfer of all those activities and programmes (HEP, HTC and HTIC) to a future Multinational Helicopter Training Centre (MHTC) by end of 2021. \u00a0 More information DARK BLADE factsheet DARK BLADE kicks off in the Czech Republic (EDA webnews) Helicopter Initiatives (EDA project page) HOT BLADE 2018 improved joint and combined helicopter training (EDA news) \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/06/07/dark-blade-2019-successfully-completed"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0083", "date": "2019-05-24", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Third Defence Energy Management course launched", "text": " EDA has launched this week another Defence Energy Managers Course (DEMC), already the third since its creation in January 2017.

Defence ministers discussed the Head of Agency\u2019s report on the implementation of EDA\u2019s long-term review and of the statute of the Agency agreed in 2015. They also tasked EDA to pursue its work in key research and capability development domains. In the margins of the meeting, a new military mobility programme on cross-border movement permissions was signed.\u00a0 \u00a0 Implementation of EDA\u2019s long-term review and the 2015 Council decision\u00a0\u00a0 Ministers welcomed the presentation by the Head of Agency of the report on the implementation of the conclusions and recommendations of EDA\u2019s long term review (LTR, endorsed in May 2017) which reinforced EDA\u2019s mission on three aspects: as the main intergovernmental prioritisation instrument at EU level in support of capability development; as the preferred cooperation forum and management support structure at EU level to engage in technology and capability development activities; and as a central operator with regard to EU funded defence-related activities and military voice in wider EU polices. In parallel to the implementation of the Council decision of 2015, the LTR adjustments allowed EDA to adapt to the fast-changing European defence landscape and the new requirements stemming from the EU defence initiatives that followed the 2016 EU Global Strategy: CARD, PESCO, European Defence Fund.\u00a0 \u00a0 Reflecting the Head of Agency\u2019s report, Ministers acknowledged the important support role EDA plays in the implementation of these initiatives as well as in ensuring coherence among them. They tasked the Agency to continue its coordination with the European External Action Services (EEAS including EU Military Staff), the EU Military Committee and the European Commission in their respective areas of responsibility, and to pursue coherence of output and avoidance of unnecessary duplication with NATO.\u00a0 The Steering Board agreed to revert to the review of the 2015 Council decision on EDA\u2019s statute, seat and operational rules in 2020. \u00a0 Implementation of EDA\u2019s key taskings and next steps Ministers were also provided with a comprehensive update on the progress made in the numerous technology and capability development activities currently underway in the Agency. It shows that EDA manages a constantly growing number of projects and programmes which is set to even further increase in the future, also as a result of Member States\u2019 request for support on PESCO projects.\u00a0 Among the many research and technology domains in which EDA is active, a particular emphasis was put on Artificial intelligence (AI). In order to better understand the potential future military applications of AI, Ministers agreed on a two-step approach. The first phase will see the creation of a specific EDA cross-Directorate ad-hoc team which will develop a \u201cAI Definition, Taxonomy and Glossary Document\u201d, as well as increased collaboration with EU stakeholders (especially the Commission) and the launch of an Innovation Prize in the area of AI. The second step, later this year, will consist of in-depth analyses of concrete AI defence applications in areas where capability gaps exist. Ministers also welcomed the Agency\u2019s contribution to the identification of initial lessons related to the 2018 revision of the Capability Development Plan (CDP), the CARD Trial Run, the first PESCO projects and the Preparatory Action on Defence Research. These lessons identified should be reflected and taken into account, as appropriate, in the further development of the defence initiatives, it was stressed.\u00a0 The Steering Board also asked the Agency to pursue the implementation of the 2018 EU Capability Development Priorities through robust and output-driven Strategic Context Cases (SCCs). EDA was asked to present to Capability Directors in June 2019 for endorsement the landscaping part of the SCCs, including their avenues of approach to tackle the capability shortfalls and lack of coherence in the European defence landscape, in order to inform the further implementation of the EU defence initiatives. The Agency was also invited to present to the Steering Board in February 2020 detailed roadmaps with objectives and milestones for those activities that, subject to the necessary ad-hoc decisions by Member States, could be taken forward in the Agency framework.\u00a0 \u00a0 Military Mobility In the margins of the Steering Board, ministers also signed the new EDA programme on \u201cOptimising cross border movement permission in Europe\u201d (see related news here).

The programme is developed in the framework of EDA\u2019s work on military mobility. It implements an important part of the \u2018Action Plan on Military Mobility\u2019 which was presented by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (HR) and the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council in March 2018. Military mobility is also highlighted in the EU-NATO Joint Declaration signed in Warsaw in 2016. The purpose of the programme signed today is to harmonise different national regulations of the participating Member States. It should allow Member States to reduce the administrative burden associated with different permission procedures and thus significantly shorten the timelines for granting surface and air cross border movement permissions. The programme provides the basis for important activities at technical and procedural level to develop the necessary arrangements for cross border movement per transport mode during crises, preparations for crises, training and day-to-day business. The arrangements cover surface (road, rail and inland waterways) and air movements (Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems, fighter aircraft or helicopters). They are expected to be finalised in 2020.\u00a0 \u201cMilitary mobility is about improving the movement of military personnel and assets across and beyond the EU. The high number of Member States participating in this new programme on cross-border movement permissions shows the need to alleviate the administrative burden while fully respecting the sovereignty of Member States\u201d, said Jorge Domecq, EDA\u2019s Chief Executive. \u00a0 Military mobility Military mobility covers the movement of military personnel and assets from one place to another, including crossing borders by using different modes of transport. The latter is of utmost importance for multinational operations. The capacity to ensure a smooth, efficient and effective movement of military personnel and assets across and beyond the European Union (EU) will enhance the EU\u2019s preparedness and response to crises. It will enable EU Member States to act faster, in line with their defence needs and responsibilities, both in the context of Common Security and Defence Policy missions and operations, and in the framework of national and multinational activities.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 EDA\u2019s role in the implementation of the Action Plan EDA is committed to supporting its Member States. The \u2018Action Plan on Military Mobility\u2019 builds upon the \u2018Roadmap on Military Mobility\u2019 developed by an EDA expert working group which was set up on request of the EDA Member States in September 2017. In addition to the programme on cross border movement permission, the Agency support to Member States comprises another programme on harmonising of military requirements in the customs domain as well as surveys on transportation of dangerous goods and other legal aspects. \u00a0 Further information: Factsheet on Military Mobility \u00a0 EDA press contacts:\u00a0 Elisabeth SCHOEFFMANN Head of Media & Communication elisabeth.schoeffmann@eda.europa.eu T+32 470 87 01 65 Helmut BRULS Media & Communications Officer helmut.bruls@eda.europa.eu T+32 2 504 28 10 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/05/14/22-member-states-sign-new-military-mobility-programme"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0089", "date": "2019-05-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "DARK BLADE 2019 kicks off in Czech Republic", "text": " DARK BLADE 2019, the 13th helicopter exercise organised under the umbrella of the European Defence Agency\u2019s Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP), takes place as of today (13 May) at N\u00e1m\u011b\u0161\u0165 airbase in Czech Republic, until 1 June 2019. A total of 29 air assets (25 helicopters + 4 fixed wing) and some 600 military personnel from six countries - Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia, - will participate in this exercise hosted by the Czech Air Force. DARK BLADE 2019 will allow crews to practice operations in various environment replicating the challenging conditions that participant forces are expected to encounter when deploying to a theatre of operation. The exercise\u2019s main focus will be on enhancing interoperability at the tactical level between helicopter units by using the Composite Air Operations (COMAO) concept in a combined, joint, realistic and challenging environment. Its main objectives are to: enhance tactical interoperability between helicopter units from the participating countries by using the COMAO concept in a combined, joint, realistic and challenging environment and to operate using standard helicopter Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs). The focus will be on Composite Air Operations (COMAO) with live firing and trooping; train and practise TTPs with/against fighter jets and electronic warfare means on the ground; improve interoperability in training and operational tasks with Ground Forces involvement (NVG operations, low level flying, formation flights, FARP training, gunnery, etc.) in a full spectrum environment. \u00a0 Programme Participating crews will fly diverse day and night COMAO missions and execute Air Assault (AA), Air Interdiction (AI), Air Transport (AT), Close Air Support (CAS), Personnel Recovery (PR) missions, night flights (with/without NVG) and other missions at tactical level. They will also train special procedures like marshalling, fast rope and abseiling techniques, Special Patrol Insertion/Extraction (SPIE), pick-up and drop off procedures, air-to-surface live firing (helicopter door gunnery and sniper training). In addition, DARK BLADE 2019 will provide multiple opportunities to practice multinational training with the Special Operation Forces (e.g. infiltration and exfiltration) and will enhance crews\u2019 skills in using the HEP Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and COMAO planning procedures in the conduct of tactical missions.

The Agency also considers this programme as a suitable vehicle for enhanced access for Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) to the cross-border supply chain. The PMC follows EDA\u2019s Request of Information (RFI) in 2017 through which a first contact was established with industry on this concrete programme \u00a0 Business-to-business workshop In order to support the PMC, EDA will organise a business-to-business (B2B) workshop at its premises in Brussels around mid-May. Further details on this workshop, including participation criteria and related requirements, will be communicated by EDA to industry in due time. The aim of the B2B workshop is to promote cross-border cooperation within the EU and enhance mid-caps/small and medium enterprises\u2019 access to defence contracts in general, and to the future OMBT-Leo2 programme (contractual) implementation in particular, by facilitating initial contacts between industrial stakeholders with relevant expertise (at full-system and / or subsystem level), in this field. Specific criteria for participation of interested industries will be part of the communication and each request will be assessed by contributing Member States experts and EDA, on a case-by-case basis. \u00a0 Way ahead The information gathered through the PMC will be assessed by EDA and governmental subject matter experts. The results of the assessment will further support contributing Member States in their national decision, and EDA in the awarding process of possible future contracts. \u00a0 Background In spring 2017, EDA launched the \u2018OMBT-Leo2\u2019 project, a new Pooling & Sharing initiative which aims at optimizing existing Main Battle Tank (MBT) capabilities in Europe with an initial focus on the Leopard 2A4. The concept foresees the offer of surplus Leopard platforms available in certain Member States (the \u2018providers\u2019) and transfer them (lease, rent or sell) together with an upgrading package to one or several other Member States (the \u2018receivers\u2019) interested in acquiring and introducing in-service this type of capability. The Pooling & Sharing of training, exercises and maintenance between providers and receivers, using already existing facilities, is also part of the concept. Upgrade of legacy MBTs to the latest technical standards would have a positive impact for European defence industry in the area of land systems. It would also contribute to the maintenance of technological excellence of the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB). Additionally, regarding economies of scale, Member States owning and operating for national purposes the same type of MBTs, can opt-in for upgrading their in-service fleet. \u00a0 More information :\u00a0 EDA seeks European defence industry\u2019s input on Main Battle Tank optimization (EDA news, September 2017) ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/04/02/wanted-industry-solutions-for-optimisation-of-mbt-capabilities"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0098", "date": "2019-04-05", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA launches work on research prototype for cyber defence situation awareness", "text": " Last week, a kick-off meeting was held at EDA to launch the contractual work on the Cyber Defence Situation Awareness Package Rapid Research Prototype (CySAP-RRP) project, in the presence of representatives of the three contributing Member States:\u00a0 Spain (lead country), Germany and Italy. The industry consortium in charge of the project (INDRA Sistemas SA, Leonardo S.p.a and Fraunhofer) provided Member States with an overview of the project management plan describing tasks, milestones and project deliverables.\u00a0 The project was conceived as the first step of a spiral development in order to set up a full Cyber Situation Awareness operational capability. The CySAP-RRP will be built upon previous work done by EDA to develop a Target Architecture and System Requirements for an enhanced Cyber Defence Situation Awareness Capability.\u00a0 The core objectives of the project include essential research challenges to assist military decision-makers in cyberspace and to set the basis for a fully-fledged Command and Control (C2) system for cyber operations.\u00a0 CySAP is at the forefront of technology development with the aim of obtaining a common and standardized cyber defence planning and management functional area service. The research challenges are to provide a comprehensive understanding of the cyber defence elements in the planning and conduct phase of military operations in which cyberspace is now recognised and treated as any other domain such as land, air or maritime.\u00a0 Under the framework of EDA, the three Member States participating in CySAP agreed a common set of requirements and a Target Architecture for the capability. CySAP follows a modular approach allowing\u00a0 to have a flexible set of functionalities by exercising a system engineering process. Current market available solutions for cyber situational awareness do not meet the entire spectrum of military requirements such as risk analysis, cyber related Courses of Action (CoA) development and assessment as well as support to decision-making. CySAP will provide situational analysis that can be integrated into the overall common operational picture of a mission, as a cyber information layer able to provide timely and accurate situational awareness. CySAP is set to obtain innovative solutions by joining efforts of leading defence industries and researchers in Europe. The architectural design comprises several spirals to be completed in the next years subject to future investments. The possibility to introduce CySAP follow-on activities into PESCO or the EDIDP are currently explored and assessed. The next progress review meeting is scheduled for September 2019 in Spain.\u00a0 Background The updated EU Capability Development Plan (CDP) endorsed by the EDA Steering Board in June 2018 reconfirmed cyber defence as a priority for capability development in the EU. The CDP recognises the need for defensive cyber operations in any operational context, based on sophisticated current and predictive cyberspace situational awareness. This includes the ability to combine large amounts of data and intelligence from numerous sources in support of rapid decision making and increased automation of the data gathering, analysis and decision-support process.\u00a0 In November 2018, the European Council adopted an updated version of the EU cyber defence policy framework (CDPF).\u00a0 Supporting the development of Member States\u2019 cyber defence capabilities is a priority area where the now established CySAP project serves as a core to guide future research and operational capabilities.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/04/05/eda-launches-work-on-research-prototype-for-cyber-defence-situation-awareness"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0099", "date": "2019-04-05", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA supports NATO CCD COE \u2018Locked Shields\u2019 cyber defence exercise", "text": " \u2018Locked Shields\u2019, the world\u2019s biggest and most advanced international cyber defence exercise involving life-fire attacks, is organized annually by NATO\u2019s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE) in Tallinn.

At the same time, military installations can be insufficiently acknowledged in both distributed water management and pollution control despite their ubiquitous presence. Against this backdrop, EDA\u2019s SBWC research project was launched in 2017 with the Hellenic MOD as lead nation to investigate how to improve water management in military camps from sustainability, hydro-informatics, and technological perspectives. During 2017 and 2018 at sites from each of the six participating Member States involved (Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain), the National Technical University of Athens collated water supply, distribution and consumption data, and made technical assessments. Bespoke recommendations were made for each of the military sites from across these different European geographic and climatic regions based on: detailed modelling of water and wastewater cycle of each camp using an Urban Water Cycle Optioneering Tool (UWOT)\u00a0\u00a0 assessments of alternative scenarios regarding interventions for each camp\u00a0 consideration of social, economic, environmental and technological context factors such as population, monitoring and automation of water transmission and storage systems, budget availability, regional water quantity and quality, climate change, and the feasibility of using information and communications technology (ICT) development of Key Performance Indicator protocols, including economic, operational and social impacts\u00a0 economic assessments of interventions for each camp based on modelling results. Recommended interventions varied in scale and complexity and ranged from those of a more straightforward nature, such as the installation of grey water recycling and water harvesting systems, to more technologically sophisticated measures, such as the application of ground penetrating radar to support leak detection and control\u00a0 or the use of a grid of smart sensors to enable real-time monitoring and management of water supply systems. It was found that leakage was responsible for considerable water losses with mitigation measures costing around 40% of the annual cost of water lost to leakage in one case, thereby providing a significant return on investment. Rainwater harvesting in another case could provide nearly two thirds of the supply required for vehicle washing. Installation of smart water grid systems would integrate ICT into the management of the water distribution systems to optimize operation of the water supply network.

Managed by the European Defence Agency (EDA), the Consultation Forum is a European Commission initiative (DG ENER) receiving funding under the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 R&I programme. EDA and the European Commission will continue to work hand in hand to deliver the last steps of the Consultation Forum. Today\u2019s conference was opened by Mr Savvas Angelides, the Minister of Defence of the Republic of Cyprus.\u00a0 In his speech, Jorge Domecq, the EDA Chief Executive, highlighted that \u201cthe extensive participation makes the Nicosia Conference the biggest one since 2015 when the project was initiated.\u201d This, he said, reflects the continuous interest of the Ministries of Defence to apply sustainable energy models in the defence sector and to benefit from the transition to an Energy Union. \u201cThe Consultation Forum is a role model of how EDA performs simultaneously its triple mission of being the major intergovernmental prioritisation instrument at EU level in support of capability development, the preferred cooperation forum and management support structure as well as the interface with the Commission and other Agencies in accordance the Long-Term Review conclusions and recommendations endorsed by Ministers of Defence\u201d, Mr Domecq stated. He also informed the participants that he agreed with Mr Dominique Ristori, European Commission Director-General for Energy, on the possible continuation of the Consultation Forum through a third phase with a higher budget and a longer duration. Klaus-Dieter Borchardt, the Deputy Director-General of DG ENER, recalled the three key pieces of legislation in the Clean Energy for All Europeans package that have been recently approved: the revision of the Renewable Energy Directive, the revision of the Energy Efficiency Directive (EU) and the Energy Performance of Building Directive. The Nicosia Conference focusses on the development of guidelines for improving overall energy management and energy efficiency of military building stock and fixed infrastructure. It also addresses energy considerations by reviewing renewable energy sources and their use in defence infrastructure and developing guidelines on the protection of defence-related critical energy infrastructure against hybrid threats. The Conference will last two days and address several topics ranging from the impact of the energy-related directives on the defence and security sector to the elaboration of defence energy-related project ideas. \u00a0 Next Conference The last of the three steps Conferences of the Consultation Forum will be hosted under the auspices of the Romanian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, by the Romanian Ministry of National Defence, and will take place in Bucharest on 12 and 13 June 2019. \u00a0 About the CF SEDSS II The Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector (CF SEDSS) is a European Commission initiative managed by the EDA. It aims at bringing together experts from the defence and energy sectors to share information and best practices on improving energy management, energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy as well increasing the protection and resilience of defence energy-related critical infrastructures. On 20 October 2017, the second phase of the Consultation Forum (CF SEDSS II) was launched. This project has received funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, and the agreement is between the EASME executive agency and the EDA. The contract was signed on 16 October 2017 for 22 months, expiring on August 2019.\u00a0 Based on the foundations laid during the first phase of the Consultation Forum (2015-2017), the second phase has been further expanded to cover the following interrelated subjects through three main working groups (including sub-working groups): WG 1: Energy Management including Energy Efficiency (Sub-WG1: Energy Management and Sub-WG2: Energy Efficiency; WG 2: Renewable Energy Sources and Technologies; WG 3: Protection of Critical Energy Infrastructure and one cross-cutting theme: Finance. \u00a0 More information: Full text of EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq speech at Nicosia conference About CF SEDSS II European Funding Gateway for Energy in Defence at www.eda.europa.eu/eufunding/energy Further progress in sustainable energy for defence sector\u00a0 ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/02/26/moving-towards-defence-sustainable-energy-models"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0111", "date": "2019-02-21", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA workshop held on \u201cAutonomous Cyber Responses\u201d", "text": " Member States representatives together with cyber research experts from the European Cyber Security Organisation (ECSO), industry, research organisations and academia recently met at an EDA workshop to discuss\u00a0 \u2018Autonomous Cyber Responses\u2019. This research topic refers to the challenges brought about by the automation in cyber defence and includes among others self-configured networks, automated cyber resilience, decision support systems, visual analytics, autonomous mobile cyber defence agents, man-machine modules and machine learning models to address the cyber research challenges Member States\u2019 Armed Forces are confronted with. The objective of the workshop was to provide EDA\u2019s Cyber Research and Technology Ad Hoc Working Group with examples of European research efforts and solutions, to identify capability gaps that could be covered with this technology and to explore new collaboration initiatives in this challenging field. Participants acknowledged the urgency of meaningful collaborative research activities at EU level in view of building tomorrow\u2019s defence capabilities, and supported the continuation of similar initiatives. A so-called \u2018Interested Community of Experts\u2019 (ICE) set up within the Ad Hoc Working Group will perform an evaluation of the proposals discussed at the workshop. Outline descriptions for future collaborative research projects in this field are expected to be presented to Member States in the upcoming meetings. \u00a0 Background The potential benefits that European Armed Forces could draw from the use of cyber-resilient autonomous systems have also been recognised by EU Member States. One of the 11 EU Capability Development Priorities approved by Member States in June 2018 is called \u201cEnabling capabilities for cyber responsive operations\u201d. The Overarching Strategic Research Agenda (OSRA) - which provides a necessary link between R&T efforts and the military tasks and long-term capability needs of the Capability Development Plan (CDP) -\u00a0 identified a number of Research and Technology areas, the so-called Technology Building Blocks (TBBs), in which a cooperative approach at the European level would bring an added-value to support the development of defence capabilities. The Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) on Cyber Defence developed within the relevant EDA Ad Hoc Working Group in compliance with OSRA requirements provides informed prioritisation on cyber-related technologies necessary for the military while identifying opportunities for dual-use efforts and investments, be it in national, multinational or EU-funded contexts. Autonomous Cyber Response is one of the TBBs developed under the Cyber SRA. In November 2018, the European Council adopted an updated version of the EU cyber defence policy framework (CDPF) which calls for considering cyber defence issues in the calls of the Preparatory Action on Defence Research and in the topics called for in the European Defence Fund.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/02/21/eda-workshop-held-on-autonomous-cyber-responses"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0112", "date": "2019-02-07", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA renews Cooperation Arrangement with the Athena Mechanism", "text": " EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq and Hans-Werner Grenzh\u00e4user, the Athena Administrator, have signed an arrangement renewing the framework for future cooperation between EDA and Athena. The Cooperation Arrangement signed on 1 February 2019 aims at replacing the previous arrangement which was signed on 27 February 2015 and was valid for a limited period. It offers the option for any CSDP Operation/Mission Commander to call upon EDA to provide technical and overall administrative support for their most complex procurement procedures. The full text of the arrangement is available here. Under the previous arrangement, the Agency has supported the EU Training Mission in Mali for the procurement in Europe of a medical incinerator between May 2015 and February 2016. EDA also supported operation EUFOR ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina for a cost-benefit analysis of camp management in the Sarajevo Camp Butmir from July to October 2015. In addition, the Agency supports CSDP military operations and missions with other projects as well as contracted support pre-mission solutions. On the project side this has so far included cyber awareness seminars, maritime surveillance, personnel management as well as management of geospatial information. Contracted support reaches from satellite communications to wider logistics support.\u00a0 This has already been the case for CSDP military operations in the Central African Republic (EUFOR RCA and later EUTM RCA), the Mediterranean Sea (EUNAVFOR MED operation Sophia), Bosnia and Herzegovina (EUFOR Althea), Mali (EUTM Mali), Somalia (EUTM Somalia and EUNAVFOR Atalanta).\u00a0 Most recently, EDA also started supporting the newly established Military Planning and Conduct Capability (MPCC) with contracted communication services, and it is supporting CSDP civilian missions as well. \u00a0 The Athena Mechanism Athena is the mechanism established to administer the financing of the common costs of European Union operations having military or defence implications governed by Council Decision 2015/528/CFSP. The Council Decision allows for arrangements to be negotiated with Union bodies to facilitate procurement and/or financial aspects of mutual support in operations in the most cost-effective manner. \u00a0 More information:\u00a0 Cooperation Arrangement signed on 1 February 2019 (full text) Support to Operations (EDA brochure) \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/02/07/eda-renews-cooperation-arrangement-with-the-athena-mechanism"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0113", "date": "2019-02-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Contracts signed for the provision of aero medical evacuation services in Europe and Africa", "text": " The European Defence Agency has just concluded multiple framework contracts with Global Helicopter Service GMBH, Elitaliana S.R.L. and Starlite Aviation Operations Ltd. for the provision of fixed and rotary wings medical evacuation services in the context of EDA\u2019s Support of Operations. The contracts run until January 2023 for a maximum value of 120 million Euro.\u00a0 In national and multinational operations, the provision of In-theatre aeromedical evacuation services is often a challenge. In many cases, capabilities are not available from Member States and outsourcing is necessary to provide air medical evacuation services through private companies. Experience shows that contracting on the spot under time pressure is mostly not a cost-effective solution. Having in place ready-to-use arrangements is very beneficial to ensure immediate availability of services, whilst equally reducing the administrative burden and achieving economies of scale. The overall purpose of the AIRMEDEVAC project is to efficiently and cost effectively provide contributing members with an option to order \u2018ready-to-use\u2019 commercially available In-theatre aeromedical evacuation services through EDA. The 4 contributing members (CM) today are: Austria, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. The project is open to all EDA participating Member States, EU entities as well as third states having an administrative arrangement with EDA. The contributing members have mandated EDA through a Project Arrangement (PA) to manage the project including the negotiation of Multiple Framework Contracts (FWCs) and service requests on their behalf. The contracts concluded today are the result of a close cooperation dating back to 2016 between EDA, the EU Military Staff and the contributing members to define the requirements and evaluate the services required. EDA has been in the lead of the process up to the conclusion of the contract and will continue to be fully responsible for its management throughout the implementation.\u00a0 The contractors offer services to evacuate patients from the point of injury to the initial Medical Treatment Facility (Forward AIRMEDEVAC) or to transfer them between in-theatre Medical Treatment Facilities (Tactical AIRMEDEVAC) in the context of national and/or international defence and/or security operations. Services include access to a wide range of Rotary and Fixed-Wing aircraft in Europe and Africa to meet a variety of operational needs, both abroad and at home.\u00a0 The project constitutes an efficient pay-per-use solution that does not impose any binding financial commitments beyond services requested. It is quick and flexible and will reduce the administrative burden for members who do not have to run their own bidding processes since they can rely on the EDA framework contracts. \u00a0 More information:\u00a0 AIRMEDEVAC factsheet EDA brochure support to operations ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/02/06/contracts-signed-for-the-provision-of-aero-medical-evacuation-services-in-europe-and-africa"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0114", "date": "2019-02-04", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Save the date: Capability-Driven Defence Research and Innovation Conference", "text": " Under the auspices of the Romanian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, the Romanian Ministry of National Defence, in cooperation with the European Defence Agency (EDA), organises a conference on the theme of \u201cCapability-Driven Defence Research and Innovation\u201d.

This means that the project is now ready to provide GOVSATCOM services to meet the GOVSATCOM demands of Member States and European CSDP actors through pooled capabilities (bandwidth/power and/or services) provided by contributing Member States. This governmental pooled capability is set up to provide satellite communication (SATCOM) resources that cannot be obtained on the commercial market with sufficient level of guaranteed access and security.\u00a0 The GSC Demo corresponds\u00a0 responds to an existing need and is fully in line with the revised 2018 Capability Development Plan and its related EU Defence Capability Priorities. It has also to be seen in the light of the ongoing efforts within the European Union to establish an EU GOVSATCOM within the EU\u2019s next space programme. Furthermore, the GSC Demo project also complements EDA\u2019s EU Satcom Market project, already in place since 2012, which provides commercially available SATCOM and CIS services in an efficient and effective manner.\u00a0 Today\u2019s milestone was achieved after intensive work done since June 2017 to establish a Project Arrangement. Under the leadership of Spain, all 15 contributing EDA Member States of the project (Spain, Austria, Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, France, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom) accepted the Project Arrangement as baseline for mutual support and collaboration. Norway, which has signed an Administrative Arrangement with the Agency, is also contributing to the project. EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq, who attended today\u2019s meeting in Madrid, stated: \u201cThe role of satellite communication in a European strategic autonomy perspective cannot be overstated. I am pleased to say that EDA has played its part in facilitating SATCOM solutions for the EU for some time and in an incremental fashion that has proved quite successful. This GSC Demo project together with the Agency\u2019s EU SatCom Market project underlines the importance of SATCOM and confirms the priority that has been granted to this capability during the most recent revision of the Capability Development Plan\". Major General Salvador Alvarez Pascual, the Deputy Director of Programs in the Spanish Ministry of Defence, said:\u00a0 \"Now it is time to start this project which is the result of significant work of experts from different nations.\u00a0Spain will face the chairmanship of the Project Arrangement Management Group with confidence to have a good cooperation. The project will fulfill our common objectives and targets and provides the ideal opportunity to test its governance\u201c. \u00a0 Background Reliable, stable and secure communications are crucial in any CSDP mission and operation. Yet, terrestrial network infrastructures are not available everywhere, for instance in areas hit by natural disasters, at sea, in the air or in hostile zones. SATCOM can be the solution: rapidly deployable, flexible and distance insensitive, SATCOM can offer communication links where terrestrial networks are damaged, overloaded or non-existent. However, access to SATCOM cannot be taken for granted at any time, especially not when governmental users require them at short notice and without pre-arranged agreements. In situations of high demand, competition with other users of commercial SATCOM capacities creates a risk of non-availability and high costs. Against this backdrop, EU leaders decided in 2013 that there was a need for a new solution combining the advantages of commercial and military satellite systems in order to address both civil and military needs through European cooperation. The European Defence Agency, in collaboration with the European Commission and the European Space Agency, since then is preparing the next generation of GOVSATCOM.\u00a0 GOVSATCOM is seen as a capability that is placed in between the commercial satellite communication market and the highly protected military satellite communication capability. The project originates from an EDA Steering Board decision of November 2013 which tasked EDA to pursue its work on GOVSATCOM coordination with Member States, the European Commission and the European Space Agency in order to propose a comprehensive programme for Member States who wish to participate. After a sound preparatory work, the aforementioned EDA Member States decided in June 2017 to establish the GSC Demo project and intensify their collaboration in GOVSATCOM.

The project was conceived as the first step of a spiral development in order to set up a full Cyber Situation Awareness (CySA) operational capability. The CySAP-RRP will be built upon previous work done by EDA to develop a Target Architecture and System Requirements for an enhanced Cyber Defence Situation Awareness Capability. The core objectives of the project include essential research challenges to assist military decision-makers in cyberspace and to set the basis of a Command and Control (C2) system for cyber operations.\u00a0 Under this PA, results will be delivered using a spiral approach over the next 18 months. EDA\u2019s Project Team Cyber Defence (PT CD) identified the need for capabilities to enable military commanders at all operational levels to understand and manage the risk of cyber-attack. An important prerequisite is to provide situation awareness (SA) for the commander and his staff, based on a general and specific threat landscape from which the risk of cyber-attack can be observed, understood and evaluated. The objective is for military commanders to have a clear understanding of the cyber threat landscape including system vulnerabilities and attack vectors and to equip them with the tools required to make informed decisions in order to manage cyber risks during the planning and conduct phases of an operation. A dedicated CySAP Ad Hoc Working Group (AHWG) comprising the contributing Member States, EDA and additional subject matter experts and stakeholders started work on a Common Staff Target (CST), Common Staff Requirements (CSR) and a Business Case which describes which operational elements are needed to achieve a cyber situation awareness for the EU Armed Forces. CySAP follows a modular approach which means that the adopted SA capability architecture will influence additional cyber defence solutions to achieve interoperability. Other spirals, subject to future commitments and out of the scope of the first step, are planned to further develop CySAP towards a final CySA capability. CySA is a key aspect in all cyber defence efforts and initiatives currently pursued within the EU and other international organizations. As part ofthis endeavour, EDA hosted two capability awareness days with the support of industry and academia in order to allow the military to benefit from existing products and trends related toCyber Situation Awareness. Since its inception in 2016, EDA\u2019s Cyber Research and Technology AHWG has supported CySAP. This working group promotes collaborative cyber defence research within a cyber Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) looking into research activities to address capability gaps. Following the Cyber Ranges Federation project launched by 11 EU Member States in 2017 CySAP is the second EDA collaborative Cyber Defence project and the first collaborative R&T project in the domain. \u00a0 Background Cyberspace is the fifth domain of operations, alongside the domains of land, sea, air, and space: the successful implementation of EU missions and operations is increasingly dependent on uninterrupted access to a secure cyberspace, and thus requires robust and resilient cyber operational capabilities.\u00a0 The updated EU Capability Development Plan (CDP) endorsed by the EDA Steering Board in June 2018 reconfirmed cyber defence as a priority for capability development in the EU. The CDP recognises the need for defensive cyber operations in any operational context, based on sophisticated current and predictive cyberspace situational awareness. This includes the ability to combine large amounts of data and intelligence from numerous sources in support of rapid decision making and increased automation of the data gathering, analysis and decision-support process. In November 2018, the European Council adopted an updated version of the EU cyber defence policy framework (CDPF).\u00a0 Supporting the development of Member States\u2019 cyber defence capabilities is a priority area where the now established CySAP project serves as a core to guide future research and operational capabilities. \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2019/01/11/cyber-situation-awareness-package-(cysap)-project-launched-by-three-member-states"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0120", "date": "2018-12-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "R&T project launched on 3D printing of energetic materials", "text": " In the margins of yesterday\u2019s EDA Steering Board meeting in R&T Directors composition, six EDA Member States (Finland, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Poland, Sweden) as well as Norway (which has signed an Administrative Arrangement with the Agency) signed a project arrangement to develop a new research project on \u2018Additive Manufacturing Techniques for Energetic Materials\u2019 (AMTEM).\u00a0 Under the lead of France, 15 European research organizations and defence industrial players will investigate the potential of 3D printing (Additive Manufacturing) technologies for producing future explosives and propellants.

In order to provide operation commanders with optimal capabilities in this domain, EDA Member States in 2014 launched GISMO, the \u2018Geospatial Information to Support decision Making in Operations\u2019 project. Since then and working in partnership with the EU Satellite Centre (EU SatCen), GISMO has produced a first operational output in the form of \u2018GeohuB\u2019, a software application which allows for the safe and reliable sharing of geospatial information (GI) within a mission\u2019s operational headquarter.\u00a0 After a successful field trial, GeohuB was successfully deployed in November 2017 to the Italian Operation Headquarters, Rome, in support of EU Naval Force Mediterranean (EUNAVFOR MED). In practical terms, this means that operation participants with access to the classified mission network of EUNAVFOR MED\u2019s operational headquarters in Rome can upload, share and manage geospatial data related to the operation (GeohuB is accessible through a normal web browser with a user-friendly interface). Rear Admiral Enrico Credendino Commander EUNAVFOR Med Operation Sophia Last June, GISMO started the transition of the GeohuB application from the current status of Initial Operating Capability (IOC) to Full Operating Capability (FOC) by the summer. A move much welcomed by Rear Admiral Enrico Credendino, the Commander of EUNAVFOR Med Operation Sophia. \u201cWithin the operational activity, the GEOHUB system is an effective service to support geospatial information. We aim to increase the use of this tool more and more with the intention of reaching the full operational capability before summer 2019\u201d, he said.\u00a0 Last September, a new milestone was reached when the first training session was provided by EU SatCen staff to OHQ Sophia and training tutorials were handed over to GeohuB users on the ground in the framework of EDA project GISMO.\u00a0 \u00a0 Interview: \u201cA common geospatial solution is paramount\u201d After the GeohuB training session, we spoke to Italian Lieutenant Colonel Claudio Panizzi who is GEO Officer at operation \u2018Sophia\u2019 (EUNAVFOR Med). \u00a0 GISMO GeohuB is a Content Management System that facilitates the access to space-based information integrated with geospatial data in an Operational Headquarters environment. How important is space-based information and its integration into a common geospatial dataset for EUNAVFOR MED? Lt.Col. Claudio Panizzi:\u00a0 Almost all of the information that is managed inside an operation has a geospatial component. Reports are linked to locations, ships are located somewhere, the patrolling routes cover a given area, etc. The need to integrate all this information into a common geospatial solution is paramount to ensure that we are all fighting off the same map in this operation. An integrated approach as provided by GeohuB allows us to combine intelligence from different sources including space assets. Space assets are an operational resource able to provide answers worldwide, reliably within strict time margins. Accessing such resources and combining it with other intelligence sources enhance our capacity for decision making. \u00a0 In very practical terms, what are the main operational benefits of the GISMO GeohuB System, even though it is still only at an initial stage of operational capability, and what kind of impact it has on operation SOPHIA? Lt.Col. Claudio Panizzi: The highest benefit is to allow all branches of the operation to share a common view, empowering the staff to access data generated by other branches on their own, streamlining processes and easing dec ision making. In addition, having a common pool of information increases the safety and security of decision relying on geospatial data. \u00a0 Would you recommend other CSDP Missions and Operations or even the European External Action Service (EEAS) to use the system?\u00a0 Lt.Col. Claudio Panizzi: The use of a system able to operate inside the classified network allows to have an integrated vision. The use of open sources is important, but it is just another source of information. The real benefit for the operation comes from having all the sources in one tool that allows to mix the unclassified layer of geographical information with the classified information generated by the mission. This can only be achieved with operational tools inside the classified network. \u00a0 One of the main objectives of the GISMO GeohuB is to support the decision-making process on the basis of updated situational awareness informed by space-based information. Based on the experience you\u2019ve made so far with the system, would you say that there is room for new technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), to further improve the tool? Lt.Col. Claudio Panizzi: As said before, the GISMO GehuB is a decision-making process oriented software. It provides, if required, a wide geospatial vision of the Area of Operations related by specific thematic overlapped layers and information. In addition, to improve the aim of the product, we can suggest to develop remote sensing tools finalized to execute more autonomous analysis, such as change detection (to investigate day by day the development of specific situations) in order to provide more complete answers if specific and more localized crisis situations required it. \u00a0 GISMO GeohuB\u00a0 So far, the GISMO GeohuB has been deployed:\u00a0 since November 2017 to the Italian Operation Headquarters, Rome, in support of EU Naval Force Mediterranean (EUNAVFOR MED) in support of the MultiLayer 2016 (ML16) exercise as a tool for GI sharing among the different actors in the exercise (Brussels, EU OHQ in Postdam, FHQ in Strasbourg and EU delegation in Kampala) in support of the EUMM Georgia where the GeohuB is becoming a fundamental piece of the daily work chain within the monitoring mission in support of the MILEX 2017 as a tool to access GI by the EU OHQ in Northwood in support of EU Parallel and Coordinated Exercise 2018 (EU PACE 18) On the initiative of the EUMS, the GISMO GeohuB is also being evaluated as the application to share Geospatial Information within the European External Action Service (EEAS) network users. \u00a0 Background Commanders of CSDP missions and operations constantly need fast, reliable and updated geospatial information covering land, sea, airspace and cyber. Geospatial information is earth-related factual data referenced by geographic position and arranged in a coherent structure. Such data include topographic, aeronautical, hydrographic or planning information but also mapping, geo-referenced imagery, geophysical products, etc. available in either analogue or digital format. Most pieces of information have a location, and knowing and understanding these locations can be decisive in a mission commanders\u2019 decision-making. Ever improving geospatial information has thus the potential to revolutionise the decision-making process within military missions and operations.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/12/12/gismo-s-geohub-aims-at-full-operational-capability-by-early-2019"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0122", "date": "2018-12-11", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "OCCAR-EDA exchange of letter on European Secure Software defined Radio (ESSOR) programme", "text": " At yesterday\u2019s OCCAR-EDA bilateral in Bonn, OCCAR Director Arturo Alfonso-Meiri\u00f1o and the Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency, Jorge Domecq, have exchanged letters describing the role of the EDA in support of the ESSOR Programme.

It followed the successful completion, end of September in Sweden, of the 6th EDA Helicopter Tactics Instructor Course (HTIC). This annual event proved once more to be a unique occasion for European helicopter crews to discuss and share expertise and best practices related to helicopter tactics and to learn about training opportunities under EDA\u2019s Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP). One part of the symposium was devoted to drawing the lessons learned from recent EDA helicopter exercises, such as \u2018Hot Blade 18\u2019 (held at Beja Air Base No 11, Portugal, in May 2018), from the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), where German and Belgian NH90 helicopters were integrated in one detachment, as well as the Czech Republic\u2019s experience in preparing for the EU battle group.\u00a0 Symposium attendees also received detailed information on how military helicopter training and simulator training is done in the different Member States with briefings provided by Austria, Belgium, Greece and Germany.\u00a0 A new topic on the annual EDA Helicopter Tactics Symposium were the training and use of attack helicopters by different European countries. Briefings were delivered by specialists from Germany (EC665 Tiger), Greece (AH-64 Apache), Hungary (Mi 24) and Italy (A-129 Mangusta). The debate resulted in a concrete proposal to add a completely new chapter on Attack Helicopter Tactics in the HEP Standard Operating Procedures (HEP SOP), the capstone tactics\u2019 manual for multinational European helicopter operations.\u00a0 Industry was also present during the symposium by means of a small exhibition including various\u00a0 new technologies and briefings on spatial disorientation and night vision goggle (NVG) training, as well as mission planning tools.\u00a0 Looking ahead, symposium participants were briefed on upcoming HEP exercises, including Dark Blade 2019 (to be held in the Czech Republic) and Swift Blade 2020 (to be held in the BENELUX), which will focus on national and multinational training, including the performance of Joint and Combined Composite Air Operations (COMAO) in demanding environmental conditions and high threat scenarios. \u00a0 Successful 6th EDA Helicopter Tactics Instructor Course (HTIC)\u00a0 In the meantime, EDA keeps working on improving European helicopter interoperability through its Helicopter Tactics Instructor Courses (HTIC) the 6th of which was completed on 30 September after eight weeks of intensive training performed in Linton on Ouse RAF base (UK) and in Arvidsjaur Airport in Northern Sweden. With trainees from Sweden, Austria, Norway and the UK (representing both the Support Helicopter and the Attack Helicopter communities), the course offered a unique opportunity to foster operational interoperability and cooperation, whilst conducting advanced tactical flying training. \u00a0 \u00a0 Now in its 6th year, the HTIC continues to deliver high-end flying training in Electronic Warfare, Tactical Formation and Evasion Training and other advanced helicopter operations. During the first year, all the tactical skills are taught in the classroom, on the simulator and, eventually, during the live flying phase. During the second year,\u00a0 Bronze trainees begin a two-year programme to reach Silver and Gold qualifications, confirming their suitability for taking on the role of instructors. The complexity of the courses increases gradually over time until the final week, when trainees are expected to carry out complex Composite Air Operation (COMAO) tasks against Electronic Warfare Ground-Based Air Defence Systems, Fast-Jet aggressors and a whole range of low-tech weapon systems.\u00a0 Five Tactics Instructors graduated from this year\u2019s course whereas seven trainees are now eligible to complete the Silver Level in the coming years. As usually, the HTIC was supported by a range of units including 100 Sqn Hawks from the UK, Gripens from the Swedish Air Force, EW systems from Polygone in Germany, as well as staff from 8 Sqn, 606 Sqn, 600 Sqn, Joint Helicopter Command and the Swedish Air Force,\u00a0 and Tactics Instructors from Austria, Germany, Sweden and the UK.

Directors discussed the updated version of the Overarching Strategic Research Agenda (OSRA) which provides a necessary link between R&T efforts and the military tasks and long-term capability needs of the Capability Development Plan (CDP).\u00a0 Combining a top-down approach (from capability needs to technologies) and a bottom-up approach (from new emerging technologies to capabilities), OSRA aims at streamlining Europe\u2019s defence research priorities and informing Member States\u2019 decision-making process on defence research. Practically speaking, OSRA identified a number of R&T areas, the so-called Technology Building Blocks (TBBs), in which a cooperative approach at the European level would bring an added-value to support the development of defence capabilities. In a second step, OSRA will also identify appropriate funding instruments. This information is expected to help Ministries of Defence to decide whether to lead or contribute to cooperative ad-hoc R&T projects and will also inform funding decisions taken in the context of the European Defence Fund (EDF). \u00a0 Updated OSRA validated At today\u2019s meeting, R&T Directors validated the outcome of the OSRA review (OSRA v2), including the 139 developed TBBs and the results of the application of the approved OSRA prioritisation methodology. They also tasked EDA Captechs and Working Groups to develop TBB roadmaps for the highly prioritized TBBs by June 2019. In close cooperation with the participating Member States, EDA will continue to update the TBBs and to further investigate cooperation opportunities for each of them, including the appropriate funding instruments. EDA will also look into the Lessons Identified during the prioritisation and implementation phases of OSRA v2. These Lessons Identified will be presented for an initial discussion to the R&T Steering Board in 2020 in view of the next OSRA version, and in synchronisation with the next CDP revision.

The warning about the dangers ahead is coming from the very people who are working on artificial intelligence: researchers, pioneers, and business people as well, who don't want to see their own discoveries exploited for malicious goals\".\u00a0 Against this background, the EU\u00a0has a very special role to play \u2013 as a promoter of new global rules to protect our citizens' security, and at the same time, as a force for innovation and progress at the service of human beings, she stressed. \"So first of all, we are working to build consensus on what should and should not be allowed in the field of autonomous weapons. We would like scientists and researchers to be free to do their job knowing that their discoveries will not be used to harm innocent people. Together we can define the boundaries of artificial intelligence applications, so that within those limits, scientists are free to explore the immense positive potential of artificial intelligence\",\u00a0said Ms Mogherini, adding: \"Our position on this has always been very clear: all weapon systems should comply with international law, and humans must always remain in control of the use of lethal force\".\u00a0 Work is currently ongoing at the United Nations to define a first set of guiding principles on autonomous weapons, and this work needs close cooperation between governments, the industry and civil society. \u00a0 \"No time to waste on Artificial Intelligence\" Supporting innovation and having a strong industry is essential for Europe's security, and this is also true with artificial intelligence, Ms Mogherini stated. \"Almost 50 per cent of global private investment in artificial intelligence start-ups is happening in China. We Europeans cannot afford to waste time, and to be less innovative than other world powers. It is a matter of economic growth, and it is a matter of security\".\u00a0 Our European defence industries and research laboratories are among the best in the world. And yet, investment from European national governments in research and technology in the field of defence continue to decrease, she underlined. \"We, as the European Union, cannot tell national institutions how much to spend on defence or on research. What we can do \u2013 and what we are doing, is to incentivize our Member States to join forces, create new economies of scale, to the benefit of our industry and of our collective security. This is the logic behind all the work we have been doing on security and research, with the European Defence Agency, with the European Commission and with our Member States\". \u00a0 EDA's essential contribution to recent EU defence initiatives The revised Capability Development Plan (CDP), the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD), the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the European Defence Fund (EDF) are all tools recently set up to allow and foster increased defence cooperation. The European Defence Agency, Ms Mogherini said, \"provided an essential contribution in crafting these initiatives, to ensure their coherence and to help turn them into concrete action\".\u00a0 The Europe of defence is taking shape, and in the years ahead, the role of the European Defence Agency will be even more important, she stressed. \"This can be the hub where governments and the industry meet. A place for coordination among national defence policies, following the guiding light of innovation and of our collective security\". \u00a0 More information Speech by Head of Agency Federica Mogherini at the EDA 2018 Annual Conference \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/11/29/federica-mogherini-opens-annual-conference-focused-on-unmanned-and-autonomous-systems"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0130", "date": "2018-11-23", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA Chief Executive visits Ukraine", "text": " EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq held talks today (23 November) in Kiev with First Ukrainian Deputy Minister of Defence Mr Ivan Rusnak, and representatives from other national authorities.

Savvas Angelides, Minister of Defence of Cyprus gave a keynote speech. Led by the ESDC, the platform builds on the support already provided by the European Defence Agency (EDA), the European External Action Service (EEAS) and the European Commission. The main task of the ETEE platform within the ESDC is the coordination of cyber security and defence training and education for EU Member States. The existing training will be harmonised and standardised and new courses will close the gaps between training needs and training activities. These efforts will be jointly undertaken by various stakeholders and partner organisations. \u2018Looking at the future, the platform\u2019s success is very much in the hands of the Member States.\u00a0 There is much to be achieved and the Executive Academic Board on Cyber (EAB.Cyber) under the chair of the ESDC is an excellent forum to manage the future\u2019, Mr Domecq said in his speech. In response to Member States\u2019 requirement to fill the skills gap in cyber defence, EDA played an important role in developing the design proposal of this platform, following the results of a relevant feasibility study which were properly adapted to the actual Member States\u2019 needs. The Global Strategy\u00a0 already referred to cyber attack as a serious threat to be dealt with in order to protect the EU citizens and a threat to national security due to the disruptive potential of these attacks and their high impact on modern societies. Heads of State and Government identified cyber among the four key capability shortfalls in Europe and Member States in the frame of PESCO already established projects on cyber, where EDA with its role in the PESCO secretariat but also in the frame of its mission for cooperative capability development provides support.\u00a0 Member States saw the need for coherence at EU level on cyber education, training and exercises already some 8 years ago, and voiced as such within the Capability Development Plan.\u00a0 The EDA has worked on this priority with Member States, within the Project Team for Cyber Defence and with colleagues in the European External Action Service and Cyber was reconfirmed as a priority in the revised CDP. Based on the EDA Cyber Defence Training Needs Analysis and the experiences gained in cyber security training of the ESDC, work was initiated to establish CSDP Training and Education for different audiences, including EEAS, personnel from CSDP missions and operations and Member States' officials. The integration of ETEE into the existing structures of the ESDC was concluded and has been taken forward by EDA and ESDC throughout the course of this past year, resulting in a vehicle to enable sustained delivery of cyber defence education, training and exercise services and products, while seeking synergies with respective NATO initiatives, also in the frame of the implementation of the EU-NATO Joint Declaration. \u00a0 More information: Cyber defence (EDA project page) ESDC statement on Cyber Platform EEAS communication on ETEE inauguration ceremony EEAS article on Handbook on Cybersecurity: 'Cybersecurity is a collective responsibility' EU publication:\u00a0Handbook on cyber security\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/11/20/cyber-education-training-exercise-and-evaluation-(etee)-platform-launched"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0134", "date": "2018-11-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Half way from the concept to joint technology demonstration", "text": " 60 experts approximately from 5 nations (Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway and Poland) jointly trialed technology demonstrators developed under the EDA IED Detection programme (IEDDET) in October 2018, Austria. The joint trials aimed at data collection for all technology demonstrators developed within the IEDDET three projects VMEWI3, MUSICODE and CONFIDENT under the same operation conditions. \u00a0 Joint test area The Allentsteig test area for the EDA IEDDET programme joint trials was provided by Austria as contribution to the IEDDET programme. For these trials a special 500m test-lane, free of metal scrap was tailored and built for the MUSICODE field-test programme. For VMEWI3 two test lanes, each of 2000m length, were provided. On each these test lanes 15 georeferenced IEDs were buried. On the VMEWI3 test-lanes the full IED-vignettes were arranged. \u00a0 Initial IEDDET projects observations The objective of the VMEWI3 technology demonstrator is to provide early warning of indirect IED indicators by using a suite of forward looking camera systems on an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). Real-time detection and decision fusion is applied to enhance the overall detection performance. The operator of the system is located in a moving manned vehicle following the unmanned detection platform at safe distance with the same speed, and will be able to confirm, reject and manually add detections. For the first joint EDA IEDDET trial a demonstrator was developed consisting of a multi-camera head with nine tailormade camera systems each focusing on a specific set of indicators, such as ground signs, man-made objects and markers. The multi-camera head was mounted on a panning unit allowing the head to follow the road curvatures and to be aimed at a suspect object when halted for inspection. The multi-camera head, together with a highly accurate positioning system was mounted on an unmanned ground vehicle to provide stand-off. Both the multi-sensor head and the unmanned ground vehicle could be remotely controlled from a control vehicle. Single sensor detection algorithms were developed and also software to allow the detections of each camera to be registered to the same reference image for fusion. The highly accurate position and pose of the camera system is required to map the detected indicators in world coordinates on a map and decision processing. During the trial synchronized data acquisition with all nine camera systems and the positioning system was achieved on four kilometers of test lane on which vignettes had been emplaced. Data was primarily collected with a manned UGV, up to speeds of 15km/h, to obtain maximum quality data for offline analysis, detection and fusion algorithm development in the coming year of the programme. Additionally, remote control of the UGV during data acquisition with the multi-sensor platform was demonstrated up to speeds of approximately 20km/h. The images of all nine cameras were remotely (wireless) displayed in the Control Vehicle. Real-time processing and depiction of multi-camera early warnings to an operator was achieved in simulation mode by replaying the recorded data as if in real-time and for live data on a static UGV. The trial results will be used to further develop detection and fusion algorithms and to achieve real-time early warning on a moving UGV.\u00a0The detected indicators will be exchanged offline with the MUSICODE and CONFIDENT projects in EDA IEDDET Joint Detection Map (JDM). The aim of the MUSICODE project is to demonstrate an improved Technology Readiness Level 5 multi sensor detection approach compared to available systems. Data from several sources will be used to enhance the capability of IED detection.\u00a0 Four different on-board sensor systems based on already known technologies, with the addition of existing detections from the VMEWI3 technology demonstrator as well as a priori available intelligence information. The goal is to combine this information to strengthen the confidence in (combined) alarms, and possibly reduce the false alarm rate. Running several sensor systems on the same platform, with the addition of remote control and data links and high precision GPS positioning is particularly challenging with respect to cross talk and interference between systems.\u00a0 Preliminary interference anechoic chamber trials were already conducted at an earlier stage, and one of the main goals in Allentsteig was to repeat these trials under field conditions and with the inclusion of mitigation measures pointed out during the first lab experiments. A second goal was to obtain a realistic detection data set for each on-board sensor system. For this purpose, dedicated targets were produced and emplaced by the various teams. The third goal was to run the system with the tactical vignette targets also used by the other projects. This was performed partly on a completely clutter free test lane, and partly on the so-called tactical lane which was shared with the other teams.\u00a0 The combined IEDDET Programme data set will be used to discuss and implement the EDA IEDDET JDM solution.\u00a0 Finally, the Allentsteig trials resulted in the first shake-down of technical solutions in general terms, also with respect to mechanical design. \u00a0 Participants to the 1rst joint IEDDET programme trials The project CONFIDENT has the objective to provide demonstrator platforms of an UGV and an UAV, equipped with suitable sets of sensors for close-in confirmation and identification of IEDs. In addition, CONFIDENT will add airborne early-warning capabilities. These platforms will take action on IEDs already detected by VMEWI3 and MUSICODE, either after excavation in route-clearance scenarios or, if placed above-ground, particularly in urban scenarios including CBRNE-threat. At the first joint EDA IEDDET trials the focus of the CONFIDENT test programme was on testing three newly developed sensors under field conditions. All sensors were operated mounted on the UGV. The scenario of an excavated IED was simulated by a dummy-IED. The UAV for close-in inspection was tested for the capability of airborne chemical detection. Two types of UAV have been tested with the different scenarios. Regarding airborne early warning capabilities, a software-tool is being developed to detect the defined IED indicators. The photographic material for this development has been collected by flights of the Schibel-Camcopter capturing scenarios provided by role-players. Additionally, airborne early warning capabilities have also been demonstrated with a swarm of drones. Data and lessons learned from the 2018 trials will be used for information fusion and the next iteration of development towards the final EDA IEDDET trials and demonstration in 2019/2020. \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/11/19/half-way-from-the-concept-to-joint-technology-demonstration"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0135", "date": "2018-11-20", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Outcome of EDA Ministerial Steering Board", "text": " The European Defence Agency\u2019s (EDA) ministerial Steering Board met this Tuesday morning under the chairmanship of the Head of the Agency, Federica Mogherini. Defence ministers notably discussed the CARD Trial Run Report, the implementation of the 11 new EU Capability Development Priorities and the Agency\u2019s 2019 budget. \u00a0 Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD) Ministers discussed the main findings, recommendations and lessons learned of the CARD Trial Run report and agreed to establish CARD as a standing activity with the first full cycle to be launched in autumn 2019. Some main findings indicate that Member States still carry defence planning and acquisition mostly from a national perspective. CARD will provide the overview that will allow Member States to better coordinate their defence planning and spending and engage in collaborative projects, improving consistency in Member States defence spending and overall coherence of the European capability landscape. The report also confirmed an upwards trend of defence spending over the 2015-2019 period, even if it also shows that investment in defence research and development has decreased over recent years. The CARD \u2018lessons learned\u2019 for the future will be further explored in a series of workshops organised by EDA in the coming weeks and months. \u201cCARD is designed to be a \u2018pathfinder\u2019 helping Member States to get a better picture of the European capability landscape and identifying new opportunities for cooperation on capability development and procurement, while avoiding duplication of work with NATO\u201d, Jorge Domecq, EDA\u2019s Chief Executive, commented. \u00a0 Implementation of the 2018 EU Capability Development Priorities Last June, Member States approved 11 new EU Capability Development Priorities, which are the baseline and key reference for CARD, PESCO and the European Defence Fund. Ministers were updated on their practical implementation which will be pursued through \u2018Strategic Context Cases\u2019 for each of the 11 priorities together with Member States, in close coordination with the EU Military Committee (EUMC) and the EU Military Staff (EUMS), also involving the EU defence industry. The first version of the 11 \u2018Strategic Context Cases\u2019 will be presented to the steering board in June 2019 for approval. \u00a0 Cooperative Financial Mechanism (CFM) Ministers were updated on the state of play regarding the establishment of the Cooperative Financial Mechanism (CFM) and endorsed the proposed way ahead. In cooperation with the European Investment Bank (EIB), the objective is to make the CFM a tool to sup-port cooperative projects inter alia where unsynchronised defence budgets hinder or impede the launch or implementation of such projects. The European Council called since 2016 for an increased support from the EIB to the defence and security sector. EDA offered its expertise to the EIB for materializing this support and a Memorandum of Understanding has been signed in February 2018 between the two institutions. Negotiations of the CFM Programme Arrangement (PA) were recently finalized; the document is now under staffing in the capitals. \u00a0 2019 General Budget & 3-Year Planning Framework 2019-2021 No unanimous agreement could be found at the Steering Board on a 2019 General Budget that would allow the Agency to carry forward its increasing number of tasks including in relation to CARD, PESCO, the European Defence Fund or new activities such as Military Mobility. Subsequently, on 22 November, the Head of Agency proposed to Member States to allow the Agency to activate \u2018provisional twelfths\u2019 during the first quarter of 2019 on the basis of the 2018 General Budget level set at \u20ac32.5 million. Member States approved this way forward on 11 December, by written procedure. At the appropriate moment and taking into account the wider context, the Head of Agency will resubmit an EDA 2019 General Budget proposal for discussion and consideration by Member States. As a result of the inconclusive 2019 General Budget discussion, Ministers were informed during the Steering Board that, at this stage, no agreement on the EDA 3-Year Planning Framework 2019-2021 could be reached and that the Agency would revert to Member States in due time to address the way ahead.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 EDA press contacts Helmut BRULS Media & Communications Officer helmut.bruls@eda.europa.eu T+32 2 504 28 10 Catherine CIECZKO Media & Communications Officer catherine.cieczko@eda.europa.eu T+32 2 504 28 24 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/11/20/outcome-of-eda-ministerial-steering-board"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0136", "date": "2018-10-30", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA Chief Executive visits Denmark", "text": " On 30 October, upon invitation by the Danish authorities, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq paid a visit to Denmark where he met with the Minister of Defence, Claus Hjort Frederiksen, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry for Industry, Business and Financial Affairs, Thomas Ditmer, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ulrik Vestergaars Knudsen, as well as other government officials and industry representatives.

A total of 24 companies and research institutes from across Europe participated in the contest. A jury thoroughly assessed each of the proposals and reached agreement on the two winners who are awarded \u20ac10,000 each.\u00a0 \u00a0 The winning ideas AITEX won in the category \u2018Autonomous detection, identification and monitoring through sensor and platform networking in the area of CBRN protection technologies and techniques\u2019 with a smart textile idea: a \u2018wearable computing\u2019 system composed of many electronic devices (including sensors able to monitor environmental and personal parameters) fully integrated into textile solutions. For this purpose, it is proposed to develop Electronic Noses (ENs) integrated into textiles based on an array of sensors composed of Graphene Oxide (GO) capable of identifying and quantifying a wide range of chemical warfare agents. The complete system would be printed on a textile substrate obtaining a fully wearable system which has significant advantages compared to traditional rigid and semiportable ENs. Clover Technologies won the prize in the category \u2018Integration of multi-robot swarming concepts in support of future defence capabilities in the area of GNC\u2019 with an idea based on a blockchain-based solution to provide a common platform for swarm nodes with an extra security layer. Swarm robotics is an emerging technology facing many challenges such as computational and storage limitations, heterogeneous communication protocols, information security, etc. The idea put forward by the winner aims at a solution which would facilitates the communication of the swarm robotic nodes within a secure environment that offers integrity, confidentiality and authentication. The projected solution is composed of: - a blockchain platform which allows a secure coordination of a swarm robotic; - a Group Key Distribution Algorithm which allows to manage, in a secure way, the joining/leaving operations within a swarm robotic; - and Java Card technology, which offers a tamper resistant solution to storage and manage the sensitive information in a robot. \u00a0 Background AITEX, based in Alcoy (Spain), is a leading Spanish centre of research, innovation and advanced technical services for the textile sector.

The Forum brings together experts from the defence and energy sectors to share information and best practices on improving energy management, energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy as well as increasing the protection and resilience of defence energy-related critical infrastructures. Managed by EDA, the Consultation Forum is a European Commission initiative (DG ENER) receiving funding under the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 R&I programme. The\u00a0 \u00a0conference of today was officially opened by Mr Tomasz Zdzikot, Polish Deputy Minister of Defence. Jorge Domecq, the EDA Chief Executive highlighted in his speech the \u201clarge number of participants which send the strong message that sustainable energy matters for defence, and a greener defence energy matters for the European Union\u201d. Mr Hans Van Steen, Acting Director for Renewables, Research and Innovation, Energy Efficiency, DG ENER, European Commission, underlined the importance of having seen \u201ca network develop, information being exchanged, best practices being shared, and capacity, trust and self-confidence grow\u201d. The Consultation Forum provides a unique platform that can assist the Ministries of Defence of the EU Member States to generate ideas for defence energy policies, strategies, action plans and defence energy-related project ideas. This process will enable them to move towards a more sustainable energy model bringing down energy bills that can be allocated to other military priorities. In this respect, the second phase is more project-oriented, and as the Chief Executive underlined, it \u201cpresents a financial and strategic opportunity to improve energy efficiency and to diversify the energy supply and enhance resilience to security challenges\u201d.\u00a0Mr Hans Van Steen drew the participants\u2019 attention to the fact that \u201cAt a time of tight defence budgets, the Defence and Security sector cannot afford to ignore the opportunities that a state-of-the-art approach to energy efficiency and renewable energy sources offer in terms of economic advantages, security of supply and environmental impact\u201d. He then added that, in this context, \u201cIt is very important that the Defence community has a clear understanding of how the new EU legislation on energy could affect its work. The Energy Union Framework Strategy is not only about energy and climate: it is part of a wider policy aimed at accelerating the fundamental modernisation of Europe's entire economy, making it low-carbon and energy and resource efficient, by transforming the whole energy system in a socially fair manner.\u201c The Warsaw Conference focusses on a range of financing and funding options, coming either from the national public sector or the European Union instruments. To support this process, the Chief Executive has launched today the European Funding Gateway for Energy in Defence, a dedicated web-page on the EDA website. Through this instrument, he encourages the participants to explore what is \u201can overview of the financing and funding opportunities that the defence sector, and the Ministries of Defence and Armed Forces, industry, research and technology organisations or academia, can access at the European level for energy-related projects\u201d. The Conference will last two days and address several topics ranging from energy data in defence, energy metering & data collection, energy performance contracts, RES projects including energy storage to critical energy infrastructure resilience and energy-related legislation. \u00a0 Next Conference The third Conference of the Consultation Forum will be hosted by the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Cyprus and will take place in Nicosia on 26 and 27 February 2019. \u00a0 About the CF SEDSS II The Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector (CF SEDSS) is a European Commission initiative managed by the EDA. It aims at bringing together experts from the defence and energy sectors to share information and best practices on improving energy management, energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy as well increasing the protection and resilience of defence energy-related critical infrastructures. On 20 October 2017, the second phase of the Consultation Forum (CF SEDSS II) was launched. This project has received funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, and the agreement is between the EASME executive agency and the EDA. The contract was signed on 16 October 2017 for 22 months, expiring on August 2019.\u00a0 Based on the foundations laid during the first phase of the Consultation Forum (2015-2017), the second phase has been further expanded to cover the following interrelated subjects though three main working groups (including sub-working groups): WG 1: Energy Management including Energy Efficiency (Sub-WG1: Energy Management and Sub-WG2: Energy Efficiency; WG 2: Renewable Energy Sources and Technologies; WG 3: Protection of Critical Energy Infrastructure and one cross-cutting theme: Finance.

The two-day event brings together key stakeholders from national authorities, industry, European agencies and international organisations, to exchange views and best practices related to the harmonisation of European military airworthiness rules and standards. Common airworthiness approaches and standards are viewed as critical enablers for enhanced European defence cooperation.\u00a0 In his opening speech, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq thanked the Spanish authorities for hosting the event and for their strong support and involvement in the MAWA Forum. He recalled the creation of the Forum 10 years ago and stressed that since then, a comprehensive set of European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) was developed and implemented by Member States.\u00a0 \u201cAlthough the levels of EMAR-implementation vary from country to country, based on this harmonised approach a total of 40 recognitions between military airworthiness authorities have been signed in the last five years and are now viewed as cornerstones for the structural cooperation between authorities. I would call this a remarkable result\u201d, Mr Domecq stated. In addition, the MAWA initiative is getting stronger attention outside Europe, on a global level. \u201cSeveral non-EDA participating nations (e.g Norway, Denmark, Switzerland and Australia) have embraced the same approach, are in the process of implementing EMAR\u2019s in their national systems and are engaged in mutual recognitions with National Military Airworthiness Authorities\u201d, he said. Furthermore, Member States are now acknowledging that harmonised safety requirements are beneficial for everyone, even beyond the airworthiness domain. \u201cAs a result, Member States have tasked EDA to develop a proposal for the progressive introduction of a Total System Approach to Military Aviation on the basis of two pilot projects, notably RPAS and military transport aircraft. This proposal, that should give a new impetus to the harmonisation of safety requirements in military aviation, will be presented to Member States at the end of this year\u201d, the EDA Chief Executive announced.\u00a0 He also stressed the \u201coutstanding cooperative relationship with NATO\u201d in the area of military aviation.\u00a0 \u00a0 Background The Military Airworthiness Authorities (MAWA) Forum oversees the development and maintenance of the European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) and promotes ways and means to harmonise the military airworthiness oversight across Europe.\u00a0 A central theme of this year\u2019s conference is the implementation of a new airworthiness roadmap as a next step in the progressive alignment of airworthiness approaches in Europe. In this context, participants exchange views on the impact the EMARs have had so far, both on the regulated community and the military airworthiness authorities. The conference also addresses the challenges of transitioning towards EMAR-based regulations in the coming years. Other topics on the agenda are the evolution of the cooperation framework between national military airworthiness authorities, as well as global developments.

The agenda of the conference themed 'From Development to Implementation' includes a topic on civil-military cooperation. The EDA plays a key role in this domain and at EU level, to facilitate the coordination of military views and act as interface between the Military community and the EU institutions. As a result, EDA coordinated the development of the working paper proposed by the EU on this topic. ICAO Member States and aviation stakeholders attend the conference to exchange on global strategies for safety and air navigation planning, development and implementation. As part of the European Union delegation mandated by Violeta Bulc, European Commissioner for Mobility and Transport, Mr Christophe Vivier, Head of Unit SES/SEAR, and Mr Denis Bouvier, Project Officer SES Policy, will participate on behalf of the EDA. This year\u2019s conference focuses on the implementation of operational improvements from the conceptual phase until deployment. It emphasizes the importance of concepts for global use, the development of regional implementation plans and the local implementation of performance improvements, based on specific operational requirements in a cost-effective approach. Participants will establish priorities for safety and air navigation planning for the coming years and develop a set of high-level recommendations in different key performance areas of the air navigation system, to be submitted to the ICAO Council for subsequent endorsement by the 40th Session of the ICAO Assembly in 2019. In close collaboration with the European Commission Directorate General for Mobility and Transport (DG MOVE) the Agency contributes to technical discussions on civil-military cooperation and coordinates the European Union\u2019s military inputs towards it. Civil-military cooperation is necessary to enhance Air Traffic Management (ATM) as well as communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS), and to create a safe and more interoperable airspace. Its goal is to move from coordination to collaboration and from ATM research and development to implementation. This contribution from the EDA reflects the strong collaboration links forged with DG MOVE regarding the military side of the SES/SESAR operations. The overall objective is to ensure that a modernised aviation system will accommodate the needs of all stakeholders, including the military, for operations and training, all types of platforms (manned and unmanned) and all types of missions, roles and applications, in a balanced and proportioned way, in peace time and in crisis situations. In preparation for this important event, the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) set up an ad-hoc ECAC/EU coordination group for safety and ATM in which the EDA was represented. This group, co-chaired by the European Commission and by ECAC, has been tasked to steer the preparation of draft \u2018European Working and Information Papers\u2019 to be presented at AN-Conf/13. Regarding Civil-Military cooperation, the AN-Conf/13 will be invited to agree on four recommendations: Urge States to agree with the strategic approach moving from civil-military coordination to collaboration. Request ICAO to provide appropriate guidelines on the strategic approach. Encourage ICAO to develop together with States mechanisms to collaborate with the military community at global and regional levels. Request ICAO to reinforce the development of civil-military synergies thanks to an effective collaboration starting from research and development to deployment of interoperable systems. The final report will be available in two weeks. \u00a0 More information: ICAO website Committee A - Agenda Item 3: Enhancing the global air navigation system (video) \u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/10/15/eda-takes-the-lead-in-coordinating-the-military-for-civil-military-discussions-at-icao-conference"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0144", "date": "2018-10-10", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA supported course relevant to defence receives ERASMUS+ funding", "text": " The European Union\u2019s ERASMUS+ programme, funded by the European Commission to support education and training, has awarded \u20ac3 million for a transnational advanced Master course relevant to defence called EMIMEO: 'Erasmus Mundus on Innovative Microwave Electronics and Optics'. \u00a0 EDA contributed with data analysis to the application which was put forward by a consortium led by the Universit\u00e9 de Limoges in France to access ERASMUS+ funding.\u00a0 EDA\u2019s support to EMIMEO is justified by the fact that it addresses analog RF Photonics and Microwaves which are in the critical defence technologies list and also part of the Capability Development Plan (CDP) where they are considered as enablers for advanced radars and electronic warfare systems. The European defence industry and research institutes are looking for engineers and researchers with skills and competences in this complex field. Under its activities related to Key Strategic Activities (KSA) in defence meant to identify key domains for European strategic autonomy, EDA has selected the area of RF Photonics as a relevant sample case. The EMIMEO Master course will contribute to support European skills and competencies in this domain, as well as the competitiveness and non-dependence of the European high-tech industry (including defence and space) in the development of Photonics and Microwave applications. \u00a0 The international partnership (encompassing industry, universities and associations in 6 Member States) includes the following participants: Universit\u00e0 di Brescia (Italy), Universidad Del Pais Vasco/ Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea (Spain), Aston University (United Kingdom), Universitatea Tehnica Cluj-Napoca (Romania); Altran Italia SpA and Hitachi Rail Italy SpA in Italy; GMV Aerospace and Defence SA, and TTI Norte SL in Spain; Oclaro Technology Ltd in United Kingdom; European Microwave Association in Belgium; Alcatel-Lucent International Sas, Amcad Engineering, Competitiveness cluster Alpha-RLH, Callisto France, III-V Lab, Inoveos, NOKIA, CNES, Thales Alenia Space France, Thales SA and United Monolithic Semiconductors SAS, Zodiac Aerospace\u00a0 in France.

EDA Deputy Chief Executive Olli Ruutu and EDA\u2019s European Synergies & Innovation (ESI) Director, Denis Roger, were among the panelists participating in these debates.\u00a0 In his opening speech, Minister Kunasek stressed the importance for Europe to have an \u201cinnovative and competitive European defence industry\u201d. \u201cWe therefore require new ways of cooperation between Armed Forces, entreprises, industry and the research community in order to find scientific, technological and capability-based solutions, and to activate value chains that help us strengthen our security and defence competence\u201d, he stated.\u00a0\u00a0 EDA Chief Executive Domecq, in his speech, insisted on the need to ensure coherence and consistency between the EDF and the other EU defence initiatives, especially the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD) and the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO). On top of that, the baseline for all three initiatives should be the 2018 Capability Development Plan (CDP).\u00a0\u201cEven if we ensure that all three initiatives \u2013 CARD, PESCO, EDF - are smoothly coordinated and harmonised, there is one element which is indispensable for coherent capability development at European level, and that is common priority setting, which must be the baseline for CARD, PESCO and EDF\u201d, he said. In the research domain, common priority setting is ensured by the Overarching Strategic Research Agenda (OSRA) which links capability priorities and defence research activities. \u201cWhat the CDP is for capability development, the OSRA is for research. Before the end of the year, we will, for the first time, have adopted agreed research priorities stemming from the CDP 2018, that can be used for not only ad-hoc research activities among Member States but also for the Research Window of the EDF projects and other funding instruments such as H2020, Horizon Europe, ESIF, COSME, and more\u201d, Mr Domecq announced. It is important that the EDF takes into account the experiences from the EDIDP discussions, as well as the lessons learned from the implementation of the Preparatory Action on Defence Research and the previous Pilot Project, the EDA Chief Executive said.\u00a0 If the Defence Fund is capability driven, focused on the agreed priorities and coherent with the other defence initiatives, \u201cthen it has a great potential added value in the development of European defence capabilities and incentivizing cooperation\u201d, Mr Domecq concluded. \u00a0 More information: Conference website \u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/10/02/vienna-conference-highlights-research-potential-of-european-defence-fund"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0146", "date": "2018-09-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Cyber Ranges Federation Project reaches new milestone", "text": " EDA\u2019s Cyber Ranges Federation project, in which 11 Member States will federate their national cyber ranges and improve their respective Cyber Defence training capabilities, reached an important milestone with the completion of its first development phase (\u2018Spiral one\u2019). With several EU Member States developing their own national cyber ranges, this project aims at developing a system to interconnect and federate them into a highly effective European network that benefits from the strengths of each participant.\u00a0 The objective is to develop a more sophisticated and powerful platform enabling exercise and training planners to design more realistic scenarios relying on existing and interconnected capabilities. At the same time, it will allow users to improve their Cyber Defence skills by relying on an extremely effective environment. In addition to training and exercise support, the federated capability will also be beneficial for other activities such as research, modelling, simulation and testing. The sharing of knowledge and best practices is another objective of the project.\u00a0 The Cyber Ranges Federation will be supported by a web-based Cyber Defence Training and Exercise Coordination Platform (CD TEXP), an EDA product currently in a test phase, whose capabilities will be extended to support the project. The EDA also provides expertise and support in Cyber Defence and other areas. The first phase of the project, led by The Netherlands, was focused on developing formal requirements and a draft high level technical architecture to interconnect national cyber ranges. The requirements were produced leveraging knowledge and experience from all participant Member States, including military and academia representatives. NATO was involved in the first phase as an observer. In light of the 2016 EU-NATO Joint Declaration, additional ways for cooperation and coordination with NATO\u2019s own capabilities will also be investigated by the project team in the next phase. \u00a0 Second phase launched on 5 September The second phase of the project (\u2018Spiral two\u2019), led by Finland, kicked off on 5 September 2018 at a meeting in Helsinki (picture above). It will mainly focus on taking up the afore-mentioned requirements and implement them. The outcome will include the creation of a Community of Interest in which Cyber Defence training and exercise specialists will collaborate and improve the pooling & sharing of resources in this highly demanding domain.\u00a0 Earlier this year, six Member States signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) confirming their intent to contribute with their respective cyber range assets to the project; other Member States are expected to join the MoU before end of 2018. \u00a0 Background The success of military operations, including EU-led operations, is increasingly dependent on the availability of, and access to, cyberspace. The EU Cyber Security Strategy 2013 recognizes Cyber Defence as one of the strategic priorities of the EU and Heads of State and Governments decided in December 2013 that Cyber Defence should be one of four key areas for capability development.\u00a0 An essential element of EU cyber defence capability is highly skilled and well-trained personnel. Enhancing awareness and education of technicians, operators and decision-makers is urgent. Cyber ranges to support training and exercises are both essential and scarce. In the 2014 Capability Development Plan, the scarceness of cyber range facilities in support of Training and Exercises was recognized as an important capability gap that urgently needs resolution. The now established project serves to close this capability gap. Pooling & Sharing projects are an integral means for closing capability gaps in the cyber domain. \u00a0 More Information: Six Member States agree to pool & share cyber ranges capabilities (EDA news June 2018) Cyber Ranges: EDA\u2019s First Ever Cyber Defence Pooling & Sharing Project Launched By 11 Member States (EDA news May 2017) EDA Cyber Defence project page EDA Cyber Defence factsheet \u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/09/13/cyber-ranges-federation-project-reaches-new-milestone"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0147", "date": "2018-09-24", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "PESCO \u2018clarification workshop\u2019 held in EDA", "text": " End of last week (20/21 September), a \u2018clarification workshop\u2019 at expert level was organized by the PESCO Secretariat at the EDA with the aim of facilitating an exchange of information between the PESCO participating Member States and to provide details on the 33 new project proposals put forward by them as part of the second project assessment and selection round currently underway.\u00a0 The workshop was chaired by the PESCO Secretariat made up by the European External Action Service (EEAS), including the EU Military Staff (EUMS), and the EDA.

At that occasion, he welcomed the close and productive working relationship established between the EDA and OCCAR on the basis of the Administrative Arrangement signed in July 2012 and called for an even stronger cooperation in the future to bring forward potential new collaborative defence equipment programmes, also in view of the opportunities that the recent EU defence initiatives provide.\u00a0 \u201cI am very glad to be here today on the occasion of the 20th Anniversary of OCCAR. Since 2012, EDA and OCCAR have established close relations which are continuously evolving, aiming to complement each other\u2019s strengths in promoting effective defence cooperation while ensuring through-life capability development\u201d, Mr Domecq stated. The close relationship between the two organisations started immediately after the creation of the EDA in 2004 but gathered additional momentum in November 2008 when the EU Council of Ministers invited the EDA to seek the \u201cgreatest synergy\u201d with OCCAR and to conclude an Administrative Arrangement (AA), which was subsequently negotiated and signed in 2012. It foresees that both cooperate in a way that is \u201cmutually reinforcing, non-duplicative, coherent and complementary\u201d in order to enhance Europe\u2019s defence capabilities, improve European armaments cooperation and strengthen the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB). The conclusions and recommendations of EDA\u2019s Long Term Review (LTR), approved by Defence Ministers in May 2017, explicitly acknowledge \u201cthe potential of the EDA-OCCAR relations to further evolve into a more structured and reciprocal approach towards key European capability programmes, ensuring seamless coordination and coherence between both organisations\u201d.\u00a0 \u00a0 Division of labour While EDA main role is to initiate and facilitate European collaborative defence capability ad hoc projects and programmes, OCCAR\u2019s provides for cooperative programme management expertise. Close cooperation between EDA and OCCAR ensures through-life managementon capability development. This division of labour proved successful, for example, in the development of the Multinational Multi-Role Tanker Transport Fleet (MMF) in which participate five countries (NL, LUX, DE, NOR, BE) and whose aim is to mitigate Europe\u2019s shortfall in Air-to-Air refueling capabilities. Initiated by the EDA in 2012, it was later handed over to OCCAR who currently manages the acquisition of MRTT tankers on behalf of the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) which, following the acquisition phase, will be responsible for the complete life-cycle management of the fleet.\u00a0 Other example: the Medium Altitude Long Endurance Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (MALE RPAS) programme. Launched in an EDA framework in 2013, it was taken up by four Member States (DE, FR, IT, ES) before being handed over to OCCAR in 2016 for further development (definition, configuration, etc.) while EDA continues to provide support to the programme upon its expertise. Indeed, in September 2016, EDA and OCCAR concluded an arrangement under which EDA will continue to provide support to the MALE RPAS programme in the field of air traffic integration building on the work already achieved and on the on-going activities related to the integration of military RPAS in the Single European Sky approach.\u00a0 \u00a0 Background OCCAR was initially established by an Administrative Arrangement signed by the Defence Ministers of France, Germany, Italy and the UK on 12 November 1996. In 1998, the Defence Ministers of the four founding Member States signed the treaty-like \"OCCAR Convention\", which was subsequently ratified by the national Parliaments and came into force on 28th January 2001. The Convention gives OCCAR its legal status, allowing it to award contracts and to employ its own staff. Belgium and Spain joined OCCAR respectively in 2003 and 2005. \u00a0 More information: EDA-OCCAR Administrative Agreement\u00a0 OCCAR website \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/09/20/eda-chief-executive-attends-occar-20th-birthday-ceremony"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0150", "date": "2018-09-12", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "1st AAR Conference in Europe points at ways to fill capability gap", "text": " Some 200 experts, stakeholders, industry representatives and political/military decision-makers from the European, transatlantic and international Air-to-Air Refueling (AAR) community gathered today in Brussels for the 1st AAR Conference in Europe organized by the European Defence Agency (EDA). The event was opened with speeches and presentations by the Belgian Minister of Defence, Steven Vandeput,\u00a0 the Assistant Secretary General for NATO Defence investments, Camille Grand, the chairman of the\u00a0Aerial Refueling Systems Advisory Group (ARSAG), General John Sams, as well as the EDA Chief Executive, Jorge Domecq. Subsequent high-level speakers included the Commander of the European Air Transport Command (EATC), Maj. Gen. Laurent Marboeuf, the Mobilization Assistant to the Commander US Air Forces in Europe, Maj. Gen. John B.Williams, the Director of the Dutch Military Aviation Authority, Cdre. Jean-Paul Apon, the Chairman of the Multinational Multi-Role Tanker Transport Fleet (MMF), Cdr. Dick Kreiter, NATO Director Armament & Aerospace Capabilities (Defence Investment Division), Dr Giorgio Cioni, General Vincenzo Camporini from the Instituto Affari Internazionali as well as EDA Capability, Armament and Technology (CAT) Director, Martin Konertz. The conference discussed the current state of play (notably Europe\u2019s shortfall in this domain) as well as the future opportunities and challenges of Air-to-Air Refuelling from a European, transatlantic and international perspective. In successive sessions and panels, the political, operational and regulatory aspects and problems were analysed and possible solutions discussed.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 In his speech, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq praised AAR as a domain in which Europe is catching up on its shortfall in full complementarity with NATO. Even though Europe is still heavily dependent on US AAR assets, \u201cit is slowly but surely catching up thanks to national and multinational Air-to-Air Refuelling initiatives which aim to develop a future capability that meets our operational requirements\u201d, Mr Domecq said. The aim is not to duplicate NATO efforts but for Europe to be able to act and to become credible partners, he stressed. \u201cI very much welcome our NATO partners to this conference. The work we do together in AAR is exemplary for how we promote close EU-NATO cooperation. The joint political commitment complemented by the excellent staff-to-staff cooperation led to a synchronized and harmonized approach towards dealing with the AAR shortfall, both on the NATO and EU side\u201d. The EDA\u2019s AAR activities are fully synchronized with the NATO\u2019s roadmap on AAR improvements. \u201cThis prevents unnecessary duplication but more important creates opportunities for more collaboration (\u2026) By increasing the European AAR capability, the participating nations also strive to meet their NATO Defence Planning Process (NDPP) targets\u201d, Mr Domecq stated. \u201cThe MMF is a perfect example on how to get from the shortfall to a capability\u201d. \u00a0 Way ahead Conference participants widely agreed that considerable work still lies ahead as Europe\u2019s remaining 30% AAR shortfall, especially during operations, cannot be fixed overnight. Discussions pointed at a variety of complementary steps that should be taken to fill the gap in the comping years, in particular: promote and further expand the Multinational Multi-Role Tanker Transport Fleet (MMF) beyond the five current participating countries (Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, Norway, Belgium). To date, the fleet has ordered eight A330 MRTT aircraft the delivery of which is expected between 2020 and 2022. There are currently three options for additional aircraft in place (potential increase to 11 aircraft in total); encourage European countries with national AAR programmes in place to procure more assets, especially Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft; increase the procurement of A-400M wing pods to be pooled and shared; improve the standardization and streamlining of the international tanker clearance process. Background In December 2013, EU Heads of State and Government acknowledged AAR as a key capability shortfall and tasked the EDA to work on it. AAR subsequently became one of the Agency\u2019s Key Capability Programmes and the subject of an EDA Pooling and Sharing initiative which eventually led to the creation of a Multinational Multi-Role Tanker Transport Fleet (MMF). OCCAR, Europe\u2019s organization for the management of cooperative armament programmes, manages the MMF acquisition phase whereas the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) will be responsible for the complete life-cycle management of the fleet (A330 MRTT). The fleet is funded by the participating nations who will also have the exclusive right to use these NATO\u2013owned aircraft which will operate in a pooling arrangement. The aircraft will be configured for inflight refuelling, the transport of passengers and cargo, and medical evacuation flights. \u00a0 More information: Jorge Domecq speech at AAR Conference Speech Belgian Defence Minister Steven Vandeput Speech NATO ASG DI Camille Grand EDA AAR project page\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/09/12/1st-aar-conference-in-europe-points-at-ways-to-fill-capability-gap"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0151", "date": "2018-07-20", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA Industry Exchange Platform on RPAS Air Traffic Integration (ATI):  2nd call for papers", "text": " EDA has opened a 2nd call for papers from defence industry, academia and research institutes on the topic of Remotely Piloted Air Systems (RPAS) in the context to the EDA Industry Exchange Platform on RPAS Air Traffic Integration (ATI).

The main objectives of EDA\u2019s \u2019Additive Manufacturing Feasibility Study & Technology Demonstration\u2019 project were to assess the areas where AM technologies can have a positive impact on defence capabilities and to demonstrate their feasibility. The project, initiated in the framework of the CapTech Materials & Structures within the EDA Research & Technology domain, was organized around three work-strands: (i) a desktop study to place AM and its potential in a defence context, (ii) a technology demonstration of the feasibility of deploying these technologies in support of a military operation, (iii) an exhibition to senior military staff which took place in Spain in September 2017. The \u2019Additive Manufacturing: State of the Art and Strategic Report\u2019 describes the different additive manufacturing technologies and identifies existing capabilities in Europe. Issues related to a potential use of AM in defence, such as gaps in the value chain, IPRs (Intellectual/Industrial Property Rights), standardization and certification, test and evaluation, skills and education are also addressed, as well as an analysis of the future needs in these areas. Three value chains for implementation of AM in the most promising defence areas were developed, identifying the main limitations for AM implementation and providing solutions to overcome the existing barriers.

The Plan and its Priorities will be instrumental in identifying future cooperative activities irrespective of the chosen cooperation framework, including under PESCO and the European Defence Fund (EDF). \u201cSince 2016, the European defence project has picked up speed. Based on the 2016 EU Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy, several initiatives have been launched to reinforce defence cooperation: the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD), the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), and the European Defence Fund (EDF). Today\u2019s adopted EU Capability Development Priorities serve as their benchmark to ensure that their combined outcome will be a more coherent set of deployable, interoperable, sustainable capabilities and forces\u201d, says Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency (EDA). The Capability Development Plan (CDP) provides a full capability picture that supports decision-making processes at EU and national level regarding military capability development, thus contributing to increased coherence between Member States\u2019 defence planning. It addresses security and defence challenges from the perspective of European capability development, looks at the future operational environment and defines EU Capability Development Priorities agreed by Member States. The revised 2018 CDP has been developed in the framework of the European Defence Agency (EDA) in close cooperation with Member States and reflects key contributions from the EU Military Committee and the EU Military Staff. The CDP is a shared EU reference informing national capability planners on capability requirements over time. Member States\u2019 defence planners are encouraged to use it to identify priorities for capability improvement and opportunities for cooperation. \u00a0 A more output oriented CDP One of the novelties of the 2018 CDP is that it considers evolutions in the wider European security and defence environment taking into account the necessity to counter hybrid threats and the adaptation to the new EU Level of Ambition agreed by Member States. The 2018 Plan also looks at the entire spectrum of capability development and underpins the identification of cooperative activities that can be implemented by Member States in the cooperation framework of their choice. The 2018 CDP is output oriented and this will be further reinforced by the development of Strategic Context Cases as of the second half of 2018, with a view to support Member States in the implementation of the 2018 EU Capability Development Priorities. Subsequently the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD) will help operationalising the CDP by reviewing Member States\u2019 implementation of the 2018 EU Capability Development Priorities and by identifying additional opportunities for cooperation. Finally, the coherence between capability, R&T and industrial domains will be reinforced by the interaction between the CDP, the Overarching Strategic Research Agenda, Key Strategic Activities and the engagement with industry. \u00a0 The CDP Process The CDP includes a capability shortfalls analysis from the CSDP perspective, as well as lessons learned from recent operations provided by the EU Military Committee. The mid-term dimension assesses the potential for cooperation for each capability. The CDP finally offers an assessment of future trends (2035 and beyond) and needs for each capability by linking long-term technology trends to future capability requirements and related R&T needs as well as industrial perspectives. \u00a0 EU Capability Development Priorities Based on the identified trends, information gathered from Member States, the EU Military Committee and the EU Military Staff, a set of EU Capability Development Priorities were proposed by EDA and agreed by Member States. On the one hand, they address main capability shortfalls for deployed operations (land, maritime and air capabilities as well as logistic and medical support) with a reinforced focus on high-end warfare. On the other hand, they also cover other national focus areas, such as the adaptation of military capabilities required for territorial defence and security or cyber defence. The 2018 EU Capability Development Priorities cover the following lines of action: Enabling capabilities for cyber responsive operations Space-based information and communication services Information superiority Ground combat capabilities Enhanced logistic and medical supporting capabilities Naval manoeuvrability Underwater control contributing to resilience at sea Air superiority Air mobility Integration of military air capabilities in a changing aviation sector Cross-domain capabilities contributing to achieve EU\u2019s level of ambition After today\u2019s approval, EDA will start the preparatory work for the implementation of the 2018 Priorities, including through the elaboration of Strategic Context Cases. The Agency will also conduct bilateral training sessions with Member States in support of national defence planners as well as with the EU Military Staff, the European External Action Service and other stakeholders upon their request. \u00a0 More information: Capability Development Plan Factsheet CDP capability trends 2035+ ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/06/28/new-2018-eu-capability-development-priorities-approved"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0161", "date": "2018-06-11", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EU-NATO Joint Declaration: Third Progress Report published", "text": " Last week, the third progress report on the implementation of the common set of proposals on the implementation of the Joint Declaration, signed in Warsaw in July 2016, was presented to the EU and NATO Councils.\u00a0 \u00a0 In addition to the 42 proposals adopted on 6 December 2016, 32 new actions were added on 5 December 2017 including on topics such as counter-terrorism, women, peace and security and military mobility.

With 29 air assets flying a total of more than 550 hours and around 1,200 military participants, the exercise (the 12th held under the HEP umbrella) demonstrated once again the immense added value of collaborative multinational training for participating States\u2019 aircrews, maintenance staff, troops and support personnel under very demanding (hot, dusty, mountainous) conditions. Six Member States (Belgium, Germany, Hungary, The Netherlands, Slovenia and Portugal) deployed assets, including 21 helicopters of 7 different types (A-109, AS-532, EH-101, CH-47, MI-17, NH-90, SA-316). The first week included a complete day of briefings covering flight safety, expected battle rhythm, host nation support, and a helicopter academics session to refresh COMAO Mission Planning procedures. This theoretical element was followed by operational briefings designed to familiarise aircrews with Beja airbase, rehearse emergency procedures with firefighters and Special Operations Forces (SOF), get familiar with the different helicopter types and ensure high safety levels.\u00a0 The first week was completed with individual trainings, helicopter operations flown by day and by night, fighter evasion missions carried out with Portuguese F-16 fighter jets and helicopter firing drills. All participating Member States were able to reach their national training objectives.\u00a0 During the second week, flying crews performed complex missions in a demanding but realistic environment, making full use of the dusty and mountainous surroundings and shooting ranges. As the exercise advanced, the multinational crews conducted ever more complex coalition level trainings culminating in the planning and execution of several Composite Air Operation (COMAO) missions. These covered a spectrum of advanced helicopter manoeuvre tactics including a large formation of helicopters with embarked troops, integration of Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) teams and paratroopers jumping from a Mi-17 helicopter and a C-295 aircraft, all set against complex threats such as SA-8 SAM, missiles and F-16 fighter jets. Six instructors from Austria, Germany, Sweden and the UK, previously trained in EDA\u2019s Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC), formed the HOT BLADE 2018 Mentor Team. It supported the multinational crews in the preparation and execution of the COMAO missions and identified valuable Lessons Learned to be applied in future exercises. Other lessons will be drawn from a more in-depth analysis of the exercise results which is currently underway. The experience of planning, preparing and flying together in combined and joint missions is a critical requirement for maintaining operational readiness at a realistic level. With most nations facing budgetary constraints, such level of advanced training is almost impossible to achieve on a national basis.\u00a0 In addition to the cost benefits, the exercise also considerably improves interoperability which has become the trademark of the Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP) and which was also underlined by the Exercise Director in his closing remarks: \u201cTogether we are stronger\u201d.\u00a0 HOT BLADE 2018 proved to be another important milestone on the way to meeting the HEP\u2019s objective, namely to continuously improve Europe\u2019s operational helicopter capability.\u00a0 The next \u2018Blade\u2019 exercise is scheduled to take place in the Czech Republic in May 2019. \u00a0 More information:\u00a0 Hot Blade 2018 kicks off with focus on interoperability EDA Helicopter Initiatives Project Page Factsheet Exercice HOT BLADE 2018 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/06/15/hot-blade-2018-improved-joint-and-combined-helicopter-training"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0166", "date": "2018-06-05", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA to develop military airworthiness database", "text": " The European Defence Agency\u2019s Steering Board has given its green light to the development of a European Military Airworthiness Platform for Safety Information Exchange (EMAP SIX).

Military Mobility is key to European security. Today\u2019s security environment demands the smooth, efficient and effective movement of military personnel and assets within and beyond the European Union. As a complex and multidimensional issue, military mobility requires a \u2018whole-of-government\u2019 approach whilst respecting national sovereignty. The EU\u2019s Action Plan on Military Mobility, presented by HR/VP Federica Mogherini and the European Commission on 28 March 2018, outlines the steps the European Union is taking to improve Military Mobility. The Action Plan builds on the Roadmap on Cross-Border Military Transportation developed by the European Defence Agency and in close cooperation and coordination with all relevant actors, including NATO.\u00a0\u00a0 In his opening speech, Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, Krasimir Karakachanov, said: \u201cThe boundaries between internal and external security issues are getting less distinct, the hybrid nature of conflicts is already established as a rule. Improving military mobility is key to the EU's ability to effectively carry out its Common Security and Defense Policy\u2019s operations.

The currently ongoing revision of the CDP will be finalised by June 2018 and Defence Ministers highlighted the importance of ensuring coherence of output and timelines between EU and NATO defence planning processes. At the same time, an Overarching Strategic Research Agenda (OSRA) is being developed with a view to guiding future investments in collaborative European defence research. Ministers of Defence welcomed the progress achieved so far in the trial run of the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence implemented by EDA in its capacity as CARD Secretariat. The first CARD report will be presented in November 2018. EDA also supports Member States as part of the PESCO Secretariat. On 2 May, the PESCO Secretariat (EDA together with EEAS/EUMS) issued the second call for project proposals to PESCO participating Member States to be submitted by 31 July 2018. \u00a0 Military Mobility Regarding Military Mobility, and in line with the scope and timelines mentioned in the European Union Action Plan, the Agency is currently preparing two ambitious programmes on the harmonisation of military requirements related to customs and on cross border movement permission. Both programmes aim at facilitating military mobility activities. The Agency together with the participating Member States will look at harmonising the military requirements related to customs. The programme on cross border movement permission builds on the successful Diplomatic Clearances arrangement which foresees annually issued clearance numbers for air transport aircraft. The arrangement has proven its value by reducing administrative burden and time. The new programme will build on this good practice by looking at surface movement to enhance military mobility for road, rail and inland waterways, also including air assets such as helicopters and air-to-air refuelling aircraft. The Agency\u2019s work in this area is coordinated with the PESCO project on military mobility and conducted in close cooperation with the EEAS, EUMS, the Commission and other stakeholders. It is also coherent with respective NATO initiatives. \u00a0 Main Battle Tank Defence Ministers invited the Agency to pursue the development of the Pooling and Sharing initiative on Main Battle Tanks (MBTs) based on identified MBT surplus capacities in a number of Member States (Providers) and a demand for the acquisition of such assets in others (Receivers). The Agency together with national experts and industry investigated to what extent Providers could pool & share their surplus assets with interested Receivers and upgrade the MBTs to the latest configuration available. In addition, some Member States have voiced interest in upgrading their national fleets and keep them under full national control (Upgraders). The project will provide economies of scale throughout the entire life cycle while enhancing interoperability among Member States. \u00a0 \u00a0 Cooperative Financial Mechanism & other topics The Steering Board was informed about the progress achieved in the negotiation of the Programme Arrangement of the Cooperative Financial Mechanism. It is intended that the CFM will be structured around two pillars, one intergovernmental, and one involving the European Investment Bank as the sole lender for defence-related projects and programmes in line with its lending policy. Following calls from the European Council to support investments in defence research and development activities, the European Investment Bank and the European Defence Agency concluded a cooperation agreement on 28 February 2018. Ministers welcomed closer interaction between EDA and NATO. They were also presented with lessons learnt on the successful implementation of the Pilot Project and the first work programme of the Preparatory Action on Defence Research by the Agency under delegation of the European Commission. Finally, the Steering Board welcomed the progress made with regard to the implementation of the dual-use strategy on RPAS regulation, based on close coordination with the European Commission, the SESAR Joint Undertaking and EASA. \u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/05/05/outcome-of-eda-ministerial-steering-board"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0172", "date": "2018-05-15", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Serbian Minister of Defence visits EDA", "text": " Aleksandar Vulin, Minister of Defence of the Republic of Serbia, visited the European Defence Agency this week for discussions with EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq.\u00a0 The Republic of Serbia concluded an Administrative Arrangement\u00a0with the European Defence Agency (EDA) in 2013 enabling it to participate in EDA projects and programmes on a case by case basis.

The Memorandum of Understanding was signed by Udo Helmbrecht, ENISA's Executive Director, Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the EDA, Steven Wilson, Head of EC3 and Ken Ducatel, CERT-EU's Acting Head. The MoU aims at leveraging synergies between the four organisations, promoting cooperation on cyber security and cyber defence and is a testament to the trusted partnership that exists between these EU agencies. \u00a0More specifically, it focuses on five areas of cooperation, namely Exchange of information; Education & Training; Cyber exercises; Technical cooperation; and Strategic and administrative matters. It also allows for cooperation in other areas identified as mutually important by the four organisations. This collaboration will ensure the best possible use of existing resources by avoiding duplicative efforts and building on the complementarity of ENISA, EDA, EUROPOL and CERT-EU. This framework brings added value to the expertise, support and services that these parties provide to the European Union organisations, Member States and all stakeholders concerned. High Representative/Vice-President and Head of the European Defence Agency, Federica Mogherini said: \u201cCyberspace threats do not know of national borders. Cooperation among Member States but also at European level is therefore essential. Europe is stronger when it tackles threats together, in a common and coordinated approach. And this is exactly where this Memorandum of Understanding is key and where the added value of the European Union lies: working together, joining forces, putting the experiences and the knowledge of all at the service of our citizens' security. \u201d Vice-President for Digital Single Market Andrus Ansip said: \u201cWe can face cyber threats successfully if we have in place a functioning exchange of information, we have strong technical capabilities and we work on basic cyber hygiene. Better cooperation between these EU agencies will lead to this result. \u201d Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship Dimitris Avramopoulos said: \u201cThe threats against both our physical and virtual worlds are becoming increasingly connected. This is why increasing cyber security is one of the priorities of the European Union. But we can only do this effectively through stronger cooperation and joint actions, where our operational agencies, like Europol, can play a critical role with the expertise they bring to the table in support of our Member States. \u201d Commissioner for the Security Union Julian King said: \u201cThe cross-border nature of the cyber threat means that cooperation has never been more important. This improved collaboration between ENISA, EDA, EC3 and CERT-EU will help us to strengthen our cyber resilience, build effective deterrence and help deliver credible cyber defence and international cooperation. \u201d Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, Mariya Gabriel said: \u201cTrust and security are key components of the digital economy and society. The EU agencies should lead by example. Only by working closely together will we have a chance to mitigate the cybersecurity risks.\u201d Prof. Dr. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA said: \u201cENISA welcomes the opportunity to work closely with our partner organisations. Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility, and it is only by cooperating closely with all relevant stakeholders that the EU has a chance to address cybersecurity challenges.\u201d Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the EDA: \u201cEDA supports Member States in the development of their defence capabilities. As such, we also act as the military interface to EU policies. Today\u2019s Memorandum of Understanding is an important step towards increased civil-military cooperation and synergies in the area of cyber security and cyber defence.\u201d Steven Wilson, Head of Europol\u2019s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3): \u201cThis MoU illustrates how a safe and open cyberspace can only be achieved through enhanced cooperation and commitment. Through their participation, all parties involved demonstrate that they are willing to join forces and recognise that together we can provide the necessary response to cyber related threats. From EC3, we welcome the opportunity to enter a new era of working together with our MoU partners and are delighted to share our expertise and experience.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Ken Ducatel, Acting Head of CERT-EU, said: \u201cThe EU institutions, bodies and agencies rely on the specialised skills and tools in threat intelligence and incident response of CERT-EU. But, we don\u2019t maintain these capacities by acting alone. That is why acting together with our peers and partners in the other signatories to this Memorandum is so important.\u201d The 2014 Cyber Defence Policy Framework called for the promotion of civil-military cooperation and synergies with wider EU cyber policies, relevant EU institutions and agencies as well as with the private sector. ENISA, EDA, EUROPOL and CERT-EU began initial discussions in 2016 which eventually led to this milestone signature. The principles behind this Memorandum of Understanding are fully in line with the implementation of the Joint Communication on Cyber issued by the High Representative and the European Commission in September 2017. \u00a0 More information: European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA)\u00a0 European Defence Agency (EDA)\u00a0 Europol\u2019s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)\u00a0 Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU Institutions, Agencies and Bodies (CERT-EU)\u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/05/23/four-eu-cybersecurity-organisations-enhance-cooperation"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0175", "date": "2018-05-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Hot Blade 2018 kicks off with focus on interoperability", "text": " HOT BLADE 2018, the 12th helicopter exercise organised under the umbrella of the European Defence Agency\u2019s (EDA) Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP), kicked off yesterday 7th May at Beja airbase in Portugal.

The DEMC aims at increasing energy efficiency and reducing energy consumption in the military domain through the application of defence-specific Energy Management Systems (EnMSs) based on the ISO 50001 standard.\u00a0 The DEMC is the first of its kind to be run at multi-national level and to deliver both theoretical and practical EnMS training to energy managers from European navies, armies and air forces.\u00a0\u00a0 The implementation of EnMSs under DEMC resulted in saving around 2,5 GWh of energy consumed, reaching normalised reductions in energy consumptions of up to 25.2%. The course was split into 5 distinct modules (3 classroom-type and two practical of total duration of 12 months) with this first pilot run launched in April 2017. Participants improved their know-how on the complexities of managing energy within a defence organisation. They were also able to acquire the capacity to structure, implement and improve effective EnMSs and to enhance their skills thanks to on-going mentoring, alumni relations and membership in the European Defence Energy Network (EDEN) with permanent access to its established on-line resources. The DEMC marks another important milestone in EDA\u2019s approach to sustainability in defence and fulfils the level of ambition of the EDA Member States for capacity building in energy management, already identified through the first round of the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector (sponsored by the European Commission) and the EDA\u2019s own Energy and Environmental Working Group, developing\u00a0 mainstream sustainability concepts within the defence sector as enablers for improved military capability and reduced environmental footprint of military activities. \u00a0 Background The course began with a 5-day classroom-type session (module 1) to guide the participants with the framework and requirements of ISO 50001 EnMS standard and to familiarise them with energy data analysis techniques. Then followed a 6-month mentoring session (module 2) on the development of the core structure of the EnMSs to be applied, including visits at participating Member States\u2019 sites, webinars and extensive one-on-one mentoring. It was followed by module 3 (3-day classroom type session) which, besides reviewing the progress made so far, further elaborated on the EnMS requirements especially related to training, design, procurement, operations (including deployments). The subsequent 5-month mentoring session (module 4), included site visits, during which energy internal audits were\u00a0 conducted, coupled with further support though webinars and tailored guidance. The concluding 3-day classroom type module (module 5) focused on reviewing the developed EnMSs and providing further guidance on operational control issues related to energy. The pilot run of the Defence Energy Managers\u2019 Course (DEMC \u2013 Pilot) was attended by MoD / Armed Forces\u2019 personnel from Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Sweden and The\u00a0 Netherlands. During this pilot course, the EnMS concept was developed and is currently applied at 10 military installations of diverse uses (from military academies to armoured vehicles\u2019 camps and naval depos). With such a successful outcome of the DEMC - Pilot, up to 6 steady state DEMC could be envisaged over the next 3 years. The steady state courses will build upon the pilot course taking into account gained experience, recommendations and feedback from participating Member States.\u00a0 The project is delivered by GEN Europe and the Centre for Renewable Energy Sources & Savings (CRES).

This two-week comprehensive airlift tactics training course aims to enhance interoperability between European Air Forces. The participating crews were trained within a simulated theatre-deployment setting, exposing them to a complex surface-to-air and air-to-air threat environment, within which they were tasked to conduct demanding airlift missions. At the end of the course, 3 graduating crews received a certificate reflecting the training objectives achieved. EDA initiated the European Tactical Airlift Programme (ETAP) to develop innovative, efficient and more effective approaches to overcome Advanced Airlift Tactical Training and Interoperability shortfalls, within the European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) programme. ETAP aims to enhance European transport airlift operational capability for crisis management operations through the pooling and sharing of experience, training opportunities and organisational costs, and the development of agreed common tactics, techniques and procedures, to better meet the challenges of flying transport aircraft in a joint and combined modern operational environment. The organisational and administrative responsibilities for the ETAP have recently been handed over to the European Tactical Airlift Centre (ETAC) in Zaragoza, Spain, which was opened in June 2017 in the presence of EU High Representative and Head of the EDA Federica Mogherini, the Spanish Minister of Defence Mar\u00eda Dolores de Cospedal and EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq. This multinational centre, which was established with the support of 10 EDA Member States (Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Portugal and Spain) and one Third State (Norway), delivers European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Courses (ETAP-C), European Airlift Transport Training (ETAP-T), European Advanced Tactical Instructor Course (ETAP-I), Symposia (ETAP-S) and any other ETAP related activities for military air transport personnel. The 2018 activities began in January at the International Training Centre (ITC) in Pisa, Italy, with the first three ETAP-I. The first ETAP-C took place in Zaragoza from February 18th until March 3d, with nine crews and six aircraft (2 C-130, 1 C-160, 1 CASA 235 and 2 CASA 295) from Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, France and Spain. This course was divided in two parts, day and night, with some of the crews attending the night course using night-vision goggles.

EART 2018 brings together tankers from Germany, the Netherlands, France and - for the first time - from a non-European country, the United States, for a two week training exercise ending on 20 April.\u00a0 The European Air-to-Air Refuelling Training (EART) concept was introduced in 2014 under the European Defence Agency\u2019s (EDA) air-to-air refuelling initiative, and is run by the European Air Transport Command (EATC) from Eindhoven airbase. The exercise is supported by the host nation (the Netherlands), the Eindhoven-based Movement Coordination Centre Europe (MCCE) and EDA.\u00a0 EART is organised on a yearly basis in combination with the \u2018Frisian Flag\u2019 fighter training exercise, also organized by the Netherlands, that operates from Leeuwarden Airbase. The objective is to train air crews and engineers in planning and executing complex air-to-air refuelling (AAR) operations in a multinational and realistic COMAO (composite air operation) environment, with the overall aim of enhancing effectiveness and interoperability of forces. A particular focus is also put on facilitating the certification processes between tankers and receiver aircraft. The exercise director for EART 2018 is Colonel Andrea Massucci (Italian Air Force). \u00a0 Eindhoven for two weeks \u201ctanker town of Europe\u201d AAR is a significant force enabler and multiplier as it enhances combat effectiveness by extending the range, payload and endurance of receiver aircraft. It allows air power to be projected at greater distances or concentrated where and when it is needed mostly. \u201cAir-to-air refueling capacity is the backbone of modern day air power. Without it, we don\u2019t do much. Air power continuously needs fuel\u201d, said Lieutenant-Colonel Harry Oostema, Head of Operations at Eindhoven air base.\u00a0 However, delivering a guaranteed, continuous coverage of air-to-air refueling capacity is challenging. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need to train together. The European air-to-air refuelling Training (EART) at Eindhoven air base provides us with that unique opportunity\u201d, Lieutenant-Colonel Oostema stressed. \u201cFor two weeks Eindhoven air base will be the tanker town of Europe\u201d. \u00a0 Background: EDA\u2019s global approach on AAR EDA has developed a global approach on AAR with three objectives: optimizing the use of assets, increasing the overall AAR capacity and reducing fragmentation of the fleet. This work has led to three complementary work-strands, on some of which EDA is cooperating closely with other agencies and organizations like OCCAR, the Movement Coordination Center Europe (MCCE) and the European Air Transport Command (EATC). EART 2018 is part of the first work strand (optimization of existing capabilities), which is achieved by supporting training exercises. In this domain, EDA has also taken the lead to streamline the different certification processes leading to a clearance. By standardizing these processes the different aviation authorities can easily identify the differences between their own process and their counterpart. By working closely together, already fielded capabilities and future capabilities, can work more cost efficiently and increase their operational output.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 More information: Air-to-Air Refueling EDA project page Air-to-Air Refueling factsheet EATC website \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/04/09/5th-european-air-to-air-refuelling-training-takes-off-in-the-netherlands"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0184", "date": "2018-04-12", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA\u2019s new SME Corner now online", "text": " The SME Corner\u00a0at the EDA website has been redesigned to make it an even more comprehensive and reader-friendly source of information on EDA defence industry related matters for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and SME-policy makers.\u00a0 The new SME Corner\u00a0has two main building blocks: (1) industry opportunities and (2) government opportunities.

The European Council of 19 October 2017 encouraged the EIB to examine further steps with a view to supporting investments in defence research and development activities. As a response, the EIB recently approved the European Security Initiative - Protect, Secure, Defend, strengthening its support for RDI for dual-use technologies, cybersecurity and civilian security infrastructure. Today the EIB and EDA teamed up to support EU policy objectives, in particular as regards the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). The cooperation between the two entities materialises as major European initiatives supporting the EU level of ambition in the area of security and defence are launched, including a European Defence Fund. As a first step, EDA and the EIB envisage cooperation in the Cooperative Financial Mechanism (CFM). The CFM is foreseen as a mechanism for EDA Member States to financially support the set up and conduct of the development of military technology. The EIB role in the CFM would focus on supporting the development of dual use technologies. Additionally, the two organisations agreed to exchange expertise, in particular with a view to identify possible financing opportunities for defence and security-related Research and Technology projects in support of EDA participating Member States. EDA stands ready to support the EIB in identifying projects, that are potentially eligible for its assistance; this could include both projects promoted by the Member States, such as those in the context of the recently launched Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), as well as projects promoted by companies including Small and Medium Sized Enterprises in the defence and security sector.\u00a0 \u201cEuropean security and defence is high on the agenda of decision-makers and citizens alike.

The last activity, TRAWA, is due to be completed by May 2018. The Pilot Project aims at exploring how the European Union can support building defence capabilities relevant for the Common Security and Defence Policy and Member States. It was proposed by the European Parliament and launched by the European Commission in response to multiple political calls from EU institutions, Member States and NATO to improve Europe's defence capabilities. This objective is also enshrined in article 42 (3) of the Treaty on the European Union. The Pilot Project had been entrusted to the European Defence Agency (EDA) by the European Commission through a Delegation Agreement, which was signed on 16 November 2015. The EDA proposed to the European Commission a list of topics, for the preparation of the work plan of the Pilot Project. The call for proposals, the submission of proposals, the evaluation and the awarding of the grant agreement were organised and coordinated by EDA. After the signature of the grant agreements, three research activities were launched, executed by the awarded consortia and monitored by EDA. With a budget of 1.4 million euros from the European Union, the three research activities received a grant in the order of \u20ac 430.000 each. All projects were launched in November 2016, namely: EuroSWARM, SPIDER and TRAWA. The successful outcome of the Pilot Project, as a predecessor to the Preparatory Action for Defence Research, is to be seen in proving the feasibility of defence research funding through the EU budget. The initial rationale and objectives of the Pilot Project, which along with the on-going Preparatory Action on Defence Research was set-up to pave the way for a fully-fledged European Defence Research Programme (EDRP) in the next Multi-Annual Financial Framework after 2020, have already been met. It has supported the demonstration that EU funding can effectively support EU defence research needs, based on a structured cooperation and joint work between the European Commission and the EDA. The successful handling of the Pilot Project by the European Commission and the EDA has been an excellent preparation for the Preparatory Action on Defence Research and a future EDRP. Unmanned Heterogeneous Swarm of Sensor Platforms (EuroSWARM) EuroSWARM aimed to test and demonstrate that efficient and effective operation of unmanned swarm systems can bring a profound impact to the military arena. The key focus was the minimisation of uncertainties in situational awareness information for surveillance operations through a swarm system of systems composed by static and mobile heterogeneous sensors. The main objectives of the activity were to: develop key techniques for adaptive, informative and reconfigurable operations of unmanned heterogeneous swarm systems, namely: optimal task allocation and resource management, sensor fusion, cooperative guidance, robust sensor network; integrate the developed enabling techniques; validate the developed enabling techniques based on empirical simulation studies; demonstrate the proposed solutions based on a small scale of experiments. EuroSWARM was carried out by a consortium led by the University of Cranfield (UK) which also included the French aerospace research agency ONERA (Office National d'Etudes et de Recherches A\u00e9rospatiales), the Swedish Defence Research Agency FOI and the University of Patras (Greece). Inside Building Awareness and Navigation for Urban Warfare (SPIDER) SPIDER aimed to develop an innovative system to support Urban-Warfare operations by providing improved situational awareness to operational forces entering an unfriendly building. It focused on the use of radiofrequency (RF) stationary sensors and mobile ground robots. The main objectives of the activity were to: develop and analyse a framework comprising the use of multiple sensors to perform indoor mapping and human detection in an Urban Warfare context; consider the choice of a data fusion strategy to process and combine sensor data; explore the advantages and constraints of using each solution as well as solutions encompassing autonomous robots combined with static RF sensor networks. SPIDER was carried out by a consortium led by TEKEVER, a Portuguese technology company, and composed of IT Aveiro - Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es (Portugal), Aralia (UK) and the Bulgarian Defence Institute (BDI). Standardisation of Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) Detect and Avoid (TRAWA) The TRAWA activity, which is still ongoing, aims to contribute to the development of standards for a performant and affordable detect and avoid (DAA) system usable on-board Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS). It is focused on the Remain Well Clear (RWC) function and contributes to the standardisation activities in cooperation with other international efforts in full alignment with EUROCAE WG 105 Terms of Reference. The main objectives of the activity are to: specify Remain Well Clear in quantitative terms and obtain validation via simulations; specify sensor types, detection ranges and position estimation accuracy; develop requirements for remote pilot HMI (Human Machin Interface) characteristics. TRAWA is carried out by a consortium led by the Netherlands Aerospace Center (NLR) with the following partners: the German Aerospace Center (Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Luft- und Raumfahrt, DLR), Deep Blue (Italy), Tony Henley Consulting (UK) and EuroUSC (Italy). \u00a0 More information Project page on the Preparatory Action ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2018/02/23/pilot-project-euroswarm-and-spider-activities-completed"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0199", "date": "2018-02-20", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "European Centre for Manual Neutralisation Capabilities starts its activities in Vienna", "text": " Today, the European Centre for Manual Neutralisation Capabilities (ECMAN) was officially opened in Vienna.\u00a0 The ceremony was attended by the Austrian Chief of Defence, General Othmar Commenda and high level representatives from the Ministries of Defence of the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Sweden, NATO accredited COEs (CIED, EOD, JCBRN Defence), German Federal and Local Criminal Police, the German CIED Information Centre, the Swedish CBRN Defence Centre, Swedish EOD and Demining Centre, the Italian CIED Centre, as well as military attaches in Austria and the European Defence Agency (EDA).

The deployment to Italy completes the first tranche of up to nine systems, which will be distributed across European military RPAS Schools and Centres of Excellence that will allow networked collaborative training. The aim is to build over time a European MALE RPAS community of interest to improve procedures, tactics and to harmonise training approaches. The project was developed by the EDA under the mandate of the European MALE RPAS Community (DE, EL, ES, FR, IT, NL and PO) and is a joint effort with the European Air Group (which also includes BE and UK) in which the EDA is delivering the RPAS training technology demonstrator equipment and the EAG is producing training schedules to exploit the new system.\u00a0This will enhance interoperability between Member States who currently field MALE RPAS platforms and those that aspire to the capability within a 5-10 year timeframe.\u00a0The roll out of the systems will run in parallel with an increasingly ambitious virtual exercise programme that will provide opportunities for joint training and the cross-fertilisation of training approaches as instructors will teach lessons across the network to students at the dispersed sites.\u00a0 The project will run for four years initially as a Training Technology Demonstrator and has already attracted additional interest from other Member States. The EDA has for some time supported Member States ambitions in several areas of Education, Training and Exercise activity. The Agency is not a long-term training provider as such, but\u00a0 operates as a training consultancy, establishing business cases underpinning new initiatives for Member States to consider\u00a0 and setting up contracts on their behalf as required. Once initiatives have reached a sufficient level of maturity and are consolidated, they are transferred to a Member State or multinational organisation willing to take over administrative responsibilities and to ensure their longer term development.

To shed light on these and other questions related to Big Data in defence, the European Defence Agency (EDA) launched the \u2018Big Data in Defence Modelling and Simulation\u2019\u00a0 (BIDADEMS) study whose findings are now available and has led to a new project researching new methodologies (MODSIMMET).\u00a0\u00a0 While Big Data is already extensively used in the civil domain, for instance helping companies to improve decision-making based on customer spending (big) data, its potential benefits for the defence sector still needs to be explored and investigated.\u00a0 Against this backdrop in September 2016, the EDA initiated the BIDADEMS study aimed at better understanding Big Data methodologies, techniques and their potential applications in the defence domain, in particular for modelling and simulation (M&S) purposes. In the M&S domain, Big Data could potentially help to provide simplified military simulation designs, generate more realistic simulation scenarios and environments, improve the exploitation of simulation results or provide new opportunities for M&S support to military test and evaluation (T&E) activities. \u00a0 Recommendations The study identified some emerging Big Data technologies with high potential for defence M&S (such as cloud computing, non-relational databases, data analytics or visual analytics) and formulated recommendations for the EDA and Member States\u2019 future work in this domain, notably: 1. Future M&S applications should be designed with Cloud Computing in mind, setting up cloud based environments to provide \u201csandbox\u201d test areas to analyse new data sets. 2. Further investigation into the application of Data and Visual Analytics techniques and to data analytics to M&S models focussing on:\u00a0 a) Models and data available through predictive analytics as inputs for M&S models;\u00a0 b) Current data mining techniques and their applicability to M&S output data. 3. Given the high innovation rate of these techniques it seems to be necessary to both inform and educate analysts on new data analytics techniques and to provide M&S developers with Big Data considerations when developing future models.\u00a0 \u00a0 Outcome The outcome of the BIDADEMS project supported EDA\u2019s contribution to the 2nd Annual European GeoInformation Symposium & Exhibition on Big Data and the Global Big Data Defence 2017 Summit, both held in Berlin during June 2017. Also the project has motivated the EDA\u2019s \u2018Simulation\u2019 Capability Technology Group (CapTech) to initiate a new study, MODSIMMET, which will analyse how to approach very complex scenarios like hybrid warfare with different methodologies like Data farming and War gaming supported by Big Data and Artificial Intelligence.\u00a0 The collection, storage, analysis and management of a huge amount of real and simulated data is inevitable and will increase in the future.

Within this overarching framework the Agency has organised another Personnel Recovery Staff Course (JPRSC), already the 13th since 2013, from 15-24 November at the European Personnel Recovery Centre (EPRC) at Poggio Renatico Air Base, Italy. Some 20 students from seven countries (Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Norway) attended the course led by instructors from Germany, Italy, Sweden and the EPRC. The main focus was on training officers who will have to support their commanders on personnel recovery related issues. The courses are designed for staff in tactical operation centres (TOCs), personnel recovery coordination cells (PRCCs) and joint personnel recovery cells (JPRCs). The next Personnel Recovery Controller and Planner Course will take place in Karlsborg, Sweden, from 12-22 March 2018 and will be organised in cooperation with the Swedish Armed Forces.\u00a0 Background The EDA PRCPC project was established on 30 May 2013 as an EDA Category B project under the lead of Sweden. As of today, it includes eight contributing Member States (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Hungary, Italy, The Netherlands and Sweden). The course cycle has been extended three times and will be finalised on 30 May 2019. The European Personnel Recovery Centre (EPRC) based at Poggio Renatico Air Base, Italy, closely cooperates with the EDA. It was created on 8 July 2015 by seven nations (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom) with the aim of improving the four phases of personnel recovery (preparation, planning, execution, adaptation) by developing and harmonising common PR policies and standards and providing support for education, training, exercises and operations. \u00a0More information:Personnel Recovery - EDA\u00a0project page\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/11/29/eda-moves-forward-with-personnel-recovery-training"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0224", "date": "2017-11-24", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ONLINE now: the new EDA magazine is out!", "text": " The latest European Defence Matters magazine is now available with a special focus on the 10 probably most disruptive defence innovations to come.

In his final remarks wrapping up the conference, Mr Domecq thanked all the speakers for their contributions: Federica Mogherini, Head of the Agency; Julian King, EU Commissioner in charge of the Security Union; Kersti Kaljulaid, President of Estonia; Mikko Hypponen, Chief Research Officer of F-Secure. He also expressed gratitude to\u00a0the members of the two panels who shared their expertise and assessments and sparked lively discussions with the audience.\u00a0Main takeaways Mr Domceq singled out several key takeaways from this year\u2019s conference, in particular: Cyber threats affect all military capabilities. It\u2019s therefore essential to strengthen the cyber resilience elements in the development of all future platforms & systems, across land, air, maritime or space domains;Armed forces need to learn their lessons from previous incidents more rapidly and efficiently so as to be able to better prevent, detect and respond to future attacks; Europe is stronger if it tackles cyber threats together, in a common and coordinated approach encompassing the full military dimension of cyber defence; Member States need to better coordinate their cyber strategies to avoid fragmentation, to ensure and improve interoperability, and to protect special requirements of the military;Strategies and policies are essential but what really matters at the end of the day are the capabilities in place to counter cyberattacks. The most effective way for Member States\u2019 armed forces to identify, plan, develop, procure and eventually use these capabilities is by doing it together;New EU defence cooperation tools\u00a0such as the\u00a0Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD), the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the\u00a0European Defence Fund (EDF) are now in place. They need to be used in the best possible way; PESCO, in particular, could be a game changer for defence and offer a welcome cooperation framework for Member States to take forward priority projects, including on cyber;The European Defence Fund, for its part, will offer new funding opportunities for cooperative projects. Specifically, at the upstream R&T level, it could support the development of cyber defence technologies identified in the future Overarching Strategic Research Agenda (OSRA) and of related Technology Building Blocks; The European Commission\u2019s new Cyber Package, if properly implemented, can contribute to increased security in the Fifth Domain provided that duplication is avoided and that the specificities of the military dimension are fully taken on board;Continuous engagement with other parties such as NATO is paramount to ensure continued coherence of output;Dialogue with industry is equally important to secure the required future capabilities and the appropriate degree of strategic autonomy. \u00a0EDA prepared to play its part As far as the EDA\u2019s cyber work is concerned, \u201c2018 will see the topic stay centre stage\u00a0in the Agency\u2019s work plan\u201d, with a particular focus on three main activities. Firstly, the Capability Development Plan (CDP) revision in spring is expected to include new cyber defence needs and priorities some of which were already flagged during the 2016 EDA Table Top Exercise on hybrid threats. Secondly, the Agency looks forward to seeing the Initial Operational Capability of the CSDP Cyber Training & Exercise Platform next year in close cooperation with the European Security & Defence College. The project on pooling demand for cyber defence training and exercise support by the private sector should also reach its conclusion. And thirdly, on facilitating the interface with wider EU policies, the EDA will continue its work on the implementation of the Cyber Defence Policy Framework. The Agency is also considering setting up a dedicated Capability Technology Group (or Cap Tech) on cyber defence. In all of these activities, \u201cengagement with industry will be of central importance to enable our Member States to develop the capabilities they need to stay ahead in tomorrow\u2019s cyberspace\u201d, Mr Domecq stressed. \u201cOur work to improve Europe\u2019s cybersecurity and cyber defence is still in its initial phases. We must lose no time in embracing this golden opportunity to both plan and implement the next steps together. Only in doing so will we ensure that the advent of the digital era remains an opportunity for European citizens in the 21st century\u201d, the EDA Chief Executive concluded. \u00a0More information: Jorge Domecq closing speech EDA Annual Conference 2017Federica Mogherini opens Annual Conference at \u201cmost important moment for EU defence in d\u00e9cades\u201dRemarks by High-Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the 2017 Annual Conference of the European Defence AgencyEstonian President Kaljulaid: EU needs shared cyber expertise and joint exercise at strategic level Annual conference delivers insights on future of cyber defence \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/11/23/2017-annual-conference-closes-with-call-to-step-up-cyber-defence-cooperation"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0227", "date": "2017-11-23", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Federica Mogherini opens Annual Conference at \u201cmost important moment for EU defence in decades\u201d", "text": " The European Defence Agency (EDA) Annual Conference 2017 entitled 'Security in the digital age: the added value of European cooperation\u2019 was opened Thursday morning (23 November) in Brussels by the Head of the Agency, Federica Mogherini. Addressing a 400-strong audience representing the whole European defence spectrum - governments, armed forces, industry, EU institutions, NATO, think tanks and media - Mrs Mogherini said the conference was taking place \u201cat the most\u00a0important moment for European defence in decades\u201d\u00a0with bold new initiatives such as the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD), the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the European Defence Fund (EDF) creating an unprecedented momentum for enhanced cooperation. \u201cToday, we are\u00a0building a\u00a0European Union of security and defence. It' not a plan, not a dream anymore, but a reality (...)\u00a0All the building blocks of a security and defence union are finally there\u201d, she stated.\u00a0This means that Member States can now project and develop their defence capabilities together: \u201cWe can buy together, to ensure that we have all the capabilities we need while also spending efficiently. And we can act together, much better than before, to manage or prevent crises, to strengthen our partners, to make our citizens more secure\u201d. Acting together\u00a0is a necessity\u00a0\u201cbecause today\u2019s security challenges are too big for any of our Member States alone. Everyone understands this today. Our citizens are asking for more security and more efficient budgets, and the two are only possible if we join forces\u201d, Mrs Mogherini stressed. \u00a0The EDA, a leading force \u201cThe Council, the Commission and the European Defence Agency have all played their part in shaping the path towards a European Union of security and defence\u201d, she went on. The EDA\u00a0was\u00a0a \u201cleading force\u201d in defining the recent \u2018defence package\u2019 and, as far as PESCO is concerned, is already helping Member States assess the value of their projects for cooperation. \u201cThis will be central to the success of PESCO\u201d, the Head of the Agency stressed. The ambition is to move towards a European security and defence union, not re-open the debate on a European army. \u201cBut in a way, we are doing something that is much more ambitious. We already have European missions and operations - 15 of them so far - and we have created a single command centre for our training and advisory missions. We are now working to build a truly European defence industry, a truly European defence market, and a truly European defence research which are the basis for a truly European defence.\u00a0European military trainings are a concrete option. And the possibilities of PESCO are immense\u201d, she stated. The\u00a0CARD\u00a0and the European Defence Fund (EDF) are also\u00a0key instruments in which the EDA has \"great expertise, a huge potential - which also means huge responsibilities - to support Member States and the Commission in their decisions\".\u00a0Cyber defence: clear need for closer cooperation Turning to the conference topic, Mrs Mogherini said cyber was a defence domain where close cooperation was more indispensable than ever. \u201cCyber threats require a response that is both civilian and military. To protect our cyberspace, we will need more research, better capabilities, more training and exercises, in constant coordination with our partners\u201d. Promising new cyber initiatives recently saw the light\u00a0- such as the setting up of a Hybrid Fusion Cell within the External Action Service, the inauguration of the European Centre for Countering Hybrid Threats in Helsinki, the first ever European strategic cybersecurity table-top exercise \u2018CYBRID\u2019 co-organised last September by the Estonian Presidency of the EU Council and the EDA, and last year's EU-NATO Joint Declaration which also covers cybersecurity - but more needs to be done: \u201cWe have to explore the full range of possibilities that we have built over the last couple of years with the Commission, Member States, the External Action Service and the European Defence Agency\u201d. \u00a0Exciting journey With the new tools (CARD, PESCO, EDF) in place, EU defence cooperation has reached a level that was\u00a0unimaginable not only 60\u00a0years ago but even just six months ago, Mrs Mogherini said. \u201cA new exciting journey has just started. Everyone will have to play\u00a0it role, starting of course from us, from the European Defence Agency and the External Action Service. We will have to find new ways of working together across the institutions \u2013 knowing that this is for the entire Union, for each of our citizens, and for a more peaceful and secure world\u201d.\u00a0More information: \u00a0Remarks by High-Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the 2017 Annual Conference of the European Defence AgencyEstonian President Kaljulaid: EU needs shared cyber expertise and joint exercise at strategic level Annual conference delivers insights on future of cyber defence 2017 Annual Conference closes with call to step up cyber defence cooperationJorge Domecq closing speech EDA Annual Conference 2017 ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/11/23/federica-mogherini-opens-annual-conference-at-most-important-moment-for-eu-defence-in-decades"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0228", "date": "2017-11-23", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Annual conference delivers insights on future of cyber defence", "text": " In addition to the four keynote speeches delivered by Federica Mogherini (Head of the EDA), Julian King (EU Commissioner for the Security Union), Kersti Kaljulaid (President of Estonia) and Mikko Hypponen (Chief Research Officer, F-Secure), participants at this year\u2019s EDA Annual Conference witnessed two lively and interactive panel debates on cyber as a \u2018persistent strategic challenge\u2019 and enhanced cooperation in Europe and beyond, and on how to tackle growing cyber threats.Panel 1: Cyber - A persistent strategic challenge High-level panellists in the first roundtable were General Riho Terras (Commander of Estonia\u2019s Defence Forces), Dirk Hoke (Airbus Defence and Space CEO), Lieutenant General Ludwig Leinhos (Commander of the German Cyber and Information Space Command), Kevin Scheid (NATO NCIA General Manager), Neil Cassidy (Rolls Royce VP Director Cyber Security, Risk & Compliance) and Fabrice Clement (Proximus Director Security Governance & Investigations). The panel discussed a number of key questions such as \u2018How far do EU Member States share cyber-threat assessments?\u2019, \u2018How are national governments tailoring their responses and increasing their preparedness levels?\u2019, or \u2018How should European institutions support Member States in their efforts to navigate the myriad initiatives linked to cybersecurity and cyber defence?\u2019. Better information sharing and enhanced cyber defence cooperation are indispensable, not only between EU member States but also between the EU and NAT. Speakers also pointed to the need to avoid duplication of efforts and to increase cooperation with industry for delivery of the required technological solutions to counter growing cyber threats. The importance of cyber education and training was highlighted, as was the serious problem of finding and recruiting skilled cyber experts in Europe today, set to worsen in the future. \u00a0Panel 2: European solutions to global problems The afternoon panel discussion saw high-profile speakers discuss potential technological solutions, how industry is adapting to provide such technologies, and what the EU and NATO can do to support this process. Questions raised ranged from \u2018How should Member States\u2019 defence procurement models adapt to the fact that most of the available cyber defence technology today is dual-use?\u2019, \u2018How far are civilians and the military cooperating and exchanging best practises to avoid duplication and promote excellence?\u2019 or \u2018Where should the EDA focus its efforts to support EU Member States when it comes to cyber?\u2019. The four high-level panellists were: Annegret Bendiek (Senior Associate Europe Research at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, SWP), Jakub Boratynski, (Head of Unit for Cybersecurity and Digital Privacy, DG Connect, European Commission), Rogier Holla (Deputy Head of the EU Computer Emergency Response Team, CERT-EU), Merle Maigre (NATO CCD COE Director) and George Sharkov (the National Cybersecurity Coordinator & Adviser to the Prime Minister of Bulgaria). The speakers touched on the importance of research and innovation in the civilian and military sides of cyber, on international norms in cyber warfare, the Tallinn Manual, and failed UN attempts to regulate and on the protection of critical infrastructure. All agreed on the urgent need to update existing SCADA systems to adapt to the current threat landscape. \u00a0More information: \u00a0Federica Mogherini opens Annual Conference at \u201cmost important moment for EU defence in d\u00e9cades\u201dRemarks by High-Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini at the 2017 Annual Conference of the European Defence AgencyEstonian President Kaljulaid: EU needs shared cyber expertise and joint exercise at strategic level2017 Annual Conference closes with call to step up cyber defence cooperationJorge Domecq closing speech EDA Annual Conference 2017\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/11/23/annual-conference-delivers-insights-on-future-of-cyber-defence"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0229", "date": "2017-11-23", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Estonian President Kaljulaid: EU needs shared cyber expertises and joint exercise at strategic level", "text": " In her keynote speech delivered at\u00a0the EDA's Annual Conference 2017, Kersti Kaljulaid, the President of Estonia, urged EU Member States to step up cybersecurity awareness building, including in the military domain, \u201cby learning from each other and sharing best practices\u201d. The Estonian EU Presidency led by example last September when, in cooperation with the European Defence Agency, it organised \u2018EU CYBRID 2017\u2019, a strategic table-top cyber defence exercise which for the first time ever involved EU defence ministers, the European External Action Service (EEAS), the European Commission, cyber-related EU agencies as well as NATO\u2019s Secretary General. \u201cAmong many other valuable lessons, EU CYBRID 2017 showed that although political decision makers would in case of a cyberattack be the first to react and make decisions, their understanding, knowledge and awareness of the nature of cyber incidents still leaves much to be desired\u201d, the President said. \u201cThis shows that exercises like EU CYBRID 2017 have to be conducted regularly both on the Member State and EU level\u201d, Mrs Kaljulaid added. Since the cyber domain evolves constantly, joint cyber exercises need to involve the higher political (ministerial) level because some aspects of cyber defence are \u201cpolitically sensitive\u201d, such as the attribution of attacks. \u201cA technical point at first glance, but a political decision at the end of the day\u201d which also impacts the choice between offensive and defensive responses. While there is no doubt that these questions are for Member States to decide, \u201cthey need not only to be discussed but also exercised at strategic level\u201d, she said.\u00a0\u201cEDA has to continue with its successful projects\u201d The Estonian President welcomed last Monday\u2019s EU Council conclusions on cyber which, along with the European Commission\u2019s cyber package, should give \u201cnew impetus to cyber security issues for the years to come\u201d. In this context the EDA, too, has an important role to play: \u201cI do believe strongly that in this situation the European Defence Agency should continue with the successful projects it has conducted so far and which complement the projects of the Commission without unnecessary duplication. For example, I believe that EDA should concentrate its efforts on education, training and strategic level exercises, because those are the fields \u2013 whether we like it or not \u2013 where the Member States have probably the biggest shortfalls and at the same time willingness to do more cooperation at the European level\u201d. \"We must also think about how the EDA\u2019s cyber activities would contribute to the European Defence Industrial Development Programme and the Permanent Structured Cooperation, and vice versa\u201d, Mrs Kaljulaid added.

Sixteen trainees from Belgium, Sweden, Germany, Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and the UK took part in the second COMAO course, the objective of which was to increase interoperability and the common understanding of complex mission planning in a multinational environment. The course involved support and attack helicopters but also fast-jet, intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR) as well as air transport and ground force units.The course started with a theoretical part, including detailed briefs on COMAO, 4Ts (Task, Target, Threat and Tactics) mission planning as well as standard rotary tactics employed to counter a range of different threats. Participants also examined the Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) of the attack helicopters and fast-jet capabilities in both the Blue and Red Air role delivered by 100 Sqn RAF. The second part of the course was devoted to the practical mission planning for a multinational joint helicopter force (and its support assets) which had to operate in a given and constantly evolving political and military scenario. As the course went by and the complexity of the missions increased, trainees became increasingly familiar with the planning processes and the crews\u2019 performances improved considerably, even under worsening mission conditions and mounting time pressure. The course level was gradually elevated to a point where the individual trainees had to prepare their missions on their own.

The Joint Communication identifies areas in which the EU will work to facilitate and help expedite military mobility. The European Defence Agency (EDA) set up a dedicated Ad Hoc Working Group in September to support the elaboration of a follow-on Action Plan on Military Mobility by spring 2018.The Joint Communication adopted today outlines steps to be taken to address the obstacles that hamper movement of military equipment and personnel across the EU with the aim of facilitating and expediting their mobility.\u201cDefence forces depend on the ability to move quickly. Physical, legal and regulatory barriers can lead to delays, disruptions, higher costs and vulnerability. Successful EDA projects such as the EU Multimodal Transport Hub and the Diplomatic Clearances initiative for military air transport demonstrate the advantages of a coordinated European approach to military movement. However, these are patchwork solutions. What is missing is a consistent approach allowing military personnel and equipment to cross borders swiftly and smoothly. The EDA\u2019s existing expertise in this domain provides the best platform for the EU and the Member States to build a comprehensive action plan promoting civil/military synergies\u201d, said Jorge Domecq, EDA Chief Executive.\u00a0Tasked by the Member States, the European Defence Agency recently put in place an expert-level Ad Hoc Working Group to address the persistent shortfalls and promote better coordination and enhanced synergies among all stakeholders. The objectives of the working group are to identify obstacles and barriers to cross-border movement and surface transit of military personnel and assets, to map existing initiatives and shortfalls, identify relevant actors at EU and national level and to develop an action plan with dedicated tasks and responsibilities including a roadmap with timelines. Among the principles to be followed are avoidance of duplication and inclusiveness in order to address all relevant stakeholders. The expert group will deliver its report in spring 2018, based on which the High Representative and the European Commission will build an Action Plan on Military Mobility.\u00a0Existing projectsThe EDA currently runs two projects which are dedicated to removing regulatory, legal or procedural obstacles to military movement of troops and airlift capabilities:In 2014 fourteen Member States decided to launch a dedicated project within the European Defence Agency dedicated to an EU Multimodal Transport Hub. Those Member States have identified the need to better coordinate military movement. A Multimodal Hub Transport (M2TH) network is being developed in order to facilitate the fast movement of troops, through harmonised regulations, procedures and process as well as pooling and sharing of assets and infrastructure in Europe.\u00a0 Core to this project is the central coordination of movement, identifying a physical network of locations and identifying services to be provided. Execution uses simplified and harmonised procedures within the boundaries of EU legislation and national laws. Other Member States have shown interest in joining this project.\u00a0The aim of EDA\u2019s Diplomatic Clearances Technical Arrangement is to harmonise procedures for overflights and landings of EU nations\u2019 military registered or operated transport aircraft. The arrangement enables the 16 signatory Member States to operate without the need to submit diplomatic requests for each flight, with an annual diplomatic clearance number issued. This common mechanism increases efficiency and effectiveness of European airlift, giving more flexibility during mission preparation and mission execution. Furthermore it saves Member States\u2019 human and financial resources with a significantly reduced number of required requests and notifications. A dedicated online portal provides basic transparency on national policies and procedures for granting diplomatic clearances for military transport aircraft.\u00a0\u00a0More informationJoint Communication to the European Parliament and the Council on military mobility in the European Union\u00a0EDA project on Multimodal Transport HubsEDA project on Diplomatic Clearances Technical Arrangement", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/11/10/eda-provides-expert-input-for-action-plan-on-military-mobility"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0233", "date": "2017-11-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Outcome of EDA Ministerial Steering Board", "text": " The European Defence Agency\u2019s (EDA) ministerial Steering Board met this Monday afternoon under the chairmanship of the Head of the Agency, Federica Mogherini.

Since 2009, a total of 641 crewmembers from 16 different European countries have graduated from the HTC course. This is a considerable accomplishment for a programme that was initially set up to enhance the preparation and operational capability of crews to be deployed to Afghanistan, but which then evolved into a much broader multinational helicopter tactics training course. It delivers advanced helicopter tactics training under EDA\u2019s Pooling & Sharing initiative with the aim to enhance the European helicopter operational capability for crisis management and to improve the interoperability of Member States\u2019 helicopter crews. HTC courses cover the entire crew spectrum (pilots, loadmasters, door gunners etc.) and deal with typical ground and air threats as well as the tactics that can be employed to mitigate them. An HTC course is typically divided into two phases: the first week being devoted to theoretical training, and two additional weeks focusing on simulator-based training. Standardisation and interoperability are improved by the use of EDA Helicopter Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). In addition, participation in HTC courses provides helicopter crews with the opportunity to develop an international helicopter network which can prove quite valuable in envisaging future cooperation opportunities. Best practices and lessons learned are regularly integrated into the course syllabus to ensure it remains up to date and of highest quality.

The Consultation Forum aims to examine how energy efficiency measures, renewable energy sources and technologies, and protection of critical energy infrastructure considerations apply to the European defence sector. This second phase will see the initiative move towards the identification of bottlenecks preventing the sector from fully benefiting from sustainable energy. This will help the work move towards more concrete implementation, in view of seizing the economic benefits presented by the transition to clean energy. \u201cThe second phase of the Consultation Forum presents the defence sector with a fresh opportunity to collaborate with the European Commission on energy efficiency, renewable energy, and the protection of critical energy infrastructure. Energy security is a key priority for European armed forces, and by acting together, we can improve the resilience of military activities at home and on missions, as well as reduce cost and operational risks, while contributing to the broader objectives of the Energy Union. We must now capitalize on this initiative and deliver real benefits through the initiation of defence energy projects\u201d, said EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq. \u201cAll strands of our energy policy, whether it is energy efficiency or renewables, security of supply or interconnections, have an impact on European defence. While energy efficiency and renewable energy policies were almost not known in the defence and security sector, the Consultation Forum has been key in changing the approach and revealing the significant potential. I am therefore very pleased that the Consultation Forum is entering its second phase which will enable us to explore further how this initiative could be both turned into concrete improvements in the ways which the defence and security sector uses energy and transformed into a real economic opportunity\u201d, Dominique Ristori, Director-General Energy, said. The first phase of the work brought together a majority of Member States\u2019 Ministries of Defence alongside NATO, the NATO Energy Security Centre of Excellence, industry and academia, and led to the creation of a European Defence Energy Network (EDEN) with over 100 members. Plenary meetings of the Consultation Forum were held in Brussels (January 2016), Dublin (June 2016), Rome (November 2016), Lisbon (May 2017), and Thessaloniki (September 2017), looking at the challenges and opportunities of moving to a sustainable energy future in the defence sector, including the implications of relevant EU energy legislation for defence.\u00a0\u00a0 The second phase of the Consultation Forum will focus on the identification of bottlenecks preventing the sector from fully reaping the benefits of sustainable energy. The aim is to work towards more concrete implementation, and to identify the tools and opportunities that will transform the knowledge developed to date into tangible defence sector energy projects. Work will be conducted by three parallel working groups covering: (1) Energy Efficiency including Energy Management (2), Renewable Energy Sources, and (3) Protection of Critical Energy Infrastructure (PCEI), with finance as a cross-cutting theme. This initiative is a Coordination and Support Action which received funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant Agreement No 789231.Further information can be found on\u00a0EDA's European Defence Energy Network (EDEN) webpage. Background \u00a0The Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector is a European Commission initiative managed by the EDA, the first initiative of its kind for these institutions. It brings together experts from the defence and energy sectors to share information and best practices on improving energy management, energy efficiency, and the use of renewable energy. The first phase of the Consultation Forum was announced on 20 October 2015 for a period of 24 months. The work was carried out in three parallel working groups: (1) Energy Management, (2) Energy Efficiency, and (3) Renewable Energy Sources.

Around 200 representatives from government institutions, industry, academia as well as research and technology centres participated in this unique forum which was held in Gij\u00f3n (Spain) on 12 September 2017. The event was structured in three different activities (conference sessions, exhibition and technical visit) with the aim of raising military awareness of additive manufacturing (AM) technologies and their potential to improve military operations, logistic support or maintenance of platforms. The conference session was opened by Mr. Rini Goos, Deputy Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency, who highlighted \u201c3D-printing can become a game changer for defence. It allows for easy customisation of small series and opens the possibility to manufacture even very complex parts - on site and on demand. This is especially important for military operations and their logistic support\u201d. The talks were focused on three central themes: additive manufacturing expectations from EDA and the European Commission, current 3D-printing experiences of the European Ministries of Defence and industry developments in the AM field from companies specialised in the defence sector. The results of the EDA AM project were also presented, highlighting the Agency\u2019s capacity to supporting a capability from R&T to development. A main conclusion of the conference is that in spite of the fact that some organisations have already earned significant experience on AM, non-technical factors (IPR, training, standardisation and certification, health and safety, etc.) currently still impose limitations for AM implementation in defence. As reinforced during the exhibition, only with the inputs provided by all the attendees and via the EDA consultation to identify impact of 3D-printing technologies in defence all these factors will be identified, and the way ahead towards the full implementation of AM in defence could be depicted. Attendees also had access to an exhibition area where 3D-printed prototypes and real parts were on display. The EDA\u2019s deployable AM facility was on display as well. Industry, academia and research centres from eight different European countries participated as exhibitors. Finally, a visit to PRODINTEC advance manufacturing centre\u2019s facilities (contractor at the EDA AM project) was performed. There, attendees had the opportunity to see AM equipment in operation and its possible applications in several sectors from defence to health, aerospace or construction. Background The conference and exhibition were part of EDA\u2019s \u201cAdditive Manufacturing Feasibility Study & Technology Demonstration\u201d project which is expected to be finalised in December 2017. The project, initiated in the framework of the CapTech Materials & Structures within the EDA Research & Technology domain, is composed of three work strands: (i) a desktop study to place additive manufacturing and its potential in a defence context, (ii) a technology demonstration of the feasibility of deploying these technologies in support of a military operation, (iii) an exhibition to senior military staff concluded in the event celebrated at Gij\u00f3n last 12th September.\u00a0 Further information on 3D-printing at EDASee the videos of the EDA AM Exhibition and EDA AM Facility deploymentAlbum of the Exhibition and of the AM Facility deploymentEvent web - Exploring Additive Manufacturing impact in Defence capabilitiesSuccessful test flight for EDA 3D-printing lab during deployment at EAATTC 17-3 Defence experts meet to discuss implications of Additive Manufacturing 16.ESI.OP.144 \u2014 Additive manufacturing feasibility study and technology demonstration 3D printing: EDA launches new project to test feasibility in the defence field Latest EAATTC 2017-1 EDA AM Project Fact sheet and EDA AM Facility Deployment Leaflet ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/10/19/3d-printing-community-explores-applications-for-defence"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0240", "date": "2017-10-18", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "First fully fledged defence project gets ESIF funding", "text": " For the first time, a fully fledged defence research project - initiated by the Croatian Ministry of Defence and supported by the European Defence Agency (EDA) - has been awarded EU co-funding under the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). So far only \u2018dual-use\u2019 projects with both civilian and military applications had been able to secure ESIF funding. The granting of ESIF funding to this Croatian project, which aims at developing a cyber conflict simulator, represents a landmark in EDA\u2019s year-long efforts to open up EU funding opportunities for pure defence research projects, in addition to dual-use projects. The news was welcomed by EDA\u2019s Chief Executive, Jorge Domecq: \u201cThe fact that ESIF funding is now also accessible to genuine defence projects is an important signal that should help strengthen the European defence industrial base. The Agency will continue to exploit the benefits of wider EU policies for defence stakeholders and facilitate their access to EU funding possibilities\u201d. The cyber conflict simulator set to be developed under the Croatian project is meant to be fit-for-purpose and usable by MoDs straightaway, including in European and international military exercises. It will allow for multiple groups in different roles to collaborate or compete within a defined cyber space, in order to address potential cybernetic attacks. It will also enable the definition of a cyber terrain consisting of different objects, connections, threats, controls, which will be defined by a set of properties and functions connected in a variety of ways.

The objective of this year\u2019s calls is to award grant agreements for a value of some \u20ac22 million from the Preparatory Action\u2019s 2017 budget and to exercise options of up to an additional \u20ac20 million next year, to be funded under the 2018 budget, once available.\u00a0\u201cThe high interest in the Preparatory Action on Defence Research was obvious from the Information Day and Brokerage Event, conducted by the EDA and the European Commission in June 2017, with over 400 participants. What is noteworthy, besides the number of submissions itself, is the incredible amount of entities - research institutes, small and mediums size enterprises and prime companies - which have bid for the various calls. This reflects the urgent need for more defence research funding, cross-border collaboration and harmonisation in Europe. With the\u00a0 PADR, we are on the right path to a more comprehensive European Defence Research Programme after 2020\u201d, commented Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency.Research in defence-related technologies is critical for the development of the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base and to strengthen EU Member States\u2019 strategic autonomy. The European Commission launched the Preparatory Action on Defence Research (PADR) on 11 April 2017. The foreseen budget is \u20ac90 million over three years. The aim of the PA is to test and lay the groundwork for a possible European Defence Research Programme in the next Multiannual Financial Framework after 2020.\u00a0The EDA and the European Commission signed a Delegation Agreement on 31 May 2017, by which EDA became the PADR\u2019s implementing agency. The EDA published the first three Calls for Proposals on 7 June 2017. The deadlines to respond were 28 September 2017 for the 'research in technology and products in the context of Force Protection and Soldier Systems' and 'strategic technology foresight' topics, and 5 October 2017 for the 'technological demonstrator for enhanced situational awareness in a naval environment' topic.The EDA will now conduct evaluations with the support of independent subject matter experts. The evaluation and scrutiny process will last until December 2017. The EDA expects to sign the various grants with the beneficiaries towards the end of 2017 and early 2018.Based on the budgets for 2018 and 2019, additional Calls for Proposals and Information Days are in preparation.Before the PADR, a Pilot Project (PP) was introduced in the EU budget in 2015 and 2016, adopted by the European Council and the European Parliament, on the basis of an initiative by the latter, and with the EDA as implementing agency.

Their progressive implementation and the mutual recognition of National Military Airworthiness Authorities \u201cis key in paving the way for more and deeper cooperation\u201d, he said.\u00a0 He emphasized that \u201cThe next harmonisation phase should now focus on further evolution of the regulatory and oversight framework\u201d. Referring to the longer term perspective, he stated: \u201cOnce a harmonised European Military Airworthiness System will have been fully developed and sufficient confidence is gained from its implementation, steps could be taken towards the formation of a European Military Joint Airworthiness Authorities Organisation (EMJAAO)\u201d as envisaged by Ministers of Defence in 2008, emphasising that this would in no way whatsoever\u00a0 be a supranational authority. Mr Van Reybroeck reiterated that the European Defence Agency remains committed to facilitate the ongoing work and cooperation, and to coordinate the military views of the participating Member States including through the organisation of supporting events such as this Military Airworthiness Conference.\u00a0Further EvolutionThe MAWA community will continue to harmonise views and approaches to overcome fragmentation. Thus, further development and maintenance of harmonized military airworthiness requirements and supporting documents will remain a key objective of the MAWA community. At the same time, harmonization of processes and procedures to support recognition and increase efficiency in oversight will unlock further benefits for industry and national authorities alike. Emerging topics such as RPAS airworthiness requirements and safety management will set the scene for future activities and must be appropriately addressed in a joint and coordinated manner, in close coordination with relevant civil and military stakeholders.\u00a0More information:EDA project page on European Military Airworthiness Authorities Forum (MAWA)", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/10/11/annual-military-airworthiness-conference-opens-in-athens"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0245", "date": "2017-10-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA call for papers: Maritime Surveillance Capabilities", "text": " The European Defence Agency (EDA) today published a call for papers\u00a0on the topic of Maritime Surveillance which is open to defence industry, academia, research institutes and associations or groupings of industrial suppliers. The call is part of EDA\u2019s new approach towards establishing a structured dialogue and enhanced engagement with industry in the context of the ongoing Capability Development Plan (CDP) revision and aims at associating defence industry to an upcoming EDA Maritime Surveillance Workshop with defence planners and relevant experts. Following a first workshop focusing on Remotely Piloted Air Systems (RPAS) which took place on 12th September 2017, the EDA is now organising a second one-day workshop to be held on 1 February 2018 to explore the mid to long-term (20 years ahead) aspects of Maritime Surveillance.This workshop will not be a forum for discussing the commercial aspects of current systems, but a dialogue intended to enrich the CDP long-term view with industry inputs on the long term industrial and technological outlook in the specific capability area of Maritime Surveillance. In this perspective, the EDA is inviting National Defence Industry Associations (NDIAs) and the AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD) to reach out to their members and encourage them to respond to the call for papers. Selected industry representatives will be invited to share their views of long-term outlooks focusing on the questions listed in the questionnaire. Speakers will be selected based on this call for papers, which will be evaluated by the EDA.Submissions are sought from as wide as possible a range of industries involved in aspects of development related to Maritime Surveillance. Though responses to all questions in the questionnaire are encouraged, submitters may develop answers to specific questions in greater detail based on their area of expertise. This will allow thematic discussion panels to be formed.Submissions will be judged on their innovativeness and relevance as well as ability to stimulate discussion on the future role of Maritime Surveillance.

This step concludes the first phase of the expert group\u2019s work. It should assist Member States to build consensus on how to enhance best the protection and resilience of defence related Critical Energy Infrastructures. To address the risks, vulnerabilities, capability and research shortfalls of defence related Critical Energy Infrastructures (CEI), the PCEI expert group was set up in May 2016. It\u2019s primary task was to assess how the defence sector can apply existing EU CEI legislation to enhance the protection of defence-related CEI and improve its resilience throughout Europe. For that purpose, the group developed an EU-wide defence focused \u2018PCEI Conceptual Paper\u2019. The chairman of the group, Colonel Georgios Drosos from the Hellenic MOD, explains that \u201cthis Paper is intended to lead to a collaborative civilian-military approach which supports EU Member States in the identification of best practices and tools which will strengthen further the resilience of defence related CEI from any failures, risks or threats, including terrorism, cyber-attacks, migration flow stress, climate change, and natural hazards\u201d. Martin Konertz, EDA\u2019s Capability Armaments and Technology (CAT) Director, considers that \u201cthis PCEI Conceptual Paper will provide an important building block for increased CEI resilience in the EU as it should inform a related EU policy or guidelines and assist Member States to initiate projects of common interest with the support of the EU\u201d.\u00a0Deliverables Besides the Conceptual Paper, the PCEI expert group also produced a factsheet designed to increase collaboration, awareness and visibility. Both documents will be submitted in mid-October to the European Commission\u2019s DG Energy for final approval. Denis Roger, EDA\u2019s European Synergies and Innovation (ESI) Director, stated: \u201cIn order to move beyond the conceptual phase and towards a broader consensus, we will need to foster a common PCEI culture within the EU defence sector and even beyond that, in wider society. In this way, we can contribute to securing a sustainable energy supply chain for both fixed infrastructures and for CSDP operations\u201d.\u00a0Background The work\u00a0of the PCEI expert group is led by the Ministries of Defence of Cyprus and Greece, supported by their respective national academia and research centres (Centre for Research & Technology Hellas \u2013 CERTH, Cyprus University of Technology, European University Cyprus, KIOS Research and Innovation Center of Excellence - University of Cyprus, National Technical University of Athens - NTUA).

The project, sponsored by both the German and Italian MoDs in the frame of EDA\u2019s Capability Technology (CapTech) Ammunition Technologies group, addresses the challenge that affects most European shooting ranges: they are too narrow and too short to adhere to the necessary safety areas for shooting tests with guided ammunition. So as to enable European shooting ranges to perform this test firing, a generic mission abort system was designed and demonstrated. In the event of a deviation from the predefined flight path, the system will break down the projectile into two parts and these parts will not leave the surface danger area. The project progressed through several phases from concept through to overall design, more detailed designs, construction, integration, and design verification tests.The aerodynamic analysis, safety area calculations, and reliability analysis were also undertaken. The final test consisted of firing of two MAS demonstrators with the Howitzer PzH2000 and was conducted at Meppen Proving Ground (WTD91) in Germany in the third quarter of 2016. The feasibility of mission abort systems for guided ammunition was successfully proven. This represents an important step towards the utilisation of European test ranges in the performance of guided ammunition tests. Possible miniaturisation of electronic components could facilitate the integration of MAS into rounds with calibres smaller than 70 mm. Another possibility might be the implementation of MAS into operational ammunition. The demonstrator was developed by Diehl BGT Defence and Finmeccanica and the test projectile used was the Vulcano 155mm (subcaliber 92 mm).

Mr Dominique Ristori, the Director-General of the Directorate-General Energy of the European Commission, greeted the participants by video message. It was closed by Mr Denis Roger, the European Synergies and Innovation Director at the EDA. Opening the conference, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq thanked the participants for the active involvement in the Forum over the last two years. He also used the opportunity to give direction for the future: \u201cAs we move to the next phase of the Consultation Forum, we need to focus on defence energy projects and their funding. We need to focus on results.\u201d As possible project areas, Mr Domecq highlighted infrastructure improvements leading for example to the refurbishment of buildings to Nearly Zero Energy Building standards. Projects relating to the assessment of renewable energy technologies could be analysed for where investments could be made to make commercial renewable energy technologies suitable for military use. Finally, there could also be scope to develop policy tools and training on raising energy awareness as well as the development of tools for optimum technology selection. European Commission Director-General Dominique Ristori said the energy transition was a \u201ctop priority of the European Union\u201d. \u201cIt is not only about energy and climate alone. It is about accelerating the fundamental modernisation of Europe's entire economy, making it low-carbon, energy and resource efficient, in a socially fair manner. And making it less dependent on imports. It requires the transformation of the whole energy system. All sectors need to contribute and to reap the benefits. I am therefore very pleased that we will continue with the second phase of the Consultation Forum as of October. This would allow, inter alia, a deeper analysis of the issues at stake and the identification of bottlenecks that need to be resolved to allow the defence sector to benefit fully from sustainable energy and to use the energy transition as a major economic opportunity\u201d, he stated. The aim of this week\u2019s last meeting of the Consultation Forum was to reach agreement on the content of final report with recommendations for a more implementation focused second phase. The conference was attended by around 100 experts from government administrations, as well as industry, academia, NATO representatives and the European Commission. In total, there have been five conferences of this first phase of the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector. In closing the conference, Director European Synergies and Innovation Denis Roger highlighted, that \u201cwe have built a defence energy community which did not exist before\u201d. Second phase The second phase of the Consultation Forum will have an implementation focus to take the knowledge developed in the first phase and turn this into results. The focus will remain on energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, and the protection of critical energy infrastructure in relation to the implications of relevant EU legislation when applied to the defence sector\u2019s infrastructure. This means that results will have direct benefits for the delivery of defence infrastructure capability, while contributing to the broader objectives of the Energy Union. Background The Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector is a European Commission initiative managed by the European Defence Agency. It brings together experts from the defence and energy sectors to share information and best practice on improving energy management, energy efficiency, and the use of renewable energy. The Consultation Forum has taken place in a series of five plenary meetings over 24 months, and its first phase will be concluded in October 2017. The work is carried out in three parallel working groups each with a particular focus: (1) Energy Management, (2) Energy Efficiency & 3) Renewable Energy.

A total of 19 students, from 6 contributing countries (Cyprus, Ireland, The Netherlands, Germany, Spain and Italy) benefitted from the knowledge and experience of a cadre of instructors from Germany, Hungary and Italy. The European Personnel Recovery Centre (EPRC), a close partner of EDA, contributed to the event by organizing a specific instructor course aimed at \u2018training the trainers\u2019. The main focus of the course was to train staff officers to support their commanders in personnel recovery related matters. The course was designed for personnel in Tactical Operational Centres (TOCs), Personnel Recovery Coordination Cells (PRCCs) or Joint Personnel Recovery Cells (JPRC\u2019s). The overall objective of the JPRSC is to ensure that trained personnel are available to support any future personnel recovery activities in an operational context. Personnel recovery is a vital element of modern operational planning as it provides a security net for deployed personnel. Most importantly, it boosts morale and acknowledges the responsibility of Member States and the European Union to develop and provide relevant capabilities to recover and reintegrate isolated personnel deployed in the context of crisis management operations under the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). The next EDA JPRSC will take place from 15th to 24th November 2017 in Italy (Poggio, Renatico) and will be organised by the European Personnel Recovery Centre (EPRC).

The concept foresees the offer of surplus Leopard platforms available in certain Member States (the \u2018providers\u2019) and transfer them (lease, rent or sell) together with an upgrading package to one or several other Member States (the \u2018receivers\u2019) interested in acquiring and introducing in-service this type of capability. The Pooling & Sharing of training, exercises and maintenance between providers and receivers, using already existing facilities, is also part of the concept. Additionally, regarding economies of scale, Member States owning and operating for national purposes the same type of MBTs, can opt-in for upgrading their in-service fleet. Business Case The EDA is now elaborating a business case based on the upgrading of participating Leopard 2A4 platforms to the latest configuration (2A7) and invites the European defence industry to provide its input. For this purpose, the Agency issued a Request for Information (RFI) on 22 September to the AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD) and National Defence Industry Associations (NDIAs) of EU countries, encouraging the European defence industry to consider creating cross-border industrial partnership. Upgrade of legacy MBTs to the latest technical standards would have a positive impact for European defence industry in the area of land systems. It would also contribute to the maintenance of technological excellence of the European Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB). This RFI encourages the establishment of European multinational cross-border industrial partnerships as the preferred mechanism to exploit this opportunity. Additionally, EDA considers this programme as a suitable vehicle for enhanced access for Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) to the cross-border supply chain. The business case will have to provide information on the content and cost of the Integrated Logistics Support package provided by industrial partners covering recurring/scheduled maintenance as well as estimated figures for the Life Cycle Costs of the upgraded tanks. With the support provided by EDA on updating the business case, interested Member States will further evaluate the possibility of acquiring/upgrading this up-to-date version of the tanks.

The MMF project was initiated by the European Defence Agency (EDA) in 2012 and the Organisation Conjointe de Coop\u00e9ration en mati\u00e8re d'Armement (OCCAR) manages the acquisition as the NATO Support and Procurement Agency\u2019s Contract Executing Agent. The acquisition phase was launched in July 2016 with the signing of the original contract and includes the first two years of support. Following the acquisition phase, NSPA will be responsible for the complete life-cycle management of the fleet. The Programme is funded by the four participants to the MMF project who will have the exclusive right to use these NATO-owned aircraft which will operate in a pooling arrangement. The aircraft will be configured for inflight refuelling, the transport of passengers (including VIPs) and cargo as well as for medical evacuation flights. The aircraft will be operated by a multinational unit from the Main Operating Base (MOB) in Eindhoven (NLD) and Forward Operating Base (FOB) in Cologne (GER). The delivery of the seven A330 MRTT aircraft currently on contract from Airbus Defence and Space\u2019s tanker conversion line at Getafe near Madrid is expected between 2020 and 2022. \u00a0More information:Germany and Norway formally join Netherlands and Luxembourg to operate pooled fleet of NATO-owned Airbus A330 MRTT tankers (EDA news, June 2017) Multinational Multi-Role Tanker Transport Fleet (MMF) takes shape (EDA news July 2016) Air-to-Air Refuelling - EDA Project Page\u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/09/25/multi-role-tanker-transport-fleet-(mmf)-expands-significantly"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0255", "date": "2017-09-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "\u2018COSME\u2019 grants now available for defence clusters", "text": " For the first time ever, COSME (the EU Programme for the COmpetitiveness of enterprises and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises) offers grants for European defence clusters cooperating in international partnerships.The European Defence Agency (EDA) has been exploring and highlighting COSME opportunities for \u00a0defence-related SMEs and clusters since 2016.

Twenty participants from seven countries and 14 organisations (industry and research) attended the workshop and discussed a suitable approach towards the realisation of an open architecture for soldier systems.\u00a0Industry and research representatives acknowledged and welcomed the progress made in the development of standard architecture to date. Some of the most relevant topics discussed were:The lack of standard connectors suitable for dismounted soldier systems (DSS) impedes the standardisation process as standardisation is only possible in cases where at least two sources are available.\u00a0Lack of data interfaces between weapon devices and soldier systems in the \u201cNATO Powered Accessory Rail\u201d document. Instead it focuses only on the mechanical and electrical interfaces. It was stressed that recommendations be included for such data interfaces in the STASS II architecture. The lack of data interface standardisation means that each manufacturer has to define a data interface which significantly reduces the opportunities for future interoperability.Cognitive burden to soldiers imposed by large amounts of available information. The participants recommended the study team to focus not only on technical aspects of soldier systems architecture but also the possible effects on soldiers of such large amounts of data. This aspect is critical of the way tactical information is presented. If a soldier is overwhelmed with information his/her attention can be easily diverted from the battlefield situation and as a result put him/her in danger.\u00a0The storage of collected information. Nowadays, the sensors that provide Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) capabilities generate large volumes of data. A soldier is considered an important asset to collect and thus to support ISTAR capabilities. However this creates the need for equipping him/her with additional equipment. Taking into account the current trend to reduce the cognitive, thermal or weight burden for soldier systems this aspect requires further assessment.\u00a0As stressed during the workshop, a business model and cost-benefit assessment are important prerequisites prior to investments in \u00a0soldier systems. While the majority of benefits are for the user, a STASS II compliant system facilitates a flexible and powerful arrangement that otherwise would be extremely costly.The STASS II study will be completed by the end of 2017 and together with the STASS I results will propose a comprehensive open reference architecture for soldier systems. The approach initiated under the STASS studies will be further developed under the EU Preparatory Action for Defence Research 2017 (PADR 2017) call for Force Protection and Soldier Systems by defining and technically validating a generic open soldier systems architecture which should be ready for standardisation.All presentations given during the workshop are available here:\u00a02017-09-06 - STASS II Industrial Workshop - Presentations\u00a0More informationCapTech Ground Systems page", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/09/18/eda-advances-work-towards-open-architecture-for-soldier-systems"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0257", "date": "2017-09-07", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "First cyber exercise at EU ministerial level focuses on strategic decision-making", "text": " EU Defence Ministers today participate in \u201cEU CYBRID 2017\u201d, a strategic table-top cyber defence exercise. The exercise, the first of its kind, is organised by the Estonian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, the Estonian Ministry of Defence and the European Defence Agency (EDA). The objective of EU CYBRID 2017 is to raise awareness of cybersecurity incident coordination at political level and of the potential effects of offensive cyber-campaigns. It focuses on situational awareness, crisis response mechanisms and strategic communication.\u00a0 Cyber is widely recognised as a major threat in the EU\u2019s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), yet there has been limited attention to EU missions and operations\u2019 resilience . To address cyber threats in CSDP, Estonia is organising in cooperation with the European Defence Agency a strategic table-top cyber-exercise \u201cEU CYBRID 2017\u201d for EU Ministers of Defence during their informal meeting in Tallinn on 7 September 2017. \u201cCyber, the fifth domain of warfare, must be given as much attention as land, air, sea and space. There is no 100% protection in cyber. It is imperative that EU Defence Ministers test their cyber defence mechanisms. The buy-in of Member States is key for the EU to have the necessary skills, technology and capabilities\u201d, Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency, said. The scope of the exercise is crisis response to a major offensive cyber campaign against EU military structures in a hybrid warfare context. The objectives of the exercise are: Situational awareness. Use the EU Intelligence and Situation Centre (INTCEN) to ensure a common understanding of the crisis and the impact of hybrid attacks on EU military structures and to give initial assessment/context for the cyber-campaign. Crisis Response. Raise awareness of the instruments available to the EU in to give strategic guidance on the response to a major offensive cyber-campaign against CSDP structures in a hybrid warfare context. STRATCOM. To coordinate initial messages among EU Member States at political level. Cyber defence. Raise awareness on cybersecurity incident coordination at political level and demonstrate potential effects of offensive cyber-campaigns. Trigger discussions at Council level with a view to examine possible measures in response to specific events, drawn from the crisis scenario. \u00a0 About the exercise EU CYBRID 2017 is a table-top cyber exercise focused on strategic choices and considerations at the EU ministerial level. It is not expected that exercise participants address specific technical issues that arise during the exercise: this will be addressed later in associated exercises (e.g. EU PACE 2017). The goal of the exercise is to highlight a number of strategic concerns and topics that arise in connection with any hypothetical cyber crisis. This exercise should serve as a forum for discussion at ministerial level and provide strategic guidance to address future crises. The exercise scenario include an orchestrated cyber-attack campaign against an EU-led military operation affecting both an EU Headquarter in Rome (OHQ Rome) and its subordinated maritime assets. Multiple cyber-attacks covering a range of cyber threats combined with other incidents will take place over the course of the exercise. The exercise scenario refers to fictitious countries, organisations and operations. \u00a0Cyber defence and the European Defence Agency Cyber defence is one of the priorities of the EDA\u2019s capability development plan and of the NATO-EU Joint Declaration. A project team consisting of EDA and its participating Member States' representatives is responsible for jointly developing cyber defence capabilities within the EU CSDP, supported by R&T experts. The Agency\u2019s main focus is on supporting member states in building a skilled military cyber defence workforce and in ensuring the availability of proactive and reactive cyber defence technology. The EDA for example develops, pilots and delivers a variety of cyber security & defence courses and exercises from basic awareness over expert level to decision maker training. \u00a0More information:Cyber defence project page and factsheetCybersecurity and the Estonian Presidency of the Council of the European Union", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/09/07/first-cyber-exercise-at-eu-ministerial-level-focuses-on-strategic-decision-making"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0258", "date": "2017-09-04", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Chief Executive Domecq visits Bulgaria", "text": " EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq held talks in Sofia on 3 and 4 September with the Bulgarian Minister of Defence Mr Krassimir Karakachanov, Deputy Minister of Defence Mr Atanas Zapryanov and the Deputy Foreign Minister Mrs Emiliya Kraleva.

Additionally, Member States have recently agreed for the EDA to conclude an Implementing Arrangement with the European Space Agency (ESA) on their cooperation for GOVSATCOM. This Arrangement will maximise synergies between the activities of the two Agencies to support the European Commission in its efforts for preparing an EU GOVSATCOM initiative.The EU GOVSATCOM initiative aims to provide EU Member States, organisations and operators with assured satellite communication services by 2020. As part of the programme, the European Space Agency (ESA) this week contracted Airbus to produce a demonstrator providing a technical solution for secured interconnections between different SatCom architectures and users.\u00a0This demonstrator contract follows on from two design studies running between 2015 and 2017 on behalf of the ESA and EDA respectively.

In June 2017, 14 EDA Member States (Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom) and Norway agreed to develop a demonstrator for pooling and sharing satellite communication capabilities.\u00a0BackgroundReliable, stable and secure communications are crucial in any CSDP mission or operation. Yet, terrestrial network infrastructures are not available everywhere, for instance in areas hit by natural disasters, at sea, in the air or in hostile zones. Satellite communications (SATCOM) can be the solution: rapidly deployable, flexible and distance insensitive, they offer communication links where terrestrial networks are damaged, overloaded or non-existent.However, access to SATCOM cannot be taken for granted at any time, especially not when government users require them at short notice and without pre-arranged agreements. In situations of high demand, competition with other users of commercial SATCOM capacities creates a risk of non-availability and high costs. Against this backdrop, EU leaders decided in 2013 that there was a need for a new solution combining the advantages of commercial and military satellite systems in order to address both civil and military needs through European cooperation. The European Defence Agency, in collaboration with the European Commission and the European Space Agency, is now preparing the next generation of GOVSATCOM.\u00a0GOVSATCOM will be a capability that is placed in between the commercial satellite communication market and the highly protected military satellite communication capability.\u00a0 More information\u00a0 14 EDA Member States to pool & share GOVSATCOM capabilities Governmental Satellite Communications (GovSatcom) ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/09/12/future-european-govsatcom-programme-takes-next-step"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0261", "date": "2017-08-02", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "5th EDA Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC) completed", "text": " The European Defence Agency\u2019s 5th Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC), which ran over several weeks at Royal Air Force (RAF) base in Linton-on-Ouse (North Yorkshire, UK) and Arvidsjaur Airfield in Lapland (Sweden), was successfully completed in July.

This is the main result of a study commissioned by the European Defence Agency (EDA) and conducted by a consortium consisting of FOI, the Swedish Defence research Agency, and ISL, the French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis. The study details the use of laser systems - both LIDAR-based (Light Detection and Ranging, a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges) and LADAR-based (LAser Detection And Ranging) - and indicates that their successful incorporation into existing detection and identification technologies for underwater targets in difficult operating conditions, such as those found in the Baltic Sea, can have a significant and positive impact on performance, particularly for rapid detection and identification. Laser systems can deliver operational improvements as compared to sonar systems: airborne laser scanning, for instance, can be deployed extremely quickly in order to detect, locate and track underwater or floating objects. It is also possible for airborne laser scanning to identify the types of targets, provided that the target is large enough. Once a target is detected it is then possible to quickly deploy a surface or underwater vessel equipped with a Laser Gated Viewing (LGV) or Underwater Laser Scanning (ULS) system to positively identify confirm the target information. The study concluded that laser based technologies are a viable and complementary solution for acoustic sensor systems, even in turbid waters or in waters with high organic content, such as shallow regions or archipelagos found in the Baltic Sea. \u00a0 Methodology In order to analyse the performance of these technologies, three scenarios were defined: (1) Maritime mine identification, (2) Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and submarines detection and (3) Rapid environmental assessment (REA). The study used modelling techniques along with systems knowledge to assess the performance of laser baser underwater systems. In order to assess the performance of the systems in the defined scenarios and tasks, the conditions and systems were simulated. \u00a0 Background The task to detect and identify underwater targets has traditionally been undertaken by sonar based systems, particularly in open water conditions and in waters with significant depths. However, there are situations where sonar-based systems could be assisted by complementary technology in order to achieve improved performance. Examples of such operating conditions are relatively shallow waters where sonars ships cannot operate and complex marine terrain such as coastlines with archipelagos numerous small islands, narrow sounds and inaccessible locations. The Baltic Sea, due to its high level of turbidity in coastal regions is one such area that is particularly challenging for the detection of underwater targets using laser based sensors. The occurrence of organic matter such as algae and the effect of sediment transport in the water column coupled with the seasonal optical attenuation contribute to difficulties in detecting underwater targets. \u00a0 More information CapTech Maritime (EDA project page) Maritime Surveillance (MARSUR) - EDA project page MARSUR put to the test during live demonstration at OHQ EUNAVFOR MED SOPHIA (EDA webnews, May 2017) \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/07/20/eda-study-confirms-benefits-of-laser-for-detection-identification-of-underwater-targets"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0265", "date": "2017-07-26", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Estonian Defence Minister visits EDA", "text": " J\u00fcri Luik, the Estonian Defence Minister, was welcomed today (26 July) by EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq at the Agency\u2019s premises for a fruitful exchange of views which focused on Estonia\u2019s participation in EDA projects and programmes, cyber defence, the conclusions of the recent Long Term Review of the Agency as well as the implementation of the security and defence aspects of the EU Global Strategy.

It gathered 27 experts from various European Ministries of Defence, industry, SMEs and academia related to this technology domain. The objectives were to raise awareness and better understand the potential of smart textiles and discuss the impact of these technologies on future defence capabilities.\u00a0 Today, efforts in this field are focused on the development of standards to define terms, definitions, technical specifications and requirements for smart textiles. Future trends include multi-functionalities to make the soldier lighter, safer, and smarter. Specifically the main trends include the monitoring of the well-being, health status and protection of the soldier, including adaptive camouflage and reducing the weight. Given the interest of the smart textiles for different applications, highlighted in the Materials Strategic Research Agenda (SRA), this workshop sought to gather experts in related fields to discuss future research directions within Europe, when applying this kind of materials to defence systems. The workshop brought forward multiple success stories of smart textiles used in different defence applications with functions such as: thermal control, moisture control, UV protection, functional bactericidal and self-cleaning. Ongoing activities and projects were presented by EDA and organizations from Member States showing the increasing interest and potential of smart textiles for enhancing soldier systems. Among the most targeted research areas were shown to be: durability, thermal comfort, \u00a0adaptive camouflage, measurement and communication sensors, energy harvesting and recovery, modelling and simulation tools and new materials such as graphene or bio-composites.\u00a0 The discussion also addressed manufacturing and commercialization of smart textiles, recognizing the growing market and opportunities stemming from the technological developments taking place in the civilian sector. Furthermore, the certification and standardization aspects were highlighted with particular attention paid to ensuring product quality and development of legislation. \u00a0 The main outcome of the workshop was the identification of the areas for cooperation at EU level, especially in terms of identifying and testing the available systems, and several proposals were put forward for in-depth study and future activities. Another conclusion of the workshop included the need of shaping future priorities and defining stages toward the goal of achieving multifunction soldier uniforms.\u00a0 The workshop was followed by the 37th meeting of the CapTech Materials & Structures held in the research centre ITAInnova on 31 May and 1 June. The meeting focused on the review of the CapTech\u2019s current activities and on the discussion about future actions and upcoming opportunities. The efforts of the CapTech were further acknowledged with the occasion of the visit to the EDA Additive Manufacturing facility deployed in the Zaragoza Airbase. The successful deployment of a 3D-printing lab for the duration of EAATTC 17-3 represents the main focus of EDA\u2019s ground-breaking project, \u201cAdditive Manufacturing Feasibility Study & Technology Demonstration\u201d. The deployment underscored the strong interest and potential of AM technologies across all military branches (pilots, maintenance, technicians and logistic support), who were keen to learn how 3D-printing could benefit their area of expertise. The success of this showcasing has significantly contributed to raising awareness on the operational application of these technologies and on the potential synergistic effects of undertaking European defence R&T activities.\u00a0 The workshop and the Materials CapTech meeting was co-organized by EDA\u2019s CapTechs Materials & Structures, Land Systems and CBRN & Human Factors, and the Research and Technology Organizations CITEVE, AITEX, ITAInnova and the Spanish MoD. \u00a0 More information: For further information, please contact CapTech.Materials@eda.europa.eu\u00a0 CapTech Materials & Structures CapTech Ground Systems CapTech CBRN and Human Factors EDA Research & Technology European Defence Agency Role in Research & Technology - Towards Enhanced European Future Military Capabilities Combat Equipment for Dismounted Soldier Feasibility Study Programme (CEDS FSP) Future Soldier Systems CBRN Joint Investment Programme EDA Web news on Survey: EDA consultation to identify impact of 3D-printing technologies in defence EDA web news on AM Exhibition: Exploring Additive Manufacturing impact in Defence capabilities, 12 September 2017 EDA Web News on the AM Deployment: Successful test flight for EDA 3D-printing lab during deployment at EAATTC 17-3 \u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/07/06/the-eda-materials-structures-week---workshop-on-smart-textiles-in-defence"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0268", "date": "2017-07-11", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Polish SME secures ESIF co-funding for R&T project relevant to military operations", "text": " In line with defence R&T priorities identified within its CapTechs, the European Defence Agency has successfully supported a Polish small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) to access EU funding from the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) for a 2 million euro project dealing with tropospheric radio-wave propagation to extend the range of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) operations. (picture: Airbus DS) Following an EDA procedure inviting Member States\u2019 Ministries of Defence to identify and propose R&T projects, which EDA could support in view of receiving ESIF funding, the Polish Ministry of Defence submitted this project to EDA. The project holder, an SME, has been awarded the full amount it had applied for, namely two-third of the total project cost. This is already the fifth EDA-supported R&T project funded by ESIF. EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq welcomed the fact that all five EDA-supported R&T projects funded by ESIF are led by SMEs, in line with the European Council\u2019s call to all relevant actors to work on fostering investments in defence supply-chains, with a particular focus on SMEs. Within this scope, EDA has recently: launched a free-of-charge assistance process focusing on access to the second main fund among ESIF, the European Social Fund (ESF), in support of key skills and competencies for defence (KSC). Under this procedure [\u201cESF4KSC\u201d], MoDs may forward to EDA (by the 18th of September 2017) KSC-related projects collected nationally from stakeholders; published an EDA\u2019s \u201cESIF web-platform\u201d to provide any potential defence-related stakeholder (e.g. MoDs, industry, research-and-technology organisations, academia, clusters) with an interactive mapping on \u2018sources\u2019 of regional, national and transnational calls for proposals under Structural Funds as well as respective contact details of ESIF managing authorities in charge for funding allocation. With EDA\u2019s support, defence-related technology domains benefitting from ESIF so far include energy, naval, robotics, components and modules, radio-frequency sensors, aerial, advanced materials and structures, communication Information Systems. Therefore, EDA\u2019s work has proved that ESIF is a relevant opportunity for both defence industry and RTOs, additionally to the budget earmarked for defence.

Procuring specific services such as Role 2 Medical Support or customised assets can be challenging especially on short notice. EDA assists EU military operations in fulfilling their needs for complex goods or services (e.g. armoured vehicles, air to ground surveillance, medical services ) through the CSO platform. A powerful tool for interaction, the CSO platform helps to connect economic operators and procurement authorities. Economic operators are invited to subscribe to the platform database to receive regular updates on business opportunities from EU-led operations or other governmental and institutional authorities. EUTM-S is currently seeking for Role 2 medical care services to cover the region of Mogadishu. Medical care support is categorised into four roles that identify the functions and the capabilities of a medical unit or element. Most of the care capabilities of each role are subordinates to the next higher role. In general a Role 2\u00a0 as medical care support is characterised by its ability to perform surgical interventions, including damage control\u00a0 surgery and\u00a0 surgical\u00a0 procedures\u00a0 for\u00a0 emergency\u00a0 surgical\u00a0 cases,\u00a0 to\u00a0 deliver\u00a0 life,\u00a0 limb\u00a0 and\u00a0 function\u00a0 saving\u00a0 medical\u00a0 treatment and to perform reception / triage of casualties.

The two nations committed to participating in the project through the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding at NATO HQ in Brussels today. Known as the Multinational Multi-Role Tanker Transport Fleet (MMF) the programme was initiated by the European Defence Agency (EDA) in 2012. Europe\u2019s organization for the management of cooperative armament programmes - OCCAR - manages the MMF acquisition phase as Contract Executing Agent on behalf of the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA). Following the acquisition phase, NSPA will be responsible for the complete life-cycle management of the fleet. The Programme is funded by the four nations who will have the exclusive right to use these NATO\u2013owned aircraft which will operate in a pooling arrangement. The aircraft will be configured for inflight refuelling, the transport of passengers and cargo, and medical evacuation flights. The first two aircraft have already been ordered to be delivered from Airbus Defence and Space\u2019s tanker conversion line at Getafe near Madrid in 2020. Five additional aircraft will now be ordered, and that order will include options for up to four further aircraft. NSPA GM, Peter Dohmen said \u201cAs NATO\u2019s Support and Procurement Agency, we are proud to be a key enabler of this critical project to help European nations meet their air transport and refuelling requirements. The successful cooperation in this project - bringing together all our capabilities - bodes extremely well for further future NATO / EU collaboration.\u201d OCCAR Director, Arturo Alfonso-Meiri\u00f1o said: \u201cThe MMF programme has broken new ground in bringing together the combined capabilities of the EDA, NSPA and OCCAR as one team, with each organisation working within its particular sphere of expertise. I very much welcome that this important initiative has now attracted additional partners to join, and it still includes options for the participation of even more countries.\u201d EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq said: \u201cThe MMF is a prime example of European defence cooperation which shows that once a capability shortfall has been jointly identified, European nations can pull together, work on a common project aimed at filling the gap, and eventually deliver.

Results of the exercise will feed into the revised Capability Development Plan (CDP) which will be presented to Ministers of Defence in the first semester of 2018. The three day long exercise is part of the CDP revision and addresses the review of the current Long Term Trend Capability Assessment, with a perspective on 2035 and beyond. It comprises in-depth analysis and assessment of all military tasks, identifying the evolution of key military requirements, the key trends towards 2035 and beyond, the future importance of the different tasks, as well as related risks and challenges. \u201cSimilar to previous table top exercises, we evaluate capability trends by using threat scenarios. Only this time, the elaboration of these scenarios was more complex as we are looking at trends in 2035 and beyond. We thus worked closely together with military R&T experts to elaborate scenarios including technology available in about 20 years. The aim is to derive future military capability development trends in a European setting\u201d, says Roland Van Reybroeck, Cooperation Planning & Support Director at EDA. The TTX will address the full scope of military tasks in view of answering the question \u201cwhich capabilities will Member States\u2019 armed forces need in 2035 and beyond?\u201d An important aspect thereby is to analyse in detail the capability implications in different scenarios. \u201cIf we take for example global warming and the melting of ice caps, apart from ecological and economic consequences, the military would need to look at its long term capability needs to face new geopolitical scenarios potentially resulting from climate change. In this context, military long term capability planners would for example examine related requirements for the next generation of frigates\u201d, explains Lars-Ove Roos, Project Officer at EDA.

Some 600 military personnel from seven Member States (Portugal, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, the United Kingdom), the European Air Transport Command (EATC) as well as observers from Brazil and Hungary participated in this sixth edition of EATT. The tragic loss of life in northern Portugal as a result of wildfires was a sombre backdrop to this year\u2019s training. Understandably, a large element of the exercise\u2019s firefighting and heavy lift equipment was redeployed to the rescue effort at very short notice. Nevertheless, the training continued with eight aircraft (see below) and ten aircrews from seven nations and over 600 supporting personnel in the form of ground engineers, paratroopers, logistic teams and normal operational support personnel drawn from the air force, army and navies of the contribution nations, underlining the inherently joint nature of contemporary operations and training. As in previous years, the focus of the second week has been on advanced tactical operations with the crews dropping tactical loads and paratroopers within an increasingly complex intelligence driven scenario.\u00a0 The main effort is to operate the aircraft in packages of up to six\u00a0 to form the mainstream of a Composite Air Operation (COMAO) mission with integrated fighter aircraft as protection.\u00a0 The training has offered a very sharp reality check through the addition of surface-to-air threat emulators that illuminate the aircraft, testing their tactical ability and drawing lessons on the challenges of operating\u00a0 in contested air environments.\u00a0 The German A400M was a welcome new addition to this year\u2019s event and was put through its paces by the exercise staff who are drawn from the EATC, the newly formed European Tactical Airlift Centre (ETAC), EDA and the multi-national Core Planning team from the contributing Member States.\u00a0 The training also enjoyed a visit from observers from the Brazilian Air Force and a multi-disciplinary team from Hungary who is planning to run a future EATT from Papa airbase.\u00a0 Despite the restrictions on airspace and equipment resulting from the operations to the north to counter the wildfires, the participating crews are unanimous in the need to run more multi-national events to improve interoperability and to share best practice in this critical operational domain. EATT17 (as of 2018 to be renamed European Tactical Airlift Project Training, ETAP-T) is also an important milestone for EDA in that it marks the first practical handover of a training activity from the Agency to the ETAC following the formal transfer of responsibility that occurred on 8th June 2017 in Zaragoza.\u00a0 HRVP Mogherini and the Spanish Defence Minister Mme de Cospedal opened the ETAC in a joint ceremony, which also included the symbolic handover of the ETAC banner from EDA\u2019s Chief Executive Jorge Domecq to the newly appointed ETAC commander. EDA will continue to support the 20-nation European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) Programme in other areas of airlift such as harmonisation of diplomatic clearances and the development of user groups for specific aircraft operators.

However, while research on Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) in classical business environments has produced satisfactory and well-established solutions, this is not the case for mobile/tactical environments in which operators have to deal with much more complex challenges (such as the limitations of disruptive and throughput-constrained networks, aggravated by limited end user devices) for which existing SOA technologies are not an answer.\u00a0 EDA\u2019s TACTICS project was thus launched in February 2014 to: propose measures to mitigate the constraints of military tactical environments so that they can also benefit from SOA; and to formally describe a Tactical Service Infrastructure (TSI) in a reference architecture following the NATO Architecture Framework (NAF). \u00a0 Results\u00a0 At the beginning of the project, military constraints, operational requirements and expected SOA benefits were collected and defined with the help of national military experts. On this basis, a reference architecture for a Tactical Service Infrastructure (TSI) was designed in such a way that it can cope with the constraints.\u00a0 By performing a number of technology studies in dedicated fields of research, it was ensured that the TSI reference architecture encompasses up-to-date and also novel research results reaching from security policy management, traffic engineering, quality of service provision and interoperability mechanisms for semantic service registries.\u00a0 The resulting TSI reference architecture describes how a future SOA-based middleware could be established and what mechanisms the middleware can take advantage of, to support user-facing services\u2019 realisation in a tactical constrained environment.

This multinational exercise was initiated within the framework of the European Air Transport Fleet Programme of the European Defence Agency (EDA) and will be executed by the newly founded European Tactical Airlift Centre (ETAC) and supported by the European Air Transport Command (EATC).\u00a0 The overall objective of this exercise is to achieve a high level of interoperability among air transport capable EDA Member States by exposing their crews to a complex operational environment, in which to practice their procedures and tactics and to gain \u00a0the necessary qualifications to perform tactical operations in current theatres of conflict and humanitarian relief. EATT2017 is set up to give the participating aircrews a variety of training, from basic tactical elements like practicing assault landings and air drop procedures to complex multi-ship combat mission profiles. The planning and execution is assisted by mentors, ensuring proper application of the common tactical guidelines. In parallel, training of Combined Air Terminal Operation (CATO) personnel is taking place on the ground, dealing with cargo preparation, loading of aircraft, and administrative procedures.\u00a0 Around 100 paratroopers from Germany, France, the Netherlands, Poland, and Portugal will be deployed daily by mission aircraft. From the multi-organisational staff to the multi-national contingents, EATT2017 focuses on the overarching goal of increasing the interoperability of European airlift assets through training based on agreed common procedures. With already over 100 crews having received European tactical airlift training and over 2,000 hours flown in the past five years, EATT2017 follows in this spirit, and is a tangible example of improving Europe\u2019s military airlift provision for a strong European defence. Assets and staff from seven Member States participate in EATT2017: Germany (C-160 Transall and A400M Atlas), France (C-130H Hercules), the Netherlands (C-130H Hercules), Poland (C295), Portugal (C-130H Hercules), Romania (C-27J), and United Kingdom (C-130J Hercules).\u00a0 \u00a0 More information: EATF project page EATT2017 Factsheet ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/06/19/european-air-transport-training-2017-takes-off"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0277", "date": "2017-06-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "14 EDA Member States to pool & share GOVSATCOM capabilities", "text": " On June 15th the EDA Steering Board accepted, by written procedure, the Outline Description for the Governmental Satellite Communications (GOVSATCOM) Pooling and Sharing demonstration project (GSC demo). Under the leadership of Spain, the project brings together Austria, Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, France, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Norway, which has signed an Administrative Arrangement with the Agency, is also participating in the project. The next step will be the establishment of a Project Arrangement. The project originates from an EDA Steering Board decision of November 2013 which tasked EDA to pursue its work on GOVSATCOM coordination with Member States, the European Commission and the European Space Agency in order to propose a comprehensive programme for Member States who wish to participate. Subsequently, the task to prepare the next generation of GOVSATCOM was confirmed by the European Council in December 2013 and work on GOVSATCOM has also started at the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Commission. The main objective of the project is to meet the GOVSATCOM demands of Member States and European CSDP actors through pooled capabilities (bandwidth/power and/or services) provided by contributing Member States. This governmental pooled capability is set up to provide SATCOM resources that cannot be obtained on the commercial market \u00a0with a sufficient level of guaranteed access and security.\u00a0 The Steering Board acceptance marks the end of the GOVSATCOM preparation phase where EDA employed a sequential approach in developing this project, analysing since 2014 satellite communication needs for European actors involved in the conduct of national or CSDP operations and detailing potential solutions to address the capability development. \u00a0 The work in EDA has been supported by a feasibility study since mid-2015. This study identified the GOVSATCOM Information Exchange Requirements and provided a forecast tool assessing both defense satellite connectivity requirements in support of European CSDP activities and national operations of EU Member States, as well as civil government requirements for European government stakeholders. The focus was on communications requiring guarantee of access, security and autonomy that go beyond standard commercial satellite solutions, without requiring the highest level of security that only military satellite systems can provide.\u00a0 The next step then was to carry out a detailed assessment of existing and planned commercial and governmental satellite systems and their suitability to meet the aforementioned requirements. The study relied on a variety of sources and analytical processes, including the use of an external study conducted for the European Commission on civil government requirements and studies conducted for ESA to define new satellite systems to fill gaps identified in the assessment part of the EDA GOVSATCOM feasibility study. In parallel with the study, EDA\u2019s SATCOM project team developed the GOVSATCOM Common Staff Requirements and an associated Business Case. Both documents have been approved by the Steering Board in March 2017.\u00a0 The Business Case closely follows a recommendation of the study for EDA to explore a Pooling and Sharing demonstration as part of the European GOVSATCOM initiative. The project will be put in place progressively with due consideration given to the impact it might have on suppliers, users and alternative frameworks. The Pooling and Sharing demonstration will require close cooperation, not only \u00a0between the Member States which contribute to the SATCOM capability pool and those who use it but also with the other GOVSATCOM activities pursued in ESA and the Commission. The Ad-Hoc Working Group of the GSC demo project, consisting of all 14 Member States and Norway, will now establish the Project Arrangement detailing the legal conditions for the project. \u00a0 Background Reliable, stable and secure communications are crucial in any CSDP mission or operation. Yet, terrestrial network infrastructures are not available everywhere, for instance in areas hit by natural disasters, at sea, in the air or in hostile zones. Satellite communications (SATCOM) can be the solution: rapidly deployable, flexible and distance insensitive, they offer communication links where terrestrial networks are damaged, overloaded or non-existent. However, access to SATCOM cannot be taken for granted at any time, especially not when government users require them at short notice and without pre-arranged agreements. In situations of high demand, competition with other users of commercial SATCOM capacities creates a risk of non-availability and high costs. Against this backdrop, EU leaders decided in 2013 that there was a need for a new solution combining the advantages of commercial and military satellite systems in order to address both civil and military needs through European cooperation. The European Defence Agency, in collaboration with the European Commission and the European Space Agency, is now preparing the next generation of GOVSATCOM.\u00a0 GOVSATCOM will be a capability that is placed in between the commercial satellite communication market and the highly protected military satellite communication capability. \u00a0 More information: EDA factsheet GOVSATCOM EDA project page GOVSATCOM Video: GOVSATCOM - SATCOM for security and defence\u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/06/16/14-eda-member-states-to-pool-share-govsatcom-capabilities"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0278", "date": "2017-06-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA launches its \u2018ESIF web-platform\u2019", "text": " As a follow-up to the Commission\u2019s European Defence Action Plan acknowledging that European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) may be used by Member States in the defence sector, the European Defence Agency publishes the \u201cEDA\u2019s ESIF web-platform\u201d to provide any potential defence-related stakeholder (including MoDs, industry, research-and-technology organisations, academia, clusters) both with: an interactive analytical mapping on \u2018sources\u2019 of regional, national, and transnational calls for proposals under Structural Funds and respective contact details of the hundreds ESIF managing authorities ultimately in charge for funding allocation.

Four crews, representing three Member States (Germany: C160; Poland C130 and Spain: C295 and C130) received their certificates following the completion of the two-week training course. Over 120 personnel were involved including support personnel from Italy, Belgium, the European Air Transport Command (EATC) and JAPCC. The training provided air transport crews with a focused airlift tactics training syllabus specifically designed to enhance interoperability between European air forces. Nine missions were executed, including very low level tactical flights, fighter engagement and evasive maneuvers from ground-to-air threats all trying to stop the air drops of critical cargo and paratroopers. \u00a0Each crew flew an average of 20 hours in a particularly demanding environment and completed several successful tactical flights to successfully graduate from the course.\u00a0 \u00a0 Jorge Domecq (EDA Chief Executive), Federica Mogherini, Dolores de Cospedal \u00a0 3D-Printing in defence: Successful test deployment of AM facility \u00a0 EDA\u2019s ground-breaking project, \u201cAdditive Manufacturing Feasibility Study & Technology Demonstration\u201d, successfully deployed a 3D-printing lab to Zaragoza for the duration of EAATTC 17-3. The project aims to assess the areas where Additive Manufacturing (3D-printing) can have a positive impact on defence capabilities and to demonstrate the feasibility of on-site critical component manufacture. On May 31st, the lab was loaded on a Spanish C-130 and successfully completed a 30 minute flight. This test was pivotal to examining the feasibility of the facility to be deployed by air. After landing, the lab and its equipment was inspected and found to have encountered no issues from the airlift.\u00a0 During the deployment, the AM lab generated a lot of interest from the multinational units involved in EAATTC 17-3. Lab technicians worked closely with EAATTC 17-3 officials in the design and production of different test parts. Through these interactions, the technicians were able to gather ideas to print parts on-site and on-demand. The deployment also underscored the strong interest and potential of AM technologies across all military branches (pilots, maintenance, technicians and logistic support), who were keen to learn how 3D-printing could benefit their area of expertise.\u00a0 The deployment has been successful in terms of showcasing the technologies and raising awareness of their operational application. Furthermore, the lessons learned from the deployment and test flight of the AM lab will also contribute to shaping the design and requirement of future 3D-printing facilities.\u00a0 The results of this feasibility demonstration will be presented in September, as part of an exhibition (Exploring Additive Manufacturing impact in Defence capabilities) to high-ranking military staff, to raise awareness on the possible impact of AM in defence. \u00a0 More information:\u00a0 EDA Fact sheet on EAATTC 17-3 EDA Fact sheet on 3D-printing \u00a0 ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/06/08/european-tactical-airlift-centre-opens-in-zaragoza"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0285", "date": "2017-06-09", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ONLINE now: the new EDA magazine is out!", "text": " The latest European Defence Matters magazine is now available with a special focus on the EU\u2019s Space Strategy and its implications, opportunities and challenges for Defence.\u00a0 NEW: the magazine is now also available ONLINE in a user-friendly, state of the art responsive lay-out and accessible via all your devices: smartphone, tablet or desktop! \u00a0Check it out HERE Space-based civilian services have become indispensable in everyone's daily lives.

The PADR will provide European added value as the research projects will focus on capability priorities at European level, notably through the Capability Development Plan (CDP), and on areas where Member States can no longer afford to act alone. Thereby, it will also create new incentives for cooperation both among governments and industry. At the signing ceremony, Commissioner El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska stated: \u201cThe Commission is ready to play its role to the full and to even put EU funds and legal frameworks to support defence research and defence capabilities. This is potentially a game changer. However, to achieve this we need the expertise of the EDA. Together we can make a real difference. This partnership will continue to be important as we build the Defence Fund with the implementation of the European Defence Industrial Development Programme\u201d. EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq thanked the Commission for making the Delegation Agreement possible and said the EDA was looking forward to a good and fruitful implementation. He stated: \u201cOur work in carrying forward the Preparatory Action will be in line with EDA\u2019s role as central operator for EU funded defence related activities as well as the preferred cooperation forum and management support structure at EU level for participating Member States to engage in technology and capability development activities, highlighted at EDA\u2019s last Ministerial Steering Board. I am proud we have successfully achieved this agreement which lays the basis for a sound and fruitful cooperation between the Commission and EDA for the years to come. It is a balanced Delegation Agreement in which the Commission and EDA will be genuine partners. The Preparatory Action on Defence Research will be the test bed for the coming European Defence Research Programme\u201d. \u00a0 Foundations laid by successful Pilot Project The foundations for the Preparatory Action were laid last year with the successful launch of a much smaller \u2018Pilot Project on Defence Research\u2019 which is also managed by the EDA on the basis of a Delegation Agreement signed in November 2015. The Pilot Project was a first opportunity for the EDA to demonstrate its ability to manage EU funding for defence research. Mr Domecq stressed that the Agency was now ready and well prepared to run the much bigger PADR with its \u20ac90 million budget of which \u20ac25 million are earmarked for 2017. The EDA played an important \u2018upstream role\u2019 in setting up the Preparatory Action and will also have a crucial \u2018downstream\u2019 task to fulfil, as a hub for the exploitation of the outcome of the different R&T projects under the PADR. \u00a0 Next steps Now that the Delegation Agreement is signed, the EDA will immediately proceed with its implementation. The first step will be the launch, on 7 June, of the 2017 calls for proposals. An Information Day is then scheduled for 27 June in order to inform entities from industry and the research community (including universities) about the opportunities and modalities of the Preparatory Action. Proposals can be submitted by the autumn and the signature of the first grant agreements is envisaged by the end of this year. Calls for 2018 proposals are expected to be launched early next year. \u00a0 More information: EDA factsheet on PADR Practical details on 27 June Information Day Preparatory Action\u00a0on Defence Research: Commission adopts financial decision with project d\u00e9tails (EDA webnews, April 2017) ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/05/31/commission-and-eda-sign-delegation-agreement-for-preparatory-action-on-defence-research"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0287", "date": "2017-06-02", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Successful test flight for EDA 3D-printing lab during deployment at EAATTC 17-3", "text": " In a major step forward for EDA\u2019s innovative Additive Manufacturing (AM or 3D-printing) in defence project, the AM lab completed a successful test flight on-board a Spanish C-130, fulfilling all airlift requirements for a military deployment and civilian transport. The test flight,\u00a0 part of the simulated deployment the 3D-printing facility is currently undergoing at the European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course (EAATTC 17-3) in Zaragoza, was pivotal to examining its feasibility to be deployed by air.

This was the 11th helicopter exercise under the umbrella of EDA\u2019s Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP). With 16 air assets and roughly 500 military participants, it once again proved the immense value of collaborative training for the troops, aircrew, maintenance and support personnel who took part. Organised at P\u00e1pa in Hungary, the Exercise proved to be a high-tempo, dynamic event. A total of 250 flight hours were accumulated, almost 28000 ammunition rounds and 480 non-guided rockets fired. The five participating Member States (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Slovenia and Hungary) participated with 14 different European helicopters. The first week included a complete day of briefings covering flight safety, expected battle rhythm and host nation support, weapon range procedures and a review of joint helicopter tactics. This theoretical element was followed with familiarisation of the aircrew with P\u00e1pa airbase, emergency rehearsals with firefighters and (SOF) troops to take account of the different helicopters types and to ensure high safety levels were achieved in all areas. \u00a0The first week continued with individual training, helicopter operations by day and night, fighter evasion missions with Hungarian JAS-39 GRIPEN jets and live-fire training on the different weapon ranges. Despite significant bad weather with low cloud and thunderstorms, all day and night missions were completed successful. In the second week, the shooting ranges north of Lake Balaton were fully utilised, allowing the flying participants to train in a highly realistic mixed rural and urban environment and adapt their thinking to complex missions with integrated live-firing scenarios. As the exercise matured, the multi-national crews conducted coalition level training, which culminated in the planning and execution of \u00a07 Composite Air Operation (COMAO) missions. These covered a spectrum of advanced helicopter manoeuvre tactics including a large formation of helicopters with embarked troops and integrated training Joint Terminal Air Controllers (JTAC), set against complex threats such as SA-6 SAM, T-72 Main Battle tanks and GRIPEN fighter aircraft. The experience of working together and practicing live firing tactics in combined and joint missions is a critical requirement to maintain operational readiness at a realistic level. With most nations working within tight financial constraints, this level of advanced training is virtually impossible to achieve on a purely national basis. \u00a0However, in addition to the cost sharing benefits, the exercise also offers a step change in improved interoperability which has become the hallmark of the HEP. In his closing remarks, the Exercise Director expressed his appreciation to everyone who had contributed to the success of the exercise:\u00a0\u201cDuring this two week period all of you demonstrated a high sense of commitment and accomplished your tasks with diligence and professionalism. We come from different nations, with different languages, but we have the same missions and the same challenges to address. You have demonstrated that working together is the only solution to achieve our appointed tasks and reaching success.\u201d Even as the Exercise draws to a close, work to identify critical lessons begins. \u00a0FIRE BLADE 2017 is but a waypoint in the Programme\u2019s objective of continuous improvement of European helicopter operational capability. \u00a0 The job now is to build on this excellent foundation as we move forward to the next exercise in Portugal in June 2018. \u00a0 More information: Fact Sheet Exercise FIRE BLADE 2017 Helicopter Initiatives (EDA project page) 11th EDA Helicopter Exercise \u201cFIRE BLADE\u201d ready for take-off in Hungary! \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/05/22/fire-blade-2017-11th-eda-helicopter-exercise-concludes-after-successful-live-firing-operations"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0291", "date": "2017-05-17", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Second Test and Evaluation Community Days Conference held in Vienna", "text": " The second Conference on Test and Evaluation (T&E) was held in Vienna on 24-27 April 2017 with the title \u201cEuropean priorities - challenges and opportunities for a large EU network of T&E Centres\u201c. Building on the success of the first conference held in Rome in 2014, the Vienna conference was attended by around 100 experts from 17 EDA Member States, the European defence industry, and the European Commission, as well as NATO representatives. The aim was to provide a forum for the T&E community to exchange ideas, information and experiences. The conference was opened by Lieutenant General Norbert Gehart, Armament Director, Austrian Federal Ministry for National Defence and Sport, and Mr Rini Goos, Deputy Chief Executive, European Defence Agency, and was hosted by the Austrian Armament and Defence Technology Agency. The conference sessions were moderated by the EDA Cooperation Panning and Support Director Mr. Roland Van Reybroeck, together with members of the Defence Test and Evaluation Base (DTEB) Plenary Group. Current challenges for T&E requirements derived from the Capability Development Plan (CDP) in the wider context of the under the EU Global Strategy provided the basis for more than 20 presentations and interactive discussions among conference participants. European T&E cooperation examples and visits to Austrian test facilities provided practical insights and the opportunity to exchange experiences and lessons learned. Main results of the conference included the acknowledgment of common challenges facing the T&E community and the need for a large European network of test facilities. Test and evaluation was recognized as a key enabler in support ofEU capability development priorities contributing to the objectives of the EU Global Strategy Implementation Plan on Security and Defence. The conference encouraged participating Member States to enhance cooperation and coordination of T&E initiatives under the EDA umbrella, to improve awareness of existing T&E capabilities, to explore opportunities for civil and military cooperation and to maintain and further develop key skills and competences in the T&E domain to the largest extent possible. \u00a0 Background The Test and Evaluation Community Days Conference is an EDA initiative held every three years in cooperation with a participating Member State. It brings together experts from Europe\u2019s government Test Centres, project managers, T&E Directors, and European Defence Technology Industry Base (DTIB) representatives to exchange information, learn from each other and initiate new T&E projects, and create strategic networks to support EU forces. \u00a0 More information: EDA prepares inter-laboratory test round to counter electromagnetic effects on operations (News, July 2016) Inaugural Test and Evaluation conference delivers results (December 2014) ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/05/17/second-test-and-evaluation-community-days-conference-held-in-vienna"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0292", "date": "2017-05-12", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Cyber Ranges: EDA\u2019s First Ever Cyber Defence Pooling & Sharing Project Launched By 11 Member States", "text": " On May 5th, the Project Arrangement (PA) for the first ever Cyber Defence Pooling & Sharing Project was signed by all eleven contributing Member States. The Cyber Ranges Federation Project brings together Austria, Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Finland, Ireland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden \u00a0under the co-lead of the Netherlands, Finland and Greece. The project originates from an EDA initiative and will be carried out under the EU pooling & sharing agenda with support from EDA. The core aims of the project include: increasing the availability of existing and emerging cyber range facilities; increasing the occupation rate and efficiency of cyber ranges and platforms; \u00a0mainstream and improve cyber defence training, exercises and testing at European level. Under this PA, the objectives will be achieved in a spiral approach over the next 36 months. The Cyber Ranges Federation Project is the first of four Cyber Defence Projects launched so far under the Pooling & Sharing agenda. While other projects such as Improved Cyber Situation Awareness, improved Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) detection, and pooling of Member States\u2019 demand for private sector-provided cyber training are still in the preparation phase, the Cyber Ranges Federation Project is the first cyber defence related collaborative EDA project that is moving from the preparation phase to the implementation phase. A total of 30 work packages are foreseen for the project, divided between two spirals. Work on the first spiral, composed of 19 different work packages, will commence with the first meeting of the Project Management Committee under the lead of the Netherlands. Spiral 1 is expected to be completed within 18 months. The remaining 11 work packages will be completed after a review of the results of spiral 1 under the lead of Finland in spiral 2. It is expected that the projects will substantially contribute to improving the quality and authenticity of cyber defence related education, training and exercise formats for all stakeholders in Europe. This will be achieved by providing on the one hand wide ranging and capable technical platforms and on the other by establishing a European community of experts on up-to-date cyber defence training and exercises.\u00a0 The sharing of knowledge and best practice is also an implicit objective of the project. In doing so, the Cyber Ranges Federation will also be supported by an EDA developed web-based Cyber Defence Training and Exercise Coordination Platform (CD TEXP), which is expected to be operational by the end of this year. In addition to training and exercise support, the cyber ranges can also be effectively employed in the areas of research as well as modelling, simulation and testing. Project preparation was observed by NATO, and in the light of the NATO-EU Joint Declaration, additional ways for cooperation with the project of NATO to establish its own cyber range capacity will be sought by the contributing Member States. \u00a0 \u00a0 Background The success of military operations, including EU-led operations, is increasingly dependent on the availability of, and access to, cyberspace. The EU Cyber Security Strategy 2013 recognizes Cyber Defence as one of the strategic priorities of the EU and Heads of State and Governments decided in December 2013 that Cyber Defence should be one of four key areas for capability development. \u00a0An essential element of EU cyber defence capability is highly skilled and well-trained personnel. Enhancing awareness and education of technicians, operators and decision-makers is urgent. Cyber ranges to support training and exercises are both essential and scarce. In the 2014 Capability Development Plan, the scarceness of cyber range facilities in support of Training and Exercises was recognized as an important capability gap that urgently needs resolution. The now established project serves to close this capability gap. Pooling & Sharing projects are an integral means for closing capability gaps in the cyber domain.\u00a0 \u00a0 More information: Cyber: EDA, ENISA, EC3 and CERT-EU discuss future cooperation EDA supports Operation Sophia with Cyber Awareness Seminars (webnews November 2016) Cyber Defence (EDA project page) Cyber defence factsheet ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/05/12/cyber-ranges-eda-s-first-ever-cyber-defence-pooling-sharing-project-launched-by-11-member-states"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0293", "date": "2017-05-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Call for submissions: EDA Defence Industry workshop looking at the long-term outlook for RPAS", "text": " EDA has opened a call for submissions from defence industry representatives on the topic of Remotely Piloted Air Systems (RPAS).

The Long Term Review (LTR) conclusions and recommendations endorsed by Ministers will reinforce the Agency to keep it fit for purpose in the light of upcoming, more ambitious tasks and challenges deriving from the EU\u2019s new Global Strategy. Set to be implemented over the coming months, the agreed measures will strengthen the EDA as the main intergovernmental prioritisation instrument at EU level in support of capability development, with a more output-oriented Capability Development Plan (CDP) and a key role in operating the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD). They also will enhance the EDA as the preferred cooperation forum and management support structure at EU level to engage in technology and capability development activities, ranging from R&T to critical enablers, exercise and training as well as support to operations, including the industrial dimension. The Agency is also to be reinforced as an interface between Member States and EU institutions and as a central operator for EU-funded defence-related activities such as, for example, the upcoming Preparatory Action on defence research and the future European Defence Research Programme. \u00a0 Cooperative Financial Mechanism (CFM) Ministers welcomed the financial and legal package presented by the Agency and approved the setting up of an Cooperative Financial Mechanism as an EDA Ad-Hoc CAT A programme. Negotiations with Member States on a Programme Arrangement will start soon. The EDA was invited to report to the Steering Board on progress made during these negotiations before the signature of the Programme Arrangement. The objective of the Cooperative Financial Mechanism, to which contributing Member States would participate and contribute on a strictly voluntary basis, is to incentivize defence cooperation by overcoming the lack of budgetary synchronisation between Member States and the problems that this causes for the launch of cooperative defence cooperation projects. Experience has shown that unsynchronized budget availability at the launch phase of a collaborative programme is one of the key challenges. Through the CFM, Member States can support each other via a system of reimbursable advances and deferred payments. The mechanism can also be used more widely as a hub for managing investments, such as EDA R&T projects, and ring-fencing resources allocated for cooperative purposes. It will facilitate the launch of collaborative projects and have positive repercussions in capability, technological and industrial terms. \u00a0 Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD) Ministers welcomed the work carried out by the EDA, in close cooperation with EEAS, on the definition of the scope, principles, methodology and detailed modalities of the CARD which will start with a trial run as of this autumn. The Agency was encouraged to pursue this work. Minister agreed to present a report on the trial run to the Steering Board in November 2018. The CARD aims at facilitating Member States delivering in particular on EU capability development priorities agreed in the framework of the Capability Development Plan (CDP). The CARD will also allow Defence Ministers to regularly take stock of the European capability development landscape, assess progress in cooperative capability development to date and share information on defence spending plans. \u00a0 Engagement with industry, other topics Ministers endorsed EDA\u2019s revised approach towards establishing a structured dialogue and enhanced engagement with industry based on a set of priority actions focused on the capability development process, exercises, R&T prioritization, innovation, SES/SESAR, Key Strategic Activities and support to industry. These priorities will guide the 2017-2018 activities of EDA in relation to industry. The Steering Board tasked the Agency with presenting an assessment report of these priorities and their implementation in November 2018. Ministers also welcomed the work already conducted by the EDA on the Preparatory Action on Defence Research, with the Delegation Agreement expected to be signed end of May. Ministers also took stock of the Agency\u2019s main cooperative programmes (such as, for example, Air-to-Air Refuelling, Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems - RPAS, GovSatCom and Cyberdefence) and reviewed the progress made in other projects within the portfolio of more than 50 capability projects currently run by the EDA.

ETAC represents one of the largest transfers of a project, created and developed by the EDA, to one of its Member States on a permanent basis.\u00a0 Zaragoza will officially become the home of the European Air Transport Fleet (EAFT) Programme on June 8th in a ceremony marking the transfer of this project from the EDA to Spain. Created in 2011 by EDA, and signed by 20 participating nations, the EATF partnership aims to increase the EU\u2019s airlift capabilities by addressing shortages and increasing interoperability. The establishment of a permanent multinational airlift training centre (ETAC) marks a major step forward in European defence collaboration in the critical capability domain of tactical airlift.\u00a0 \u00a0 An EDA first: Joint Deployment of EAATTC 17-3 and 3D Printing Lab\u00a0 The third European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course for 2017 (EAATTC 17-3), hosted by the Spanish Airforce at Zaragoza airbase will run from 28 May to 9 June 2017. This edition of EAATTC gathers five aircraft from four different countries (Belgium: C130; Germany: C160; Poland C130 and Spain: C295 and C130). This training aims to provide air transport crews with a robust airlift tactics training syllabus in order to enhance interoperability between European air forces. The graduation ceremony for participating aircrew will take place as part of the opening of the ETAC on June 8 2017. As part of EDA\u2019s approach to explore new avenues for defence cooperation and enabling technologies, its innovative project on 3D printing in defence will be deployed as part of EAATTC 17-3. The project, officially titled \u201cAdditive Manufacturing Feasibility Study & Technology Demonstration\u201d, aims to assess the areas where Additive Manufacturing (AM) (3D printing) \u00a0can have a positive impact on defence capabilities and to demonstrate its feasibility.\u00a0 The second work strand of this project is a technology demonstration of AM in a simulated deployment scenario. Its aim is to demonstrate the feasibility and operational utility of deploying these technologies in support of a military operation. The deployment of the 3D printing lab represents a significant step in bridging the data gap on 3D printer performance in deployed conditions and will demonstrate the operational utility of these technologies.\u00a0 First of all the lab will be deployed on a test flight to examine its feasibility to be deployed by air. During the exercise the lab technicians will interact with the officials deployed at EAATTC 17-3, presenting the possibilities offered by the equipment, and identifying in a close dialogue with them what are the main needs in an operation that could be fulfilled with an AM facility. Together, the technicians the officials will select a number of different test parts to be produced on site and on demand, with different grades of complexity.\u00a0 The project represents a clear example of how cross-fertilization of ideas from different domains, from R&T to operations, will enhance defence capabilities, especially when supporting deployed missions. The overall study has the objective of raising awareness in the defence community and of promoting a better understanding of the potential held by these technologies, thereby stimulating their implementation in defence specific areas. \u00a0 Media Day \u2013 June 8 Members of the media can avail of a special one day media flight from Brussels to Zaragoza airbase (kindly provided by the Belgian Ministry of Defence) for the opening of ETAC.

The military medical support options in Europe used to be designed and optimised for military operations of a larger scale. For some of the current missions conducted in the context of the European Union\u2019s Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP), such as antipiracy or training missions, a far smaller number of personnel has to be deployed than in the operations mentioned above. Against that background EDA carried out the study \u201cMedical Support to Light Footprint Operations\u201d which involved EDA\u2019s \u2018Project Team Medical\u2019 and other Ad Hoc Medical Working Groups. The key issue investigated by the study was to keep the quality of medical support at the highest possible level for missions of smaller scale. The overarching goal was to provide participating Member States with the analytical means to identify new ways of providing effective medical support to so-called \u2018Light Footprint Operations\u2019 (LFO) in the context of CSDP. As LFOs are not formally described in current EU or NATO doctrines, there is no agreed set of principles or best practices to tailor medical support to this type of missions. The study commissioned by EDA analysed key elements of LFOs provides recommendations on a way forward on how to tailor and improve medical support for LFOs, namely: EU Medical Concept - requirements for medical support for LFOs and best practices for the provision of medical support must be introduced into the current EU Medical Concept; Further harmonization of qualification, material and concepts \u2013 based on lessons identified in recent CSDP missions, including difficulties and major obstacles, the study describes options for improved interoperability between units providing medical support, including to facilitate harmonisation and standardisation; Categorization of Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) - based on lessons identified in recent CSDP missions, the study analyzed that the concept of allocation roles should be revisited to consider modularization of medical units as a cost-effective way; New technologies and research activities - the study indicates opportunities for multinational cooperation in development and research activities for new technologies, that could be used for both reduce the footprint of medical support in LFOs and the improvement of medical care; Engagement between military and civilian medical community - the study identified a number of crossovers in the domains of training of medical professionals and the make-up of deployed medical staff, medical practices of information sharing and medical technologies. To address the synergies and concerns, the study suggests that EDA should seek opportunities to serve as a forum to build trust between the consumers of the technology, the developers and the manufacturers. \u00a0 More information: Medical support (EDA project page)\u00a0 EDA symposium discusses EU deploy capabilities for CSDP operations (EDA webnews, June 2016) ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/05/04/delivered-eda-study-to-help-improve-medical-support-for-small-operations"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0298", "date": "2017-05-10", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA consultation to identify impact of 3D-printing technologies in defence - deadline extended!", "text": " Additive Manufacturing (AM), widely known as 3D-printing, has been identified as one of the key enabling technologies to improve European industrial competitiveness. Although AM technologies have been developed in the civil sector, it is considered that there is significant potential for additive manufacturing technologies to enhance defence capabilities. Among them, the most likely are mobility, sustainability, effect and protection through e.g. field repair & maintenance, reduced logistic burden and improved sustainability in warfightingand peacekeeping missions. Substantial economic benefits are also expected. To identify and explore areas where additive manufacturing will have a wider \u00a0impact, the European Defence Agency (EDA) has commissioned Fundaci\u00f3n Prodintec (http://www.prodintec.es/en/) and MBDA FR (http://www.mbda-systems.com/) to conduct a project on \u201cAdditive Manufacturing Feasibility Study & Technology Demonstration\u201d, with expected delivery in December 2017. The study \u00a0targets the entire spectrum of European defence and Additive Manufacturing (AM) stakeholders, at all levels of defence and AM supply chains. The project is composed of three work strands with specific and intertwined objectives:\u00a0 A desktop study to place AM and its potential in a defence context. The main outcome of this work strand will be the identification of opportunities for AM in the European defence sector. At the same time, it will aim to highlight factors preventing European defence forces from reaping the benefits of this breakthrough technology The second work strand is a technology demonstration of AM \u00a0in a simulated deployment scenario. Its purpose is to demonstrate the feasibility and operational utility of deploying these technologies in support of a military operation Following the desktop study and the technology demonstration, the conclusions of this feasibility study, including the equipment used and typical objects and materials produced, will be presented in an exhibition. The objective is to raise the military awareness of AM \u00a0technology and to exemplify how it could improve the way operations, logistic support or maintenance of platforms are conducted. Therefore, this study has the objective of raising awareness in the defence community and of promoting a better understanding of the potential held by these technologies, thereby stimulating their implementation in defence specific areas. By doing so, not only the R&T community will be informed, but also other potential beneficiaries of the technology, linked to the EDA capabilities mentioned above. This will create a synergy between the Materials R&T community and the operational staff, helping the R&T community to understand the requirements from the operational side. The contractor for the study has recently kicked off the consultation process through different means (questionnaires, interviews, etc.) with all competent stakeholders, such as: participant Member States MoDs, European Commission, European Space Agency (ESA), European Defence Technology and Industrial Base (EDTIB), and AM related stakeholders (Industry, SMEs and academia).

MARSUR Networking was designed to enhance the \u00a0Recognized Maritime Picture and to support CSDP Operations. Following its launch in 2006, MARSUR has grown to become EDA\u2019s longest running project, with 17 EU Member States plus Norway now forming the MARSUR Community. Today\u2019s capability demonstration was attended by 30 distinguished guests from 15 EU Member States and Norway plus representatives from the EUMC, EMSA and the EU SATCEN. The forum was also addressed by EDA Deputy Chief Executive Mr. Rini GOOS and the EUNAVFOR MED operation SOPHIA Deputy Commander, Rear Admiral Luc-Marie LEFEBVRE. The key enabler for maritime operations is having the maritime information needed to operate on dangerous seas. Within this challenging domain, decision-makers need to receive the information they need in a readily usable format, allowing to them incorporate different data and information from civilian and military actors. To respond to this need an innovate capability that allows actors to exchange operational data, which in turn enhances situation awareness, was created by EDA, MARSUR. Speaking before the launch of the live demonstration, EDA Deputy Chief Executive Mr. Rini Goos addressed the forum and highlighting how MARSUR represents a vital aspect of EDA\u2019s strong commitment to supporting the naval aspects of European defence. \u201cThe link between Operation SOPHIA and MARSUR is the perfect example of constructive and targeted efforts to implement the EU Maritime Security Strategy, ensuring overarching information exchange among European actors in a cross-sectoral and comprehensive way. This interaction with multiple maritime security stakeholders and the backing it provides to EUMMS\u2019 vision, makes MARSUR and SOPHIA\u2019s endeavor an excellent implementation example of the goals and principles we have set for our Union in the maritime domain.\u201d\u00a0 For the first time, the event brought together the input provided by Member States via the respective Maritime Operations Center\u2019s (MOCs) and demonstrated how they can be used to create a comprehensive Maritime Situation Picture. At the live capability demonstration, EUNAVFOR MED Operation SOPHIA Deputy Operation Commander stressed the role and relevance of Operation SOPHIA and its dependance on maritime situational awareness. The success of Operation SOPHIA depends on a large extent on the cooperation of EU Member States which is true for the recognized maritime picture profiting from the input of the MARSUR Networking, as well. In building the demonstration, a storyboard created for this event outlining the contribution of several MARSUR Participating Member States (PMS) over several months with information gathered in the MOCs by naval assets not assigned to Operation SOPHIA providing valuable input to the Operations situational awareness. The picture quickly filled up with relevant information in a short time. 6 MOCs corresponded to specific requests by relevant core services offered by the MARSUR capability: Live Chat, Email, Voice of IP and Track Streaming were specific services provided, and helped to add, analyse and deal with suspicious or otherwise relevant tracks in Operation SOPHIA. Even PMS without a completely developed MARSUR capability were able to contribute by helping to identify different Vessels of Common Interest (VCI) or providing amplifying information about their movement.\u00a0 During today\u2019s live demonstration, a mobile component of the MARSUR capability was presented - a German Auxiliary Vessel assigned to Operation SOPHIA, the FGS RHEIN, demonstrated the use of the MARSUR capability as a maritime situational awareness tool installed on a potential Force Headquarter afloat.\u00a0 With some further support and integration into national systems MARSUR could become a most valuable tool for any future CSDP Operation, making best use of naval units already deployed in an area of responsibility not part of the Operation. Pointing to this aspect, Mr. Rini Goos commented, \u201cI am certain that this standard of European concerted effort will be taken further because, as the demonstration will show, the use of the MARSUR capability could become a blueprint for any future CSDP Operation.\u201d\u00a0 The significance of the live demonstration at OHQ EUNAVFOR MED SOPHIA has also helped to advance the trust and close cooperation among Navy MOCs in Europe, uniting a common European cause pursued through Operation SOPHIA.\u00a0 \u00a0 Background\u00a0 \u00a0 EUNAVFOR MED operation SOPHIA EUNAVFOR MED operation SOPHIA, launched in June 2015, presents its core task to contribute to wider EU efforts to disrupt the business model of human smuggling and trafficking networks in the Southern Central Mediterranean. To date, we have apprehended 109 suspected smugglers and traffickers and neutralized 426 boats, preventing them from being re-used by smugglers. Additionally, from October 2016, we are fully involved in the training of the Libyan Navy and Libyan Navy Coast Guard and in the implementation of the arms embargo off the coast of Libya according to UNSCR 2292(2016). \u00a0 European Defence Agency The European Defence Agency was established under a Joint Action of the Council of Ministers on 12 July, 2004, \"to support the Member States and the Council in their effort to improve European defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the European Security and Defence Policy as it stands now and develops in the future\u201d.

This is the 11th Helicopter exercise to be conducted under the umbrella of EDA\u2019s Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP). The European Defence Agency continues to offer an operationally realistic framework for Member States to develop, consolidate and share best practice in advanced helicopter operations. The conflict in Afghanistan brought several contributing Member States (cMS) together to jointly overcome reduced availability of combat ready crews and platforms. Several common factors were identified: a lack of effective crew training, sub-optimal technical equipment and the challenges of logistic support to remote deployed operations. The HEP successfully addressed the training need and continues to offer a unique vehicle for improved helicopter capability development. Exercise FIRE BLADE will provide an operationally demanding environment for participating Member States to train together and improve tactics and interoperability, including the coordination and integration of Joint Terminal Air Controllers (JTAC\u2019s) into live fire scenarios. \u00a0 Exercise FIRE BLADE 2017 FIRE BLADE will not only provide crews with the opportunity for live weapon engagement, it will also allow them to conduct complex air operations in a realistic and challenging environment. A total of 14 helicopters from Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary and Slovenia, as well as two fixed wing aircraft from Hungary will take part. FIRE BLADE will deliver tactical training, over the two week period, offering participants a unique opportunity to plan and execute Composite Air Operation (COMAO) missions within a joint and combined framework. Trained Helicopter Tactics Instructors trained under EDA\u2019s Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC) will mentor the multinational crews in the preparation and execution of theses challenging COMAO missions. The mentor team for FIRE BLADE will include 5 instructors from Austria, Germany, Sweden and the UK. EDA\u2019s Director for Cooperation Planning and Support, Roland van Reybroeck, highlighted some of the key benefits of the exercise: \u201cFIRE BLADE marks another major milestone in EDA\u2019s Helicopter Exercise Programme and will offer a very demanding period of training for the operational crews. Since its launch, the HEP has developed into one of the most intensive formats for joint European helicopter training. The realistic settings and complex missions are particularly challenging and the crews and aircraft will be stretched to their limits. I would especially like to thank Hungary for hosting the exercise for the first time and congratulate them on becoming the 7th Member State to do so.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 Background The overall aim of the HEP is to enhance interoperability at tactical level \u00a0between helicopter units by using the COMAO concept in a combined, joint, realistic and challenging environment and to teach and learn helicopter Techniques, Tactics and Procedures (TTPs). During FB17 the units will fly a diverse set of day and night training missions, with a focus on live firing operations. FB17 is a real-world example of what can be achieved through European defence cooperation.\u00a0 Further updates on FB17 can also be found on Twitter using #FIREBLADE2017. \u00a0 Another important milestone for the EDA\u00a0 \u00a0The HEP is one of the EDA\u2019s helicopter training programmes. The exercises focus on individual, environmental and multinational training, increasing interoperability through practical experiences, sharing operational experience and developing common tactics, techniques and procedures. HEP started in 2012 as a ten-year programme, it offers a tangible example of how collaboration in training can be a critical component of improved European helicopter capability and interoperability. \u00a0 EDA Helicopter Exercises In Numbers Between 2009 and 2017 : 229 helicopters, 1.590 aircrew members and almost 13.500 technical and logistics personnel, as well as infantry and special forces, from 19 Member States have deployed to the EDA exercises which were held in France, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Finland and Belgium. \u00a0 DVD exercise FIRE BLADE 2017 A Distinguished Visitors Day (DVD) will be held on May 11th, which senior officials of the participating Member States will attend.

During the week, more than thirty experts, representing the Materials network from various European Ministries of Defence, industry, SMEs and academia related to this technology domain, gathered to share interests and plan future R&T activities. Today, aerostructures know-how is mainly based on monolithic metallic and composite material structures. This also holds true for military applications. The potential offered by combining different materials in a hybrid design solution, by developing novel design concepts or by integrating several functionalities within one design solution etc. is not fully utilized today. Therefore, on 7 March 2017, high-level experts on materials and structures for defence platforms gathered to define a potential European level cooperative R&T project that will represent an important step toward further developing this concept. This form of international collaboration facilitates the sharing of background information on European interests and of current or foreseen issues specific to this domain. Having and applying the resulting insights could lead to forging common targets and to helping further EU collective capability in high performance low weight structures. The main outcome of the workshop was the identification of the most promising avenues for cooperation in this area, namely preparing the knowledge base required for future platforms, starting with design elements derived from existing ones \u00a0and identifying capability requirements and maintenance needs which exceed the current state of the art.\u00a0 This interesting and constructive workshop was followed by the 36th meeting of the CapTech Materials & Structures. The meeting focused on the review of the CapTech\u2019s current activities and on the discussion about future actions and upcoming opportunities for advancing the scope and coverage of its work. Special attention was given to the impact of the ongoing developments in European defence research on the future SRA. These circumstances have been acknowledged as game changers also for the Materials & Structures community. In this regard, the planning of the new Materials Strategic Research Agenda, (SRA) following the EDA Overarching Research Agenda (OSRA) methodology, was discussed in depth. In order to prepare this update, the OSRA methodology was also applied to the development of Technology Building Blocks (TBBs) by analysing the technology gaps identified in the current SRA.\u00a0 Another evolving dimension of particular relevance is the incorporation of new Materials CapTech members, resulting from the continuous efforts of EDA and the Materials CapTech National Coordinators to welcome key stakeholders, growing the CapTech network from one meeting to the next one. On EDA\u2019s side, the joint efforts with the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN) to support dual-use small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is continuously leading to concrete opportunities by identifying SMEs potentially interested in the work of the CapTech.

Speaking at the Press Day of EART 2017, EDA Director for Capability, Armament & Technology, Mr. Peter Round commented:\u00a0\u201cAAR is one of the four key projects in which EDA and its Member States has identified a capability gap. We are working hard to overcome the shortfall in Europe in the AAR domain and this exercise is very important building block in that process. Training and standardisation leads to increasing interoperability and thus to a more efficient capability and force enabler in the sky.\u201d \u00a0 Why AAR Matters\u00a0 AAR is an area with Europe faces critical capability shortfalls, highlighted by operations in Mali, Libya and Kosovo. With AAR, pilots can extend the radius of their planes and flight time, and more complex missions can be performed. Moreover, the planes do not need to return to their base to refuel between missions.\u00a0 \u00a0 Background\u00a0 The EART concept was introduced in 2014 following EDA\u2019s air-to-air refuelling (AAR) initiative, and is run by European Air Transport Command (EATC) from Eindhoven airbase. It is a dedicated AAR training for tanker and crews to become familiar with scenarios they are not regularly exposed to, maintain proficiency and enhance knowledge of multinational tanker aircraft. The exercise is supported by the Host nation (the Netherlands), MCCE and EDA.

As the EDA is involved in 6 out of the 7 areas of the Joint Declaration (Resilience, Maritime, Cyber, Defence Capabilities, Defence Industry/Research, Exercises), it is crucial that EDA-NATO capitalise on their existing good interaction.\u00a0 Speaking at the conclusion of the visit, Mr. Domecq commented; \u201cI am delighted to have welcomed NATO Deputy Secretary General Rose Gottemoeller to the EDA for extremely positive and forward looking discussions. Even before the EU-NATO Joint Declaration the Agency pursues substantive dialogue and cooperation at staff-to-staff level with NATO, from top management to expert level. However, a new culture of EU-NATO interaction was triggered due to the Joint Declaration. It has added new momentum and provides the opportunity to further enhance cooperation and to provide more visibility to the ongoing staff-to-staff talks.\u201d ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/03/27/nato-deputy-secretary-general-rose-gottemoeller-visits-eda"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0317", "date": "2017-03-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EAATTC 17-1 successfully launched", "text": " The starting pistol for the first European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course for 2017 (EAATTC 17-1), hosted by the Bulgarian Air force at Plovdiv Airbase, was fired yesterday (26 March).

This initiative represents a continuation of previous EDA Technology Watch activities and projects and has the purpose to increase access to high quality defence technology information for the Agency and its stakeholders.\u00a0 This new capability will help EDA\u00a0 provide better support to the activities of Member States as well as those foreseen under the Preparatory Action for Defence Research and the future European Defence Research Programme. \u00a0Having a systematic understanding of evolving technical trends and their effect on future European defence capabilities, both long and short term, is of great significance for EDA\u2019s work. The Technology Watch activity is providing one of the inputs for the EDA CapTechs process of technology identification. The objective of this new project is to develop customized versions of JRC\u2019s monitoring and data analysis tools adapted to the needs of defence. The modules identified in JRC\u2019s tools have been assessed as crucial for understanding the state-of-the-art technologies relevant for the defence sector and their evolution. The new system will provide both media and technology monitoring components, use diverse information sources and offers a combination of search methods. Furthermore, JRC\u2019s instruments give the possibility to identify in real-time tendencies in specific domains. This is especially important in the current context of fast-paced technological development and can represent a strategic advantage for the European defence community.\u00a0 The outputs from the monitoring systems can serve as background information to be used in the assessment and prioritization phases of defence R&T planning, essential for the development of the CapTechs Strategic Research Agendas.

The EART concept was introduced in 2014 following EDA\u2019s air-to-air refuelling initiative, and is run by European Air Transport Command (EATC) from Eindhoven airbase. The exercise is supported by the Host nation (Netherlands), MCCE and EDA. EART is organised on a yearly basis and is pooled with the Dutch Frisian Flag fighter exercise that operates from Leeuwarden Airbase. The aim of EART 2017 is to train tanker crews in air-to-air refuelling operations within a realistic and multinational framework. In combination with the Frisian Flag exercise, EART 2017 represents a unique opportunity for specific training for air crews, planners, taskers and engineers in planning and executing missions in a complex COMAO (composite air operation) environment. The exercise director for EART 2017 is Colonel Andrea Massucci (Italian Air Force). During the training exercise, crews will have the opportunity to increase their know-how in complex multinational scenarios. Furthermore crews can enhance their knowledge of multinational tanker aircraft and exchange information and procedures. EART 2017 is part of an approach that puts a premium on joint training exercises and increased standardisation to enhance overall effectiveness and interoperability of forces.\u00a0 EDA Live coverage: March 29th EDA will be live from Eindhoven airbase for special coverage of EART2017.

This work has led to three complementary work-strands, on some of which EDA is cooperating closely with other agencies and organizations like OCCAR, the Movement Coordination Center Europe (MCCE) and the European Air Transport Command (EATC). EART 2017 is part of EDA\u2019s first work strand (optimization of existing capabilities), which is achieved by supporting training exercises. In this domain, EDA has also taken the lead to streamline the different certification processes leading to a clearance. By standardizing these processes the different aviation authorities can easily identify the differences between their own process and their counterpart. By working closely together, already fielded capabilities and future capabilities, can work more cost efficiently and increase their operational output.\u00a0 \u00a0 More information:\u00a0 Air-to-Air Refueling Project page Air-to-Air Refueling Fact sheet ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/03/22/4th-european-air-to-air-refuelling-training-takes-off-in-the-netherlands"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0320", "date": "2017-03-24", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Four Project Arrangements signed in the margins of CAP Steering Board", "text": " Four new Project Arrangements (PA) were signed by participating EDA Member States in the margins of the EDA Steering Board meeting in Capability Directors formation which took place on 23 March at the Agency under the chairmanship of Lieutenant General Erhard B\u00fchler.

Other objectives are to apply harmonized\u00a0Customs procedures, to ensure a more cost-effective use and pooling of European transport assets, to allow for the best use of existing air/sea/inland infrastructure and increased civil military transport synergies, and to develop cost saving options for combining a range of logistic facilities and systems. The overarching aim of the project is to develop a European Multimodal Transport Hub Network ready to be used by CSDP missions and for other Member States\u2019 purposes (day to day business and exercises) through harmonised regulations, procedures and processes as well as pooling and sharing of movement and transport assets and infrastructure in Europe. Once set up, this European network will considerably facilitate the deployment of troops and assets for joint CSDP operations as well as the overall military movement and transport.This project involving 14 contributing Member States. \u00a0 ECMAN (European Centre for Manual Neutralisation Capabilities). The aim of this project is to provide participating Member States (Austria, as a lead nation, as well as Germany, the Czech Republic, Finland and Italy) with expertise and experience in the field of Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) threats. The project will provide opportunities to enhance education and training, improve interoperability and capabilities, assist in doctrine, TTPs and equipment development & testing and validate concepts through experimentation. Close involvement during the entire cycle of a Manual Neutralisation (MN) activity will provide participating Member States with highly skilled MN personnel. ECMAN is a follow-on activity of the EDA Category B programme Manual Neutralisation Techniques Courses and Exercises (MNT C&E).\u00a0 PRCPC (Personnel Recovery Controller and Planner Course). This project was established in 2013 as a Cat B project under the lead of Sweden. The course was initiated by six contributing Member States: Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, and Sweden. The Course was extended a first time until 2015 and then until 2017. Cyprus joined in 2017. The main focus of the Course, which will now run until 2019, is to train staff officers in supporting their commanders in Personnel Recovery related tasks. The EU will thereby benefit from the increased number of trained personnel available to support future CSDP operations and missions M3U (Multinational Modular Medical Unit). This project will standardize national medical capabilities to achieve a high level of multinational interoperability so that different medical modules can be integrated within a framework structure offered by a Frame Nation.

The 5th HTIC will begin with a four-week classroom phase including simulator exercises at Linton-on-Ouse.\u00a0 This is followed by a three week deployment to Arvidsjaur Airfield in Lapland (Sweden) where the participants will engage in live flying exercises operating Swedish Blackhawks, Austrian Huey, Kiowa & Blackhawks and German CH-53s.\u00a0 The Staff Instructors will come from Sweden, Austria and the UK with supporting air assets including: Hawks from 100 Sqn (UK), Gripens from F21 Wing in Lulea (Sweden) and Alca Jets from the Czech Air Force.\u00a0 Additionally, a DA-20 Falcon from Cobham Aviation will provide EW and C2 support, augmented with ground based Electronic Warfare (EW) assets provided by RAF Spadeadam\u2019s EW Range.\u00a0 In total, around 35 trainees and instructors will participate in the ground phase.\u00a0 However, that number will swell to \u00a0over 120, with all the supporting assets, engineers and operations personnel during the flying phase. \u00a0 Background The EDA\u2019s Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC) provides aircrew from participating nations with the skills and knowledge to teach advanced tactics to front-line aircrews from within their own national organisations and to assist in delivering the EDA\u2019s Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP), the Helicopter Tactics Course (HTC) and the future HTIC. Successful graduates from the course are awarded a qualification recognised by other Member States. \u00a0HTIC development courses run over two years: in the first year, prospective instructors refine their own knowledge of advanced helicopter tactics to the maximum degree. In the second year, the emphasis shifts\u00a0 to develop the participants\u2019 ability to teach those tactics. In turn, Instructors who have demonstrated above average abilities in delivering the course will be individually selected to become supervising instructors for future HTIC. The three main elements of HTIC include Evasion Training, Electronic Warfare and advanced Operations.\u00a0 They are initially taught as stand-alone skills before being brought together in a complex, non-permissive environment in the framework of the planning and execution of Composite Air Operations (COMAO). \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/03/21/5th-eda-helicopter-tactics-instructors-course-(htic)-to-take-off-with-home-grown-teachers"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0323", "date": "2017-03-10", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA\u2019s Annual Report 2016 released!", "text": " 2016 was a seminal moment for European defence and the European Defence Agency. A year that added a new sense of urgency and determination to European defence efforts. The Annual Report 2016 presents the main activities and achievements of the EDA across its full range of activities and projects. The report is free to access and is available for download here. The Welcome Word by EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq sets the scene on what was a defining year for the EDA.\u00a0 2016 was a seminal moment for European defence and a defining year for the European Defence Agency (EDA). The events that shaped 2016 added a new sense of urgency and determination to see Europe delivering on its potential in defence. \u00a0The time has gone when Europe\u2019s achievements were judged in terms of what it agreed on paper. Henceforth the success or failure of European ambitions in defence will be judged exclusively on the basis of \u00a0action and implementation. Defence is now, and needs to remain, firmly on the European political agenda.\u00a0 Three major initiatives contributed to a momentous shift in European defence thinking in 2016. First, Federica Mogherini, the EU\u2019s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and Head of the EDA, presented the \u00a0European Union Global Strategy (EUGS) in June, calling for the full use of the \u201cAgency\u2019s potential as an essential prerequisite for European security and defence efforts.\u201d This was followed by the Implementation Plan on Security and Defence, which set out a new level of ambition for the EU in defence. Second, the European Commission adopted the European Defence Action Plan, paving the way for a substantive European Defence Fund. Thirdly, the EU-NATO Joint Declaration added new impetus and concrete substance to the EU-NATO strategic partnership. These defining actions of 2016 have opened a window of opportunity for Europe to achieve concrete results starting in 2017. This means that the critical work on implementation has to begin now. And EDA, whose core tasks are to support capability development through European defence cooperation, increase cooperative efforts in research & technology, and strengthen the industrial and technological base of the European defence sector, will be fundamental.\u00a0 2016 put the spotlight on the added-value and expertise of the EDA. The four key capability programmes welcomed by the European Council in 2013 have made significant progress over the last 12 months. The contracts for a Definition Study of the European MALE RPAS (Medium Altitude Long Endurance Remotely Piloted Aircraft System) and for Air-to-Air Refuelling (AAR) were both signed in the summer. Cyber security poses ever-changing challenges that require a cross-sectoral approach to developing effective cyber defence capabilities. In 2016, EDA continued to facilitate efforts in education, training and exercise to enhance Europe\u2019s cyber capability. Governmental Satellite Communications (GovSatCom) activities have also progressed well with studies to identify Member States\u2019 requirements with a view to exploring a pooling solution of existing capabilities. The Agency\u2019s work in support of operations and enhanced standardisation and certification continues to yield positive results. EDA remains ambitious about what can be achieved in these programmes in 2017, in terms of increasing the number of Member States involved, addressing the full life cycle of defence capabilities, and developing effective education, training, and exercise initiatives.\u00a0 This Agency was also a driving force in 2016, breaking new ground in an area that up to a few years ago would have been deemed inconceivable: defence research funded by the EU. The EU\u2019s Pilot Project on defence research, which marks the first time that the EU budget is used for defence research, is run and managed by the EDA on behalf of the European Commission. Its implementation is well advanced and the three contracts it foresees were signed in October. As a test bed for the conditions of defence research in an EU framework, it also paves the way for the next milestone on the road towards dedicated EU defence research: the launch of the so-called \u2018Preparatory Action\u2019 on CSDP-related research.\u00a0 A pivotal moment for the EDA, but 2017 will be equally crucial in demonstrating the added-value of EU-funded research in the defence sector.\u00a0I believe that 2016 is defined by the fresh momentum behind European defence, but sustaining this momentum requires a strong partnership with industry. Europe\u2019s strategic autonomy is dependent on a globally competitive, technologically advanced and innovative industrial base, that supports the development of the military capabilities Europe needs. This year EDA has identified sources of support for the defence industry, launched a process to earmark future activities and concrete initiatives in support of defence-related SMEs, and has started to reorient is engagement with industry to better reflect the evolving defence industrial environment.\u00a0 The growing interest of the European Commission in defence issues puts a premium on ensuring that the Agency plays its role to the full as the interface between Member States and the Commission. It has already done this successfully, be it in terms of the Pilot Project and the Preparatory Action on defence research, or EU legislation that has implications for defence, such as REACH, related to hazardous chemicals which may have a direct impact on the operational effectiveness of the armed forces as well as the competiveness of the European defence industry. Equally, the establishment of the EDA Single European Sky (SES) Military Aviation Board, \u00a0a milestone that will form the basis for EDA\u2019s work on relevant military aspects of SES, underscores the pivotal role of this Agency. \u00a0 EDA is an outward looking agency that puts a premium on enhancing cooperation with other institutions and bodies to consolidate cooperation and optimise our overall impact. Its relationship with NATO, based on substantive dialogue at all levels, is ensuring mutually-reinforcing capability development. The Administrative Arrangements with both OCCAR and European Space Agency (ESA) have greatly improved synergies across programmes this year. In 2016, the EDA signed new agreements with SESAR JU, EUROCONTROL, and the European Union Satellite Centre (SATCEN).\u00a0 The next twelve months will have a transformational impact on European defence. EDA will be at the heart of it. Each year, this Agency grows its expertise and track record of delivery: 2016 was no different. The EDA has now passed the 185 mark in terms of projects facilitated and managed since its inception, representing almost \u20ac1 billion in R&T investment by the contributing Member States. In 2017 this Agency will continue to work in support of our Member States and strive to reinforce the European industrial and technological defence base. \u00a0The launch of the EDA Long Term Review at the end of 2016 aims to set out the long-term objectives, priorities and way of working for this Agency as we move into the future and carry forward the implementation of the EUGS. 2016 has elevated European defence to a new level and set out an ambitious vision for the future. This Agency will work with even greater determination and will deploy its full range of expertise so that successful implementation will be the defining characteristic of the year ahead. I hope that 2017 will witness an even greater evolution in European defence cooperation.\u00a0 Jorge Domecq, EDA Chief Executive\u00a0 \u00a0 More information: EDA Annual Report 2016\u00a0 ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/03/10/eda-s-annual-report-2016-released!"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0324", "date": "2017-03-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA Chief: \u201cDefence cooperation is not just inevitable, it also pays off\u201d", "text": " In an Opinion Editorial published this weekend simultaneously in a number of selected European newspapers and online media(*), EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq highlights the multiple benefits of deeper European cooperation in the field of defence (especially cost-savings and increased efficiency & interoperability) and called for \u201cmaking defence a matter of genuine European interest\u201d. \u00a0Here is the full text of Mr Domecq\u2019s article: \u00a0 Deeper EU defence cooperation is not just inevitable: it also pays off for governments and citizens Long treated as a marginal aspect of the European Union\u2019s wider Common and Security Policy, defence has emerged as a top priority on the European agenda. Successive EU and Member States initiatives in 2016 have catapulted defence to centre-stage. More than that: as EU leaders prepare to meet in Rome on 25 March for the 60th anniversary of the Rome Treaties in the midst of one of the most challenging and turbulent periods the Union has ever faced, defence is put forward as an area in which the European project could be reinvigorated with success. I share this ambition: the time has come to make defence a matter of genuine European interest. Let\u2019s be frank: we, Europeans, have no credible alternative but to join forces and think and act on security and defence in more European terms, beyond national lines. The growing threats in our immediate neighbourhood, the future of our transatlantic relationship and the technological revolution that is taking place on a global scale should convince even the most skeptical that, at this time, Europe will not get out of doing more and better for its own security. Politically, a stronger and more cooperative European approach to defence seems inevitable. To put it bluntly: the changing global order will sooner or later oblige European nations to pull together and to act collectively if they want to remain capable of protecting their interests and citizens. But pressure from outside should not be the only driver. In fact, there are also many practical reasons why enhanced European defence cooperation makes lot of sense. Budgetary sense, first and foremost. Today, Europe\u2019s defence market remains seriously fragmented. Budgets are planned and spent nationally by 28 Defence Ministries without any proper coordination. This is costly and often leads to duplication of effort and spending as each Member State tries to cover the whole spectrum of defence capabilities. Better planning, joint procurement and the pooling and sharing of defence capabilities can therefore improve the output of military spending and save large amounts of taxpayers\u2019 money. Estimates(**) suggest European governments could save almost a third (!) of what they spend on military equipment if they decided to coordinate investments. We are talking here about billions and billions of euros which could be saved or freed for additional long-term investment. But cost-effectiveness is not the only benefit. Interoperability and increased effectiveness are equally important outcomes of a more cooperative approach on defence spending. Compared to the US, European Armed Forces operate far too many different types of military capabilities. In 2016, for example, EU Member States had 20 different types of fighter aircraft (compared to 6 in the US), 29 types of frigates (4 in the US) or 20 types armoured fighting vehicles (2 in the US). More cooperative planning, procurement and operation of assets would streamline the capabilities in use and thereby considerably improve Member States Armed Forces\u2019 interoperability. Pooling and sharing is therefore key to making sure that European Armed Forces become more effective/interoperable and European citizens and taxpayers get better value for money. To facilitate such cooperation and initiate and manage cooperative projects between willing Member States is the bread and butter of the European Defence Agency (EDA). Since its creation in 2004, the Agency has become THE \u2018hub\u2019 for European defence cooperation with expertise and networks that are second to none. Experience clearly shows that if Member States have the political will to seriously engage in cooperation, the EDA is able to deliver. Today, at a time when the EU\u2019s institutional lines between internal and external security are becoming increasingly blurred, it is worth recalling that Member States have always, since the beginning, considered the EDA to be their main tool and vehicle for advancing defence cooperation, since it is in EDA where they, the national governments, decide what the capability priorities are and how to manage them. The support that the European Commission is willing to provide through the recently adopted European Defence Action Plan (EDAP) is most welcome in this respect. Defence cooperation is needed urgently. We cannot afford to allow this important issue to be dragged into political or institutional debates that do not strictly focus on our common goal: making European defence stronger. To achieve that, Europe needs to make the best out of the tools it has and the EDA is certainly among them. The European Union is at a crossroads. Visionary decisions and ambitious actions are needed to keep the European project alive and thriving.

The main output from the project is a geospatial information management capability called GeohuB.\u00a0 \u00a0GeohuB was first demonstrated in 2016 and has now been successfully implemented at the Operational Headquarter (OHQ) in Rome in support of the EUNAVFOR MED Operation SOPHIA. The availability of Geospatial Information (GI) is a key requirement to ensure effective planning, conduct of operations and support to decision-making. The GISMO project, initiated jointly by EDA and EU SATCEN, is addressing this requirement.\u00a0 The GeohuB tool was initially deployed in a standalone capacity in the EUNAVFOR MED Operation SOPHIA Operational Headquarters in Rome. Early in 2017 the tool was successfully installed into the Operation Sophia Classified Mission Network. \u00a0 In February 2017 a Training and Operational Field Trial (OFT) was conducted within the OHQ with the objective of assessing the maturity and the operational value of the GeohuB tool and associated GI management capability. \u00a0The availability to all staff of geographic-based information was easily accessible through web services in the Classified Mission Network.\u00a0 Such GI access enables improved shared situational awareness and to inform the decision making process within the OHQ. The intuitive and user friendly access to the GI provided by the GISMO GeohuB facilitated the access to shared information by both expert and non-expert GI users in the OHQ. CJ2 and JOC products were produced using the GeohuB during the OFT, with higher value for the CJ Staff. \u00a0\u00a0Looking to the future, based on this successful OFT and associated training, the project will now transition the GeohuB to a Fielded Initial Operating Capability with the long term objective being to provide a Full Geographic Information System Capability within EU-led Missions and Operations.

The Course Correction Fuze (CCF) project was initiated in 2012 within EDA\u2019s Smart Munition Working Group (SMWG) with the objective to develop common technical knowledge on cost-effective and affordable solutions for reducing ballistic dispersion and enhancing the accuracy of Member States\u2019 artillery rounds, by introducing a new type of fuze. Subject experts from EDA Member States (Belgium, Poland, Sweden, UK) as well as Norway (which has signed an Administrative Arrangement with the EDA) looked into the subject and came up with a Common European Requirements document for CCF which was agreed and distributed to participating Member States\u2019 capability and armaments authorities in late 2016. Moreover, it was also recognized that there is a need to have a harmonized approach to the challenge of integrating and Test & Evaluating CCF into existing and future artillery systems in order to generate costs savings. In this way a dedicated investigation on CCF integration with Artillery Systems in EU was developed during 2016 and successfully delivered in early 2017. This investigation was divided in three different phases: Phase 1 was mainly devoted to the collection of information on available CCF solutions, artillery systems and ammunition in the EU. Five of the identified CCF solutions were selected, some of which use airbrakes to reduce the down range dispersion while others use fixed or movable canards that reduce both down range and cross range dispersion; Phase 2 consisted of an analysis of those five CCF solutions and their integration into both the artillery systems and the ammunition used by the participating Member States. As there exist many different artillery systems in Europe, in order to be able to integrate the selected CCFs into all those systems, the artillery systems were divided into three categories: CAT I \u2013 Manual; CAT II \u2013 Semi-Auto loading & Gun laying; and CAT III \u2013 Auto Loading and Gun laying; Phase 3 of the project focused on developing conclusions and recommendations in view of identifying future opportunities for cooperation among participating Member States. \u00a0 Many opportunities for cooperation One of the main conclusions is that there are many opportunities for cooperation and pooling & sharing despite the fragmented picture of artillery systems used by European Armed Forces. Several countries use the same type of artillery system and, therefore, can easily share and follow the same CCF integration steps. But opportunities for collaboration even exist for countries using different systems for which at least some synergies can be found in terms of similar subsystem characteristics such as calibre, fire-control software or ammunition types. In a broader perspective, the joint development of ballistic calculation software and fuze setter standards and the definition of interfaces and data protocols for CCFs were also recommended to achieve an efficient integration in artillery systems. Specific work strands were identified and an action plan has been proposed. It also became clear that the (currently ongoing) review of the Capability Development Plan (CDP) should take into account future CCF integration into artillery systems.

The HEP is one of the European Defence Agency\u2019s (EDA) helicopter training projects and programmes. It is the first time that Hungary will host a HEP event, thus becoming the 7th member state to do so.\u00a0 In excess of 450 personnel are due to take part in this exercise programme. A total of 17 air assets from 5 Member States (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Slovenia) are expected to take part. In addition, observers from Italy and Czech Republic are foreseen. FB17 will deliver tactical training, over a 12 day intensive programme, offering participants an unique opportunity to plan and execute missions within a joint combined framework. FB17 will be designed to allow European helicopter crews to train, adopting joint procedures while operating in a challenging scenario. Today at the EDA in Brussels the Final Coordination Conference for FB17 took place. Following on from the Main Planning Conference which was held last October in Hungary, today\u2019s conference put the final preparations in place ahead of the beginning of FB17 on May 1st. Tom Bennington, Head of Education, Training & Exercise Unit at EDA commented, \u201cthe exercise gives a good opportunity to train in a realistic operational setting. Specifically we will be working with Special Forces, and will be focusing on live weapons firing using the Composite Air Operations Concept, effectively operating the helicopters with fast jets and ground assets [e.g. surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems]\u201d. At the event, on behalf of the host nation Hungary, Lieutenant colonel P\u00e9ter Simon of the Hungarian Air Force and Commander of the Air Task Force for exercise FB17 said, \u201cas per previous Blade exercises, FB17 will have its own training subjects, in this case live firing. Hungary is an excellent location for live fire exercises due to diversity and quality of ranges available to visiting European crews\u201d. \u00a0 \u00a0 The aim of the exercise is to enhance interoperability at a tactical level between helicopter units by using the COMAO concept in a combined, joint, realistic and challenging environment and to teach and learn helicopter Techniques, Tactics and Procedures (TTPs). During FB17 the units will fly a diverse set of day and night training missions, with a focus on live firing operations.

With more than 11,000 military aircraft stationed in Europe, state air forces represent the biggest fleet operators and airport owners in Europe. Ahead of EDA\u2019s participation at WAC 2017 (SESAR stand 889), EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq writes that the military represents a key and credible partner in SES/SESAR. In the context of increased regional and global instability and given the evolving security challenges facing Europe, it is crucial for security and defence that any development in air traffic modernisation takes military requirements fully into account, in order to avoid any adverse impact on national and collective defence capabilities. The implementation of the European Global Strategy (EUGS), the European Defence Action Plan (EDAP) and the EU/NATO Joint Declaration, offer a window of opportunity to address and contribute to strengthening European Security and Defence. Military aviation is a key part of this. The EDA facilitates the coordination of military views related to the challenges of SES facing Military Aviation and acts as an interface between the military community and the European Commission. In doing so, EDA ensures coherence and complementarity across the military community through staff-to-staff coordination with NATO and EUROCONTROL, while actively developing its cooperation with key civil stakeholders.\u00a0 The Aviation Strategy for Europe defined by the European Commission and the revision of the EASA Basic Regulation provide opportunities for early involvement of the military. Military aviation significantly contributes to ensuring the required secure environment in Europe. It is crucial for security and defence that any development in air traffic modernization takes military requirements fully into account, in order to avoid any adverse impact on national and collective defence capabilities. The changes brought about by technological solutions in terms of procedures, regulations, equipment and organisation need to be considered at the earliest possible stage and on the basis of a systemic approach, by relevant military organisations. The Military Aviation Strategy in the context of Single European Sky reflects the shared view on military aviation as an integral part of the air traffic in Europe for the coming decades. It establishes the strategic vision that European aviation will incorporate the security and defence dimension at a level that will ensure that Military Aviation continues to provide and further improve, effective security and defence in Europe in the changing context of the civil aviation sector, without prejudice to the safety of civil air traffic. It includes fundamental principles related to safety, civil-military coordination and cooperation across the military community, as well as strategic objectives on security and defence, access to airspace and use of air navigation services, confidentiality, cyber security, and interoperability. In supporting its implementation, the European Defence Agency contributes to ensuring that the military are recognised as credible and reliable partners for excellence in global aviation.

It successfully tested and identified solutions with high potential, which also triggered numerous scientific publications.\u00a0 Increasing military requirements combined with environmental regulations, such as REACH, lead to critical situations in the sense that they put at risk the operational availability and running costs of Navy ships in terms of corrosion and surface protection. In addition, there is a requirement to extend repair intervals to 6-10 years in order to reduce maintenance levels and related costs, to maintain \u00a0ship security and to comply with environmental regulations. The consequences of these requirements and regulations are various and have types a serious impact on potential risks, unsuitability and/or suppression of existing technical solutions. In this context, the aim of the project was to consider new approaches and solutions for defining in particular the adapted conditions based maintenance. In order to achieve this, the vast Corrosion Control of Navy Ships (CCNS) study was undertaken between 2013 and 2016 to establish the critical areas within Corrosion Control Technology. Through its extensive tests, the project produced very positive results in the field of sensors and fouling treatment. One sensor, which is now commercialised, offers a promising solution for on-board applications. Interesting results for new faster accelerated aging tests have also been obtained, showing the relevance to real in-service degradation of coatings and corrosion. The study revelead that the process of data collection is especially challenging in terms of measuring on-board currents. A database including relevant and usable data for modeling of cathodic protection was created. Collection and integration of such data into an improved numerical model will help optimise the systems used by navies of all participating countries.

The main aim was to prove that it is feasible to coordinate and operate unmanned ground systems together with regular manned vehicles in future mounted combat missions. It also helped the military community to become familiar with heavy unmanned ground vehicles. The Hy-MUP project was funded by the two contributing Member States - France and Germany - and carried out by a consortium consisting of ECA Robotics and Thales for France as well as Diehl BGT Defence and Rheinmetall Landsysteme for Germany. The Hy-MUP project was in fact a continuation of a previous project on \u2018Semi-Autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicle (SAM-UGV)\u2019 conducted by the same consortium. Both projects were hosted in the EDA CapTech Ground Systems (Land). The project\u2019s objectives were to: (i) prove the feasibility of the operation of unmanned ground systems in coordination with regular manned vehicles in future mounted combat missions by analysing and defining use-cases for platooning, (ii) identify the high safety requirements and (iii) develop a demonstrator of a hybrid fleet (manned and unmanned vehicles) to be deployed in convoy reconnaissance and/or surveillance (platooning) missions with a mobile Control and Command Vehicle (CCV) manned driven and an mobile robotized vehicle which can either be tele-operated by an operator from the Control Station installed in the CCV or configured to follow a Leader Vehicle autonomously. In addition to that, from the military perspective, another project goal was to help the military community to become familiar with heavy unmanned ground vehicles by progressively introducing heavy robotics in the Armed Forces. \u00a0 Different \u2018Leader Following\u2019 functionalities For the practical part of the project, various case scenarios for using mixed platoons of manned and unmanned vehicles were defined and demonstrated. The Control Station and the communication unit were installed in a Control and Command Vehicle lent by the French MoD. A 4x4 wheels drive civilian vehicle (ISUZU D-MAX) was then equipped with a Drive by Wire capability (including a Drive By Wire (DBW) kit from Paravan and a Robotic kit updated from the SAM-UGV project), several sensors enabling autonomous motion by using \u2018Leader Following\u2019 facilities. An additional communication unit enables tele-operation via control station. Two different \u2018Leader Following\u2019 functionalities were implemented and evaluated during trials with various Leader Vehicles, various weather conditions and various environments: The first Leader Following functionality runs two algorithms in parallel: (i) one uses the centre vision camera and (ii) the other uses the information coming from a Velodyne - 3D LiDAR sensor. In case one of the algorithms loses the leader, the other can reinitialize the connection of the first one. The second Leader Following functionality combines the data coming from an algorithm using vision camera mounted on Hy-MUP robotized platform and a sign panel installed at the rear of the Leader Vehicle, on one hand, and an algorithm using information from a Velodyne - 3D LiDAR sensor, on the other hand. An \u2018Obstacle Avoidance\u2019 function which, in real operations, is required to avoid intruders or collisions (with pedestrian or vehicles) was also tested but could not be fully evaluated during the trials due to project constraints. The Hy-MUP project developed the so-called \u2018Hy-MUP system\u2019: it consists of an integrated demonstrator with a Control Station (installed in a manned vehicle of the convoy) and a robotized platform. Teleoperation and autonomous Vehicle Following are available from a moving Control Station. Obstacle Avoidance will have to be further integrated and evaluated. Even though the Hy-MUP system is not yet fully completed and validated, it nevertheless already demonstrated the benefits and importance of manned/unmanned vehicle convoy capabilities in military operations.

This initiative represents a first try to identify ways and means by which innovation activities could be more systematically managed in order to create additional value for the Agency and its stakeholders. Fostering innovation is key in strengthening Europe\u2019s defence capabilities as it has been clearly stated in the new EU Global Strategy (EUGS) and its implementation plan as well as in the European Commission\u2019s European Defence Action Plan which emphasises the multidimensional role of innovation in defence. In this context, innovation can be perceived as the creation and application of new products, services and processes. This includes the creation of a new technology, product, process or service, as well as the application of existing technology to a different problem or domain. By introducing innovative technologies developed in other domains, both the initial investment risk and the time from ideation to military capability are minimized. Nevertheless, innovation is not only focused on the creation of new concepts. It also focuses on the value that the new concept will create for end-users. In this regard, innovation in the defence sector should aim at enhancing military capability. The new project takes the form of two studies to be carried out by RAND Europe and Indra Systemas S.A respectively and dealing with different aspects of innovation. The project\u2019s objectives are the following: Analysis of the current defence research innovation strategies and identification of best practice in terms of organisational structures, supporting policies and incentives for research innovation management Analysis of stakeholders, environment, specific defence requirements related to innovation and identification of appropriate organizational structures applicable to defence Identification of candidate technologies for innovation injection and preparation of scenarios for a follow on proof of concept Identification of innovation management methods and state-of-the-art practices, such as design thinking and transfer of knowledge to be used within the EDA\u2019s research and innovation communities. The kick-off meetings of both studies, which took place on 16th and 20th of January respectively, set the ground for a very promising project. The working teams have already discussed in depth the transformation of the objectives into tangible outcomes for the Member States in support to the European efforts of fostering innovation in defence.

Further to assessing the impact of REACH (and associated CLP) regulation on defence, the study aimed to develop recommendations for further improvement of REACH regulation and its current implementation regime. The basis for the study, which was finalised in December 2016, aimed for a win-win solution achieving two principle goals: a high level of health and environmental protection, as well as ensuring the operational effectiveness of Member States\u2019 Armed Forces and enhancing the competitiveness and innovation of the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base.

Philippe Brunet, the Commission\u2019s Director for Space Policy and Defence within DG GROW, who also participated in the SEDE debate, indicated that the delegation agreement should be signed quickly, if possible in March 2017. Mr Roger recalled the importance of the Pilot Project (PP) on defence research which is currently being implemented through a delegation agreement signed in November 2015 between the Commission and the EDA, has proved a great opportunity to test the interface between the Commission and the EDA in the implementation of a centrally-funded defence research scheme at EU level. Several \u2018lessons learned\u2019 from the PP are being applied in the preparation for the PA, for instance the need to have some more innovative and adapted to defence specificities Intellectual Property Rules (IPR) or to have a wider pool of evaluation experts available. \u201cFor the Preparatory Action, the basic rule should be to draw the lessons already learnt from the Pilot Project, to keep the way of working when it demonstrated to be satisfactory and to improve what needs to be improved, while adapting to the increased scale\u201d, Mr Roger said. In particular, he referred to the key \u2018upstream role\u2019 the EDA has in consulting all stakeholders (government, industry and RTOs) about key research priorities and consolidating them with Member States. He also mentioned the execution and exploitation (\u2018downstream\u2019) roles the Agency played in the PP and which it would also have to play in the PA implementation. \u00a0 Focusing on priority military needs Mr Roger stressed the need to make sure that collaborative defence research undertaken under the Preparatory Action will be linked to priority military capability needs of Member States: \u201cI must insist on this point, which is a key specificity of Defence Research. Since the market is a monopsony, the only buyer being the Ministries of Defence, it is absolutely essential to make sure that the technical requirements of the projects match the future Capability needs defined by Member States and reflected in the Capability Development Plan endorsed at the level of the Ministers of Defence\u201d. \u201cIn accordance with article 45 of the Treaty on the European Union, EDA has a key role to play in guaranteeing this consistency between Capability and Research priorities\u201d, he stated. \u00a0 EDA prepares for PA implementation role Implementing the PA means that the EDA will also have to adapt its own structures because compared to managing a relatively small Pilot Project (three projects with a total budget of \u20ac1.4 million), the task of managing a substantially bigger Preparatory Action (\u20ac90 million budget over three years with probably more than a dozen projects in total) will be much more of a challenge. That\u2019s why the EDA has already set up a dedicated PA Unit in order to manage EDA\u2019s \u2018upstream role\u2019 and its forthcoming implementation role. It already includes four people and additional growth is anticipated once the delegation agreement is signed. The first short term task of that new unit will be the practical implementation of the Preparatory Action Work Programme: launch of the calls, organisation of the evaluation and signing of the grant agreements. \u201cBut we also need to have a longer term vision: a key success indicator of the preparatory Action will be the usefulness of the results for Member States\u2019 future Capability Development Programmes\u201d, Mr Roger said. EDA\u2019s existing structures (CapTechs, Project Teams, Working Groups) will contribute to make sure that the PA results are fully taken into account and to promote follow-on projects and programmes. The PA unit could also have a key role, in permanent coordination with the European Commission, to draw, in real time, the lessons learnt from the Preparatory Action that can benefit to the setting up of a potential wider future European Defence Research Programme (EDRP) after 2020. \u00a0 More information: Full speech of Roger Denis at SEDE committee (25 January 2017) Preparatory Action on defence research (EDA factsheet) First EU Pilot Project in the field of defence research sees grant agreements signed for \u20ac1.4 million ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/01/26/preparatory-action-on-defence-research-eda-ready-to-sign-delegation-agreement"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0345", "date": "2017-01-24", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "High industry attendance at Vienna seminar on EU funding for defence R&T projects", "text": " Rini Goos, EDA\u2019s Deputy Chief Executive, today addressed Austrian security and defence stakeholders at a seminar in Vienna on EU funding opportunities for defence research (R&T) projects.

While the focus and the aim of military operations such as the NATO-led Ocean Shield and the EU NAVFORMED Operation SOPHIA may differ, one element is vital to all naval operations: Maritime Situational Awareness. Naval Forces the world over are striving to establish what is called a recognized maritime picture. In basic terms that means finding out exactly what is happening in any given operational area at sea, including whether ships (\u2018contacts\u2019 in naval terms) are transiting the area or working within it. Maritime Situational Awareness also includes knowledge about events taking place in and around a maritime area. Current operations in the Mediterranean have underlined the need to include both military and civilian information to get a full picture. There are many different military and civilians systems around \u2013 all of which need to be compiled, verified and analysed \u2013 so a significant challenge lies in bringing the relevant information together. To this end, the European Defence Agency (EDA) helped to design an interface acting as a system of systems to support CSDP operations such as the EU NAVFORMED Operation SOPHIA. It does this by enabling maritime headquarters to exchange data and information with other networks through various services such as chat, email, tactical drawing, video recordings and track streaming. The SOPHIA Operational Headquarters was connected to the MARSUR Networking Community which encompasses 17 EU Member States plus Norway. To enhance the input of information, EDA has sponsored and designed a complex workshop which trains operators and technicians in the daily use of the MARSUR capability. This training took place from 15-20 Jan 2017 in Rome, Italy. As a lead nation of Operation SOPHIA and a host nation for the training, Italy offered ideal training conditions. 36 participants from 12 Member States and Norway spent a week at the Italian Tor di Quinto Naval Club. The participants were joined by MARSUR contractors\u2019 representatives, trainers and representatives from the MARSUR community and representatives from the Italian Navy and Operational Headquarters. The week provided a unique opportunity to exchange experience, skills and knowledge about the MARSUR capability and the requirements of Operation SOPHIA. Most of all, meeting counterparts from other Member States helped to personalise the otherwise faceless messages on the screen. The resulting network serves to build up the most important asset of information exchange and cooperation: trust. To provide even more support to Operation SOPHIA, representatives from EDA met with staff from the SOPHIA Operational Headquarters, the Italian Navy and the MARSUR community to ensure that information is sent not only from those ships engaged in Operation SOPHIA, but also all Member States\u2019 ships transiting the Mediterranean. This type of cooperation is a good example of the implementation of the EU Maritime Security Strategy which envisions cross-sectoral information exchange among European actors. \u00a0 More information: Maritime Surveillance (EDA project page) European Defence Agency supports CSDP operations European maritime surveillance network reaches operational status \u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2017/01/23/eda-workshop-on-marsur-capabilities-held-in-rome"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0348", "date": "2017-01-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ONLINE from now on: the new EDA magazine is out!", "text": " The latest European Defence Matters magazine is now available with a special focus on the European Defence Action Plan (EDAP) presented by the European Commission in November 2016.

During a kick-off meeting held at the EDA premises, the first steps of this ambitious project were discussed with experts from the \u2018Circular Economy Research Initiative\u2019 of the Cambridge Judge Business School (CJBS) which is the contractor for this project. The project will result in a study scheduled to be finalized by end of October 2017. The CJBS researchers will be working closely with the EDA project team in order to perform the initial assessment of possible constraints and opportunities that could derive from applying the Circular Economy concept and principles to the defence sector. Both teams will then establish a roadmap for follow-on actions and propose suitable alternatives in areas where problems may arise. Circular Economy is a new policy domain that was launched by the European Commission in late 2015 with a communication entitled \u201cClosing the loop: Commission adopts ambitious new Circular Economy Package to boost competitiveness, create jobs and generate sustainable growth\u201d. Then, on 30 November 2016, the European Commission adopted the European Defence Action plan which paved the road for the Circular Economy principles to be applied to the defence sector. As Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen wrote in EDA\u2019s European Defence Matters magazine recently, \u201cthe transposition of the circular economy principles in the defence sector can benefit the European industry and economy in many ways.\u201d Indeed, the Circular Economy\u2019s underlying principles are not unfamiliar to the defence sector which has managed to follow a similar path over the years, for instance by applying a through-life management approach. Therefore, it was deemed important that a proactive step be taken in view of assessing the possible alignment or gaps between the flagship initiative of the European Commission and the defence framework. In this respect, the EDA thinks that an assessment of the feasibility of a transposition of the Circular Economy concept into the defence sector could be beneficial. In particular, introducing the Circular Economy principles at an early stage of the research and technology (R&T) phase could produce more systematic and structural benefits. A positive outcome from project study could be highly beneficial for the Member States. The benefits for the defence industry (of which a large part are small and medium enterprises) will be also be explored. The EDA expects that this initial assessment will shed some light on the potential benefits and challenges of applying the Circular Economy package to the defence sector. Moreover, it should allow to identify topics, opportunities and areas that require further assessment and analysis. These topics will be dealt with in the follow-on actions that EDA will take for establishing the work strand in the area of Circular Economy in defence and enable a smooth and beneficial transition. The project team of the Circular Economy Research Initiative of the University of Cambridge Judge Business school consists of Dr Khaled Soufani, Dr Mark Esposito and Dr Tse Terence. The EDA project team is composed by Dr Panagiotis Kikiras, Mr Giorgos Dimitriou and Ms Patricia L\u00f3pez Vicente.

The main objective of the IEDDET programme is to develop, improve and field-test IED detection capabilities in order to better protect troops and increase Armed Forces\u2019 operational freedom of movement. Concretely, the programme encompasses three main projects, each of them dealing with a specific topic, namely: Vehicle Mounted Early Warning of Indirect Indicators of IEDs (VMEWI3). The objectives of this project is to focus on the detection of indirect indicators with forward looking camera systems. The technology demonstrator will be based on remotely operated unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) platforms with multi-camera head. The UGV platform will be controlled from a manned vehicle. The aim is to detect indicators of IED presence even while moving with a speed of at least 20-30 km/h (early warning capacity). UGV stand-off multi-sensor platform for IED component detection (MUSICODE). This project will develop new unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) stand-off capabilities for detection of IED components by using remotely operated multisensory platforms. Confirmation, Identification and Airborne Early Warning of IEDs (CONFIDENT). The objectives of this project are two-fold: (i) to focus on the confirmation and the identification of relevant components of IEDs including electronic parts, explosives and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) payloads prior to the release of the agents and (ii) to provide complementary early warning capability. The demonstrators will be based on remotely operated platforms (robot and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, UAV). The UAV will be used for airborne early warning. In order to ensure the coherence and interoperability between the projects, an offline detection map will be produced and shared to best explore the full set of information available for future route clearance operations and the programme will be concluded by a joint demonstration. IEDDET will involve technology companies (including SMEs), academic institutions as well as governmental and non-governmental research organisations which will all cooperate under the guidance of a management committee consisting of experts from the contributing Member States. Countering Improvised Explosive Devices (C-IED) was confirmed as a top priority in the EDA Capability Development Plan (CDP) revision of 2014.

It was the first time a European Commissioner participated in an EDA Steering Board meeting at directors level which, in itself, reflects the increased importance defence related policies have gained in recent weeks and months, and with it the work done within the Agency. Vice-President Katainen presented R&T Directors of Member States\u2019 MoDs with the main elements of the European Defence Action Plan (EDAP) adopted by the Commission on 30 November, especially the proposed setting up of a European Defence Fund and its \u2018research window\u2019 to fund collaborative defence research projects at the EU level. This \u2018window\u2019 will be mainly implemented through the Preparatory Action on defence research and should lead to a dedicated European Defence Research Programme (EDRP) in the post-2020 EU multiannual financial framework. R&T directors reviewed and discussed the EDA involvement in the Preparatory Action as well as the Agency\u2019s role within a potentially upcoming EDRP. They were also updated on how the EDA intends to engage industry in the Capability Development Plan (CDP) process. EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq thanked Vice-President Katainen for his presence and welcomed his EDAP presentation. \u201cAny initiative or measure that can help strengthening European defence cooperation and the underlying European Defence and Technological Industrial Base is more than welcome. The Commission has some powerful instruments at its disposal as set out in its Action Plan and I sincerely believe that we should make best use of, interact with and complement those\u201d, he said. Mr Domecq added: \u201cThere is a need to carefully articulate and find the right balance between the intergovernmental and the community approach.

The project\u2019s objective is to assess the areas where AM can have a positive impact on defence capabilities and to demonstrate its feasibility. The rise of Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies has created a variety of possibilities and potential benefits for the defence community. The \u201cAdditive Manufacturing Feasibility Study & Technology Demonstration\u201d was initiated in the framework of the CapTech Materials & Structures, within the EDA Research & Technology (R&T) domain. Raising awareness and promoting a better understanding of AM\u2019s application and potential in different military contexts will contribute to its timely and effective implementation in defence specific areas. The first activity carried out under this initiative will be a desktop study to place AM and its potential in a defence context. This work will summarise the state of the art ability of relevant AM technologies, identify existing R&T and manufacturing capabilities in Europe, and determine areas where further R&T activities should be carried out. The second work strand is a technology demonstration of AM. To this end, a 3D printer will be deployed as part of the EDA Sponsored Airlift Exercise, to be held in Zaragoza (Spain). This represents a significant step in bridging the data gap on 3D printer performance in deployed conditions and will demonstrate the operational utility of these technologies. At the end of the project, the results will be presented at an exhibition to high-ranking military staff, along with equipment and demonstrators, in order to raise awareness on the possible impact of AM in defence. The project represents a clear example of how cross-fertilization of ideas from different domains, from R&T to operations, will enhance defence capabilities, especially when supporting deployed missions. The EDA contractors, the research centre Fundaci\u00f3n Prodintec, and the defence industry MBDA France, will work together to support the activities described, and help to create the synergies that will strengthen the links between research activities, industrial development, and the Armed Forces. The project aims to demonstrate how R&T can contribute to strengthening European cooperation, defence capabilities and European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB).

In his opening remarks, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq recalled that the 2014 EU Cyber Defence Policy Framework, adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council in November 2014, explicitly encouraged the four agencies to enhance their cooperation in a number of areas, for instance to develop common cyber security and defence competence profiles based on international best practices and certification used by EU Institutions, to work on public sector cyber security and defence organisational and technical standards for use in the defence and security sector and to develop a working mechanism to exchange best practice on exercises, training and other areas of possible civilian-military synergy. \u201cIn the spirit of the EU Global Strategy and its implementation plan on security and defence, EU entities need to think cross-sectoral. We need to joint forces where appropriate in order to anticipate the security challenges and adapt to Member States\u2019 expectations. And nowhere does this better apply than in the Cyber domain\u201d, Mr Domecq stated. \u00a0 Task force The aim of the meeting was not yet to agree on a list of concrete projects to work on but to brainstorm and discuss possible options for future cooperation. A joint task force was set up to further discuss first initial ideas exchanged at today\u2019s meeting; it will report back by spring 2017 with an in-depth assessment and concrete recommendations for cooperation projects.

In compliance with the initial agreement, the cooperative work has been updated by the two organisations for the years 2017-2018 in order to accommodate the tasks as defined in the SESAR 2020 programme. The work programme makes EUROCONTROL\u2019s expertise in civil-military ATM coordination available to EDA to facilitate EDA\u2019s role regarding the coordination of military views in the context of the Single European Sky (SES) and its interface towards the EU institutions. During the implementation of the previous joint work programme, the EDA-EUROCONTROL cooperation successfully contributed to the provision of harmonised military inputs to the 2015 ATM Master Plan update campaign, supported Member States bidding for EU co-financing in INEA calls and provided technical impact analysis on the SESAR deployment programme and EASA regulatory material under development. \u201cThe needs of military aviation often go beyond the scope of civil aviation,\u201d said Frank Brenner, Director General of EUROCONTROL. \u201cTo work effectively, European airspace management must address both military and civil airspace user needs with coordinated processes and consultation between civilian and military stakeholders. EUROCONTROL and EDA are working together to contribute to this process\u201d. \u201cTo preserve military access to all airspace, it remains essential that we develop harmonised low-cost interoperable SESAR solutions, including standardisation and certification processes, and that we provide common mitigation actions\u201d, said Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency. \u201cMoreover the deployment phase of SESAR offers an opportunity for the military, to avail itself of funding to enhance their ATM technology, when appropriate. This has already been the case for INEA Call 2015, whereby 14 military projects submitted through EDA have been awarded funds adding up to a total of \u20ac53.5 million, which is roughly 10.5% of total funds awarded.\u201d EUROCONTROL and EDA have been working closely together since 2008 to ensure improved coordination and cooperation between civil and military air traffic, moving towards a Single European Sky for both military and civil air transport. \u00a0 For further information, please contact: Kyla Evans Head of Corporate Communications EUROCONTROL Tel: +32 2 729 51 51 press@eurocontrol.int www.eurocontrol.int Eric Platteau Head of Media & Communications European Defence Agency Tel: +32 2 504 28 23 eric.platteau@eda.europa.eu www.eda.europa.eu ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/11/17/eurocontrol-and-the-european-defence-agency-consolidate-their-cooperation"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0362", "date": "2016-11-18", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA supports Operation Sophia with Cyber Awareness Seminars", "text": " Last week (8-11 November), and for the second time since December 2015, the European Defence Agency (EDA) provided cyber awareness training to more than 100 staff from EUNAVFOR MED operation SOPHIA at the mission\u2019s Operations Headquarters (OHQ) in Rome, Italy. The seminars covered important aspects such as mission-specific cyber threats, the legal framework applicable to cyberspace, common vocabulary and best practices when using communications and information systems. They also served to inform participants about the development and establishment of EU cyber defence capabilities for CSDP military operations and missions. The seminars also allowed the command team of OHQ Rome and the EDA to exchange views on the next steps to be taken to enhance the cyber defence capabilities for EUNAVFOR MED Operation Sophia and other EU-led military operations. The seminars were conducted with the support of the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE) in Tallinn and from SYMANTEC Corporation. The EDA started organizing Cyber Awareness Seminars in 2014 in support of EUFOR RCA as a valuable contribution to raising cyber awareness for all the personnel of activated Headquarters (HQ) for EU-led military operations. \u00a0 Background The EU Cyber Defence Policy Framework, as adopted by the Council on 18 November 2014, states that \u201cCyberspace is often described as the fifth domain of military activity, equally critical to European Union (EU) Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) implementation as the domains of land, sea, air, and space. The successful implementation of CSDP has been increasingly dependent on the availability of, and access to, a secure cyberspace. Robust and resilient cyber defence capabilities are now required to support CSDP structures and CSDP missions and operations\u201d. The Policy Framework puts strong emphasis on cyber education and training. \u00a0 EUNAVFOR MED Operation Sophia EUNAVFOR MED operation Sophia is only one element of a broader EU comprehensive response to the migration issue, which seeks to address not only its physical component, but also its root causes such as conflict, poverty, climate change and persecution. The mission core mandate is to undertake systematic efforts to identify, capture and dispose of vessels and enabling assets used or suspected of being used by migrant smugglers or traffickers, in order to contribute to wider EU efforts to disrupt the business model of human smuggling and trafficking networks in the Southern Central Mediterranean and prevent the further loss of life at sea. Since 7 October 2015, the operation has moved to phase 2 International Waters, which entails boarding, search, seizure and diversion, on the high seas, of vessels suspected of being used for human smuggling or trafficking. Last June , Operation Sophia\u2019s mandate was extended until 27 July 2017 and also reinforced by adding two supporting tasks: training of the Libyan coastguards and navy; contributing to the implementation of the UN arms embargo on the high seas off the coast of Libya. On 30 August and 6 September 2016, the Political and Security Committee (PSC) authorized the launch of the capacity building and training task, and the start of the mission\u2019s role contributing to the implementation of the UN arms embargo respectively. \u00a0 More information: Support to operations (EDA factsheet) EDA provides cyber defence support to operation EUFOR RCA (webnews September 2014) EEAS website on EUNAVFOR MED\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/11/18/eda-supports-operation-sophia-with-cyber-awareness-seminars"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0363", "date": "2016-11-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Members of European Parliament Subcommittee on Security and Defence (SEDE) visit the EDA", "text": " A delegation from the SEDE Subcommittee of the European Parliament, led by Subcommittee Chair Anna El\u017cbieta Fotyga MEP, held discussions with EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq on defence-related research and the EDA\u2019s role in the implementation of the EU Global Strategy.

Over 400 personnel will take part in this exercise, with a total of 14 air assets from 4 Member States being deployed. This edition marks the 10th helicopter exercise under the umbrella of the EDA Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP). The European Defence Agency is working to provide Member States with a framework to develop, consolidate and share best practices in order to meet the challenges of flying helicopters in a modern operational environment. In consultation with Member States (MS), several factors were identified which were thought to contribute to the non-employability of helicopters; a lack of training for the crews, a lack of technical equipment for the aircraft, and the challenges of logistic support to deployed operations. The EDA is helping participating MS address these issues with the training element being the main focus. Exercises such as BLACK BLADE are fundamental to the EU capability development process. \u00a0 Exercise BLACK BLADE BLACK BLADE marks the 10th helicopter exercise under the umbrella of the Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP). BLACK BLADE is a Special Operations Forces oriented helicopter exercise, focusing on enhancing interoperability at a tactical level in a realistic and challenging environment. Over 400 personnel will take part in this exercise programme. A total of 14 air assets from 4 Member States (13 helicopters from Belgium, Slovenia and Austria and one Falcon aircraft from the UK) will be used. BLACK BLADE will deliver tactical training, over a three week period, offering participants a unique opportunity to plan and execute missions within a joint combined framework. The seamless coordination and integration of the Belgium Special Operations Ground Forces into individual scenarios for the benefit of training will be one of the specific focuses of the exercise. Commenting at the start of exercise BLACK BLADE, EDA Chief Executive, Jorge Domecq pointed to the significance of this edition:\u00a0 \u201cThe 10th edition of the Helicopter Training Exercise Programme, comes at a moment when European defence is high on the political agenda. The 10th edition is a milestone for this programme, the EDA and the Member States involved. Exercise BLACK BLADE is European defence cooperation in action. It represents a dynamic and tangible example of what cooperation among the Member States can achieve. It also highlights the importance of joint training as a prerequisite to enhance interoperability and a key enabler to ensure readiness to deploy. A positive step forward for European defence\u201d. The ultimate goal for BLACK BLADE is to develop and improve immediate output through pooling and sharing, enhance training skills among European countries for flying in different environments, and to train for future European crisis management operations.BLACK BLADE is a real-world example of what can be achieved through European defence cooperation and highlights that at very low cost, immediate operational output can be realised. \u00a0 New milestone for the EDA The HEP is one of the EDA\u2019s helicopter training projects and programmes. By enhancing the operating skills of helicopter crews across Europe, the HEP plays a part in increasing the deployable helicopter capability for contingency operations. The exercises focus on individual, environmental and multinational training, increasing interoperability through practical experiences, sharing operational experience and developing common tactics, techniques and procedures. HEP is a ten-year programme, a concrete indication that training together is an integral part of enhancing European capability and interoperability. \u00a0 EDA Helicopter Training In Numbers Between 2009 and 2016 : 206 helicopters, 1320 aircrew members and almost 13000 infantry from 19 Member States have deployed to the exercises which were held in France, Spain, Italy, Portugal and Belgium. \u00a0 Future Events A Distinguished Visitors Day (DVD) will be held on November 30th , which the Head of the EDA, High Representative and Vice-President of the European Commission, Federica Mogherini will attend. \u00a0 More information: Fact Sheet Exercise BLACK BLADE 2016 Helicopter Initiatives (EDA project page) ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/11/16/10th-eda-helicopter-training-exercise-programme-takes-off-in-belgium"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0365", "date": "2016-11-15", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Outcome of EDA Ministerial Steering Board", "text": " At the EDA ministerial Steering Board which met this Tuesday morning (15 November) under the chairmanship of HR/VP Federica Mogherini in her capacity as Head of the Agency, Defence Ministers tasked EDA to review the Capability Development Plan (CDP), approved the 2017 general budget and agreed to set up a working group to study the potential creation of a Cooperative Financial Mechanism. Ministers agreed to the review of the Capability Development Plan (CDP), to improve the capability development process by taking into account R&T and industrial aspects, and tasked the EDA to present a new set of EU priorities for military capability development for Steering Board adoption by spring 2018. The CDP review is a key element of the new EU Global Strategy (EUGS) which states that, in order to match the level of ambition set out in the strategy, Member States will need high-end military capabilities, i.e. full-spectrum land, air, space and maritime capabilities, including strategic enablers. The CDP serves as a reference for national capability planning by informing Member States about capability requirements over time, identifying areas for capability improvements and translating capability priorities into concrete collaborative programmes. \u00a0 EDA 2017 budget: first increase since 2010 Ministers approved EDA\u2019s general budget for 2017: \u20ac31 million compared to \u20ac30.5 million in 2016. \u00a0 Cooperative Financial Mechanism (CFM) Ministers were presented with EDA proposals for the potential establishment of a \u2018Cooperative Financial Mechanism\u2019 (CFM) the objective of which would be to overcome the lack of budgetary synchronisation between Member States and the problems that this causes for the launch of cooperative defence cooperation projects. They agreed to set up a working group within EDA in view of submitting a legal and financial package and associated recommendations in spring 2017. Experience has shown that one of the key factors that block or hinder cooperation is budget asymmetry or lack of synchronisation of budget availability. A potential Cooperative Financial Mechanism could alleviate this challenge by supporting the launch of projects (R&T, capability development). It would potentially incentivise cooperation by tackling the problem of absence of budgetary synchronisation, but also increasing the availability of common resources/ring-fencing budgets allocated to cooperation. The CFM will have to respect the budgetary specialty principle as expressed in the national budgetary laws and ensure that Member States keep full control of their resources and on the use of the mechanism. These aspects will be dealt with in the EDA working group. \u00a0 Implementation of EDA key taskings Ministers welcomed the progress made on the implementation of the Agency\u2019s \u2018key taskings\u2019 in the various capability programmes and the work carried out in relation to the Preparatory Action, and were briefed on the planned next steps, notably in the context of the taskings that emerge from the Council conclusions adopted yesterday (14 November) on implementing the EUGS in the area of Security and Defence. The EDA was invited to develop a structured dialogue with industry, including not only prime companies but also national defence industry associations (NDIAs) and SMEs from Member States, in support of Key Strategic Activities (KSA) the first five test cases for which have also been welcomed.

The symposium was opened by Brigadier General Iliopoulos (Hellenic Army Aviation Directorate) in the Greek Officers\u2019 Mess in Athens. Over 40 helicopter tactics instructors and experts from 14 countries, with representatives of the Helicopter Tactics Course (HTC), of the Helicopter Tactics Instructor Course (HTIC) and of the Joint Air Power Competence Centre (JAPCC) gathered for this annual Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP) event to analyse lessons learned and best practices identified in recent exercises, and to learn about new training opportunities offered by the contributing Member States of the HEP. Briefings and discussions covered the tactical lessons learned from Dutch helicopter operations in Mali, the Czech Special Operations Aviation Task Unit (SOATU) training, the mentoring of Afghan aircrew by Hungary, the Belgium Mission Planning Process and the environmental training in extreme conditions experienced during exercise Cold Blade 2016 in Ivalo, Finland. In addition, host nation Greece presented its approach to Helicopter Aviation training, fire-fighting and MEDEVAC missions with their CH-47D Chinook helicopters. The presentations were followed by panel discussions for both attack and support helicopter operators; they brought a useful insight into the latest developments in night vision goggles training, Electronic Warfare, landing zone tactics, use of sensors and technologies applied in Degraded Visual Environments, currency and proficiency challenges and helicopter self-defence aids used by the Member States. The discussions triggered new proposals for updating the HEP Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) - the capstone tactics manual for multinational helicopter operations.

In his keynote speech, Dr. Ondrejcs\u00e1k praised the publication of the new EU Global Strategy as \u201cthe strongest impetus the CSDP received in terms of strategy since 2003\u201d and recalled the implementation work launched since then, notably the High Level Conference on EUGS Implementation organised by the Slovak Presidency and also attended by High Representative Mogherini. \u201cThe debate since then shows how diverse positions of the EU Member States are in defence domain\u201d, he said. \u00a0 \u201cImportant to find common solutions on defence\u201d Dr. Ondrejcs\u00e1k stated: \u201cConsensus is well reached on the main principles of the level of ambition, such as responding to external conflicts and crises, building the capacities of fragile partners and protecting the Union and its Member states, but when it comes to details, the unanimity is far more difficult, or impossible to reach. Despite the common goal, we still diversify in visions and plans concerning defence cooperation, financing CSDP missions and operations, EU Battle Groups and form of support of our partner countries. Slovakia is not an exception, of course. But it is important that at the end of the day we find common solutions, agreeable to every Member State\u201d. \u00a0 Active role for the EDA The work of the European Commission is seen by the EU Presidency as \u201cof great importance for the current CSDP context\u201d. In this respect, the upcoming European Defence Action Plan, as part of the wider package, \u201calso creates a space for an active role for the European Defence Agency\u201d, Dr. Ondrejcs\u00e1k said. He continued: \u201cWe support fostering European defence industry and defence research creating a basis for modern capabilities to maintain security and defence needs of the EU. The initiative with its funding instruments should be open to all beneficiaries with a close focus on small and medium enterprises. We also welcome special attention the European Defence Agency\u00a0pays to defence industry in Central and Eastern Europe. I am referring to an extensive analysis about measures to enhance balanced defence Industry in Europe, which identifies obstacles and proposes solutions for defence cooperation among central and eastern European countries. The Agency regularly offers room for national armaments directors from the Visegrad 4 countries to seek possibilities for collaborative projects\u201d. \u00a0 European Defence and Technological and Industrial Base \u201cIn times of increasingly fast-changing environment of creating new technologies and the continued need for innovation and the creation of new business models, the European defence sector needs to cope with these changes to remain an important part of the global defence market and remain relevant\u201d, the State Secretary said. \u201cThis means preparing for an age of relative uncertainty that can be highly diversified, hybrid and flexible and can well require from the defence sector to adapt quickly to changing innovation patterns, new mind-sets and corporate cultures. In this strategic context, an innovative and competitive European industry is a strategic asset to support EU Global Strategy implementation and be at the centre of development of defence-related capabilities, skills and industrial manufacturing capabilities\u201d. He added: \u201cAt present, we are still situated in an environment of significant economic restrictions in the defence sector. Member States' budgets cuts, increasing prices of defence products and new players on the global military equipment and technology market impact the European defence industry. Therefore, it is necessary to change the approach. If not, the EU and its Member States will face reduced military effectiveness and the defence sector declined military business opportunities. If we use funds more efficiently, combine our efforts and share common capabilities, we can achieve the high effect for less money spent\u201d. \u00a0 Defence R&T Another risk Europe faces is the lack of Research and Development (R&D) funding, lack of innovation and procurement of new military equipment and defence systems. \u201cIn reality it means that Europe and its Member States will no longer be able to afford sophisticated modern military capabilities that would necessarily need to fulfil the tasks determined. It creates a risk for the European defence industry, which will face an increasing competition from companies producing military equipment in the third countries\u201d. \u201cPooling requirements and achieving significant savings from economies of scale would enable Member States to acquire the necessary military capabilities that would otherwise could not afford individually. Some activities can be done also on bilateral basis, such as common maintenance, training, exercises and joint research and development. The creation of a common European market for defence would strengthen the European defence industry and would also help Member States to develop military capabilities they need to fully perform its tasks in accordance with the CSDP\u201d, he stated. \u00a0 More information Federica Mogherini opens EDA Annual Conference 2016\u00a0/ speech / video Listening to the supply & demand sides: EDA Annual Conference panels deliver interesting insights Commissioner Bie\u0144kowska outlines upcoming European Defence Action Plan at EDA Annual Conference EDA Annual Conference 2016 closes with call for cooperation on defence innovation Pictures of the EDA Annual Conference 2016 ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/11/10/slovak-eu-presidency-at-eda-annual-conference-common-solutions-are-needed-on-defence"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0369", "date": "2016-11-10", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA Annual Conference 2016 closes with call for cooperation on defence innovation", "text": " EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq closed today's Annual Conference 2016 with a call for \"cooperation to generate innovation\".

Especially fields like biotechnology, nanotechnology and deep intelligence will have a profound impact on Europe\u2019s ability to develop strategic assets at the same time, new technologies and new innovation will require a new mind set: to seek out and import commercial sector innovations and quickly develop new concepts of operation; to tap into innovation in the private sector and channel it into defence; and also to achieve cross-border competition which is speciually important to SME's and start-ups in Member States which do not have prime defence companies we have to find a balance between not suffocating SME's and start-ups and taping their knowledge for defence and, on the other hand, provide our governments with assurances that these new players will respect the specificities of the defence and security world European collaboration generates innovation and \"remains the best guarantee for achieving value for money and developing cutting-edge defence capabilities\". \"Cooperation is voluntary but it is a need\"\u00a0 the main challenges arising from a third industrial revolution are to integrate future innovations into development and production cycles, gain awareness of emerging leap-ahead technologies, access non-traditional sources of innovation, and ensure the reliability of trusted supply chains innovation does not come for free: the massive decline in budgetary terms of our defence R&T efforts is a matter of the highest concern because capabilities of the future are at stake here and the competitiveness of our defence industry is at risk. Therefore, fresh funding and the reinforcement of our R&T and innovation efforts will be key to structure European cooperation to reap the benefits, and not just adapt, to a third industrial revolution, Member States should make systematic use of the programmatic, financial and policy instruments offered by the EU which can support defence research, identify key enabling technologies and support testing and experimentation in view of potential uptake in defence products the EDA is looking to get ahead by also working \u201cup-stream\u201d, notably by facilitating Member States\u2019 convergence on identifying and prioritising research topics without a strong incentive, the current momentum may tail off. We must incentivise the right actions and the right programmes cooperation in defence is still not part of Europe\u2019s DNA. Yet, it remains the most efficient and cost effective way to ensure Europe\u2019s strategic autonomy strategic autonomy and a committment to a strong relationship with our partners are two sides of the same coin; otherwise, the technological gap will create a\u00a0political gap\u00a0 as a\u00a0hub for innovation, collaboration and action, EDA will continue to engage with industry and R&T innovators as valuable partners in providing technology and solutions which address the needs of Member States. \u00a0 EDA : \"At the service of Member States\" Mr Domecq concluded the Annual Conference 2016 by recalling \"EDA's mantra: at the service of\u00a0its Member States\". However, \"the Agency's output depends entirely on Member States input. So, view this agency as a crucial and natural partner. Use our resources and expertise\". \u00a0 More information Federica Mogherini opens EDA Annual Conference 2016\u00a0/ speech / video Listening to the supply & demand sides: EDA Annual Conference panels deliver interesting insights Slovak EU Presidency at EDA Annual Conference: \"Common solutions are needed on defence\" Commissioner Bie\u0144kowska outlines upcoming European Defence Action Plan at EDA Annual Conference Pictures of the EDA Annual Conference 2016 ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/11/10/eda-annual-conference-2016-closes-with-call-for-cooperation-on-defence-innovation"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0370", "date": "2016-11-10", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Commissioner Bie\u0144kowska outlines upcoming European Defence Action Plan at EDA Annual Conference", "text": " El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska, the European Commissioner for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, today delivered an interesting 'outlook speech' at the European Defence Agency's (EDA) Annual Conference 2016 in which she\u00a0described the main pillars of the Commission's upcoming European Defence Action Plan (EDAP).\u00a0 \"There is a clear political momentum to move towards more defence integration and we have to seize it\", the Commissioner said.

The REACT (Radar imagEry Applications supporting ACTionable intelligence) study, initiated and managed by the European Defence Agency (EDA) in cooperation with EU SATCEN and participating Member States, aims at giving more value to imagery data, identifying areas where military imagery analysts can be assisted by tools/workflows to produce valuable and possibly actionable intelligence, according to users\u2019 information requests. The study is focused on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery processes and in the combined use of SAR and electro-optical images. The study has been\u00a0awarded to an international consortium composed by: e-GEOS, Telespazio Ib\u00e9rica and INTA. The contract was signed in January 2016. The aim of the REACT implementation session was to test, in a pseudo-operational environment, the workflows for the exploitation of satellite radar imagery defined during the previous phases of the study. Several workflows were tested: Monitoring, Damage Assessment, Search/Targeting. New algorithms, still in a research and development phase, were also presented. For each of programme topics, the operational experts received a \u201cRequest for Information\u201d task. The operators were tasked to perform imagery processing and imagery analysis in accordance with the workflows previously defined during the REACT study. Satellite radar imagery was provided by the EU SATCEN and by the industrial consortium. The session proved to be extremely useful for the participating experts in many respects, especially because it helped them to face the intrinsic complexity of working with radar imagery and provided practical information in each step of the defined workflow. The expertise acquired during the session will also help the imagery analysts to establish effective working procedures for radar imagery exploitation, understand the pros and cons of using the several software suites available and evaluate the state of the art of new tools and algorithms for radar imagery exploitation (e.g Automatic Target Detection & Recognition). An additional similar session will be organized in Rome in December for two scenarios typically encountered during FRONTEX activities: pre-frontier and coastal monitoring. The results of the REACT activities will feed into the work of the forthcoming EDA Project Team Space Based Earth Observation. In addition to that, the lessons learned during the meeting on the new tools and algorithms may also be discussed in the relevant EDA CapTechs.

The event was jointly organised by the EDA, the Spanish Ministry of Defence and the Agency of Innovation and Development of Andalusia (IDEA). Around 130 representatives from the Spanish Ministry of Defence, defence industry and business associations, defence-related research and technology organisations and universities participated in the seminar, which included awareness raising and in-depth know-how building sessions. The seminar showed in concrete terms how to\u00a0access funding and other instruments available within two major European Union funding programmes running until 2020, i.e. COSME (EU Programme for COmpetitiveness of SMEs) and the Structural Funds. Rear Adm. Jes\u00fas Manrique Braojos, Deputy NAD of the Ministry of Defence of the Kingdom of Spain, welcomed the audience followed by introductory remarks by the Andalusian regional minister for Employment, Enterprise and Commerce, Jos\u00e9 Sanchez Maldonado. In his opening speech, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq said: \"A 'window of opportunities' was opened by both the June 2016 EU Global Strategy of the High Representative of the Union, Federica Mogherini, and the State of the Union speech by Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in September. The Global Strategy clearly stated that Union funds - to support defence research and technologies and multinational cooperation - are essential prerequisites for European security and defence efforts, underpinned by a strong European defence industry. EDA\u2019s work has already provided a positive answer to the question whether Structural Funds may co-fund dual-use research and technology projects, which clearly have a favourable impact on both the civilian and the defence fields. EDA has also recently clarified the conditions legitimizing access - for both defence and dual-use related SMEs and clusters - to the opportunities of the EU COSME Programme 2014-2020. Altogether, considering EDA encouraging results on Structural Funds and COSME so far, one can say that the time for action is now\u201d. Both the European Commission and the Spanish Ministry of Enterprises and Public Administrations\u2019 Directorate in charge for the coordination of the national deployment of Structural Funds made presentations about currently available EU funding for the defence sector. A particular focus was put on dual-use R&T funding and on the Enterprise Europe Network\u2019s local free services in native languages. Additionally, more than 40 Spanish project managers were trained to apply for the European Regional Development Fund during a dedicated coaching session. Finally, around 60 business-to-business meetings were arranged during a conclusive matchmaking session. The seminar raised interest across all attending stakeholders, who have established promising contacts in view of an effective follow-up aimed at accessing EU funding opportunities. Taking into account the increasingly blurred lines between internal and external security on the one hand and civil and defence technology on the other hand, different stakeholders exchanged views with Mr Domecq on how to take advantage of EDA\u2019s work, through close cooperation with the Ministry of Defence of the Kingdom of Spain, in order to promote civil/military synergies wherever appropriate. \u00a0 More information: Access to EU funding (EDA project page) Dual-use research (EDA project page) 3 out of 3: another EDA supported dual-use R&T project is awarded ESIF funding (EDA News) Polish dual-use R&T project co-funded by ESIF (EDA news) New funding opportunity for dual-use research ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/11/03/successful-seminar-on-eu-funding-opportunities-in-spain"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0373", "date": "2016-11-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Partners step up efforts to address the integration of drones into European airspace", "text": " The European Commission's services (DG MOVE), the European Defence Agency (EDA), the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the SESAR Joint Undertaking (SJU) are stepping up efforts to address the integration of drones into the European aviation and air traffic management (ATM) system.

The panel raised and discussed a number of crucial questions related to the future of the European defence industry, such as 'Are Europe's defence industrial models suited for the future?', 'How best to bring innovation closer to defence?', 'Is enough being done to capitalise on civil and military synergies?' and 'What measures can the European Commission bring to support innovation in defence?'. A particular emphasis was put on how the role of SMEs and Start-Ups in the defence supply chain could best be maximised and how their full potential as a source of innovation and a key enabler for competitiveness can be realized. In this respect, the need was stressed to promote SME's access to defence research pogrammes and to encourage their greater involvement in EU funding programmes. \u00a0 Panel 2: Demand side The second panel debate in the\u00a0afternoon saw high-profile representatives from national governments and EU institutions sharing their views on implications for the defence sector at large: whole-of-government policies in support of strategic innovation, emerging risks and vulnerabilities in terms of technology control, interface with industry, impact on acquisition choices and life-cycle management. The four high-level panelists were: Rear Admiral Matteo Bisceglia (Director for Naval Armaments, Italy), Ioan Mircea Pa\u015fcu (Vice-President of the European Parliament and former Defence minister of Romania),Vice Admiral Mark Mellett (Chief of Defence, Ireland) and Alexander Weis (Vice-Director of the Bundeswehr Planning Office, Germany). Among the questions discussed were the following: 'Are the current procurement processes of Defence Ministries best adapted to the challenges and opportunities presented by innovation?', 'How important is continued and sustained national investment in research & innovation?', 'What do policy-makers need to do to provide the best possible environment to foster the technological innovations required?', 'How can Europe respond to the US Third Offset Strategy?' and 'How to overcome fragmentation of demand?'. There was broad consensus on the EDA's role in defence R&T and innovation: the Agency should continue to act as a \"catalyst\" by identifying innovation gaps and potential collaborative opportunities, bringing interested Member States together and facilitating collaborative R&T projects. However, it was stressed, R&T initiatives need to be driven by capability requirements. The objective is not to fund industrial policy, said Mr Weis. \"The EDA has to make sure that R&T projects are capability driven, be it national or EU capabilities\". \u00a0 More information Federica Mogherini opens EDA Annual Conference 2016\u00a0/ speech / video Slovak EU Presidency at EDA Annual Conference: \"Common solutions are needed on defence\" Commissioner Bie\u0144kowska outlines upcoming European Defence Action Plan at EDA Annual Conference EDA Annual Conference 2016 closes with call for cooperation on defence innovation Pictures of the EDA Annual Conference 2016 ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/11/10/'opportunities-and-challenges-from-the-supply-side'-debated-at-eda-annual-conference"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0375", "date": "2016-11-10", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Federica Mogherini opens EDA Annual Conference 2016", "text": " The European Defence Agency (EDA) Annual Conference 2016 entitled 'A third industrial evolution or revolution in defence?' was opened Thursday morning (10 November) in Brussels by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission, Federica Mogherini, who is also the Head of the Agency. Addressing a 500 strong audience coming from the whole European defence spectrum - governments, armed forces, industry, EU institutions, NATO, think tanks and media - Mrs Mogherini said in her opening speech that time had come to make urgent and concrete steps towards a stronger and more efficient European defence, and to do it \u201cthe European way\u201d. We don\u2019t need another theoretical and endless debate about a potential EU army or treaty change but what is\u00a0needed are \"very concrete actions\" to be delivered in the next months to make sure Europe can protect it citizens and become a global security provider. This is what citizens expect now that Europe is facing a \"security crisis\", she stressed. \u201cThere are no excuses, we have to do it and we have to do it now\u201d. March 2017, when Europe will celebrate the 60th\u00a0anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, will be a good moment to have a concrete implementation process up and running and to deliver on defence integration. \"Sixty years ago, the founding fathers and mothers of our European Union believed that a united Europe had to be built on two pillars: a European Economic Community, and a Defence Community. They knew that a true Union could not simply rely on the integration of the markets. They were right, and yet they failed. Sixty years later, I believe the original intuition has become even more relevant\", Mrs Mogherini stressed. To move ahead towards a defence union, Europe has not to start from scratch because the Treaty of Lisbon already offers all the tools that are required. \u201cWe just need to use them. This is a matter of political will, stated Mrs Mogherini adding that she saw now a \u201cclear window of opportunity\u201d to achieve concrete results in the coming months. She recalled the three parallel processes currently ongoing, namely the implementation of the EU Global Strategy, the Commission\u2019 upcoming European Defence Action Plan (EDAP) and the follow-up on the recent joint EU/NATO Declaration. These three processes have to be complementary, she insisted. We have to advance quickly, \u201cwe have to run\u201d, to make sure that those processes lead to first concrete results by spring 2017. In this respect, the European Defence Agency can act as a pivot between the Commission and Member States on European defence, Mrs Mogherini said. \u00a0 Capabilities are crucial The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission put a special emphasis on the need to make sure Europe has the required capabilities to play its role in defence. Capabilities have to be up to the task. \"And here, Europe has to be very careful, I believe, very careful, that the investment gap is not translated into an ever wider technology gap. Because a technology gap would then lead to an interoperability gap. And if left unchecked, this could translate into a political gap which would clearly not be in our interest. And I would add, this would also have economic implications for our continent\". There will be no strategic autonomy and defence role for Europe without a strong and smart and innovative European defence technology and industrial base, Mrs Mogherini concluded. \u00a0 More information Speech of the HR/VP Mogherini / video Listening to the supply & demand sides: EDA Annual Conference panels deliver interesting insights Slovak EU Presidency at EDA Annual Conference: \"Common solutions are needed on defence\" Commissioner Bie\u0144kowska outlines upcoming European Defence Action Plan at EDA Annual Conference EDA Annual Conference 2016 closes with call for cooperation on defence innovation Pictures of the EDA Annual Conference 2016 ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/11/10/federica-mogherini-opens-eda-annual-conference-2016"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0376", "date": "2016-10-25", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "4th EDA Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC) successfully concluded", "text": " After two intense months of training, the 4th EDA Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC), which had kicked off mid-August at RAF Linton-on-Ouse in the North of England, was officially completed on 9 October at Vidsel Airbase in Northern Sweden. Involving helicopters and aircrew from Sweden, Germany, the United Kingdom and Austria, the course was branded by experienced participants as the \u2018most challenging yet\u2019 in terms of adverse weather conditions, aircraft unserviceability and a particularly intense flying programme. Ten instructors managed to graduate with a Silver and eight with a Bronze Level; they are now fully ready and prepared to complete the course in 2017. After threat briefs and lectures from Air Battle Space Management, the course started with a simulation phase covering all aspects of tactical formation, evasion training and electronic warfare. It culminated in a complex simulated sortie requiring detailed planning and the ability to complete a task in a hostile and contested environment. All trainees reached the required standard that allowed them to move on to the next level: the live flying phase which took place in the Vidsel Test range in Northern Sweden. During that live flying training in Sweden, HTIC staff was complemented by operations & logistics staff from the Swedish Air Force as well as from the UK. Having such a strong team proved vital in the two weeks that followed when course participants had to cope with very poor weather conditions, unserviceable aircraft and sick aircrew. Despite the flying programme changing constantly, the high degree of flexibility provided by the team made it possible that sorties were still manageable and successfully achieved under testing conditions. When the weather started to improve, participants had to conduct two sorties every day to make up the delay caused by the earlier bad weather. Most sorties were completed to a satisfactory level meaning that all participants were allowed to move ahead to the Composite Air Operations (COMAO) phase which all completed successfully. \u00a0 More information: Third Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course successfully accomplished (webnews, November 2015) Helicopter Initiatives (EDA project page) \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/10/25/4th-eda-helicopter-tactics-instructors-course-(htic)-successfully-concluded"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0377", "date": "2016-11-03", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA Workshop on Materials 2050", "text": " As the defence and security landscape moves into more complex and uncharted areas, studying and developing the capabilities of the future is becoming increasingly challenging. The emergence of new platform concepts and the lead times, often spanning over decades, for materials used in major platforms result in a pressing need to start research efforts in the present. On 18 October 2016, 25 experts from various European Ministries of Defence, the U.S. Department of Defense, European institutions, and industry participated in an EDA workshop to identify materials envisioned to be used by military forces in the year 2050. High-level experts on materials and defence technologies gathered to discuss the types and functionalities of materials with a potential to improve military operations in 35 years as well as major advances that might be foreseen. Thought-provoking presentations from the European Defence Agency (EDA), the Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI), the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the European Union Institute for Security Studies (EUISS) and the European Space Agency (ESA) underlined the importance of long-term defence R&T strategic planning. They showed how innovative materials and manufacturing can be used in a wide range of applications - lowering the burden of the soldier, stealth and protection, ammunition enhancements - and can improve the lifespan, logistical aspects and functional capabilities of existing & future platforms \u2013 air, naval and land. Using a structured brainstorming method, the organizers dynamically combined the various experts in groups to create a maximum level of interaction and balance between governmental and non-governmental actors. The main outcome of the workshop was the identification of promising ideas and possible Research & Technology needs in 4 main areas: additive manufacturing, advanced smart materials, functional materials and structural materials. Computer-assisted modelling, deployed 3D printing, multifunctional materials, integrated sensors, frequency-adaptive signature control materials, and biomimetics were among the topics viewed to be of especially high interest for military forces in the next decades. Although the participants recognized that predicting the future poses difficulties in the context of evolving political, technological, economic and legislative factors, they considered that defence technology in 2050 will be shaped by capitalizing on the windows of opportunity opened in the present.

At this occasion, he stressed the important work done so far by the EDA on C-IED and called for increased cooperation between institutions and stakeholders on this crucial issue. The European Defence Agency is involved in countering IED since the very beginning because C-IEDs has been one of the Capability Development Plan (CDP) priorities almost since the launch of the EDA CDP process itself, Mr Domecq recalled in his speech. In 2010, the Agency invested one million euros to establish a Counter IED exploitation deployable laboratory. That initiative grew into the Multinational Technical Exploitation Laboratory - or MNTEL - which was successfully deployed to Afghanistan from 2011 to July 2014. MNTEL subsequently led to the establishment of the Joint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory (JDEAL) \u2013 a capability which presents a real opportunity to tackle technical exploitation in general, and exploitation of Improvised Explosive Devices in particular. \u201cThe pressing operational need to Counter IEDs has been a major driver for these developments. EDA\u2019s projects have aimed to generate exploitation capabilities that directly improve the understanding, identification and exposure of threat networks. And they were successful\u201d, Mr Domecq stressed. In August 2016, a full exploitation deployable capability was deployed to the multinational exercise \u2018Bison Counter 2016\u2019. \u00a0 Cooperation is key To be even more effective in the future, stakeholders have to cooperate and share their knowledge and expertise, Mr Domecq insisted. \u201cWe, at the EDA, demonstrated our openness to cooperation very clearly when we signed a successful and productive Cooperation Framework Agreement with the Centre of Excellence C-IED in Madrid. C-IED demands a strong Interagency approach, as do exploitation issues. This agreement has definitely paved the way for others to come. Just opening new lines of action and cooperating with stakeholders enables Institutions to work better and faster together, and of course to broaden the scope for further opportunities\u201d. The EDA Chief Executive added: \u201cWe are strong proponents of developing exploitation capabilities and so is NATO. At the end of the day, Member States and Allies each have one set of forces to deploy and protect, be it for national or EU or NATO or UN engagements. Hence we will continue our close staff-to-staff discussion on what we are currently doing on exploitation and our future intentions. Sharing in certain domains - such as the recent NATO C-IED Task Force meeting - is of enormous benefit to our on-going activities, and also helps avoid duplication of effort\u201d. \u201cExploitation disciplines should no longer be a national secret. Proficiency in this domain needs to be improved, shared and deployed by organizations and nations \u2013 to fail to do so leaves the door open for those who wish to do us harm. In this respect EDA is delivering capabilities and providing options to strengthen cooperation between MS as well as between all relevant stakeholders. Exchange of experts and training capabilities must underpin the fight against insurgent networks and hybrid hazards and this event provides the best avenue to do so\u201d, he concluded. \u00a0 Background The IAWS2016 is a 3-day event to discuss about the current situation and the future initiatives on the use of exploitation as an essential tool to counter threat networks that employ or facilitate IEDs. The general objective for the IAWS 2016 is to promote and enhance interagency cooperation among military, law enforcement and civil organizations and agencies, at both national and international levels, in order to better counter the threat networks that facilitate and employ IEDs. The IAWS 2016 addresses the current IED threat situation, with a special focus on sensitive areas for NATO and its partners. Exploitation will also be tackled, from a twofold point of view: currently existing exploitation capabilities in the military as well as in the law enforcement, and exploitation-related, capacity-building initiatives in partner countries and possible ways ahead and standards.

The Pilot Project also paves the way for the launch, in 2017, of the European Commission\u2019s Preparatory Action (PA) on defence research which, in turn, leads to a fully-fledged European Defence Research Programme (EDRP) as part of the EU\u2019s next Multiannual Financial Framework (2021-2027). All of them - Pilot Project, Preparatory Action and the future European Defence Research Programme - should support R&T that is serving capability priorities identified by Member States in the Capability Development Plan and be taken up in future collaborative capability programmes. DG GROW Deputy Director General Pierre Delsaux said: \"EU funding for defence research was almost inconceivable a few years ago for EU institutions, Member States and the defence community. This Pilot Project is therefore the precursor of a new era.\" Mr Delsaux thanked the European Parliament for its support on the Pilot Project and underlined that a lot of effort and intensive work done by both from the Commission and the EDA, to make the Pilot Project work. He also explained that there is still a long way ahead for EU funded defence research and that \"the Commission, in accordance with its institutional role and in full compliance with the EU legal context, is ready to work on defining the optimal framework and overseeing the implementation of the defence research priorities set by the Member States.\" EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq said: \u201cToday\u2019s signing marks an important milestone and opens a new chapter in the way defence research is funded in Europe. The European Parliament, the European Commission and the EDA have worked together, hand in hand, to set up this Pilot Project which is an important test bed for more defence research funded from the EU budget in the future\u201d. He particularly thanked German MEP Michael Gahler and other members of the European Parliament\u2019s SEDE committee whose relentless efforts back in 2014 resulted in the EP earmarking funding for an EU Pilot Project in the field of defence research for the first time ever. \u201cThe EDA is now looking forward to advancing the activities and making the Pilot Project a success\u201d. Mr Domecq stressed the \u201cadditional boost\u201d EU funding possibilities, such as the Pilot Project and the upcoming Preparatory Action, will give to defence R&T by complementing national research programmes and existing cooperative funding schemes. \u201cUsing the EU budget for funding defence R&T will help to generate critical mass, to network European research entities and to increase interoperability and standards. The Pilot Project has already shown to what extent EU funding in conjunction with priorities set by Member States at intergovernmental level can be a powerful catalyst to attract Primes and SMEs, Research Centers and Academia, from big and small Member States. Research in defence also has concrete and profitable spill-over effects for everyday life\u201d, he said. \u201cR&T is not nice-to-have. It is an essential prerequisite to develop the required defence capabilities of the future and thus to provide for our citizen\u2019s security\u201d, the EDA Chief Executive concluded. \u00a0 EDA call for proposal The three activities were selected following an EU-wide call for proposals organized by the EDA between 23 March and 23 June 2016. They cover the following topics: \u00a0 Inside Building Awareness and Navigation for Urban Warfare (SPIDER) - Grant: \u20ac433.225 \u00a0The objective of this activity is to provide a proof of concept for an innovative system to improve soldiers\u2019 inside building awareness by introducing into buildings miniaturized sensors which can move and change position to provide better coverage and improved performance. The activity will analyse the possibilities that new technologies and pioneering concepts provide to this aim. The proposed system will be composed by two distinct sensor subsystems: a static outdoor subsystem (a network of radiofrequency sensors that can recognize humans inside the building) and a mobile indoor subsystem which will be based on mobile robots capable of sensing the interior of the building using video camera and range-finding sensors such as depth sensors. The robots will be controlled by operators through a secure communication system. A separate station will receive all information obtained by both outdoor and indoor sensors to reconstruct an indoor map of the building. By visualizing the indoor map, the soldiers will have a crucial awareness enabling them to safely navigate inside the building. The system will be designed to be highly robust to endure operation in hostile environments. This activity was won by a consortium led by TEKEVER, a Portuguese technology company, and composed of IT Aveiro - Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es (Portugal), Aralia (UK) and the Bulgarian Defence Institute (BDI). \u00a0 Standardisation of Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) Detect and Avoid (TRAWA) - Grant: \u20ac433.292 \u00a0The aim of this activity is to contribute to the development of standards for a performant and affordable detect and avoid (DAA) system usable on-board Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS). In concrete terms, it will specify \u2018well clear\u2019 boundaries in exact terms so that specifications for DAA technical systems can be derived from them. It will also develop requirements for remote pilot HMI (Human Machine Interface) characteristics. In addition, a method will be provided through which it can be identified which RPAS types can be integrated into airspace together with other aircraft categories, and vice versa, given their DAA technology capabilities. The proposed solution will be complementary with on-going European activities of the European Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment (EUROCAE), Eurocontrol and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in this field. It will in particular follow the EUROCAE ED78a standardisation process. The activity is an enabler for the widespread use of RPAS in non-segregated airspace in Europe because it supports the development of standards for the certification of DAA solutions and helps to identify technology capabilities which need to be developed by the European defence industry. This activity was won by a consortium led by the Netherlands Aerospace Center (NLR) with the following partners: the German Aerospace Center (Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Luft- und Raumfahrt, DLR), Deep Blue (Italy), Tony Henley Consulting (UK) and EuroUSC (Italy). \u00a0 Unmanned Heterogeneous Swarm of Sensor Platforms (EuroSWARM) - Grant: \u20ac434.000 This activity will demonstrate, through a live experimentation, that typical military missions and tasks can be performed in exemplary scenarios by an unmanned, autonomous and heterogeneous \u2018swarm\u2019 system of systems, using emerging enabling technologies. EuroSWARM\u2019s main objectives are: - to develop key techniques for adaptive, informative and reconfigurable operations of unmanned heterogeneous swarm systems, namely: optimal task allocation and resource management; sensor fusion, cooperative guidance, robust sensor network; - to integrate the developed enabling techniques;\u00a0- to validate the developed enabling techniques based on empirical simulation studies; - to demonstrate the proposed solutions based on a small scale of experiments. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The activity is expected to deliver a control & command architecture for autonomous and heterogeneous swarms of sensors. The architecture will host a wide variety of piloted and autonomous swarm elements, such as unmanned air/ground/naval platforms, steerable mast, unattended remote-controlled sensors, protective devices (laser, jammer, smoke generators etc.). Any kind of weaponry is excluded from the system. Using static/mobile sensors and vehicles in an unmanned swarm-based autonomous system such as EuroSWARM can become a pilot for large scale usage to deal with critical European and global challenges such as border control or surveillance-security. The activity was won by a consortium led by the University of Cranfield (UK) which also includes the French aerospace research agency ONERA (Office National d'Etudes et de Recherches A\u00e9rospatiales), the Swedish Defence Research Agency FOI and the University of Patras (Greece). \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Pilot Project implementation The signing of the grant agreements fires the starting shot for the implementation phase of the three activities as off 1 November 2016. SPIDER and EuroSWARM will be delivered after 12 months (November 2017) while TRAWA will run for 18 months (May 2018). The Pilot Project is run and managed by the EDA on behalf of the European Commission based on a delegation agreement signed between the Agency and the Commission in November 2015. As a result, the EDA is responsible for the project\u2019s implementation and management. \u00a0 More information: Details on the three projects (Pilot Project call for proposals) Factsheet \u2018Preparatory Action for CSDP-related research\u2019 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/10/28/first-eu-pilot-project-in-the-field-of-defence-research-sees-grant-agreements-signed-for-1.4-million"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0380", "date": "2016-10-20", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "National Armaments Directors discuss a wide range of important topics at EDA Steering Board meeting", "text": " EDA National Armaments Directors (NADs) met on 19 October at the European Defence Agency for their biannual Steering Board meeting under the chairmanship of Czech Deputy Minister of Defence, Daniel Kostoval.

The Ministries of Defence (MoDs) of Cyprus and Greece offered to take the lead on this project within the framework of the EDA. Colonel Georgios Drosos, Head of the Infrastructure & Environment Department of the Hellenic MoD, was appointed as the group chairman. He stressed that the group\u2019s main objective was \u201cto assess how EU legislation on the Protection of European Critical Energy Infrastructure can be applied by the defence sector in a holistic way\u201d. Each and every part of defence critical infrastructure needs to be protected appropriately to ensure that the overall energy supply chain can function properly. As Colonel Drosos said, maintaining and improving regional energy security and sustainability within the EU will contribute to achieving this goal. The expert group\u2019s chairman also stressed that possible shortfalls can be addressed by developing \u201cprojects of common interest for the defence sector\u201d. \u00a0 Collaboration between defence and research To promote joint efforts and scientific collaboration between the defence sector and the research community, Professor Athanasios Konstandopoulos, chairman of the board of the Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH) was appointed as the co-chairman of the group. Professor Konstandopoulos pointed out that \u201cthe task of securing Energy Strategic Autonomy in a highly connected world presents challenges and creates opportunities for strengthening collaboration between the research community and the defence sector\u201d. He called on stakeholders \u201cto face the challenges and exploit the opportunities.\u201d To accomplish its goals, the PCEI expert group will use the expertise of EDA Member States\u2019 Ministries of Defence, national academic and research centres as well as EDA\u2019s partners: the European Commission DG ENERGY, Joint Research Centre, and the NATO Energy Security Centre of Excellence. Air Commodore Peter Round, EDA Capability Armaments and Technology (CAT) Director, stated that \u201cEDA aims through the PCEI Experts Group to identify common capability and research shortfalls and to address them collectively to help to achieve resilience of Armed Forces in Europe.\u201d Denis Roger, EDA European Synergies and Innovation (ESI) Director, emphasized that \u201cin times of crises, it is imperative to ensure the continued availability of secure and sustainable energy supplies and we are glad that EDA can contribute to this vital work by exploring the defence element of critical energy infrastructure.\u201d The PCEI expert group is supported within EDA at an inter-directorate level (CAT and ESI) by CAT Project Officer Protect, Constantinos Hadjisavvas, and ESI Project Officer Energy and Environment Systems, Richard Brewin. \u00a0 Way Ahead The next PCEI experts group meetings will be hosted by Cyprus in January 2017 and by Greece in March 2017. The meetings will be open to all the participating Member States of the Agency, the Agency\u2019s partners as well as other international organisations. \u00a0 Background Securing Energy Strategic Autonomy for European Defence (SESAED) is becoming more vital than ever for national and international security and economic prosperity due to the increased number of terrorist attacks, and the emerging threats from hybrid and asymmetrical warfare as well as vulnerability to the impacts of climate change and natural hazards across Europe. Hence, Protection of Critical Energy Infrastructures was identified as one of the component areas to be examined as part of the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector (CF SEDSS) which was jointly launched by the European Defence Agency (EDA) and the European Commission in October 2015. In May 2016, the PCEI Experts Group was established to explore PCEI further from a defence point of view. The Cypriot and the Hellenic Ministries of Defence (MoDs) offered to take the lead on this project within the framework of EDA. In this effort academic and research support is provided by the KIOS Research Center, the Cyprus University of Technology, the European University Cyprus, the Centre for Research & Technology, Hellas CERTH and the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). \u00a0 More information : Energy and Environment Programme (EDA project page) Second meeting of the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in Defence opens in Dublin (EDA webnews) ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/10/17/expert-group-looks-into-protection-of-critical-energy-infrastructures-for-defence"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0384", "date": "2016-10-18", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Jorge Domecq at Euronaval: \u201cMore cooperation needed to develop the next generation naval platforms\u201d", "text": " EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq today (18 October) visited the Euronaval exhibition in Paris where he had a range of bilateral meetings with industry leaders. He also participated in a panel discussion organized by GICAN (Groupement des Industries de Construction et Activit\u00e9s Navales) on the \u201cThe future of naval warfare: high-end operations\u201d. In his panel intervention, Mr Domecq called for more cooperation between Member States on European programs and the development of the next generation of platforms. \u201cThe current scattered approach is ultimately putting at risk the very survival of our naval industry (\u2026) European navies operate 20 different types of frigate, four different types of aircraft carrier, and multiple types of support ships and MCM Vessels. This situation is no longer affordable\u201d, he said. \u201cThere is no need to develop a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 solution. But we do need a full, frank, fair and mutual analysis of common gaps, common requirements and respective investments made at national and multinational level by Member States, including on high-end capabilities\u201d, the EDA Chief said. He called on Member States that face similar regional or procurement challenges to agree on common platforms with an open architecture approach for subsystems. \u201cAnd I would like to encourage industrial stakeholders not to be afraid about competition nor about possible European consolidation\u201d, he stated. \u00a0 EDA tools available Tools developed within EDA like the Collaborative Database are unique instruments to identify the business case for cooperative capability developments. 45 collaborative opportunities for naval platforms have already been identified such as \u2018surface combatants\u2019, \u2018submarines\u2019, \u2018maritime patrol vessels\u2019 or \u2018auxiliary ships for logistics support\u2019 but also specific naval assets such as \u2018maritime patrol aircraft\u2019 and \u2018naval helicopters\u2019 or capabilities like \u2018naval radars\u2019, \u2018sonars\u2019, \u2018naval air and missile defence\u2019 and \u2018ship protection\u2019. In particular, the capability of replenishment at sea and logistic support are essential. Many of the Member States share a common need for improved endurance at sea. \u201cApplying a model like the European Air Transport Command (ETAC) can be of interest\u201d, Mr Domecq said. \u00a0 Increased R&T needed Mr Domecq also said that European naval forces have probably never been confronted with security challenges as big as today, ranging from territorial protection to dealing with refugee crises and combatting criminal trafficking networks in the Mediterranean and the Aegean Sea. He recalled that the recent EU Global Strategy explicitly highlights the importance of maritime security which will also be part of the upcoming revision of the Capability Development Plan (CDP) for which the EDA will seek a mandate by Defence Ministers in November. Regarding the CDP revision, Mr Domecq insisted on the need to ensure strong interaction between the naval industry and research and technologies (R&T) community. \u201cThese efforts have to lead to an increased R&T commitment, either on an intergovernmental level through the European Defence Agency or on the basis of the future Preparatory Action and the European Defence Research Programme (EDRP). It\u2019s paramount that we push ahead with innovation on disruptive technologies\u201d, the EDA Chief Executive said. \u00a0 More information: EU naval industry in good shape but more R&T investment needed, study says (EDA webnews, October 2016) Unmanned Maritime Systems Conference (EDA webnews November 2015) Unmanned Maritime Systems (UMS) research (EDA project page) Key Industrial Capabilities - Naval Domain (EDA project page) ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/10/18/jorge-domecq-at-euronaval-more-cooperation-needed-to-develop-the-next-generation-naval-platforms"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0385", "date": "2016-10-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EU naval industry in good shape but more R&T investment needed, study says", "text": " Goods news from our shipyards: EU manufacturers of military vessels and submarines are doing well, especially on international markets where exports are booming. No reason though for the industry to rest on its laurels as it urgently needs to invest in research & technology (R&T) if it wants to stay at the top, as a recent study commissioned by the European Defence Agency (EDA) shows. This article appeared in the EDA's European Defence Matters magazine issue 11 Despite difficult conditions on a growingly turbulent global naval market \u2013 mainly caused by rising exports from Chinese, Russian and South Korean shipyards - Europe\u2019s naval industry has managed to maintain its position as a highly competitive global player if not a world leader, notably thanks to its technological edge and strong exports, the EDA-commissioned \u201cStudy on Industrial and Technological Competences in the Naval Sector\u201d concludes. The study, which was carried out by a consortium in 2015 and early 2016 (see box below), confirms that European naval industries are very strong in their respective domestic European markets - but also in international markets such as the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Latin America which all devote growing budgets to defence and often have no meaningful indigenous naval industry. Also due to decreasing defence budgets in Europe (at least over the past decade, whereas the trend has now started to reverse), export markets nowadays account for 42% of the European naval order book value. \u00a0 Healthy successful industrial base, but... Another positive characteristic of the European naval industry, according to the study, is its ability to design, integrate and produce the whole range of naval ships and almost the totality of its core systems and components. \u201cConsidering the complexity and sophistication of the products designed and built by these companies, they can be regarded as \u2018system integrators\u2019, dismissing once forever the old image of shipbuilders as mere assemblers of steel blocks\u201d, it says. The European naval industry\u2019s supply chain is also considered both diverse and complete with no area in which a monopoly exists. Most importantly (with regard to Europe\u2019s strategic autonomy in defence) there are European alternative suppliers and replacement options in place for all systems/components currently procured from outside Europe. Business diversification is another trump card played by the European naval industry. The majority of the naval players are also successful players in the high-end segments of merchant shipbuilding (e.g. cruise ships and mega-yachts) and in the related maritime activities (e.g. offshore and marine renewable energies). \u201cThis diversification strategy has created a favourable cross-fertilization between civil and military technologies (dual-use technologies), both at the Prime Contractors and at the Supply-Chain levels, leading to cost-effective designs and solutions\u201d, the study says. The study\u2019s overall conclusion could hardly be more encouraging: \u201cThe European Naval Industrial Base today is made up of healthy, capable, diversified and successful export-oriented companies\u201d. \u00a0 \u2026 more R&T investments needed However, all forecasts in the study are not entirely rosy. The study also warns that some threats stemming from non-European competitors are on the horizon such as fierce price competition from non-EU countries, especially China, South Korea and Russia. Countries which very actively support their naval industries \u201cas an act both of foreign and industrial policy\u201d. According to the study, the best way to counter this threat is by maintaining Europe\u2019s technological lead at the Prime/System Integrators level as well as across the full supply chain \u201cthrough increased, more supported, more coordinated and more focused investments in Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) at national and European level\u201d. In order to increase intra-EU cooperation in the naval defence and security domain, a dedicated area for naval related research should be secured within the next multi-annual Framework for Research, Development and Innovation starting in 2021, the study recommends: \u201cThis is essential to the long-term sustainability of the European naval industry\u201d. The European Commission\u2019s upcoming Preparatory Action (PA) on defence-related research and the Defence Action Plan (scheduled for later this year) could also play a key role as political frameworks to increase the resources devoted to defence research activities, including in the naval domain, the study concludes. \u201cHere, a distinct role of overall coordinator is foreseen and advocated for the EDA\u201d, it says. The study also pleads for a regular exchange of ideas between the EDA and the major players in the naval shipbuilding sector in order to better coordinate and integrate the objectives of the future R&T programmes in this field. Finally, the study has also led to a list of technologies considered of \u201cprimary importance\u201d both to maintain the European competitiveness and technological lead and to ensure the required level of operational superiority. In total 13 high priority topics and 4 new items were identified. The high priority list includes surface technologies topics (virtual ships, simulation, maintenance, oceanography, environmental protection, supply & support), subsea technologies (hydrodynamics and UxV integration, modularity, UxV integration, vulnerability reduction, propulsor) as well as services and transversal technologies (uninhabited systems, propulsor & propellers). The identified new R&T topics to be focussed on in the future are 3D printing, high capacity batteries, augmented reality and drones. \u00a0 About the study: With the adoption of the EU Maritime Security Strategy in 2014 which also encompasses defence-related aspects through its CSDP dimension, the maritime domain has gained renewed focus at EU level. The ability for European nations to implement such a strategy will depend on both the availability of required capabilities for both civilian missions and military operations, and the existence of a competent and competitive naval industrial base. Therefore, in 2015, the EDA commissioned this study \u2013 which was conducted by a consortium of Sea Europe (lead partner), Damen, DCNS, Fincantieri, Navantia and TKMS - to acquire a comprehensive picture of the European Naval Technological and Industrial base and its technological priorities. \u00a0 More information: Unmanned Maritime Systems (UMS) research (EDA project page) Maritime Mine Counter Measures - New Generation (EDA project page) Modular Lightweight Minesweeping (EDA project page) ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/10/06/eu-naval-industry-in-good-shape-but-more-r-t-investment-needed-study-says"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0386", "date": "2016-10-05", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Annual Military Airworthiness Conference in Lisbon", "text": " Hosted by the National Aviation Authority of Portugal (Autoridade Aeron\u00e1utica Nacional, AAN), the Annual Military Airworthiness Conference kicked off in Lisbon this Wednesday with keynote speeches delivered by EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq and General Manuel Teixeira Rolo of AAN. The two-day event (5/6 October) brings together key stakeholders from national authorities, industry, European agencies, NATO and international organisations for presentations and discussions on a variety of topics related to harmonization of military airworthiness requirements , implementation experiences and integration into a global context. In his speech, Mr Domecq stressed that standardisation, including in the area of airworthiness requirements, was a \"key enabler\" for the implementation of the EU Global Strategy. \"The application of common standards and recommended best practice is a key enabler for defence cooperation and helps strengthen the European Defence Technological and Industrial base. Most importantly, from a defence perspective, such standardisation would support effective cooperation and improve interoperability\", he said.\u00a0 He also recalled that since the establishment of the Military Airworthiness Authorities (MAWA) Forum, a lot of work has been done particularly in the area of European Military Airworthiness Requirements, the EMARs. \u201cWith the EMARs that are now developed, nations have created a baseline for a common approach to processes like certification, organisational approvals and the preservation of airworthiness\u201d. However, \u201ca real common approach can only be established if EMARs are also implemented in a uniform way, which is a national responsibility of the Member States\u201d, he stressed. Based on an earlier EDA funded study by Eurocopter, it is estimated that the adoption by Member States of optimised and harmonised military airworthiness regulations through the European Military Airworthiness Requirements would deliver a reduction of up to 50% of the development time and at least 10% of development costs up to initial-type certification. Significant further cost savings could also be achieved during the in-service phase. \u00a0 Positive trend Currently, the status of implementation of the EMARs varies from nation to nation, and at this stage the application is still mostly limited to some multinational aircraft programmes like A400M. \u201cThat said, there are signs that things are moving in the right direction. For example, NAHEMA has decided to use EMARs for the certification framework of its NH90 programme. And the participating nations in the MRTT programme will make use of the EMARs to benefit from a common approach\u201d, Mr Domecq said. In the next years, the focus should be on the standardisation of how the Member States ensure and preserve their military airworthiness, Mr Domecq said. The ultimate outcome Member States should aim for, he said, should include: 1. a single certification approach for multinational programmes, which would result in less development costs and optimised use of certification resources; 2. the development and application of common agreed industrial standards which would strengthen the position of the European defence industry in the global market; 3. optimised pooling and sharing of spare parts and maintenance resources within a single regulatory and oversight system (of key interest in relation to civil-derivative aircraft, but also with regard to military platforms such as A400M, Eurofighter, NH90 and others); 4. optimised use of oversight resources by collaboration in oversight obligations; 5. minimised gaps or differences between national regulatory and oversight systems, which would in turn minimise safety risks in multinational materiel cooperation programmes. \u00a0 More information: EDA project page on European Military Airworthiness Authorities Forum (MAWA) MAWA Annual Conference 2015\u00a0 ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/10/05/annual-military-airworthiness-conference-in-lisbon"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0387", "date": "2016-10-03", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA chief and Romanian Minister discuss defence cooperation", "text": " EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq held talks today (3 October) in Bucharest with Romanian Minister of Defence Mihnea Ioan Motoc. Romania\u2019s participation in EDA projects, the Security & Defence Implementation Plan of the EU Global Strategy and the European Commission\u2019s upcoming European Defence Action Plan were among the main topics on the agenda. During the meeting, Mr Domecq welcomed Romania\u2019s involvement in EDA projects and activities, for example: EU Satcom Market, the Joint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory (JDEAL) project and the European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) programme. Romania was also the first contributing Member States to join the EDA\u2019s \u2018Sharing of Spare Parts\u2019 project which allows it today to share military spare parts with eight other Member States who have also joined. The EDA is currently also providing technical assistance to three Romanian dual-use research project proposals as candidates for co-funding by the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). The upcoming Preparatory Action for CSDP-related research, to be launched in 2017, as well as the planned future European Defence Research Programme will open many interesting R&T opportunities, also for Romania, it was stressed at the meeting. Mr Domecq commended Minister Motoc for Romania\u2019s overall support to EDA and encouraged further engagement in the Agency\u2019s work in the future. \u201cIn the light of Romania's 10 year development plan in which it committed to devote 2% of GDP for defence expenditure, EDA is ready to provide all the necessary support as effectively and efficiently as possible, making use of opportunities for cooperation and the EU tools available in support of defence\u201d, Mr Domecq stated. Tailored approach for CEE countries Mr Domecq recalled that EDA takes into account the \u2018diversity\u2019 of the European Defence Industrial and Technological Base and that it supports the Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries in the same way as it does the V4 or LoI countries. Based on a specific CEE study which was commissioned by the EDA in 2015, the Agency is currently exploring a number of recommendations for providing more tailored expertise and support to CEE MoDs and industry, especially on defence industry policy and collaborative programmes. As part of this effort, one idea is to try to identify a pilot collaborative programme which could be undertaken by interested CEE countries, enhancing interoperability among them. CEE countries are currently being consulted on these ideas. Mr Domecq encouraged Romania to participate and to take the lead in some areas.

Poland broke the first ground with two national Personnel Recovery (PR) courses, one in May and the most recent one from 12-23 September at the National Defence University in Rembert\u00f3w in which the PR FAS ATD was successfully deployed and used. Organised on a regular basis by the Personnel Recovery Branch of the Polish Armed Forces Operational Command (AFOC), these courses aim at familiarising Polish military staff with PR. More than 60 students were trained on how to collect information and plan the recovery of isolated personnel in challenging and realistic scenarios. EDA facilitated the on-site training of users and provided information and technical support. The demonstrator almost completely replaced the usual \u2018table-top\u2019 exercise. \u00a0 Easy to handle After the courses, students agreed that the demonstrator was easy to use and intuitive. They especially praised its accuracy and considered it an important step in the delivery of PR education and training. \u201cI believe that PR FAS ATD is a very handy tool for exercise purposes and I liked using it\u201d said Major Robert Kietli\u0144ski, one of the trainees. \u201cAlthough it is just a technical demonstrator, I can see its potential benefits for real-life missions\u201d. Lt. Col. Zbigniew Zblewski, the chief of the Polish Armed Forces Operational Command Personnel Recovery Branch, welcomed the new possibilities offered by the demonstrator as a \u201csignificant leap forward\u201d in PR training. According to him, \u201cit is time to use the demonstrator on a much wider scale and to introduce it to more students\u201d. \u201cEvery piece of available information that matters for PR is centralized in a single tool, everything is stored within the system which is very convenient for students and future controllers alike\u201d, he commented. The National Defense University in Rembert\u00f3w was also engaged in the project; its representatives noted that \u201cPR FAS ATD is an important step towards modernizing Personnel Recovery and unifying this field of knowledge within the Polish Armed Forces\u201d. Moreover, an evaluation of the course results showed that students with varying degrees of knowledge of PR consistently found the system to be user friendly and comprehensive; they also concluded that it had improved their knowledge of PR significantly. \u00a0 Demonstrator ready for other deployments PR FAS ATD is the latest operational output developed in the context of the EDA\u2019s Project Team Personnel Recovery. The tool supports planners and controllers with a number of functionalities and improved situational awareness. While it is usually possible to use the demonstrator through a standard PR FAS physical workstation, an internet-based (on-line) solution was chosen for the Polish course with the connection of six different computers each running an independent system. EDA has distributed the tool to all its participating Member States (pMS), the European Union Military Staff (EUMS) and the European Personnel Recovery Centre (EPRC). The Capability, Armament & Technology Director, Air Commodore Peter Round, underscored that\u201d the EDA is always ready to provide deployment support and training\u201d. The Agency is also working to address the various aspects of the through-life management of the tool to ensure its operational functionality in the long-term. \u201cAn important objective of the EDA is to support member states in the development of the capabilities required to effectively recover isolated personnel and save lives\u201d, Pete Round stated. \u00a0 More information: Polish MoD link to PR course EDA Personnel Recovery project page Hungary hosted EDA Personnel Recovery course (June 2016) \u00a0 ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/10/05/fit-for-purpose-eda-s-personnel-recovery-demonstrator-used-in-polish-courses"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0389", "date": "2016-10-03", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA Chief Executive visits Greece", "text": " On 30 September, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq visited Greece for meetings with the Hellenic Minister of Defence, Panos Kammenos, the National Defence General Staff Admiral Evangelos Apostolakis HN, and other senior officials in the Ministries of National Defence and of Foreign Affairs.

It is the first of 30 EDA supported projects to have fully completed the new \u2018Request for Projects (RfP)\u2019 procedure that EDA introduced in 2015 in order to maximise project chance to access ESIF. Under the previous procedure, two EDA supported research projects, one Portuguese and one Polish, were assessed by the competent ESIF Managing Authorities and both were successful already. This means that all three EDA supported dual-use R&T projects which have gone so far through the entire ESIF assessment process have been awarded funding \u2013 an exceptional 100% success rate! The latest successful Portuguese project called \u201cAdvanced Lightweight Impact Resistant Materials, Components and Structures\u201d (ALIR-MCS) aims at developing, within a 3-year timeframe, a new kind of composite material with high-impact resistance, for the production of components and structures. The objective is to make sure the new material can have both civilian applications (especially in the aeronautical sector) and defence applications, mainly in bulletproof equipment. Of the total required investment (\u20ac 1.21 million), ESIF will fund \u20ac 0.83 million (69%). Project leader is X AERO SYSTEMS, S.A., a Portuguese SME based in Vila Nova de Gaia, a municipality near Porto. The consortium is composed by a wide variety of stakeholders: INEGI- Institute of Science and Innovation in Mechanical and Industrial Engineering (a Research Centre), Critical Materials (another SME), the University of Aveiro as well as the Portuguese Ministry of Defence (Estado Maior Do Ex\u00e9rcito). Under EDA supported R&T projects, this is the first time that an MoD is directly funded by ESIF. Since 2013, EDA has been providing technical assistance in order to improve the ESIF eligibility of dual-use R&T projects. The Portuguese ALIR-MCS project, which has now been granted funding, was first selected by EDA within the EDA\u2019s \u2018ESIF RfP\u2019 process; it then received technical assistance to enhance and finalize its ESIF application, which proved to be successful. EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq welcomed the third successful ESIF application in a row for EDA supported dual-use R&T projects. \u201cIt proves that with the right support and expertise of EDA, dual-use research projects, even proposed by small consortia led by SMEs, can access EU funding.

The contract kick-off meeting chaired by OCCAR and involving the three companies as well as the programme Participating States was held on 6 September 2016 at Airbus premises in Manching/Germany. The Definition Study Contract award marks the initial phase to deliver this important European capability. The MALE RPAS Programme will further develop and strengthen the European industrial expertise and skills in this essential technological area. OCCAR awarded the contract in the name of the four programme Participating States France, Germany, Italy and Spain. The three companies Airbus Defence and Space GmbH, Dassault Aviation and Leonardo S.p.a. are working together as co-contractors to perform the Definition Study. OCCAR and the European Defence Agency (EDA) will cooperate in respect of air traffic insertion of MALE RPAS and the potential participation of other states in future phases of the programme. \u201cThe EDA congratulates OCCAR, the four contributing Member States and the companies involved on this important step towards the development and delivery of a European MALE RPAS capability. This is a decisive step in the direction set by Heads of States and Government at the European Council in December 2013 to prepare the next generation of MALE RPAS in Europe. It is also a concrete example of the need to ensure the necessary European strategic autonomy as foreseen in the EU Global Strategy. The Agency will continue to support the programme building on the work already achieved\u201d, said Jorge Domecq, EDA Chief Executive. MALE RPAS will be a remotely piloted air system for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) missions.

To find out more about the strategy behind the transaction and its wider impact on the defence industry landscape, we spoke to St\u00e9phane Mayer, CEO of Nexter and co-CEO of the newly created KNDS. This interview appeared in the EDA's European Defence Matters magazine issue 11 Q.: Which were the main drivers behind the Nexter-KMW merger and the creation of KNDS (KMW + Nexter Defense Systems): synergy and cost-saving considerations or more long-term, strategic ambitions? St\u00e9phane Mayer: The strategic aim of the joint venture between Nexter and KMW is to create a European leader in land defence offering joint products that meet the operational needs of the French and German armies, and obviously those of other European and international forces. This will result in genuine convergence for users that often operate together in the same theatres. The success of our alliance will be boosted by two kinds of convergence between our Governments, which must not only define common requirements, but also adopt the same approach to export controls. Over the last few months, we have been developing synergies by gradually combining our efforts in several areas: sales, communication, purchasing, finance, products, engineering and production. We are aiming to both boost revenue and limit costs. The process does not involve any restructuring, because both Nexter and KMW are profitable companies with order books representing more than three years of business. Would you say that KNDS is the starting shot for a major consolidation process in the European land defence systems market to ensure Europeans remain competitive? \u00a0 When we announced our joint venture, we were the first, and the move came as a surprise to some. In Europe, our Governments need efficient and competitive products and are aiming for more inter-operability. On the worldwide market, the competition is extremely strong. A European consolidation process is an efficient way to achieve those objectives. Besides France and Germany, we are aiming to progressively expand our industrial footprint in other European countries to continue this strategic move. Some say KNDS could become the \u201cAirbus of the land systems sector\u201d. Is this your ambition and are you already looking for additional European partners to join the group? The joint venture between Nexter and KMW is the first step towards a strong, durable and independent European industry. Since we started the project, we have consistently stated our desire to drive European consolidation, partly through new industrial alliances. Today, we are laying the foundations of a new group, based on the excellent fit between Nexter and KMW's businesses and the expertise of two companies leading their national markets. In the future, we want to strengthen the group further by welcoming new partners that are an equally good fit and equally effective. I am very confident about this new phase of consolidation, although at the moment the priority remains setting up KNDS with Nexter and KMW. I would also like to take this opportunity to talk about European consolidation in another area, that of ammunitions. In 2014, Nexter acquired Mecar in Belgium and Simmel Difesa in Italy who joined our Nexter Munitions division, which is now Europe's third-largest munitions player. Combining these three companies has allowed us to generate multiple synergies in ammunitions, but more importantly to maintain a high level of quality in terms of precision, effectiveness and security. As a result, the KNDS group can rely on a solid munitions business. R&T is a domain where huge synergy effects can be expected from this merger. What do you hope to achieve in R&T together what was not possible alone and how do you see the future of R&T at EU level? KNDS will indeed lead to R&T synergies. Financing innovation is crucial for the success of our plans, since innovation will allow us to maintain a technological edge over our rivals by developing distinctive systems. Naturally, we will work to eliminate potential duplication of R&T within the new group. Moreover, we welcome the willingness of the Governments to support advanced technologies and R&T studies for the current and future systems. The single most important subject for us in terms of R&T and innovation is linked to the Franco-German initiative to jointly develop the technologies for the MGCS (Main Ground Combat System) and CIFS (Common Indirect Fire System). It seems that in a first phase, both companies involved in KNDS will keep their organisation, staff and even their own range of products. When do you foresee the first jointly developed and produced KNDS weapon systems - for instance a combat tank - to be on the market? For many years, we will have to keep large parts of our present organisations unchanged in order to deliver on our commitments to our customers and our existing partnerships and to remain able to support our products in service. However, we are already starting to identify synergies, to act jointly on several matters (sales, product policy, finance, purchasing, communication, etc.). We have also started to work together on future systems, including combat tanks and artillery systems. These programs will be managed, developed and produced by a shared organisation. Their calendars are mainly driven by the operational needs of our customers and the timeframe to achieve a common vision between the German, French and other European customers. In the Defence industry, this takes 5 to 10 years! 2016 has seen a lot of movement in CSDP (EUGS set to be followed by a sectoral defence strategy; launch of Pilot Project and preparation of the Preparatory Action on defence-related research) and more is expected in the coming months (European Defence Action Plan by the EC). How optimistic are you that all this will give a boost to the European defence industry in general, and to the land systems sector in particular? We can be optimistic, while remaining realistic. The land defence market is doing well internationally, and there are still many opportunities, particularly in Asia and the Middle East. However, it is an extremely competitive sector and every tender process requires increasingly large investments from the companies involved. In Europe in the last few years, Nexter and KMW have taken part in tender processes with products such as our 8x8 combat vehicles (VBCI and Boxer) and 155mm artillery systems (Caesar and PZH2000). We were not successful. Unfortunately in some cases buyers decided to purchase non-European equipment or untested equipment. Of course competitiveness is essential in order to meet the European market's needs. But there are also needs for greater European awareness regarding defence, and particularly land defence. Armies on the ground need to be much more integrated through common equipment, we need to maintain an independent EDTIB that maintains Europe's superiority in certain areas of excellence (protection, firepower, communication systems, etc.) and we need to maintain and develop a European industry that guarantees the sovereignty of EU states. On the other hand, there is also the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote and the prospect of the UK leaving the EU. How will all this impact European defence cooperation? The European defence project is vital and the many dramatic events we have seen in recent years are a reminder that we must not let down our guard on security and defence issues. We are therefore confident that the United Kingdom will remain a staunch ally and continue to develop a strong defence relationship with France. Nexter has a joint venture with BAE, CTA International, based in France. CTA International specialises in telescoped 40mm-calibre armament systems, and has developed a revolutionary new cannon. This 40mm cannon has been acquired by both the French and British armies as part of the Scorpion and Scout programmes, proving both the effectiveness of the weapons themselves and the wisdom of our Franco-British joint venture. Brexit is unlikely to have an impact on our projects. \u00a0 Biography St\u00e9phane Mayer joined the Airbus group (formerly EADS) in 2003 as Chairman and CEO of EADS Socata, an aviation component and aircraft manufacturer.

Speaking at an industrial event in Brussels Thursday night (22 September), Mr Domecq stressed that \u201cnever before over the last 10 years have we had such opportunity to relaunch the European defence project and provide it with renewed impetus and commitment\u201d.

Investing more in Research and Technologies (R&T) will be absolutely key, especially given that today\u2019s defence R&T expenditure is down to its lowest level since 2006. \u201cThe massive decline in budgetary terms of our defence R&T efforts is a matter of the highest concern. It is the capabilities of the future which are at stake here.

Although the bulk of the materiel used in such multinational operations is traditionally of military nature and therefore well-known to all of the participating troops, serious issues can arise from civilian, commercially available off-the-shelve electronic products and utensils which are increasingly used by the Armed Forces to complement their purely military toolbox. \u00a0 Such a patchwork of military, dual-use and civilian equipment used by troops from different Member States in a joint operation can entail considerable risks \u2013 from hampering the mission\u2019s effectiveness to putting at risk soldiers\u2019 lives. Against this background, one crucial question arises: How to make sure that different troops coming from different Armed Forces using different types of technical equipment can nevertheless work together efficiently and safely? Ensuring proper testing and evaluation of critical equipment - be it military or civilian - is part of the answer. \u00a0 Electromagnetic Effects (EME) That\u2019s why the European Defence Agency (EDA) has taken the initiative to promote more systematic technical testing of CSDP equipment by Member States\u2019 Test Centres and to set up an EU-wide Test and Evaluation Network, the Defence Test and Evaluation Base (DTEB). One of the areas where Testing & Evaluation (T&E) is particularly crucial is that of Electromagnetic Effects (EME). Indeed, it is not unusual that commercially acquired electronic devices used by Armed Forces generate adverse interferences with its own military equipment or with that used by partner troops in joint missions. Measures against such harmful and potentially dangerous electromagnetic effects can be seen in our daily experiences. For example, civil cell phones interfere with avionic devices; this is why sending functions of cell phones have to be switched off during flights. The damaging effects of electromagnetic interference pose unacceptable risks especially in military technologies; it is therefore necessary to control such interference and reduce the risks to acceptable levels by testing, evaluating and characterizing the threats. It is also important to\u00a0set appropriate and updated design standards for emission and susceptibility levels and to test the compliance with those standards. \u00a0 EME Networking in Europe In order to mitigate the risks of fatal interference, several European nations have developed a network of military test centres, specialised in Electromagnetic Effects, which joined the EDA\u2019s Defence Test and Evaluation Base (DTEB) to examine, amongst others, the hazardous impact of civil equipment on military operations and vice versa. This EU Network of military EME Test Centres (ENTER) conducts joint tests, exchanges results and works on harmonized standards towards enhanced interoperability of multinational forces. Second round of tests to be launched in September After having carried out a first, more general inter-laboratory comparison test (so-called \u2018Round Robin Testing\u2019), the ENTER group has now decided to launch a follow-up test in autumn 2016 which will entirely focus on current and future Electromagnetic Effects (EME) concerns. The preparatory meeting for this test round will take place end of September at the EDA in Brussels. National test centres from six EDA member States (Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Spain \u2013 the lead nation) will participate in this joint test event. The objective is to evaluate a series of test methods and procedures in order to verify their accuracy and comparability. This is of great importance to national test centres because if it can be concluded that different methods and procedures applied by Member States\u2019 testers are of identical quality and that they lead to the same results, then it will possible for national test centres to mutually recognize their test results - which means substantial savings of time and resources. At this stage, ENTER is made up of the national test centres of the six afore-mentioned EDA members but the objective is to continuously expand the group. \u201cImportant to share experiences and qualification methods\u201d Major Dr Ir Thierry Gilles, is an expert on electromagnetic effects working in the Belgium Laboratory of Electro-Magnetic Applications (LEMA) which is located in the Brussels-based Royal Military Academy. LEMA is a member of ENTER. \u201cEven with a rather small test equipment, our laboratory can contribute to EME qualifications and tests because we are complementary to other EU test facilities in the EME Network. Our strength is for example the close relationship with research topics. This means that future developments can be taken into account for capability investments. This is a valuable contribution to the Network of EME T&E Centres\u201d, Mr Gilles states. \u201cFor example, deminers use firing devices which can be very sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances. Wireless devices are a cause for concern, in particular radio transmitters used in proximity of such life-critical devices. The risk of malfunction, such as a non-detection of a buried mine, or the premature explosion of the detonators must be evaluated\u201d, he stressed. The importance of sharing test results and qualification methods among European Armed Forces is obvious. \u201cIt is very important for us to share those kind of experiences and qualification methods with other EU experts in the EME Network to optimise our qualification methods in an interoperable way\u201d, says Mr Gilles. Thomas Honke, the EDA\u2019s Project Officer for Qualification Test and Evaluation, adds: \u201cThe example of electromagnetic effects is only one aspect in the large field of EU Test and Evaluation domains. Those kind of T&E collaborations in the defence sector will help to save lives, especially if shared test methods discover weaknesses of military equipment in a pan-European context. Based on exchanging this information in qualification, test and evaluation expertise networks, EU Member States can develop adequate countermeasures. This is the spirit of our EU Test and Evaluation Networking\u201d. \u00a0 More information: European Network on Electro Magnetic Effects Test & Evaluation capabilities Rationalization (ENTER) - EDA project page Defence Test and Evaluation Base (DTEB) portal EDSTAR portal ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/07/29/eda-prepares-inter-laboratory-test-round-to-counter-electromagnetic-effects-on-operations"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0403", "date": "2016-08-30", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "\u201cA corporate mind-set favourable to innovation is critical\u201d", "text": " How do key European defence companies approach and deal with the challenge of strategic innovation?\u00a0European Defence Matters, the EDA's official magazine,\u00a0spoke to Marwan Lahoud who is Executive Vice President International, Strategy and Public Affairs of Airbus Group. The article below appeared in the 10th edition of European Defence Matters, the EDA\u2019s official magazine, which you can read by clicking here. Mr Lahoud, which lessons could you share with your peers regarding the specific features of strategic innovation in the area of defence? European Defence Matters, Magazine issue 10 A genuine and sustained dialogue between the armed forces, defence procurement agencies and our engineers is essential to defence innovation. Our armed forces need to respond to new threats as they arise. Good defence innovation that is built around a genuine dialogue is more able to deliver the best and technologically superior equipment, much more cost effectively. In defence, strategic innovation does not derive from incremental improvements but from a game-changer, a disruptor or a breakthrough. As Aesop\u2019s fable \u201cThe Lion and the Mosquito\u201d shows, a strong defence posture constantly requires adaption to new threats. Even the mighty lion can be beaten by the tiny mosquito if it can be lured into the spider\u2019s web. That\u2019s where strategic innovation comes into play. If an adversary takes a decisive advantage on a niche technology that can inflict severe damage to its opponent - it could be game over. Robotisation, big data and artificial intelligence are now widely recognised as defence disruptors. At Airbus Group, we are dedicating substantial resources to the area of \u201cautonomy\u201d, including Unmanned Vehicle Systems (UVS). Autonomous systems can better protect soldiers\u2019 lives, ease decision-making on the ground and reduce the overall cost of operations. Our latest example is the Zephyr, a High Altitude Pseudo Satellite (HAPS). The Zephyr runs exclusively on solar power and is thus able to fly autonomously for month, offering new solutions in military intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. Beyond the demand from the armed forces, what are in your view the main drivers or blocking factors for strategic innovation? A corporate mind-set favourable to innovation is critical. To grasp strategic innovation, companies need swift decision-making, less-risk adverse behaviour, failure acceptance, and fast spiral development cycles. This is the recipe for strategic innovation. Many defence companies used to be like big ocean liners: slow to move ahead and slow to change trajectory. This is changing. Those who have not taken this seriously are bound to fail. On top of that, to be innovative, companies need to talk to the right guys outside the company. At Airbus Group we place a high priority on a continuous dialogue with SMEs, universities and research centers, partners and start-ups. We are maintaining an ecosystem that fosters and grows our innovation capabilities. This has led us to support centres like the Ludwig B\u00f6lkow Campus, right from the start. This Campus is an international hub for ground breaking innovations, new ways of thinking, and practical training in the aerospace industry. Located near Munich, which has one of the richest traditions of technology development in Germany, the campus is a place where science, education, and industry come together and take innovative ideas off the drawing board and turn them into real products. Defence innovation is also clearly shaped by regulation. Intellectual property rights (IPR) are a driver, and European defence companies are more likely to engage in innovation if they feel that they can retain IPR for future market advantage. I am convinced that European support to defence industries should take this point into consideration. The limited Research and Technology (R&T) budgets for defence clearly diminish the European potential of innovation in defence which is one of the reasons why Airbus Group seeks a close interaction between innovation in defence and in the commercial area. Our business model is based on the duality of civil and defence which allows us to pursue innovation to the largest extent possible. Government investment in defence and research does however remain extremely important in driving innovation. Considerable pressures of course remain on public expenditure, which is why we applaud efforts by EU Member States to substantially improve their defence budgets. As a minimum it is absolutely crucial that member states meet their commitment to the NATO Defence Investment Pledge (2% GDP on defence with 20% on research and innovation). Should European defence companies find new ways to promote innovation? How do you evaluate the business model and success of digital companies or actors such as SpaceX in this respect? Let\u2019s face it, Silicon Valley has been the source of major strategic innovations in the US for decades. Thanks to a strong initial push by the US Department of Defense (DOD), 15% of US patents are now produced in the valley but more importantly, major GAFAs-like companies were born there. SpaceX and Google have undoubtedly marked an evolution in the aerospace industry. With OneWeb, Google and Airbus Group (as industrial partners for the design and manufacturing of a new fleet of microsatellites) are entering the \u201cNewSpace\u201d. OneWeb is about providing cheap internet access worldwide, thanks to an initial production of 900 satellites, each weighing less than 150 kilogrammes, for launch into low Earth orbit beginning in 2018. This industrial partnership clearly unites two of the world\u2019s best players and I am sure this kind of joint effort will be replicated in other areas. SpaceX is also a case in point. This company has made great progress in the development of launchers and has capitalized on all possible drivers of innovation. But we cannot be na\u00efve about this new approach. Beyond all the merits of SpaceX we cannot ignore the massive public support it has received from billions of dollars injected by NASA. Which measures should be taken to halt the reduction in R&D spending? Are cooperative programmes one of the vital solutions? In tough economic times, cutting R&D spending is an easy solution. Yet, countries like France, and Germany have not fallen into this trap. This is a shrewd decision, which we both recognise and welcome. Hi-tech corporations recognise the importance of sustained research investment and even in difficult times, boards will do everything they can to protect this investment, not to do so can cut companies out of future markets for years to come. It is the same in defence, cutting research investment can allow adversaries the window they need to develop threat capabilities that we will not be able to match. Yet, European Member States\u2019 cumulative R&D efforts are still way too low. With around 170 million Euros invested in defence R&T across Europe, representing 8% of total R&T expenditure of the Member States, European collaborative defence R&T barely exists. More worrying is that over the last ten years, European defence investment in R&D has declined by 30%. To the contrary, the US spent an average of \u20ac9 billion per year on defence R&T (i.e. four times European Member States spending combined) and an average of\u20ac 54.6 billion per year on R&D during the period 2006-2011. Thanks to its \u2018Defense Innovation Strategy\u2019 (DII), more commonly referred as the \u2018Third Offset Strategy\u2019 (3OS) this effort will even keep increasing. For the fiscal year 2017, the US Defense Secretary has announced that \u20ac67 billion will be requested in defence R&D appropriations. The Russian defence R&D budget has also doubled between 2012 and 2015 while think tanks estimate that the Chinese defence research budget will surpass the US by 2022. Against this background, the establishment of the EU\u2019s preparatory Action on defence research and its subsequent larger programme post 2021 is more than a laudable effort. It is the right move even if we regret that it may take some time to happen. I expect this action to be translated into concrete collaborative, innovative programs, meeting the current and future needs of our armed forces. As an example, VTOL RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aerial Systems) could be a potential solution for a wide range of future military applications, including surveillance missions in the maritime environment, operation from naval platforms, or land operations. I am sure that the EDA is fully aware of the importance of the preparatory action and will play a crucial role in making this endeavour a success.

The consequences are fatigue, corrosion, plastic deformation, erosion and other effects which harm the equipment and increase vulnerability in operations. On 15 June 2016, 31 experts from various European Ministries of Defence, Armed Forces, European institutions, industry and academia participated in an EDA seminar to address the effects hostile environments have on materials. High-level experts on materials and defence technologies gathered to discuss the effects of hostile environments on materials as well as possible solutions to mitigate these effects. In order to understand the importance of these issues, background information was provided on operational problems caused by material degradation and on current research work in this area carried out at EU level. The discussion focused on identifying the main effects suffered by materials used in military systems and platforms, the preventive technologies which could address them and the actions needed to reach the right Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) for the operational use of these technologies. Participants also addressed the challenges and the way ahead in view of raising awareness and sharing data. The main outcome of the seminar was the identification of promising solutions such as coatings, structural health monitoring, smart materials, additive manufacturing and nanotechnology fabrication methods. However, industry requires understanding of operational military needs, calling for a larger participation of end-users in knowledge-building activities. Also, the specification of environmental properties of materials was viewed as necessary for guiding the production and design of future materials. More cooperation between defence structures, industry and academia, coupled with appropriate financial resources were considered key elements for the advancement of research work in this area. The seminar was co-organized by the EDA\u2019s CapTech on Materials & Structures, the Ministry of Defence Portugal, the International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory (INL) and the University of Beira Interior (UBI). \u00a0 More information: For further information, please contact: CapTech.Materials@eda.europa.eu EDA brochure: European Defence Agency Role in Research & Technology - Towards Enhanced European Future Military Capabilities EDA Defence Research & Technology conference report available now (news published on 19 May 2016) \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/07/05/eda-seminar-on-the-effects-of-hostile-environments-on-materials"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0407", "date": "2016-07-04", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "First deployment of the Joint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory (JDEAL)", "text": " Elements of the Joint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory (JDEAL), which was developed by 13 participating countries under the auspices of the European Defence Agency (EDA), have been deployed away from its headquarters in Soesterberg (The Netherlands) for the first time.

Both organisations perform complementary roles and activities in the space-based earth observation domain and more generally in the space and security sector. Whereas the EDA\u2019s work is focused on the harmonisation of requirements and the promotion of appropriate schemes for future capability development, SATCEN\u2019s activity supports the decision making and actions of the EU by providing products and services resulting from the exploitation of space assets in particular in the CSDP field. Since 2004, EDA and SATCEN have collaborated on projects as important as GISMO (Geospatial Information to Support Decision Making in Operations) and GISMO 2, SULTAN (Persistent Surveillance Long Term Analysis) and REACT. With today\u2019s exchange of letters, the EDA and SATCEN establish a more structured cooperation meaning that they will even more focus on activities of mutual interest, such as studies, workshops, projects and programmes. The new enhanced relationship will also see the nomination of Points of Contact on both sides to facilitate communication and cooperation. Jorge Domecq, the EDA Chief Executive, hailed the exchange of letters as an important step and said he was \u201cconfident that, through our cooperation, EDA and SATCEN can bring a significant added value to their respective Member States by reducing administrative burden, facilitating common action where possible, supporting better planning, as well as contributing to the best use of our respective resources\u201d. Specific cooperation areas and joint roadmap EDA and SATCEN have also identified specific cooperation areas such as imagery exploitation, geospatial analysis and applications, future space-based earth observation systems, cyber defence, Big Data exploitation in the space and security domain, space situational awareness or maritime surveillance.

Deployment capabilities are crucial for any mission/operation because they have to enable the effective, timely, safe and integrated transportation of military troops and assets. Because of its multi-dimensional nature (land, sea, air), deploy is characterized by extremely high operational costs, long lasting administrative procedures and vulnerability of transport assets. These elements pose enormous challenges to Member States in their efforts to provide contributions for CSDP operations; the need for coordinated movement and transportation plans and optimization of transportation resources is thus of paramount importance. \u00a0Recent CSDP operations have demonstrated that the lack of an adequate level of deploy capabilities may seriously endanger not only the setting up but also the execution of the operation, including the re-deployment phases. Jorge Domecq, the EDA\u2019s Chief Executive, opened the symposium on Tuesday by recalling that deployability is a priority action in the Agency\u2019s Capability Development Plan (CDP) and that several projects designed to enhance Member States\u2019 capabilities are underway, including the European Air Transport Fleet programme as well as other projects related, for instance, to the setting up of EU multimodal transport hubs and multinational modular medical units or the sharing of spare parts. Nevertheless, more needs to be done to further foster Europe\u2019s deployment capabilities, Mr Domecq underlined. \u201cThey must be recognised and supported by an appropriate level of resource planning and strong political backing\u201d, he said. \u00a0Mr Domecq called on Member States to show \u201ccommitment to working together, to identifying new opportunities for pooling and sharing and to bringing added value in terms of operational effectiveness, cost reduction and long term availability of assets\u201d. \u00a0\u00a0 Consultation forum and EU deployment strategy The EDA Chief Executive also urged EU decision-makers to consider the idea of establishing a regular consultation forum to discuss and shape a pragmatic and sustainable EU strategy on deploy capabilities for CSDP. \u201cSuch a high-level consultation forum, as well as a consolidated strategy for deploy capabilities, are still missing\u201d, Mr Domecq regretted. Deployment cooperation with NATO has progressed in the last few months, he said, adding: \u201cI remain determined to develop this collaboration further, with the aim of exploring possible synergies and complementarity in order to avoid unnecessary duplication whilst optimizing the best use of scarce resources. A stronger Europe makes for a stronger and more credible NATO. This also applies equally to deployability\u201d. \u00a0 Deployment capabilities are \u201cessential\u201d for implementing EU Global Strategy In his welcome address, Major General Eric Schevenhoven of The Netherlands said that deployment, i.e. the ability to get military capabilities to where they are needed, was an \u201cessential element\u201d for the implementation of the upcoming EU Global Strategy. \u201cAs we speak, the new EU Global Strategy is nearing completion. After that, the follow-on discussion will start on how to implement the strategy.

The course was delivered by experienced instructors from Canada, France, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden. The course enabled students to be better prepared to plan and execute Personnel Recovery (PR) missions. Personnel Recovery is usually defined as the sum of diplomatic, military and civil efforts to effect the recovery and reintegration of isolated personnel.\u00a0 From feedback we know that all participants gained expertise and knowledge from this multi-national training opportunity. As a result, European PR capabilities were strengthened and the number of trained personnel available to support future operations and missions was boosted.\u00a0 During the course, the EDA\u2019s Personnel Recovery Functional Area Service Advanced Technology Demonstrator (PR FAS ATD) was presented to the participants. This system is designed to provide headquarters-level PR staff with a planning tool to manage PR missions. It has been developed as part of EDA\u2019s work to improve interoperability between European armed forces in this field.

In concrete terms, this allows the Mission to benefit from a strategic satellite link between Mali and Europe. The services provided by Airbus Defence and Space include the rental, shipping, and installation of a C-band remote satellite communications terminal in Bamako, high data rate satellite bandwidth and anchoring in Europe. The services also include training of Mission personnel, 24/7 technical support and on site-intervention if required. In addition, the Mission is also provided with mobile satellite services to include e.g. a number of satellite phone subscriptions to cover the communication needs for Mission personnel moving around in the country. EDA\u2019s Chief Executive, Jorge Domecq, welcomed this first use of EDA EU SatCom Market contract by a civilian CSDP Mission as \u201ca concrete example of how the European Defence Agency and CSDP civilian missions can develop cooperation to make best use of resources\u201d. Mr Domecq also said he was confident that other EU entities will make use of the extensive support the Agency can provide in this domain, thus further increasing the pooling effect and reducing costs for the benefit of all EU SatCom Market members. CSDP civilian Missions EUCAP SAHEL Niger and EUAM Ukraine have also ordered similar services to be provided in their theatres of operation. Fruitful cooperation The establishment of this satellite link is the result of extensive discussions to develop cooperation between the Agency and the relevant services in the European External Action Service (EEAS), especially the Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability (CPCC) directorate and the Service for Foreign Policy Instrument (FPI). The EEAS Civilian Operations Commander, Kenneth Deane, stated: \u201cI very much welcome the possibility offered to civilian CSDP Missions to make use of the services provided through the EU SatCom Market Project. I am confident this will ensure best value for money and effectively help deployment and development of the CSDP civilian Missions in line with the relevant conclusions of the European Council.\u201d The head of the EUCAP SAHEL Mali mission, Albrecht Conze (Germany), said he was \u201cvery happy about the fact that, thanks to the hard and dedicated work done by Mission CIS experts, the EDA and the contractor Airbus Defence & Space, the Mission now has a stable strategic SatCom link to Europe as well as all the other satellite communication services the mission needs.\u201d EUCAP SAHEL Mali The EUCAP SAHEL Mali civilian Mission, launched on 15 January 2015 at the invitation of the Malian government, is an important element of the regional approach taken in the European Union strategy for security and development in the Sahel. In addition to the action already taken in Mali by the EUTM Mission providing support to the Malian armed forces and by the European Union Delegation, and in connection with EUCAP SAHEL Niger, the EUCAP SAHEL Mali Mission is helping the Malian government with the reform of its internal security forces (ISF) to enable them to provide more security and justice for Malians. EUCAP Sahel Mali is dedicated to supporting the Malian authorities' commitment to restructuring their defence and security forces. EU SatCom Market Within the EU SatCom Market project, the EDA acts as the central purchasing body on behalf of the contributing members. It purchases the services from a commercial provider. The project uses a \u2018pay-per-use\u2019 model, so members do not have to contribute with regular fees; instead they only pay for what they order. Since May 2013, 38 orders have been passed for a total value of over \u20ac6.2 million with more orders planned. Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxemburg, Portugal, Romania, the United Kingdom, Serbia, the Athena Mechanism, EUCAP SAHEL Niger, EUCAP SAHEL Mali, EUAM Ukraine, EUCAP NESTOR in Somalia and EUMM Georgia are the 18 members of the project.

During this final coordination conference, discussions focused on logistics and planning arrangements. According to the information compiled during the meeting, more than 200 troops from 20 European and non-European countries, as well as some 700 Swedish troops will take part in BC16. The exercise plan is to evaluate the full C-IED concept from the first responders\u2019 perspective until delivery of C-IED related intelligence production, so as to tackle all the C-IED work strands. A large number of different C-IED enablers ranging from Military Search, Military Working Dogs, Explosives Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and Improvised Explosive Devices Disposal (IEDD), EOD divers, Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear and explosives (CBRNe) experts, Military Engineers and Weapon Intelligence Teams from Land, Maritime and Air domains will take part in the exercise. The Forces will be split up in different components such as Task Force C-IED, Brigade Level Staff, Training Teams, Observers and Lessons Learned among others. The scenario will see a large number of C-IED dedicated tasks being implemented in several locations in Sweden including maritime C-IED tasks at a naval base. The inclusion of the Joint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory (JDEAL) deployable capability (JDC) marks the first time the laboratory will deploy in its fully operational mode. Previously, the laboratory has been recently sent on a first expeditionary deployment to a Spanish exercise (Interdict 16). This time, more than 20 exploitation experts between lab members and observers will provide a 24/7 service. Major Lars Samuelsson (Swedish Armed Forces) pointed out the challenge of running such a complex and specific exercise (the only full C-IED dedicated exercise worldwide);he is expecting representatives from 20 different nationalities to attend. The first Bison Counter exercise took place in The Netherlands in 2013.

During a full week, participants went through complex mission planning exercises within a contested air and land scenario, led by the Chief Instructor, Sqn Ldr Mike Gallagher. Composite Air Operations are interrelated and/or limited in both time and space, where units differing in type and/or role are put under unified control to achieve a common objective. The need for organising the COMAO course arose from lessons identified during the previous Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course (HTIC) and Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP) exercise in Italy in 2015. \u00a0COMAO is a broad and complex subject and the number of military personnel with operational and training experience in this domain is shrinking across Europe. \u00a0This is especially pertinent to the rotary community which has limited access to existing organisations such as the Tactical Leadership Programme (TLP). \u00a0Additionally, bespoke courses in which complex helicopter operations are the main focus currently do actually not exist. The aim of the course at RAF Linton-on-Ouse was to increase participants\u2019 knowledge of COMAO planning, using the so-called 4T\u2019s (Task, Target, Threat and Tactics) process. \u00a0Equally important, the course allowed to create an environment in which numerous nations meet, work together and develop their capabilities while acquiring an in-depth knowledge and understanding of each other\u2019s platforms. The course was very well attended which is testimony for the high demand of COMAO planning trainings across Europe. \u00a0There were helicopter trainees from Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Hungary, Belgium and the UK. Tactics and weapons instructors were provided from Sweden, the Dutch Weapons School and the UK. \u00a0Vitally, the course was supported by 8 Sqn AWACS from RAF Waddington and 100 Sqn Hawks from RAF Leeming bringing with them a wealth of knowledge concerning Air Battle Space Management and a remarkable breadth of fast-jet capabilities. \u00a0The UK provided a Ground Liaison Officer with comprehensive intelligence support. \u00a0In total, the platforms present at the course included the AB212, AS532, Mi-17, CH-47, CH-53, A-109, AH-64, Navy Lynx, E3-D Sentry and the numerous fast-jet platforms represented by the 100 Sqn pilots. The course began with lectures and platform capability briefs and was followed by 3 days of scenarios with one mission being planned and briefed each day.\u00a0As the course was progressing, the missions increased in complexity, running from the start of hostilities and covert insertions for bridge demolition and distraction operations to troop reinforcements and Non-combatant Evacuation Operations (NEO). \u00a0The final event culminated in a complex night mission to arrest a High Value Target (HVT). \u00a0The threat level was raised each day; therefore the tactics to deal with those threats had to be reconsidered too before being implemented. The outcome of the course was praised as overwhelmingly positive by all the participants. \u00a0One of the key takeaways mentioned by them was that such courses need to be longer so that more time can be spent on the theoretical aspects and a deeper understanding of platform capabilities can be gained. \u00a0This recommendation will most likely be taken on board for the next edition, probably in 2017. \u00a0 More information: EDA Helicopter Initiative project page EDA Exercises and Training project page COLD BLADE Helicopter training 2016 (news, March 2016)\u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/06/16/eda-composite-air-operations-(comao)-planning-course-held-in-the-uk"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0424", "date": "2016-06-09", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Smart Blue Water Camps project launched", "text": " Acknowledging water as a critical resource throughout Europe, five EDA Member States \u2013 Greece, Cyprus, Spain, Portugal and Ireland - have recently committed to participating in a novel water management project which seeks to examine water management on defence lands from a hydro-informatics, conservation, sustainability and technological innovation point of view. The Smart Blue Water Camps (SBWC) project was proposed and developed by Greece who will lead it supported by the EDA. The project seeks to assess existing military water management systems and installations on European soil. For the first phase of the project, the five participating Member States will conduct analysis of the water infrastructure on a chosen military site in each Member State through a series of workshops in order to define the \u2018Smart Blue Water Camp Blueprint\u2019. Interventions will be identified and listed according to suitability, cost and impact on the \u2018Smart Blue Water Camp Blueprint\u2019. Phase 1 will take place over a ten month period. Thereafter, phase two of the project will involve implementation of the most suitable identified interventions. Water management Existing civil and military water management infrastructure is facing pressure due to climatic changes and limited new investment. There are two major trends developing in water management technology: \u2018smarter\u2019 and environmentally integrated infrastructure. Military installations are among the least acknowledged elements in water cycle management. Military camps have great potential for improvement due to their unique characteristics such as significant water and energy demands, significant drainage and wastewater flows, generally aging and inefficient infrastructures, in some cases a need for more autonomy from centralised water and energy systems and a transient population of end users, all of which have a detrimental impact on water management. The opportunities that are presented by military camps in terms of improved water management include: (1) space abundance for the deployment of water demand management technologies e.g. sustainable draining systems, rainwater harvesting & recycling systems, green roofs & walls, (2) similarity of military installations from an upscaling perspective and transferability of best practices and knowledge and (3) the long term commitment of military from a continuation perspective. Background The Smart Blue Water Camps project is launched within the EDA\u2019s energy and environment programme. Centred on four main themes: data collection and analysis, energy efficiency, alternative energy, and defence sustainability, the programme identifies and builds a portfolio of activity that spans the capability, armaments and research & technology perspectives with a view to sharing best practice and enabling collaborative activity wherever possible.

The NATO-EU Capability Group was established in May 2003 to address common capability shortfalls and to ensure the coherence and mutual reinforcement of NATO and EU capability development efforts. Jorge Domecq highlighted in his speech the partnership between the EU and NATO, \u201cTwenty two EU Members are Allies. We need to ensure that the differences in membership do not become more significant than the similarities. There is a need to continue our close dialogue to ensure complementarity of work. Due to our single set of forces, we cannot afford unnecessary duplication \u2013 especially in the field of programmes.\u201d Mr Domecq furthermore stressed the significant strategic overlap between the two organisations, especially regarding crisis management, conflict prevention and peacekeeping. However, while complementarity was important, the EU needed sufficient freedom of action in defence. \u201cThat is why EU Member States should support initiatives in EDA to support the development of capabilities to face the whole spectrum of challenges we face in the changing security environment, including the protection of EU citizens.\u201d \u00a0 General Mercier stressed in his intervention that cooperation between NATO and the EU was \"no longer a question of choice, but a question of will\", and continued, \"I believe we have no other choice but to leverage the competencies of each organisation and make the most of limited resources.\" Regarding cooperation with the EDA, General Mercier noted that closer collaboration could bring tangible proposals: \"I can assure you that ACT and EDA have already started working together and intend to deliver practical areas of cooperation in the coming months.\" General Mercier concluded his intervention considering \"The collaboration of our two entities could also help synchronise national innovation efforts, including those developed in the United States, in order to keep the highest level of interoperability in the future.\" \u00a0 More information: SEDE website EDA CE Intervention to SEDE - 16 June 2016 ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/06/17/nato-and-eu-complementarity-and-collaboration-in-capability-development"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0426", "date": "2016-06-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Second meeting of the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in Defence opens in Dublin", "text": " After a successful first meeting in Brussels in January this year of the two-year Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence &Security Sector, the second meeting kicked-off today in Dublin, Ireland.

This is the first time to have a decade\u2019s perspective on the European defence spending, starting with 2005 data gathered through the pilot defence data exercise. From 2005 to 2015, although in nominal terms defence expenditure increased by 3.6% from EUR 193 billion to EUR 200 billion, in real terms there was a 10.7% or EUR 22 billion decrease. Counting from the peak of expenditure reached in 2007 with the EDA Member States collectively spending EUR 204 billion on defence to the lowest point of EUR 190 billion in 2013, total defence spending reduced by 6.8% (EUR 14 billion) in nominal terms or by nearly 12% (EUR 24 billion) in real terms. The share of defence expenditure in GDP4 and in total government spending being as high as 1.81% and 3.86% in 2005, has been steadily decreasing since then, and in 2015, it is estimated to have dropped to the lowest recorded level of 1.40% and 2.95%, respectively. \u00a0 Operation and maintenance expenditure further increased, while investment further decreased As regards defence expenditure structure, the year 2014 further highlighted the trend that began to emerge back in 2011, namely that of increasing expenditure on operation and maintenance and decreasing investment. Operation and maintenance - the second largest component of total defence spend with the average share of 23% \u2013 appears to be on an upward trajectory as of 2011. During the years 2011 to 2013, it grew at an average annual rate of 2.3%, and in 2014, it jumped by 11.7% (9.8% real increase) to EUR 52.2 billion, the highest absolute and relative (26.8% of total expenditure) value since 2006. Overall, operation and maintenance expenditure increased in real terms by EUR 4.6 billion or 10.3% from 2006 to 2014. By contrast, defence investment, comprising equipment procurement and R&D (including R&T), continues to decline \u2013 a trend that started with a sharp 11.6% real decrease in 2011 and was reinforced with another significant real fall of 9.1% in 2014. Given a relatively small volume of R&D expenditure, this result was largely driven by another component of investment \u2013 equipment procurement \u2013 which in 2014 dropped by EUR 4.3 billion or 15.0%, compared to the previous year, the largest real decrease since 2006. R&D expenditure that has been declining as well, appears to be on an upward trend since 2012. In 2013, it achieved a 1.5% increase, and in 2014, it jumped by another 16.0% to EUR 8.8 billion, the biggest nominal increase observed so far. A real increase was slightly smaller, 0.8% in 2013 and 14.1% in 2014. From 2006 to 2014, R&D expenditure decreased by almost EUR 2 billion or 18.5% in real terms. The share of investment in total defence expenditure, traditionally accounting for around 20%, shrank in 2014 by almost two percentage points to 17.8%. Within the investment category, the share of equipment procurement, amounting to around 16% on average, reduced by over two percentage points to 13.3%, while the share of R&D increased by 0.5 percentage points to 4.5% between 2013 and 2014. On average, R&D share in total investment stood at around 4.3% between 2006 and 2014, with the highest value of 4.9% reached in 2006, and the lowest \u2013 3.9% \u2013 in 2012. Personnel expenditure remains the largest component accounting for slightly above half \u2013 51.2% \u2013 of total defence spend. Despite decreasing personnel numbers, personnel expenditure increased in some countries. At the aggregate EDA level, personnel expenditure has been gradually decreasing since 2006, but in 2014, it increased by 4.1% (2.4% real increase) to EUR 99.8 billion. During the entire period from 2006 to 2014, Member States\u2019 real expenses dedicated to personnel reduced by over EUR 19 billion or almost 17%. \u00a0 Defence R&T expenditure at its lowest level A slight increase (+3.2%) in R&T expenditure achieved in 2013, was lost the year after, as R&T spending dropped by 4.6% (-6.1% in real terms) back to 2012 level of EUR 2.0 billion, the lowest since 2006. R&T expenditure was highest in 2006 amounting to EUR 2.7 billion \u2013 the expected response to the ambitious goal set by the EU leaders at the Hampton Court summit in 2005 to achieve a paradigm shift in defence R&T by spending more and spending more together. However, it has been gradually decreasing since then, despite the repeated urge to invest in defence R&T now to have effective and credible defence capabilities in the future. A real-term decrease in R&T expenditure was rather dramatic, amounting to nearly EUR 1 billion or 32% from 2006 to 2014. The share of R&T in total defence spend has been gradually shrinking as well, from the biggest of 1.32% in 2006, to the smallest of 1.02% in 2014. \u00a0 Collaboration increased in equipment procurement and European defence R&T5 Since 2012, it has not been possible to have a comprehensive picture of the total Member States\u2019 expenditure on collaborative (including European collaboration) defence equipment procurement and R&T projects and programmes, as several Member States were not in a position to provide this data. Nevertheless, although incomplete, 2014 data suggests slight improvements on three out of four collaborative expenditure categories, namely collaborative and European collaborative defence equipment procurement and European collaborative defence R&T. Collaborative defence equipment procurement of the reporting EDA Member States increased by almost EUR 1 billion or 20.5%, compared to 2013, to EUR 5.7 billion. The share of European collaboration within this category increased in absolute terms \u2013 from EUR 4.5 billion to EUR 5.1 billion \u2013 but decreased in relative terms \u2013 from 94.6% to 89.8% of total collaborative procurement \u2013 during the same period. In relation to total defence equipment procurement expenditure, the share of collaborative equipment procurement increased from 15.9% to 22.1%, suggesting that the remaining 77.9% were directed to non-collaborative procurements. The share of European collaborative equipment procurement in total defence equipment procurement grew from 15.0% to 19.9%, an achievement of almost five percentage points with respect to the corresponding benchmark. As regards R&T, total collaborative defence R&T expenditure of the reporting Member States decreased by EUR 18.6 million or 9.2% to EUR 185 million from 2013 to 2014, while European collaboration part within this category increased in both absolute \u2013 from EUR 168 million to EUR 172 million \u2013 and relative \u2013 from 82.5% to 93.3% of total collaborative R&T \u2013 terms. In relation to total defence R&T, the share of collaborative R&T decreased from 9.7% to 9.3%, indicating that 90.7% were non-collaborative expenditure. Meanwhile, the share of European collaborative R&T in total defence R&T increased from 8.0% to 8.6% during the same period, signalling a minor progress in terms of the respective benchmark. \u00a0 Defence personnel decline slowed down Since 2006, defence personnel (military and civilian) has been steadily declining, mainly due to internal restructuring processes. Between 2008 and 2011, this was more evident (-4.9% annual average decrease), possibly due to unfavourable economic conditions. Thereafter personnel numbers continued to fall, thought at a slower pace, a rate of -1.7% per year on average. From 2013 to 2014, total civilian personnel reduced by almost 2% to 400,000, whereas military personnel - by half that (almost 1%) to 1,423,000. During the entire period from 2006 to 2014, total defence personnel shrank by almost 500,000 or 21.4%, where civilian personnel decreased by almost 85,000 or 17.5%, and military personnel \u2013 by almost 411,000 or 22.4%. As total military personnel decreased, so did the numbers in each military personnel breakdown category. During the 2006-2014 period, Army reduced by 209,000 or 22.5% to 720,000, Maritime \u2013 by 36,000 or 16.0% to 191,000, Air Force \u2013 by 96,000 or 28.4% to 241,000, and military personnel not assigned to any of the above categories and nominated as \u201cOther\u201d \u2013 by 72,000 or 21.3% to 268,000. In relative terms, the shares of military personnel categories remained to a greater or lesser extent stable, with Army accounting for 52%, Maritime \u2013 for 13%, Air Force \u2013 for 18%, and Other \u2013 for 17% of the total military personnel, on average. Investment (equipment procurement and R&D) per military has been increasing since 2006 (except in 2011) \u2013 a growth caused more by decreasing military personnel numbers, than increasing Member States\u2019 investment \u2013 but the last two years witnessed a decline resulting from faster diminishing overall investment. In 2014, investment per military stood at around EUR 24,000, a 6.8% reduction on the 2013 figure of EUR 26,000. \u00a0 Deployment figures noticeably decreased The average number of troops deployed outside the European Union territory decreased by almost 46%, from 58,000 in 2013 to 32,000 in 2014, mainly due to disbanded ISAF6 \u00a0security mission at the end of 2014 and withdrawal of participating Member States\u2019 troops from Afghanistan. In relation to the overall strength of the 27 Member States\u2019 military personnel, the share of deployed troops almost halved, from 4.0% in 2013 to 2.2% in 2014. During the period from 2006, when deployment figures were the highest, to 2014, the average number of troops deployed decreased by over 62% in absolute terms, and from 4.6% to 2.2% in relation to the total military personnel. Total number of deployable (land) and sustainable (land) forces also decreased between 2013 and 2014 by over 13% and over 28%, respectively. In 2014, the 27 EDA Member States had in total 417,000 deployable (land) forces and 79,000 sustainable (land) forces, both numbers being the smallest since 2006. The ratio between the sustainable and a pool of deployable forces, which remained virtually stable during 2006-2013 at around 1:4, in 2014, equalled to 1:5. After a five-year-long upward trend, costs of deployed operations decreased for the third year in a row, both in absolute terms and as a share of total defence expenditure. It reduced by over 25%, from EUR 7.4 billion (3.9% of total expenditure) in 2013 to EUR 5.6 billion (2.9%) in 2014, the lowest value and share since 2006, which is again largely a result of withdrawing Member States\u2019 combat troops from Afghanistan. Operations costs per military deployed followed the same pattern in 2012 and 2013, but it increased in 2014 by almost 38% to EUR 176,000. This may signal that deployments become increasingly expensive, and, in the case of some Member States, can be explained by the fact that countries continue contributing to international operations financially, without sending actual troops. \u00a0 Slight progress recorded on two out of four collective benchmarks In 2007, EDA Member States agreed on a set of four collective benchmarks for investment. There is no obligation in terms of timelines or translation of these benchmarks into national targets. Since 2012, due to incomplete collaborative data it is no longer possible to accurately measure progress towards two out of the four agreed benchmarks, namely European collaborative equipment procurement as a percentage of total equipment procurement (benchmark 2: 35%) and European collaborative defence R&T as a percentage of total defence R&T (benchmark 4: 20%). Nevertheless, the partial data suggests a slight increase in European collaboration in both equipment procurement (from 15.0% in 2013 to 19.9% in 2014) and R&T (from 8.0% in 2013 to 8.6% in 2014) among those countries that reported the data. With regard to the benchmark 1 \u2013 defence equipment procurement and R&T (investment) as a percentage of total defence expenditure \u2013 the trend has been mixed. Since 2006, it has been slowly but steadily increasing, but after reaching its maximum of 21.9% in 2010, it appears to be on a decline. It stayed above the 20% benchmark from 2007 to 2012, except in 2011, but in 2014, it dropped to the lowest recorded level of 17.8%. As for the benchmark 3, defence R&T expenditure as a percentage of total defence expenditure has been steadily declining since 2006, except in 2011 and 2013, when it slightly increased. In 2014, it dropped to the lowest level so far of 1.02%, which is barely above half of the 2% benchmark. \u00a0 More information: Download the 2014 Defence Data booklet Footnotes 1. During the 2014 Defence Data gathering round, Member States were asked to provide not only the actual defence expenditure of the previous year (i.e. 2014), but also the estimated defence expenditure of the current year (i.e. 2015). At the aggregate level, however, these estimates are only available for total defence expenditure. At the same time, a major effort has been undertaken by EDA to revise all the previous years\u2019 data, including 2005 data collected as part of the pilot exercise, to ensure the best achievable data accuracy and comparability across Member States and over time. Consequentially, numerous figures have been revised. 2. Data in this publication do not include Denmark, which is not an EDA Member State. 2005 data do not include Bulgaria and Romania, which joined EDA in 2007. 2006\u20132012 data do not include Croatia, which joined EDA in 2013. 3. In order to measure real growth and ensure a \u201creal\u201d comparison over years, inflation needs to be taken into account. Thus, data from 2005 to 2015 has been adjusted to 2010 economic conditions (Source of deflator: European Commission, DG ECFIN, based on the weight of the EU-28). 4. As of 2014, reduced defence expenditure shares in relation to GDP in most Member States can partially be explained by the new GDP accounting methodology implemented by Eurostat, following the introduction of the new European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010). 5. All 2012-2014 figures on collaboration are partial, as several Member States were not in a position to provide the data. 6.

The meeting was followed by the first EDA Single European Sky Military Aviation Board (ESMAB) policy level meeting. The aim of this year\u2019s Forum was to share with a wider audience, in an informal setting, the main strategic issues with regard to Single European Sky. The meeting was chaired by General Fernando de la Cruz Caravaca of the Spanish Air Force. Mr. Umberto Rossi of the European Commission replacing Mr. Henrik Hololei, Director General Mobility and Transport, opened the discussion on the challenges and opportunities for civil-military cooperation deriving from the EU Aviation Strategy and civil rulemaking activities in the framework of Single European Sky. The Chairman of the EU Military Committee General Mikhail Kostarakos then provided the vision of the EU Chiefs of Defence on SES/SESAR in the wider context of military aviation. Finally, Vice Admiral Ignacio Horcada focused on NATO C2 needs in the wider context of Single European Sky. The discussion provided for relevant exchanges on innovative technologies to be considered in SESAR, taking into account global trends in civil and military aviation. \u201cThe SMIF is a key opportunity for European air forces to come to a common understanding of key priority areas of the Single European Sky. Today also underlined the importance of a broad consultation and coordination between the European and Allied defence community as well as civil aviation. The SMIF reconfirms EDA\u2019s commitment to the three-step consultation process with EUROCONTROL and NATO, to serve the need of Member States\u201d, said Jorge Domecq. The first EDA Single European Sky Military Aviation Board (ESMAB) policy level meeting then brought together representatives from the participating Member States, as well as Denmark, Norway and Switzerland, and a representative from EUMC.

Through its dedicated \u201cProject Team Personnel Recovery\u201d, the European Defence Agency (EDA) actively supports its participating Member States to enhance Personnel Recovery capabilities and improve interoperability - with tangible results. \u00a0 The article below appeared in the 10th edition of European Defence Matters, the EDA\u2019s official magazine, which you can read by clicking here. \u00a0 European Defence Matters, Magazine issue 10 Any Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) military operation or civilian mission carries the risk of deployed personnel being trapped, isolated, captured and/or maltreated by enemy forces. If it occurs, such an incident can have an adverse impact not only the operation\u2019s security but also the troops\u2019 morale as well as general public support. It is therefore imperative to ensure the effective and quick recovery and reintegration of isolated personnel. In this regard, all possible diplomatic, civil and military options should be combined and utilised. \u201cKeeping personnel recovery high on the EU\u2019s agenda conveys the right signal to our soldiers on the ground\u201d, EDA\u2019s Capability, Armament & Technology Director, Air Commodore Peter Round stressed. He further stated that \u201cIt is our responsibility to make sure that robust and effective personnel recovery capabilities and tools are in place and available, as an integral part of any deployment\u201d. Since 2007 EDA\u2019s Project Team Personnel Recovery (PT PR) has been working in support of its participating Member States (pMS) in order to enhance their Personnel Recovery (PR) capabilities and to effectively address these challenges. Under the German chairmanship and with the active participation of its 14 pMS, the PT has delivered tangible results and valuable studies. In its activities the PT is also supported by the European External Action Service\u2019s bodies; the European Union Military Staff and the Crisis Management and Planning Directorate as well as of the newly established European Personnel Recovery Centre (EPRC), a close partner of the Agency. As CSDP Crisis Management Operations (CMO) involve many different Member States, Third States and other partner Organisations there is a growing need for ensuring common PR principles, practices, standards and capabilities that are interoperable. As Major Constantinos Hadjisavvas, EDA\u2019s Project Officer on PR, underlines \u201cdeveloping a common personnel recovery culture supported by the relevant capabilities is vital in ensuring that an effective safety net is in place for those in need in the theatre of operations\u201d. \u00a0From conceptual framework to operational PR support Personnel recovery is a complex process involving five main tasks: reporting, locating, supporting, recovering, and reintegrating. The first task, reporting, includes the recognition and notification that personnel have or may have become isolated. This information can be generated by an accountability mechanism, visual sightings, intelligence, and reconnaissance or even through direct contact with the isolated personnel themselves. The second step, the locating task, includes actions to find and geo-locate the isolated personnel, immediately followed by the supporting task aimed at providing them with mental, physical and emotional support. It is only once these essential preparatory steps have been taken that the core part of any PR mission, the actual physical recovery, can be launched. PR operations are finally concluded with the reintegrating task of the recovered personnel through medical assessments and debriefings before returning them back to duty and/or their families. Situational awareness, information management, command and control aspects as well as appropriate capabilities are thus absolutely crucial for any successful PR operation. However, as Major Hadjisavvas stresses, \u201ceven with the most cutting-edge technology, personnel recovery cannot be successful unless you have trained and motivated personnel\u201d. Working on four different but interrelated work strands (Concept, Command & Control, Equipment and Training), the PT aims at addressing the full spectrum of PR; from the cultural and conceptual context through training aspects to the development of advanced technologies. \u00a0PR FAS ATD: an operational output of EDA PR provides the capability to safely recover isolated personnel. However, it was identified that an operational technical solution to plan, launch and monitor personnel recovery missions was missing. To close this critical gap, EDA has developed a conceptual framework which led to the successful development of the Personnel Recovery Functional Area Service Advanced Technology Demonstrator (PR FAS ATD), one of the most important operational outputs of PT PR so far. This ATD is an information management and Command & Control (C2) system designed to increase the efficiency of PR missions and operations. In fact, PR FAS ATD supports planners and controllers with numerous functionalities and a significantly improved situational awareness. The system is portable and works on a \u2018plug and play\u2019 basis, so it can be used by directly connecting to a number of laptops or integrating into existing networks in command posts or headquarters. Significantly, the ATD does not need any additional client software due to access via internet browser. This minimises the rollout effort and increases Information Technology (IT) security. The demonstrator was successfully evaluated and tested during multinational courses in 2015. In mid-2016, an important milestone was reached when PR FAS ATD was finally distributed to all pMS. They can now use the tool as a web based and stand-alone system during national or multinational trainings and exercises. \u00a0Deployment Support, Training, New Projects At this stage, the PR FAS ATD is still only a demonstrator, albeit an advanced demonstrator. In order to achieve operational capability additional organisational and technical measures have to be taken. Most important tasks include interfacing existing air command and control systems as well as the provision of service support. EDA is leading these tasks by providing deployment support to pMS, addressing the various aspects of the through-life management of the tool and ensuring its viability. Furthermore, the Personnel Recovery Controller and Planner Courses (PRCPC), run by the six contributing Member States (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, The Netherlands, Sweden) as an EDA project ensures that trained personnel are available to support any future PR activities under CSDP. Seven editions of PRCPCs have taken place so far, the most recent in April at the EPRC in Poggio Renatico Air Base (Italy). Additionally, by the end of 2016, pMS will also obtain a web-based e-learning tool for Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE), based on the existing Swedish e-training tool. The SERE project aims to provide pMS with PR training for their military personnel before being deployed. Instead of developing a new tool, EDA was authorised by the Swedish Armed Forces to translate the Swedish tool into English and disseminate it to all pMS. \u201cSERE is a model of how pooling & sharing of assets and best practices can save time, resources and money\u201d, Major Hadjisavvas explains. This tool could also be useful for the personnel deployed in the context of CSDP civilian or other humanitarian missions. Way Ahead The need for enhancing interoperability of European Armed Forces\u2019 PR capabilities will be further enhanced by the increasing multinational character of CSDP operations and the volatile environment that the EU is operating in. Topics currently under consideration in the EDA to further advance this important work includes among others, the contribution to the possible revision of the EU\u2019s conceptual framework for PR in support of CSDP and enhancing the PR efficiency with the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) support. Finally in November 2016 the Agency in cooperation with the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) will organise a PR Conference in order to enhance awareness of the importance of PR in saving lives and protecting the EU\u2019s reputation.

What achievements do you strive for during the EU Presidency? Defence cooperation is not the easy way but it is the only way, if we want to retain our military capabilities, especially the high end capabilities. Cooperation demands a continuous and active pursuit of possibilities for cooperation and requires a persistent and determined mindset to become successful. The Netherlands would like to lead by example when it comes to defence cooperation. There are several examples of successful cooperation initiatives, like the France-UK cooperation under the Lancaster House Treaties, the Visegrad 4, NorDefCo and the Baltic Defence Cooperation, but I still think that we need more and closer cooperation. We should go beyond the obvious cooperation areas such as training, logistics and education. Joint training is a good start, but we have to go further. We should use small scale cooperation that works and build on those. The defence cooperation between Germany and The Netherlands could be used as an example. We are integrating a German tank battalion into a Dutch mechanized brigade, which itself will become part of a German armoured Division. This allows us to maintain our ability to fight with and against tank units, since we no longer have that capability ourselves. Another example is the long standing maritime cooperation between Belgium and the Netherlands, which has been developed to a high level. The cooperation between the BENELUX-countries in protecting their airspace is another promising example. During our EU Presidency I try to promote all these types of European cooperation where I can. And let\u2019s not forget that these cooperation initiatives, be it for operational purposes or joint capability development, also need some kind of political framework and strategic guidance. This is why I attach so much value to the EU Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy which should be presented by HR/VP Mogherini in June. And I strongly believe that this new strategy should immediately be translated into actionable proposals to strengthen European defence cooperation. A \u2018White Book like document\u2019 should describe the CSDP-related tasks and means we need to execute the Global Strategy. It should give us a clear picture of which military capabilities we need the most and so guide our future cooperation efforts. \u00a0 You mentioned the follow-up document to the Global Strategy, a \u2018White Book like document\u2019 as you call it. In your view, what should be its main elements? We see the Global Strategy, a possible \u2018White Book like document\u2019 and finally the European Defence Action Plan as three closely related documents. Essential elements for a \u2018White Book like document\u2019 are a clear military level of ambition in line with the Strategy, a description on the capability shortfalls and a proposal for a follow-up mechanism to monitor the progress at the political level. \u00a0 The Netherlands are a forerunner in terms of defence cooperation. Your country has a history of successful cooperation with Belgium and Luxembourg for example. The latest example is the conclusion of far-reaching cooperation agreements with Germany. What are the lessons learnt? We have learned that for cooperation to be successful, partners should start as early as possible in the capability development process to identify shared interests. It is easier to find common ground when all options are still open. We have experienced that extending the scope of cooperation beyond the purchase of equipment into operations, maintenance and organization helps too. Requirements become more aligned and the relationship for the long term is bound to contribute to successful cooperation. Finally, it is important to have support at all levels. After all, it is a matter of commitment and trust. This is why the political level, the policy level and the executive level should all be involved. \u00a0 But you are also active in many multinational programmes through EDA. What type of cooperation do you think gets most out of taxpayers' money? As an ideal, the taxpayers\u2019 money would be best spent when a programme is aimed at addressing a shortfall at the European level, which corresponds to the national needs of a large number of Member States. A good example of such a combination of goals is the European Air Transport Command at Eindhoven. Furthermore, taxpayers are, in the long run, best served by a well-functioning European Defence market and a strong European industrial base which are not hampered by barriers. If the market functions well, we are more capable of developing innovative, high-end military capabilities in Europe. I think this would benefit the taxpayer, but more importantly, it benefits our armed forces. \u00a0 To what extent has the Dutch defence industry benefitted from the country\u2019s cooperative approach? The Dutch defence industry consists mostly of medium and small enterprises that offer high quality contributions to capability development. However, our cooperative approach does not automatically benefit our own national industry. We see that the defence industry in Europe is subject to national considerations. For SMEs especially, it therefore remains difficult to gain cross border access to defence and security contracts, even within the framework of cooperative programs. The result is that the competitive and innovative power of our European defence industry does not reach its full potential, something which we cannot afford if we really want to gain a degree of strategic autonomy in this market. \u00a0 If you look at the upcoming Preparatory Action on defence research and the Commission\u2019s Defence Action Plan: how do you see these two major initiatives develop? Will they be a game-changer for the sector? The Preparatory Action, as part of the European Commission Action Plan, will certainly be a game changer, if it succeeds in preparing the way for a dedicated European defence research programme. First of all, this initiative shows that the European Commission is involved and committed to strengthen European defence. Secondly, investing in R&T makes it more attractive for the defence industry to focus on non-dual use technology, being commercially less attractive, but essential nonetheless. Thirdly, the Preparatory Action and the subsequent dedicated research programme will serve as an incentive for joint capability development further down the line, when R&T efforts are used to develop real capabilities. \u00a0 Biography Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert is Minister of Defence in the Dutch government since November 2012.

European Defence Matters, Magazine issue 10 In times of ever faster technological change and constant emergence of new innovation and business models, the European defence sector has to adapt quickly if it wants to remain relevant. In 2016, more than ever, Europe needs to respond to short and longer-term security challenges both on its territory and beyond. The forthcoming EU Global Strategy will inevitably consider those developments, setting out European interests. Notably, for Europe\u2019s security and defence sector this means preparing for an age of relative uncertainty that is prone to strategic surprises: at the level of threats that have become increasingly diverse, hybrid and versatile; and at the level of emerging technologies that, beyond inducing new vulnerabilities, may well require the defence sector to adapt to changing innovation patterns, new mind-sets and corporate cultures. In this strategic context, an innovative and competitive European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) is a strategic asset that supports the implementation of a credible and effective EU Global Strategy. \u201cThe industrial and technological dimension is not a mere enabler, it is at the core of any security and defence-related capability\u201d, says Jorge Domecq, the Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency (EDA). This is why the so-called \u2018Key Strategic Activities\u2018, be they specific technologies, skills or industrial manufacturing capabilities, will also have to be supported at the EU level if Europe wants to retain the necessary freedom of action, be interoperable with key Allies, and participate in global standard setting. As early as 2003, the Thessaloniki European Council underlined that the EDA was to aim at \u201cpromoting, in liaison with the Community\u2019s research activities where appropriate, research aimed at leadership in strategic technologies for future defence and security capabilities, thereby strengthening Europe\u2019s industrial potential in this domain.\u201d Today, the question of how to achieve or safeguard leadership in strategic technologies is more pressing than ever. EDA has enabled close to \u20ac 700 million of investment in defence R&T projects, it has established synergies with the EU\u2019s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, and it has participated in the identification of critical defence technologies, key enabling technologies and space technologies for European non-dependence. And there is more to come: the preparation of the forthcoming Preparatory Action for CSDP-related research and potential defence research programme that may follow within the next EU budgetary cycle may signal a paradigm shift. EDA is playing its part by shaping the content, setting priorities and preparing for the implementation of future defence-related research at the EU level. The European Defence Action Plan announced by the European Commission for the end of 2016 provides a further opportunity to reflect on how Europe will capture future innovation and drive leap-ahead technologies rather than be taken by surprise by disruptive technologies emerging elsewhere. Changing innovation patterns? For Europe to successfully spearhead innovation, it has to deal with at least four accelerating trends: (i) global competition for the lead in technology; (ii) emerging knowledge domains and technology convergence; (iii) increasingly faster innovation loops; and (iv) the growing importance of private investment in support of innovation. Each of these factors taken alone may hardly seem revolutionary, yet any combination and convergence of them in a fast-paced environment may prove to be so. The defence industrial and technological base is indeed part of a wider industrial and technological \u2018ecosystem\u2019 that is about to change dramatically, and this may lead to the disruption and far-reaching adaptation of public policy and traditional business models and practices. What has been qualified as a possible \u2018third industrial revolution\u2018 by 2030 is characterised by an ever-accelerating speed of technological change and the \u2018digitalisation of world markets\u2019. The mastery, application and development of digital technologies and big data management will be a key ingredient of economic and industrial competitiveness. Already today US digital exports are estimated at \u20ac 500 billion a year, and Europe is the main customer. 4% of US GDP is estimated to be related to the Internet and associated business opportunities. Global revenues related to the \u2018Internet of things\u2018 (big data and data-mining, cloud computing and super computers) are estimated in the order of USD 14 trillion between 2013 to 2022. ICT technology in particular will help to catalyse innovative applications in the area of human/machines, human/human and machine/machine interfaces, in addition to the expected convergence of bio-, nano-, and information technologies, robotics, artificial intelligence, materials and energy over the 2025-2050 time horizon. New players are emerging Based on such convergence, disruptive applications are expected to emerge from highly innovative start-ups and fast growing players that are modelled on today\u2019s success of the so-called \u2018GAFA\u2018 (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon\u2026). These players will share important characteristics. R&T spending levels will be high (20% and more of annual turnover). They will embrace a risk culture and have access to venture capital. They will focus on prototyping, test and experiment with \u2018rapid prototyping\u2018, \u2018lean start-up\u2018, \u2018minimal viable products\u2018 and spiral development, all with reduced procurement cycles and manufacturing lead times. From Silicon Valley and \u2018Silicon Wadi\u2019 in Israel to Bangalore, \u201caccess to finance, R&D investment and flexible and fast development and production are the ingredients of ever-fiercer competition among global innovation centres\u201d, stresses Mr Domecq. The innovation models and philosophy of those commercial companies and start-ups has little in common with a highly regulated sector such as defence, which is characterized by the need for reliable, robust and complex systems, long-development cycles, public funding and a focus on quality control through customer engagement in design, production and servicing. Yet, it is with these emerging players that both governments and defence companies will have to interact to stay ahead. Beyond defence-specific R&T, there will be increasing spin-in from commercial technologies being developed by highly specialised SMEs or start-ups. Today, such companies may not even be thinking of interacting with the defence sector. Connected technologies will be among the most decisive factors in the development of security and defence-related technologies. \u201cRobotics, automation, supercomputing, synthetic biology, data analytics and deep learning will play a growing role\u201d, according to Michael Simm, EDA Project Officer. Private actors will bear important responsibilities as to cyber security. This also implies a new way of looking at how drones and robots are networked with the increased integration among human and technological factors. Keeping a highly competitive defence industrial base with highly skilled workers will be all the more crucial if innovation is to translate into cutting-edge defence capabilities. \u201cThe key challenge for defence will therefore be to find a modus vivendi with this \u2018new economy\u2018, and to effectively integrate future innovations into defence development and production cycles\u201d, Mr Simm states. It will be key for the defence sector to: (i) gain awareness of emerging leap-ahead technologies; (ii) effectively get access to non-traditional sources of innovation; and (iii) ensure the reliability of trusted supply chains. Overall, the challenge is for governments to be able to counter threats and increase society\u2019s resilience while ensuring that the defence technological and industrial base remains a smart integrator of highly innovative products and technologies. A matter of resources and prioritisation\u2026 Innovation does not come for free. The sharp drop in defence-related R&T in recent years puts Europe\u2019s standing at risk: the investment ratios in certain key domains such as electronic components being about 1:15 when compared to the US clearly endanger Europe\u2019s status as a \u2018smart follower\u2018. More investment, more cooperative investment and clear prioritisation in resource allocation are clear answers to that trend. Yet, more than today, an emphasis will also need to be put on \u2018whole-of-government approaches\u2018 and cross-sectorial technological and industrial strategies that strike the right balance and allow for a mutually beneficial relation between the defence and the civilian dimension. Some of the more recently published national defence-related strategy documents indicate a growing awareness and provide inspiration regarding the need for increased foresight activities and refined analysis of innovation cycles; the need to craft industrial policies that are supporting key areas of security of supply with regard to industrial manufacturing capabilities, skills and critical technologies; or the need to launch defence-related innovation initiatives. As the UK Strategic Defence & Security Review (2015) recognises: \u201c\u2026 to secure operational advantage and control our costs into the future, we need to recognise and respond quickly to transformative ideas and technologies. These will come from outside the traditional national security field, [\u2026] we must find, listen to and work effectively with new partners. We must test unconventional ideas rigorously against traditional ones, and be prepared to take risks [\u2026] we do not have all the answers, but continuing with our traditional mindset will not work\u201d. In the case of the UK, this assessment is supported by the creation of a national cross-government Emerging Technology and Innovation Analysis Cell and the establishment of a defence and security accelerator for government to help the private sector turn ideas into innovative equipment and services for national security users. Inn a similar fashion, the US Third Offset Strategy recognises that many of the technologies that are potential game changers are no longer in the domain of DoD development pipelines or traditional defence contractors. Indeed, the DoD risks no longer having exclusive access to neither the most cutting-edge technologies nor the ability to control the development of them. This insight has led US officials to seek proposals from the private sector, including from firms and academic institutions outside the DoD\u2019s traditional orbit. Robotics in particular is seen as an area where commercial investment outpaces military spending. The DoD\u2019s ability to rapidly scout for and import commercial sector innovations and quickly develop new concepts of operation and doctrine is seen to be key. Numerous partnerships between the commercial sector and the US military, research and innovation centres, intelligence and law enforcement agencies exist to date. The creation of a permanent DoD office - called \u2018Defence Innovation Unit X\u2018 - is part of this approach as is investment in promising technologies through a dedicated investment fund. Additionally, in March 2016 the US DoD announced the establishment of a Defense Innovation Advisory Board. The new board aims to enhance the DoD\u2019s culture, organisation and processes by tapping innovators from the private sector. DoD will also further implement its \u2018Better Buying Power Initiative\u2018 aiming, among others, at easing procurement procedures. \u2026 but even more of changing mindsets Yet innovation is not a mere matter of resources and stated policy objectives. It ultimately requires both the demand and supply side to have a capacity of early adoption of innovation. As far as the demand side is concerned, the new environment may have an impact on acquisition choices and investment decisions and the defence customer will have to adapt to much higher innovation rates and to potentially shorter life-cycles for equipment. The new environment may increase the need for plug-and-play systems, be a strain on obsolescence management or even change the type and way of procuring defence-related equipment and services. Modular Open System Architectures (MOSA) could be utilised to enable rapid incorporation of innovative upgrades throughout system lifecycles. A stronger focus on prototyping and experimentation may be a corollary to this approach. \u201cThe fact that innovation will increasingly flow from the civil to the defence sector does not mean that the defence sector should refrain from heavily investing in exploration, testing, adapting and integrating relevant innovations\u201d, insists Mr Domecq. Prototyping and experimentation can allow the defence sector to keep pace with technology, to partner with industry and maintain critical industrial capabilities. Such efforts would help contextualise current capabilities in light of requirements and technical feasibility of future acquisition programmes. An innovative and adaptive approach may also impact on wider operational concepts, interoperability with partners and standard-setting. \u201cUltimately, MoDs will have to constantly adapt their in-house skills base and working practices in order to interface with the commercial sector\u201d, explains Mr Simm. MoDs may also have to adapt procurement schemes (i.e. fast-track contracting vehicles), introduce more flexibility, shorten decision-making cycles and address certain perceived \u2018costs\u2018 (i.e. administrative burdens and IPR regimes), which may dissuade high-tech commercial firms from engaging with the defence sector. Regarding the supply side, the change may be less fundamental and rather signal an acceleration of a longer-term trend. For some time now, the most innovative components have been generated by SMEs. While traditional defence companies are likely to continue playing the role of intermediary towards governments, they will nevertheless increasingly rely on the ability to integrate technologies according to a non-linear open innovation model based on a combination of internal and external knowledge, iterative shorter innovation loops and adding reliability and resilience to commercial technologies. This will mean to increasingly monitor cross-domain technology development. The role of a firm\u2019s internal \u2018gatekeepers\u2018 or \u2018boundary spanners\u2018 able to understand and adapt technological innovation will rise. New partnerships, joint ventures For example, with the aim of capitalizing on transformative technologies and business models in the high-tech sector, a big European Group has followed US defence industrial players in establishing a \u2018Technology and Business Innovation Center\u2019 in Silicon Valley. In parallel, the company has established a venture capital fund worth an initial US $ 150 million in order to invest in promising, disruptive and innovative businesses generated around the globe. More widely, cooperation with non-traditional industrial players may take the form of partnering with high-tech companies in the ICT sector, joint business incubators or joint ventures according to the \u2018make, team or buy\u2018 paradigm. This may alter the very fabric of industry, leading to more complex supply chain management and, ultimately, requiring increased flexibility and fluid cooperation between primes, SMEs and entrepreneurs across sectors. At the same time, one may have to deal with some side-effects. Indeed, the defence industry could be facing additional pressures on prices and margins, unexpected forms of competition, plus a growing mismatch in skills. Overall, both the demand and supply side, will have to develop a whole new risk culture: on the one hand, taking on more risk through a steady investment in expensive but potentially game-changing technologies; on the other hand, ensuring reliance on fully trusted and secure supply chains up in the context of a globalised and digitalised economy. It may imply changes to how one conceives of dual-use export (and import) control and the protection of sensitive technologies. The predominance of non-European and commercial software companies, clouds and cyber networks that are supposed to generate, manage and control big data may actually increase the vulnerability of European digital networks. The globalisation of R&T and commercial innovation is within the reach of players who can transform them into military relevant capabilities. This risk needs to be counterbalanced by capability development focused on resilience such as \u2018rapid network recomposability\u2019 technologies or \u2018split fabrication\u2019 (i.e. ICT building blocks that are designed, developed, manufactured in Europe). This is all the more important in the context of heightened hybrid threats, which may target the wider defence supply chain e.g. in terms of hostile takeovers (foreign investment), saturation of production capacities or second-round effect industrial sabotage (compromising single components or production processes). Think big \u2013 act smart Some of the aforementioned trends will develop, others may not. Yet, by failing to prepare for a potentially game-changing (r)evolution, one may well be preparing to fail. \u201cWhen putting its Global Strategy into action, Europe requires a long-term vision and effective technological and industrial policy that supports its freedom of action\u201d, underlines Mr Domecq. As with any other player in the world, Europe needs to acknowledge its industrial base as a strategic and economic asset alike, a cornerstone for safeguarding its influence and interests. This also means injecting the \u2018whole-of-government\u2018 concept with real content, notably in support of guaranteed security of supply and autonomy in areas deemed critical. There is a need for systematic technology foresight, more dual-use innovation clusters and technology incubators and long-term spiral development programmes. As competition for and access to cutting-edge technologies will increasingly be done across globalised and non-defence specific supply chains, both the \u2018E\u2018 (European) and the \u2018D\u2018 (Defence) dimension of the EDTIB may increasingly vanish. \u201cThis raises an essential question: how does Europe want to ensure mastery over technologies that will be critical in the future? This is not a question of industrial competitiveness alone but of Europe remaining among the most capable defence players\u201d, insists Mr Domecq. EDA can contribute by raising awareness, being a platform for exchange and building concrete tools when it comes to identifying Key Strategic Activities to be supported by available European funding tools, supporting longer-term security of supply and European non-dependence. On-going work developed inside the EDA together with Member States on critical defence technologies, Technology Watch, strategic research agendas or key skills and competences contribute to this effort. The support provided to innovative dual-use SMEs in accessing European Structural and Investment Funds is a further key work strand. EDA can also further provide a platform for innovative industry to engage with defence stakeholders on concrete projects, to present ideas and to understand defence-specific requirements. In order to move to the next level, however, Member States should also make systematic use of the programmatic, financial and policy instruments offered by the EU. These instruments can support defence research, identify key enabling technologies and support their testing & experimentation in view of potential uptake in defence products. The forthcoming European Defence Action Plan should make a strong plea for a credible defence-related research programme within the next Multiannual Financial Framework. This should be further supported by a wider European Defence Innovation Initiative that facilitates the scouting of emerging technologies for defence, increases interaction between the defence community and commercial communities and promotes innovative SMEs. One will also have to move towards a careful mapping of critical and cross-sector supply chains. Increasing the resilience and security of related key technological and industrial assets that are considered as genuinely critical infrastructure may also be required. As the defence sector will have increasingly to interact with players, processes and innovation models outside the traditional remit of defence, it will be all the more important to mainstream the defence dimension across available industrial policy tools, be they at the national or EU level. 2016 should provide ample opportunity to move ahead in this direction.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/05/03/the-next-industrial-(r)evolution-what-implications-for-the-security-and-defence-sector"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0446", "date": "2016-04-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA Chief Executive completes US visit", "text": " On 29 April Jorge Domecq, the European Defence Agency\u2019s Chief Executive, participated in a CSDP symposium organised by the EU delegation in the US at the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) in Washington, where he spoke on the topic of \u201cTechnology, Capabilities and Readiness: The Way Forward\u201d.

Organised in cooperation with The Netherlands\u2019 Ministry of Defence, under the auspices of the current Netherlands EU Presidency, the conference saw some 150 participants discussing emerging and critical technologies, innovation in defence as well as strategic agenda setting for R&T in Europe. The event was opened on 25 April with key note speeches by The Netherlands\u2019 Vice Chief of Defence, Vice Admiral Rob Bauer, EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq, European Commission Deputy Director General Pierre Delsaux (DG GROW) and UK MoD R&T Director and current chairman of the EDA R&T Steering Board, Bryan Wells. Presentations and discussions then followed in three successive panels. Panel 1, \u201cFrom emerging to critical technologies\u201d, focused on a number of game-changing technologies, as well as on the question of how to find them. In panel 2 \u201cHow to innovate in defence?\u201d, participants looked at innovation from various angles. The third panel, \u201cDelivering Europe\u2019s defence research agenda for the future\u201d, was dedicated to the future agenda for R&T in Defence, building on the outcomes of the two previous panels. In his welcome remarks, EDA CE Jorge Domecq warned against the consequences of insufficient R&D investment and European cooperation in times of successive budget cuts. \u201cIn the longer term low R&T investment will lead to losing in Europe Defence and industrial capabilities. We can clearly not afford that risk\u201d, he said. Now that defence budgets in many Member States are beginning to increase again, there is a \u201cgolden opportunity not only to invest in the here-and-now but also in the capabilities we will need in the future\u201d, he said. Not only does Europe need to invest more in R&T \u201cbut it also needs to do so together, that is cooperatively\u201d. Mr Domecq reckoned the upcoming Preparatory Action on defence research and the potential follow-on programme \u201cwill create a \u2018game changer\u2019 \u2013 provided the budgets are significant\u201d. Domecq asked the question if we need to think about a European cooperation regarding technology watching and innovation on a low Technology Readiness Levels (TRL), in a structure he compared to DARPA. The Netherlands\u2019 Vice Chief of Defence, Vice Admiral Rob Bauer, also pleaded for investment in a \u201cEuropean agenda for collaborative R&T\u201d. \u201cCollaborative research leads to collaborative development of cutting-edge technologies. And this leads to less waste of both money and opportunities for collaborative procurement and more interoperability. This is why the Netherlands is in favour of a large comprehensive EU-funded defence research programme\u201d, he stated. European Commission Deputy DG Pierre Delsaux said the Commission\u2019s objective was to make sure the European defence technological and industrial base is \u201cbroad, robust, innovative and fit or purpose\u201d. If Europe does not invest in R&T, it won\u2019t be able to cope with the security and defence responsibilities it has, he warned. European defence players need to cooperate more: \u201cCompetition should not be between Member States but with the rest of the world\u201d, he said. UK MoD R&T Director Bryan Wells highlighted the change in defence innovation patterns as civil and commercial high tech players have now taken the lead in R&D, including in fields relevant for the military. The scale of civil R&T investment now dwarfs defence-specific research spending; this trend has already given rise to technology areas in which defence relies completely on civil developments. \u201cWe have to accept that we will no longer invent the scientific and technology futures \u2013 and we should expect to see truly disruptive innovations occurring in unexpected, unfamiliar places\u201d, he said. The three experts panels highlighted the great quality of technological developments in Europe and the impact of emerging technologies on Defence, the need for innovation, collaboration, the importance of the Preparatory Action and its potential follow on Defence research programme and the need for a comprehensive prioritization scheme taking into account the different governance models and funding schemes for Defence R&T in Europe. EDA Deputy Chief Executive Rini Goos closed the conference on 26 April by commending speakers and participants for their \u201cinspiring and active engagement\u201d. The event confirmed that defence-related R&T is important because it underpins the needed future capabilities, he said. \u201cBut to do so, it needs adequate funding\u201d, Mr Goos insisted.

The Polish project called \u201cIntruder Detection and Avoid System\u201d (IDAAS) aims at developing a sensor-based system helping to avoid collisions between general aviation and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV, or drones). It is the second dual-use research project co-funded under ESIF after a first successful pilot project in Portugal related to technologies for unmanned maritime systems (project TURTLE). Of the total required investment (\u20ac2.2 million), ESIF will fund \u20ac1.75 million (78,7%). Project holder is EUROTECH, an SME based in Mielec, a town in south-eastern Poland. IDAAS will integrate different types of independent measurement sensors (optoelectronic cameras working in visual range and infrared, acoustic microphones with a big sensitivity, laser scanner, radar) and a complex measurement and calculation module which will communicate directly with on-board or control systems. The fundamental advantage of IDAAS system will be its complete autonomy and independence from other devices and systems. Therefore it will be possible to use it as an independent or a supplementary anti-collision system. The IDAAS project was first selected within EDA\u2019s \u201c1st ESIF process\u201d, issued in December 2012 to obtain EDA technical assistance in finalizing the application dossier under the EU multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2007-2013.

The event was hosted for the second time by the European Personnel Recovery Centre (EPRC), a close partner of the Agency. All in all, 19 students from six Member States (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain) benefitted from the knowledge and experience of a cadre of instructors from Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The main focus of the course is to train staff officers in supporting their commanders in Personnel Recovery related issues. The course is designed for personnel who hold personnel recovery positions in tactical operation centres (TOCs), personnel recovery coordination cells (PRCCs) or joint personnel recovery cells (JPRCs). Most of all, the course aims at ensuring that sufficient trained personnel is available to support future PR activities. Personnel Recovery (PR) is a vital element of modern operational planning as it provides a security net for deployed personnel. Most importantly, it boosts morale and acknowledges national as well as European Union responsibilities to effect the recovery and reintegration of isolated personnel deployed in the context of Crisis Management Operations under the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). The next EU PRCPC will take place in Veszprem, Hungary from 30 May to 10 June 2016 and will be organised by the Hungarian Defence Forces. EPRC personnel will support this iteration with instructors. Background The EDA PRCPC project was established on 30 May 2013 as an EDA Category B project under the lead of Sweden. As of today, it includes six contributing EU Member States (cMS): Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands and Sweden. On 31 May 2015, the cMS agreed to extend the PRCPC Cat B project until 30 May 2017. The EPRC is a potential candidate for the continuation of the project. The EPRC closely cooperates with the European Defence Agency. It was created on 8 July 2015 by seven nations (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom) with the aim of improving the four phases of Personnel Recovery (Preparation, Planning, Execution and Adaptation) by developing/harmonising the Personnel Recovery Policy, Doctrine and Standards through clear lines of communications with partners/stakeholders (nations and international organisations), and providing assistance in support of education and training, exercises and operations. \u00a0 More information: 6th edition of Personnel Recovery Controller and Planner Course (March 2016) ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/04/20/personnel-recovery-course-hosted-by-european-personnel-recovery-centre"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0453", "date": "2016-04-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA presents hybrid threat exercise findings to Defence Ministers", "text": " Ministers of Defence met in the European Defence Agency (EDA) Steering Board on 19 April, under the chairmanship of Federica Mogherini in her capacity as Head of the Agency. The EDA presented among other things progress of the four cooperative capability programmes, the interim report on the implementation of the Policy Framework for Systematic and Long-Term Defence Cooperation as well as a preliminary implementation roadmap for a dual-use strategy on RPAS regulation. Furthermore the Agency highlighted the key findings of the hybrid threats table-top exercise it conducted last month.\u00a0The exercise involved some 80 experts from Member States, EU institutions and NATO. It underlined for example the critical importance of strategic awareness to allow Member States to detect and identify hybrid threats. The detection of hostile hybrid threats is the most challenging and yet most important aspect of an effective defence posture in this context. Greater levels of information and intelligence and close cooperation between civil and military actors were identified as important. Additionally, rapid decision-making and deployment of the necessary capabilities needs are necessary. While in a hybrid threat scenario civil actors might be in the lead, the military must stand ready and provide decision-makers with the full scope of military capabilities if necessary. Specific focus should be given to the ability to communicate. Therefore the resilience, redundancy and protection of CIS networks remains vital and the contribution of more secure defence systems (including those using satellites) is important. \u201cThe exercise was very useful as it allowed us to stress-test military capabilities in a hybrid threat environment. It also underlined the importance of close co-operation between military and civilian stakeholders in a hybrid threat scenario. However, we also saw that existing military capabilities should not be completely reoriented towards countering hybrid threats as the full spectrum of military missions must be considered\u201d, Jorge Domecq, the Chief Executive of the EDA said. A second exercise in June will focus on the way ahead in different capability areas. Ministers of Defence were also presented with an interim report on the implementation of the Policy Framework for Systematic and Long-Term Defence Cooperation. The interim report \u2013 which was compiled on the basis of questionnaires sent to and completed by the Member States \u2013 highlights that the policy framework is well supported. The focus on information-sharing through the Agency\u2019s Capability Development Plan as well as the Collaborative Database is deemed crucial by a large majority of Member States. Defence Ministers endorsed a preliminary implementation roadmap for a dual-use strategy on RPAS regulation involving questions of rulemaking, standardisation, technological solutions and issues of cyber security. The EDA will now start consolidating the roadmap with the European Commission and other relevant actors.\u00a0 The Steering Board tasked the Agency, in close coordination with Member States, to engage with the Commission in the preparation of the Space Strategy for Europe, to ensure that common military views of Member States are taken into account.

The EU\u2019s collective level of ambition should include the ability to protect its citizens, to secure its direct neighbourhood (East and South), and to enable and support its partners to become security providers themselves, he stressed. \u201cProtect, secure, enable. This should be at the very heart of the Global Strategy\u201d which High Representative Federica Mogherini is set to present in summer, Mr\u00a0Domecq stated. However, he continued, \u201csuch a vision needs to be put into motion and will therefore require investment, support of EU instruments, capabilities and a strong industrial base\u201d. As far as military capabilities are concerned, Mr Domecq called for more cooperative programmes. \u201cMember States face the stark choice between cooperating to acquire new capabilities or risk losing them altogether\u201d, he said. \u201cWhile there are many political declarations calling for more cooperation, the reality is that we face the renationalisation of defence. In the past, we carried out more cooperative programmes than we do today; we used to cooperate more in research and technology; we created instruments such as OCCAR or the European Defence Agency which has a strong European conviction. But today, Member States seem to be shying away from cooperation, there seems to be too much of conservatism in ministries of defence\u201d, he said. The EDA Chief Executive commended Germany for being \u201ca driving force in Europe\u201d. \u201cI sincerely hope that, with the support of State Secretary Suder and (Lieutenant) General B\u00fchler, as Chairman of the EDA Steering Board of Capability Directors, with whom I work very closely, we will take European defence to a new level, taking advantage of the context of the Global Strategy and potential European Defence White Book. Europe can simply no longer afford to be a free-rider in defence\u201d, Mr Domecq concluded.

The EDA initiative is designed to provide flexible commercial satellite communication solutions for its contributing members. Commercial satellite communications are used by all nations to provide extra capacity on top of their own military and governmental satellite communications. The EU Satcom Market provides a flexible and cost-effective way of doing this.\u00a0 Jorge Domecq, the EDA Chief Executive, welcomed Serbia's decision to join the EU Satcom Market project highlighting the benefits of the project as regards the provision of commercial satellite communication solutions. He added that this was a concrete step of the Republic of Serbia to enhance cooperation with EDA partners in the framework of the Administrative Arrangement between the Agency and the Serbian Ministry of Defence.\u00a0 The Republic of Serbia signed an Administrative Arrangement with the Agency in 2013 enabling it to participate in EDA projects and programmes. The EU Satcom Market is the first EDA project which the Republic of Serbia has decided to join. Background Within the EU Satcom Market project, EDA acts as the central purchasing body on behalf of the contributing members. It purchases the services from a commercial provider. The project uses a \u2018pay-per-use\u2019 model, so members do not have to contribute with regular fees, instead they only pay for what they order.\u00a0 Since May 2013, 32 orders have been passed for a total value of around \u20ac5.2 million.

The so-called NEXTT project standing for \u201cNew Energy storage using compleX hydride Tanks for Thermoneutral systems\u201d, was initiated by the European Defence Agency in the framework of the second Joint Investment Programme on Innovative Concepts and Emerging Technologies (JIP ICET 2). The project\u2019s objective is to develop a new energy storage system for hydrogen, using new materials and advanced tank solutions with the following targets: high gravimetric density for high mobility of the system; high volumetric density for compactness and practicability of the system; and optimized heat absorption leading to low heat losses and thus reduced thermal signature of the overall system. Involving the full spectrum of R&T players The NEXTT project demonstrates and reflects in an exemplary manner the key idea behind the JIP ICET 2 programme, namely to involve the full spectrum of entities in the R&T cycle, ranging from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) over research centres to big industry, as the end-user of the technology development. The NEXTT consortium is led by a small research subsidiary of an Austrian University (Forschungs- und Technologietransfer GmbH, FOTEC) with two major research centres (Fraunhofer IFAM, Germany, and Commissariat \u00e0 l'\u00e9nergie atomique et aux \u00e9nergies alternatives CEA, France), as well as an industrial end-user (DCNS Group, France) also participating. This bandwidth allows the consortium to cover all aspects of the targeted development from research in advanced materials and system integration up to the military application. The NEXTT project also promotes civil-military synergies and dual-use technologies as it aims to transfer technologies and knowledge already used by the space industry to the defence sector for further development. The launch of NEXTT completes the lists of projects which had been earmarked under JIP ICET 2 in view of fostering the development of new, innovative technologies that have potential to enable future military capabilities. JIP ICET 2 is managed and funded by Austria, Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden in the framework of the EDA.

At exercise closure, a total of 290 hours had been flown on 156 missions with 3 participating Member States (Finland and Germany, as well as Sweden which sent observers) and 10 European helicopters: seven NH-90, one MD500 and two CH-53GA. Italian attendees participated in the survival training. This cold weather exercise was operated from Ivalo airbase in Finland. The challenging winter scenario in Lapland allowed Finland and Germany to train and adapt their aircrew to winter conditions. Besides the focus on flying in demanding white-out conditions, the exercise was used to test the helicopters, test the aircrew and to teach and learn Technics, Tactics and Procedures in a cold and snowy environment. During the first week, Finland and Germany executed individual trainings, qualifying helicopter pilots and loadmasters in white-out landings and navigation skills in an area with barely any houses or roads. During day and night missions all training aims were met and, even with Night Vision Goggles, the nights were very dark in northern Finland. During the second week, formation flights with German CH-53GA and Finnish NH-90 helicopters were flown at night. While aircrew from Germany and Finland were flying, Italian militaries attended the survival course and learned how to survive in Lapland. The German Detachment commander praised the unique nature of the exercise and stressed that the added value of cooperating with other nations and practicing winter operations in combined missions just could not have been achieved by working alone. The skills developed during the exercise are precisely those needed to conduct successful operations in the future. These types of exercises truly enhance helicopter capabilities in Europe which also reflects the objective of EDA\u2019s Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP). Since the first exercise in France in 2009, trainings have increased in scale, environmental challenges and complexity. Participants not only came from different nations but also from different branches with air force and army all working together. In exercise Cold Blade 2016, German Army NH-90 mechanics executed tests and exchanged information with their Finnish counterparts concerning winter maintenance, use of tools and NH-90 helicopter documentation.

At a time when hybrid warfare tactics - a combination of conventional and unconventional, military and non-military, overt and covert actions - are increasingly employed by state- and non-state actors in conflicts close to the EU\u2019s southern and eastern borders (Ukraine, Syria, Libya), \u201cit is essential to focus on the ability and agility of Member States and the EU to anticipate and react in a swift and coordinated manner\u201d to these threats, Mr Domecq said. \u00a0Most individual Member States have adequate capabilities in place to counter hybrid threats, \u201cbut they must learn to deploy those resources in a more coherent, comprehensive way\u201d, he stressed. The European External Action Service (EEAS), supported by EDA and the Commission, is currently preparing a joint framework on hybrid warfare which will form the basis of the future work in this field. In the meantime, the EDA continues its work of assessing the extent to which hybrid threats will affect capability development in Europe in the broadest possible context, Mr Domecq told MEPs. To this end, EDA will conduct a table top exercise from 9-11 March which will involve relevant actors, such as the EEAS, the European Commission, NATO, Member States and academics. The results will be presented to Ministers of Defence in April. Enhanced EU-NATO cooperation Referring to the potential of enhanced EU-NATO cooperation in countering hybrid threats, Mr Domecq expressed the view that progress in this particular field could take EU-NATO relations \u201cto a new level\u201d. In the current context of rapidly spreading hybrid warfare, to intensify cooperation with NATO \u201cis not an option, but an absolute necessity\u201d, the EDA Chief Executive stated in the presence of NATO Assistant Secretary General Heinrich Brauss who also attended the SEDE meeting. \u201cOur collective reply to hybrid is a major opportunity (\u2026) The comparative advantages of the EU and NATO should be used to the maximum extent. The deterrence effect of NATO and the complementarity of our (EU) tools and instruments, are more than enough reason to enhance our cooperation\u201d, he said.\u00a0 Global Strategy, R&T In his speech, Mr Domecq also touched upon the upcoming EU Global Strategy telling MEPs that the EDA would use its full expertise to help translate the Global Strategy into EU military capabilities required to deal with current and future security risks, including hybrid threats. He also highlighted the need for increased investments in defence-related research and technologies (R&T) with a particular focus on dual-use technologies and civilian-military synergies.

The deployable laboratory was financed through the European Defence Agency and is now ready for deployment to operations to counter-IED threats on the request of the JDEAL Contributing Members. JDEAL was facilitated by the European Defence Agency (EDA) and the lead nation The Netherlands. The JDEAL programme is now counted as a fully operational training facility and a deployable capability. Moreover, JDEAL is now seeking to acquire a second deployable capability. JDEAL also makes use of equipment and knowledge gained from the EDA-developed Counter-IED Technical Exploitation Laboratory (MNTEL) which was previously deployed with ISAF in Kabul. The laboratory works across the entire spectrum of technical IED exploitation. This includes detailed visual examination and high quality image capture; technical exploitation reporting; biometric analysis (latent finger print recovery); electrical circuitry (primarily radio parts); document and media recovery (focused on the mobile phones often used as IED triggering devices); chemical analysis; mechanical exploitation as well as other materiel exploitation. Major Geert-Jan Verkoeijen, JDEAL Manager in Soesterberg, and his team received the deployable facility on 10 February. Major Verkoeijen answers to three questions on the laboratory and possible future deployment here below. \u00a0 What does the Joint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory (JDEAL) mean for C-IED capability in Europe? JDEAL is an EDA Cat B project that started in September 2014 for the duration of three years. After the opening ceremony, on 4 November 2014, JDEAL has proven to be a good example for how cooperation between European nations can be arranged. The gained experience so far shows that it takes time to change, adapt current approaches, doctrines and even processes on (C-IED) technical exploitation. In some cases we see and experience that we don\u2019t \u00a0have this time. In my opinion the JDEAL concept can be seen as an example in current European political-military discussions: the current review of the \u2018C-IED concept in EU-led military operations\u2019 could benefit of the lessons identified and learned or even the cooperation approach as a whole. The JDEAL concept is already used in other cooperation developments, thus, this is a huge compliment for what we have achieved so far. In case the JDEAL concept is used for future cooperation plans, the main and most important issue is commitment. With commitment and willingness it\u2019s \u2018easy\u2019 to start in a short time. This JDEAL concept approach (could) benefit future decision making processes and eases supporting but \u2018mandatory\u2019 issues like budget, equipment and personnel. After executing several JDEAL basic courses we enter now the \u2018next\u2019 stage in the project. On 10 February we received our deployable laboratory in Soesterberg. JDEAL is now in the position to fulfill and execute its main tasks: (1) execute trainings, (2) deploy the laboratory and (3) maintain knowledge & research developments. JDEAL can contribute to trainings, operations and discussions related to our specific C-IED technical exploitation work field. \u00a0Either way JDEAL demonstrates that \u2018pooling and sharing\u2019 of capabilities and capacities are beneficial for contributing countries. This knowledge will be used for the discussion, the continuation of JDEAL after 2017. \u00a0 How do you see the readiness of the staff and laboratory for deployment? The challenge is to create a pool of experts that fulfills continuation in future deployment(s). This pool must consist of military staff who are able to use the available equipment, material and procedures. Importantly, the staff has to work in a team. Right now we don\u2019t have a deployment or mission and it\u2019s difficult to anticipate needs and consequences. In my opinion JDEAL is flexible and modular enough to adapt and fulfill \u00a0future needs. From this perspective JDEAL is in the position \u00a0to influence the decision making process. Before the actual deployment JDEAL analyses with the lead-nation how to support the deployment. JDEAL is able to prepare and execute the necessary means for deployment and make sure that the assigned crew is trained by the JDEAL permanent staff. The delivery of the first deployable laboratory JDEAL allows us to focus on the possible operational consequences of getting deployed in the upcoming months. \u00a0We are now preparing for the C-IED training exercise \u2018Bison Counter\u2019 in Sweden (August 2016). The Bison Counter \u201916 \u00a0exercise will also be a test for the technical exploitation \u2018chain\u2019 and JDEAL will benefit also from the knowledge/ procedures \u00a0of operational units and collection / level 1 tactical exploitation. This exercise will connect the several technical exploitation steps.\u00a0 \u00a0 When do you see the first opportunity for the laboratory for deployment? As stated in the JDEAL Programme Arrangement the contributing members states can claim the deployable facility. Now we have the deployable laboratory I can imagine (my assumption) that nations are considering JDEAL deployment. The JDEAL permanent staff has the challenge to make sure that when the time comes, we are ready to support the lead nation. \u00a0 More information: Counter IED project page ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/02/24/jdeal-ready-for-deployment"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0469", "date": "2016-02-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Airlift tactics training successfully closed", "text": " The first European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course (EATTC) of 2016 drew to a close on 25 February with the graduation of both day and night qualified aircrews from Belgium, Spain, Germany and Poland.\u00a0 The new dual track course was hailed as a complete success, with all training objectives achieved to reach the graduation standard but, perhaps more importantly, by the crews themselves who had found the course both challenging and enjoyable.

Convened by Commissioner El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska, the group consists of key personalities from European industry, government, the European Parliament and academia. In its report, the group now made recommendations for a long-term vision for EU-funded CSDP-related research which can boost European defence cooperation.\u00a0 These recommendations address the overall scope and governance of future EU-funded CSDP research and highlight possible collaboration and coordination mechanisms. The overarching goal of the Preparatory Action and CSDP-related research is to create a framework that would facilitate a collaborative approach to defence among the Member States. Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency (EDA) and an alternate to High Representative, Vice President and Head of the Agency Federica Mogherini, in the group, underlines, \u201cThe Preparatory Action on CSDP-related research is a pivotal instrument in support of Europe\u2019s strategic autonomy: it will reinforce our collective military freedom of action by fostering defence cooperation. The establishment of such a European instrument can contribute to translating our level of ambition into action. The Preparatory Action can become a catalyst for European cooperation in key capability areas by breaking down the barriers and overcoming the disincentives to cooperation that exist today.\u201d Against the background of shrinking defence R&T budgets with negative long-term effects on capability development and industrial outlook, the report acknowledges that an EU-funded Defence Research Programme (EDRP), complementary to national R&D, may help fostering cooperation, ensuring European security and supporting the European defence technological and industrial base.\u00a0 In the report, the Group of Personalities highlight the importance of close cooperation between governments (as sole customers), industries (as main suppliers) and R&T organisations for the success of the Preparatory Action. At the same time, the report describes the EDA as \u201cthe only EU body with the mandate to define collective defence capability and research priorities and support defence cooperation\u201d. It is \u201ctherefore the most logical and appropriate vehicle to identify and review priorities in this domain\u201d.\u00a0 Commenting on this last point, Jorge Domecq says, \u201cThe Preparatory Action combined with the active role of EDA upstream, meaning in its preparation, and downstream, in its implementation, could lead to a more systematic cooperation in Europe.\u201d \u00a0 More information Download the report here (EUISS website) ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/02/25/group-of-personalities-publishes-report-on-the-preparatory-action-for-csdp-related-research"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0471", "date": "2016-02-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Airlift tactics training with focus on night flying", "text": " The first European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course (EAATTC) of 2016 is taking place in Zaragoza Airbase, Spain, from 14 to 26 February.

New standards for RPAS A contract for the Enhanced RPAS Automation (ERA) project was signed between the EDA and a multinational industrial consortium in mid-December 2015. The project will support the widespread use of both civil and military RPAS in non-segregated airspace in Europe in general and their integration in airport operations in particular, addressing several capability gaps identified in the European RPAS Steering Group (ERSG) Roadmap for RPAS air traffic insertion. The project will contribute to setting the European standards that will provide the technical grounds for the certification of the Automatic Take-off and Landing, Autotaxi and Automation and Emergency Recovery functionalities, in the frame of the regulatory framework currently being produced. To achieve these goals, technical and procedural solutions will be developed, and demonstrated by simulations and flight trials. Additionally, the project includes the development of draft standards in cooperation with the European Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment (EUROCAE). The project also relies on active collaboration with other important stakeholders, such as the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and Eurocontrol. Roland Van Reybroeck, EDA Director Cooperation Planning & Support explains: \u201dERA complements the air traffic integration efforts of other related EDA projects, such as MIDCAS (MID-air Collision Avoidance System) covering en-route Detect & Avoid and DESIRE (Demonstration of Satellites enabling the Insertion of RPAS in Europe) covering satellite command and control data links. These projects, strongly driven by military requirements, have achieved tangible results but there is a need to proceed with further investments, also in view of establishing dual-use standards and meeting civil regulation requirements.\u201d \u00a0 ERA as ad-hoc EDA project ERA is an EDA ad-hoc project launched by five Member States: France, Italy, Poland, Sweden and Germany as the lead nation. The planned duration of the project is 42 months with an overall budget of around \u20ac31 million (excl. VAT). The ERA industrial consortium is led by Airbus Defence and Space, and composed of sixteen partners from five EDA Member States: Airbus Defence and Space and ESG Elektroniksystem- und Logistik-GmbH\u00a0 from Germany; Sagem, Thales and ONERA from France; Saab from Sweden; Finmeccanica from Italy; and nine partners from Poland: Air Force Institute of Technology (leadership Polish consortium), Institute of Aviation, Hertz Systems Ltd., EUROTECH, PIAP (Przemys\u0142owy Instytut Automatyki i Pomiar\u00f3w), Eskadra Grzegorz Trzeciak, Politechnika Rzeszowska (Rzeszow University of Technology - RUT), WB Electronics S.A., Asseco Poland S.A. \u00a0 Background RPAS have demonstrated their importance in recent military operations, particularly for surveillance and information gathering. However RPAS can also offer a wide range of civil applications such as infrastructure surveillance, firefighting, disaster or environmental monitoring, as well as border control and management. RPAS have been earmarked as one of four capability development priorities by the December 2013 European Council. The European Defence Agency has divided its work in the field of RPAS into five main areas: (1) Integration of military RPAS in non-segregated civilian airspace; (2) Certification of future military RPAS; (3) Development of cutting-edge technologies for future European RPAS; (4) Establishment of a community of military RPAS users in Europe; (5) Support to the development of a European medium-altitude long endurance (Male) RPAS to be operational by 2025. \u00a0 More information: RPAS project page ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/02/11/new-project-to-facilitate-integration-of-rpas-into-european-airspace"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0480", "date": "2016-01-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "European Defence Agency supports CSDP operations", "text": " In the framework of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), the European Defence Agency (EDA) supports EU-led military operations and missions offering a wide scope of services, ranging from managing contracts for satellite communication, through training in cyber defence, ending up with providing HR management software to operational commands. Especially developing a model of ready-to-use framework contracts will give the EDA the possibility to broaden its service to more comprehensively support the establishment and running of CSDP operations and missions.\u00a0 Introduction Support to CSDP Operations is one of the key task for the European Defence Agency, which was highlighted in the recent revision of the statute, seat and operational rules of the Agency. \u201cWe are proud to support EU-led military operations: to see our projects being used and to know that our expertise is being appreciated. Continuous service is what makes the Agency valid,\u201d says Jorge Domecq, the EDA Chief Executive.\u00a0 The EDA offers its existing projects as well as ready-to-use contracted solutions that will replicate the successful framework contract model for satellite communications. Consequently, the EDA support to operations is cost-effective and efficient, as it does not generate any additional costs for the Member States or the Agency.\u00a0 The range of EDA services to support CSDP operations In more detail, the EDA delivered a Human Resources management software for Headquarters (J1FAS) to the EU military operation in the Central African Republic in 2014. Commander Paschalis Gkounidis, the HQ Assistant Chief of Staff for Human Resources said that \u201cthe installation of this new system represents a big step forward in managing our personnel and will provide useful lessons for the improvement of the system in the future.\u201d A similar support is also provided for the operational command of the military operation in the Southern Central Mediterranean (Operation Sophia). Additionally, the EDA conducted cyber awareness training events in Larissa and Rome Operational Headquarters for the operations in the Central African Republic and in Southern Central Mediterranean respectively. In the case of Operation Sophia, the EDA also offered the MARSUR networking system, which may contribute to increasing the maritime situational awareness.\u00a0 Following several successful test cases, e.g. contracting Air-to-Ground Surveillance Services for the EU military operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (EUFOR Althea) in 2014, the EDA signed an arrangement with the Athena Mechanism (February 2015) to facilitate ad-hoc support for contracting for CSDP operations. Under this arrangement, the Agency has already supported the EU training mission in Mali for procurement of medical equipment as well as the EUFOR Althea for benchmarking current camp management services. The signature of the arrangement also provided a new impetus for the usage of the already existing EDA Contractor Support to Operations (CSO) platform as a powerful tool for interaction between economic operators and EU-led operations. The platform has successfully been used to assist in fulfilling tailored needs for the EU training missions in Mali and Somalia.\u00a0 With the Athena Mechanism having joined the EU SatCom Market project in June 2015, the cooperation has gone one step further. CSDP operations and missions can now rely on a ready pre-mission contracted solution for satellite communication. The EDA framework contracts offer high quality service with less administrative burden. The EU training mission in Somalia has successfully been using such solution since October 2015 for Fixed Satellite Services. \u201cThanks to the excellent cooperation between the EUTM J6 team, the EDA and the contractor, EUTM Somalia benefits from a reliable and secure connection with Europe for its Command and Control chain,\u201d said Brigadier General Antonio Maggi, the Operation Commander. The EU Training Mission in Mali is also relying now on the EU SatCom Market for Mobile Satellite Services. Potential projects in the future\u00a0 \u201cI have no doubts that our support to CSDP operations will increase in the future, and will provide more opportunities to deliver civil-military synergies in the contractor support context,\u201d says Jorge Domecq. The EDA, together with the Athena Mechanism and EU Military Staff, is currently exploring possibilities to implement additional ready-to-use solutions for other services, to include medical services with helicopter medevac as the first priority, infrastructure and camp management as well as strategic transportation services. The overall aim is to provide comprehensive contracted support covering all major areas pertaining to operations: from deployment and redeployment of troops, through the establishment and maintenance of camps, satellite communications services to end up with medical service. There is also a number of EDA-led projects which be might relevant for CSDP operations as they mature in the future. The list includes: smart energy camps to manage renewable energies, Countering Improvised Explosive Devices (C-IED) awareness and training, cyber situational awareness packages for headquarters to enhance cyber defence planning, a platform to share and analyse geospatial information (GISMO 2), a C-IED joint deployable exploitation analysis laboratory, and an electronic on-line gov-to-gov market platform eQuip to sell or transfer surplus defence equipment.\u00a0 More information Project page on Operations Support\u00a0 Brochure on Contractor Support to Operations (CSO) platform News \"JDEAL deployable capability: final trainings before delivery\"\u00a0(24 November 2015) News \"EDA provides satellite communications services for EUTM Somalia\" (13 October 2015) News \"EDA installs energy management equipment at EUTM Mali camp\" (13 October 2015)\u00a0 News \"EDA supports EUTM Mali to enhance medical facilities\" (8 September 2015) ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2016/01/19/european-defence-agency-supports-csdp-operations"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0481", "date": "2016-01-15", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA Chief Executive and Norwegian Minister of Defence discuss defence cooperation", "text": " Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency and Ine Eriksen S\u00f8reide, Norwegian Minister of Defence met today for discussions on Norway\u2019s involvement in EDA projects as well as ways to further enhance defence cooperation. \u201cI am very pleased to welcome the Chief Executive of EDA to Norway\u201d, said Defence Minister Eriksen S\u00f8reide. \u201cEDA is an important partner for Norway in the development of our Armed Forces.

The panel discussions, divided between attack and support helicopter operators and planners, brought an insight to the latest developments in night vision goggles (NVG) training, Electronic Warfare (EW), tactics used to land on different types of landing zones, use of sensors and technologies applied in Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) and helicopter self-defence aids used by the Member States. Reflecting on several comments coming out of discussions, new proposals to update the HEP Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), the capstone tactics manual for multinational helicopter operations, were submitted. The aims and objectives of the upcoming HEP exercises were briefed in detail, including Cold Blade 2016 (Finland, environmental training in extreme conditions), Black Blade 2016 (Belgium, Special Operations Forces exercise) and Fire Blade 2017 (Hungary, live-fire, urban operations). The HEP Member States fully realise that the multinational dimension is key to the development of the helicopter capabilities of European countries. Therefore, the well-established HEP community calls for a wider extension of proven exchanges of operational experience, such as the ones conducted during the Helicopter Tactics Symposiums.\u00a0 More information:\u00a0 Helicopter initiatives News \"Fifth edition of the Helicopter Tactics Symposium held in Prague\" (4 December 2014) \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/12/17/helicopter-tactical-procedures-on-the-agenda"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0483", "date": "2015-12-18", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA initiates a project on lightweight land vehicles", "text": " Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain and Germany as the lead nation have initiated a new project under the auspices of the European Defence Agency (EDA) the aim of which is to investigate opportunities and challenges of lightweight constructions for Armoured Multi-Purpose Vehicles (the L-AMPV project).

The consultation will take place through a series of meetings between experts from national administrations, armed forces, industry and academia.\u00a0 \"Some of the world\u2019s most efficient militaries are progressively replacing expensive fossil fuels with power generated by solar panels, wind turbines and rechargeable batteries. This is not only about more reliable on-site energy generation. It's also about making it safer and cheaper for troops to complete their missions\", said Commissioner Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete. \u201cSustainable energy use starts at home. This is true for individuals as well as for the armed forces. The energy bill for Europe\u2019s armed forces amounts to billions of euros. The EU legislation in place for energy efficiency, renewable energy and energy performance in buildings can certainly improve the armed forces\u2019 energy output. Ultimately this will not only benefit their environmental footprint but will also result in considerable savings\u201d, said Jorge Domecq during the opening of the first plenary session.\u00a0 \u00a0 Consultation Forum The Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector is a European Commission initiative managed by the EDA. It brings together experts from the defence and energy sectors to share information and best practice on improving energy management, efficiency and the use of renewable energy in the civil uses of the military. The focus will be on facilitating the sharing of good practice and expertise by assessing the existing EU energy legislation, in particular the Energy Efficiency Directive, the Energy Performance in Buildings Directive and the Renewable Energy Directive in order to see how different measures could be implemented in the defence sector thus contributing to on-going decarbonisation efforts.The Forum will also be a place to stimulate projects in key areas as well as identifying possible funding streams. Depending on the findings, the Forum might also develop recommendations on how to further develop directives or amending policy in relation to European funding mechanisms for defence. The Consultation Forum will take place in a series of five plenary meetings over two years. The work will be carried out in three parallel working groups each with a particular focus: (1) Energy management, (2) Energy efficiency & 3) Renewable energy.

The course was successfully conducted from 23 November to 4 December 2015 in Poggio Renatico Air Base, Italy. It was organised by the European Personnel Recovery Centre (EPRC) at the request of six Member States contributing to the project. All in all, nineteen students from eleven countries including Austria, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States benefitted from the knowledge and experience of a cadre of instructors from Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United States.\u00a0 The main focus of the course was to train staff officers in supporting their commanders in Personnel Recovery related issues. The course is designed for personnel who man personnel recovery positions in tactical operation centres (TOCs), personnel recovery coordination cells (PRCCs) or joint personnel recovery cells (JPRCs).\u00a0 Personnel Recovery (PR) is a vital element of modern operational planning as it provides a security net for deployed personnel. Most importantly, it boosts morale and acknowledges national as well as European Union responsibilities to effect the recovery and reintegration of isolated personnel deployed in the context of Crisis Management Operations under the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).\u00a0 The next EU PRCPC will take place in Karlsborg, Sweden, from 29 February to 11 March 2016 and will be organised by the Swedish Armed Forces.\u00a0 Background The EDA PRCPC project was established on 30 May 2013 as an EDA Category B project under the lead of Sweden. As of today, it includes six contributing EU Member States (cMS): Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands and Sweden.

A total of sixteen students attended the course which included a mixture of military and police Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), CBRN and Search specialists from the following countries: Austria, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Latvia, Czech Republic and Spain. A mixture of military and civilian CBRNe Search expertise ensured a wide range of operational experience was available during the course. Practical training provided the most effective means of learning for this course and students were able to participate in immersive scenarios as commanders, searchers, EOD and Sampling and Identification of Biological, Chemical and Radiological Agents (SIBCRA) specialists in a joint CBRN response team. A variety of instructional methods were employed to achieve this learning: demonstrations, individual skills practice, group mini-tasks and full tactical tasks for teams provided a structured approach to learning. Differentiation was applied where required to compensate for language difficulties or adaptation of existing skills from SIBCRA to Search. All practical exercises were recorded using photos and videos; this enabled every day to be concluded with a video debrief to ensure students understood the details of each phase even if they were involved in a separate aspect of the task.\u00a0 The various scenarios provided a range of operational complexities which highlighted the different operational capabilities, policies and procedures each pMS had. As a result, the course provided much opportunity for sharing best practice, and \u00a0a seminar was held to facilitate discussion about the range of capabilities. A Distinguished Visitors Day was hosted by Austria on 10 December 2015. Several Defence Attaches and other visitors participated in the event and took the opportunity to visit the CBRN School for briefings on the course design and contents. Visitors also had the chance to visit a live \u201cvessel search\u201d demonstration in the Danube river.

The European Defence Agency (EDA) led cooperation brought together a \"critical mass\" for an effective scientific dialogue, thus allowing the Nations to benefit from synergies in their respective industrial capabilities. Compared to more conventional combat aircraft designs, extremely lightweight structures exhibit different distributions of strength and stiffness. Within the BaToLUS project, cost-efficient alternatives to a well-defined baseline configuration have been developed by improved structural design, aiming to offer increased tolerance against battle damage, whilst supporting the original requirements and keeping potential penalties small.\u00a0 Thanks to BaToLUS, new rapid prototype modelling capabilities have been developed. Also, a generic design process, which includes \u201cVulnerability Load Cases\", and novel high-fidelity simulation methods have been demonstrated. A large number of structural concepts for vulnerability reductions have been identified, assessed and \u2013 for two of them \u2013 implemented and tested. Operational evaluation with respect to impacts on cost, weight and capabilities were considered at an overall platform level, together with vulnerability analysis taking into account the demonstrated structural performance and aerodynamic damage characterisation.

The seminar was co-organised by the Capability Technology groups (CapTechs) on Materials & Structures, Technologies for Components and Modules, Radiofrequency Sensors Technologies, and Electro-Optical Sensors Technologies. Metamaterials are engineered structured materials used principally to control and manipulate electromagnetic fields and acoustic waves. Their properties come both from those of the materials they are made of, as well as from their geometrical arrangements.\u00a0 High level experts on metamaterials and defence technologies gathered to discuss on the potentials of metamaterials for different defence applications and related future challenges. In order to raise the awareness for these technologies, background information was provided on current work regarding metamaterials at EU level, on relevant activities in various CapTechs, on defence capability needs and on areas were further research is needed. The discussion focused on metamaterials defence applications, such as metamaterials to enhance the performance of radar antennas, their use as radar absorbers and cloaking, both regarding acoustics and microwave signals. Also the challenges and the way ahead regarding measurements, fabrication or modelling were addressed during the meeting. The main outcome of the seminar is the identification of radar antennas and absorbers as the most promising defence applications. On the other hand, wide-band tunable surfaces are the most wanted applications of metamaterials, although they are far to be achieved. However, with a view to developing different applications, SMEs and academia need military requirements to better align their research to defence needs.

Peter Round, EDA Capability, Armaments and Technology Director, moderated three panel talks and chaired a round table discussion in which high level stakeholders shared their maritime security challenges and opportunities. \u201cEuropean prosperity, like any economic centre in our global economy, is based on successful exploitation of the sea and, at times, the ability to exert control through the use of force. A reduction in our level of ambition from Open Seas to the Littoral could bring about \u2018sea blindness\u2019, shrinking Europe\u2019s sea-going vision to what could be termed a \u2018coast guard function\u2019. I\u2019d far rather see us aspire to a \u2018sea guard function\u2019 to ensure our ongoing freedom of manoeuvre on the High Seas \u2013 i.e.: Sea Power,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Additionally, the conference included a session dedicated to research and technological aspects of the EUMSS which encompassed the local academic and research communities.\u00a0 \u00a0 More information:\u00a0 News \"EDA Continues Mine Counter Measures Activities - Two Maritime Conferences on the Way\" (19 October 2015)\u00a0 ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/11/19/maritime-security-conference"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0497", "date": "2015-11-20", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Unmanned Maritime Systems Conference", "text": " The European Defence Agency together with EuroDefense Deutschland co-organised a conference entitled \u201cUnmanned Maritime Systems \u2013 A Key Enabling Technology for the 21st Century Navy\u201d, held at the Representation of Schleswig-Holstein in Berlin. \u00a0 The conference featured participants from thirteen different nations and had ninety attendees. The conference consisted of three different panels which addressed the pertinent and topical questions in relation to the development and adoption of Unmanned Maritime Systems (UMS). In his opening remarks, Rini Goos, the Deputy Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency (EDA), highlighted the role the EDA plays in the development of capabilities and that the EDA \u201cis the place to go for Member States who are keen to develop defence capabilities through cooperation\u201d. Rear Admiral K\u00e4hler, the Chief of Staff at the German Naval Command, provided an opening keynote speech. His address set the tone for the conference, as it outlined the importance of UMS and the need for European cooperation, but, additionally, it contained a word of caution, in that we must not neglect the need for internal and external investments in a time of shrinking budgets. In the broader Unmanned Systems environment, he asserted that many of the technological developments are dual-use in nature, and there are many complimentary features between the civil and military sides.\u00a0 The conference panels proceeded to address three broad areas relating to UMS, namely the operational concerns on the adoption of UMS, the need for multinational cooperation in overcoming complexity and, finally, a focus on the challenges facing the wider adoption of UMS in terms of classification, safety and regulations.\u00a0 An interesting theme consistent throughout the conference related to the next steps on the use of UMS. It was emphasised that the current focus of UMS in the area of mine countermeasures is very much a first step and not the end point in itself. Navies must continue to innovate and accept new technologies and this often requires a cultural shift. As Dr Heiko Borchett outlined in his presentation, innovation requires a level of risk tolerance and acceptance, and that it is only by the wider adoption of UMS that we can ensure confidence and reliability in these systems and shift the debate from men vs machine, but rather focus on the men-machine and machine-machine collaborative aspects that will open the door on future uses.\u00a0 This lead into the second panel discussion, moderated by the EDA Project Officer for Naval Systems, Paul O\u2019Brien. This panel focussed upon some of the areas addressed in the EDA Unmanned Maritime Systems programme, which consists of fifteen coordinated projects and has a monetary value of \u20ac56 million. The conference participants were informed of the ongoing efforts to develop technologies to meet the capability requirement for Maritime Mine Countermeasures.\u00a0 The Capability Armament and Technology Director, Peter Round, moderated the third panel, which focused on the challenges facing the wider adoption of the UMS. This had a particular focus on regulatory aspects and legal classifications.\u00a0 The conference concluded with a speech from the Cypriot Minister of Defence, Mr Fokaides who provided an overview of the security considerations in the Eastern Mediterranean. In particular, he outlined the importance of the recent discovery of natural resources in the area and stated that these could act as a catalyst for political solutions. He further asserted that UMS technologies and the civil-military dimension have an important role to play. \u00a0 More information: Unmanned Maritime Systems (UMS) research ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/11/20/unmanned-maritime-systems-conference"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0498", "date": "2015-11-23", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA-Egmont PhD Prize awarded", "text": " Andrea Gilli received the EDA-Egmont PhD Prize during the European Defence Agency\u2019s (EDA) Annual Conference held on 16 November 2015. The award was handed over by Prof Sven Biscop, Director of \u201cEurope in the World Programme\u201d at the Egmont Institute, and Rini Goos, EDA Deputy Chief Executive.\u00a0 The biannual EDA-Egmont PhD prize is awarded by the European Defence Agency and the Egmont Institute to academic scholars to stimulate research in the field of European defence, security and strategy. This year\u2019s winner, Andrea Gilli, is a post-doctoral fellow at the Centre for Security Studies, Metropolitan University Prague, and his research on armaments cooperation has received recognition. The awarded thesis is titled \u201cUnipolarity, Technological Change and Arms Manufacturing: Industrial Alliances in the European Defense Industry\u201d. Before handing over the award, Rini Goos, EDA Deputy Chief Executive, raised the issue of the future visions which often combine the practitioner\u2019s and academic perspectives: \u201cThe practitioner\u2019s view comes from accumulated experience, realism, pragmatism and an understanding of the practical mechanics of defence and diplomacy. The academic view on the other hand is blessed by being outside the system and provides objectivity, independence, innovation and analysis in a global context. Together, these perspectives provide a complete picture.\u201d\u00a0 Prof Sven Biscot pointed out that the winner of the prize delivered a very courageous thesis based on an extensive and empirical material, and that it presents very concrete ideas for defence policies.\u00a0 \u201cIt is an honour to be here today to receive this prize and to share the contents of my research with you,\u201d said Andrea Gilli. \u201cIn the age of fast technological change and budgetary constraints, we often hear that European countries have to increase their cooperation on future military technologies,\u201d he said and added that such cooperation may be extremely difficult because of \u201cthe process of technological disruption\u201d. In his thesis, Gilli dwells upon, among other things, various aspects of cooperation in armaments production, technological advancement as well as implications for the European defence industrial base. \u00a0 Background EDA-Egmont PhD prize was created in 2013 to stimulate research in the field of European defence, security and strategy.

With successful delivery of the ground and simulator phase at RAF Linton-on-Ouse in the UK, and the phase at Vidsel test range near Lulea in northern Sweden, twelve student instructors from Austria, Germany, Sweden and the UK graduated from the course with Bronze or Silver HTI qualifications, corresponding to their experience and skills level. It was the first case that the HTIC was delivered under an EDA Category B Programme with its own approved Programme Arrangement signed in March 2015 by Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The HTIC as a multinational tactical training course involved four helicopter types: Austrian Kiowa, Swedish Air Force Blackhawk and NH90, Chinook from the UK. It engaged more than one hundred military and civilian staff, and included more than two hundred hours of live flying. The aim of HTIC is to teach experienced helicopter aircrew how to instruct tactics in the air and on the ground. It covers topics such as fighter jets evasion, electronic warfare against surface to air radar threats, convoy escort, vehicle check points and operating in the low-tech threat environment. \u00a0 A wide range of assets to provide the correct learning environment were required. The excellent support was provided by the Swedish Armed Forces with their Gripen fighter jets from 211 and 212 Squadron, the SK60 trainer aircraft and the ground-based radar defence systems as well as by the UK with their Hawk aircraft from 100 Squadron. For the first time, the Staff Instructors included graduates from the previous courses. The two returning Swedish Instructors prove that the course can be self-sustaining and is able to achieve its aim of developing an internationally recognised cadre of tactics instructors who, in turn, can continue to deliver courses in the future.\u00a0 The HTIC is a high-value, intensive course that forges close links between all participants, creating a tight-knit community. Experience and knowledge are shared openly and honestly, and working on the principle of adopting best practices, continual improvement and standardisation serve as a constant theme. Everyone works together, harmonising tactics, techniques and procedures, with ever closer interoperability being the final goal.

The EDA presented progress on the four capability programmes and initial roadmaps for potential future cooperative programmes: Biological Joint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory (Bio-JDEAL), medical evacuation and anti-tank weapons. Minister of Defence also discussed the three year planning framework detailing the Agency\u2019s work plan and priorities for 2016-2018 as well as the resources required to support this. \u00a0 Three Year Planning Framework and 2016 General Budget Federica Mogherini in her capacity as Head of Agency invited the Steering Board to approve the 2016 EDA General Budget of \u20ac33.5m.\u00a0 Approval of the EDA budget requires unanimity. Despite very positive feedback by Member States on the work and support by the Agency, there was no unanimity on the increased budget. Instead, the budget will remain at this year\u2019s level \u2013 \u20ac30.5m (zero growth). \u00a0 Implementation of Key Taskings and Next Steps Ministers of Defence welcomed the progress achieved in the four capability programmes: Air-to-Air Refuelling, cyber defence, governmental satellite communications, Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems. Given the increasingly volatile and challenging security environment in and around Europe it is equally important that other critical capability priorities as identified in the Capability Development Plan also be addressed. Potential future cooperative activities require guidance to avoid fragmentation, focus future investment and give clarity to defence industry. Ministers of Defence have today adopted the initial roadmaps for potential future cooperative programmes as proposed by the Agency: Biological Joint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory (Bio-JDEAL), Medevac and Anti-Tank Weapons. Bio-JDEAL:\u00a0The proliferation of biological agents means the biological threat to Member States\u2019 forces employed on operations remains real. Furthermore, the use of biological weapons or devices, particularly by non-state actors, can have a disproportionate effect on morale. Enhancing CBRN capabilities in operations has been outlined in the Agency\u2019s Capability Development Plan as a priority action. In order to counter these threats and assess the risk of exposure, a biological laboratory which could be deployed at short notice by a Member State would be able to: Conduct unambiguous in-theatre biological threat identification; Provide threat information to Command, enhancing the protection of EU forces and local populations and thus limiting casualties; Maintain Member States\u2019 freedom of movement and action. Following today\u2019s approval, the roadmap foresees start of the expert group\u2019s work still this year with a view to producing a Common Staff Target by the end of 2016 and a possible project launch by the end of 2017. So far, eight Member States (Luxembourg, Slovakia, Romania, Germany, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Spain, Italy) and Norway have expressed interest in this project. \u00a0 Medevac: Effective medical evacuation is a fundamental requirement for any military operation. Cooperation, interoperability, as well as common training, is paramount for Member States to constitute reliable MEDEVAC capabilities. As with the previous proposal, enhancing this capability is a priority action of the Capability Development Plan which was endorsed by Member States. Following Minister\u2019s endorsement, the work will start with a study on \u201cInteroperability in Forward Aeromedical Evacuation with Rotary Wing\u201d which will be launched this year. Based on the outcome of the study, the Agency will make proposals on possible interoperability activities and training. This work builds on interest shown by seven Member States (Luxembourg, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Austria, Finland, Germany, the Czech Republic and Italy). \u00a0 Anti-tank weapons: Anti-Tank capabilities are still of fundamental importance in the context of National security strategies. Some Member States still have in service equipment designed in the late 1970s which will become obsolete in the near future; they will need to consider upgrade or replacement of their systems. Others are willing to address the anti-tank weapon gap by developing new capability requirements potentially through joint procurement programmes. To move ahead quickly, the Agency will together with Member States evaluate possible urgent requirements for commercial off-the-shelf solutions still in 2015. This project represents also a quick win opportunity for Pooling & Sharing. Anti-tank is a domain where work will build on interest shown by nine Member States (Estonia, Romania, Finland, Sweden, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, Greece, Latvia) and Norway.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/11/17/outcome-eda-steering-board"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0503", "date": "2015-11-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA Annual Conference: the second part", "text": " The second part\u00a0of the European Defence Agency (EDA) Annual Conference held on 16 November 2015 was built around a question on research opportunities at the EU level. Prior to the fruitful discussions on various aspects of research and the \u201cdual-use\u201d concept, the floor was taken by Mr Conrad Bruch, Director of Defence at the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs of Luxembourg, who represented Etienne Schneider, Vice-Minister, Minister of Economy & Minister of Minister of Defence: \u201cWe welcome work on a global strategy that will encompass all the tools at our disposal to create a stronger and more secure Europe,\u201d he said and continued: \u201cWe need to become more effective in facing crisis, we have the right tools and structures at our disposal,\u201d he said,\u00a0also\u00a0mentioning\u00a0the role of the European Defence Agency. Special addresses Jens Stoltenberg,\u00a0NATO\u00a0Secretary General, and Federica Mogherini, Head of the European Defence Agency, High Representative and Vice-President of the European Commission, marked their presence during the conference and delivered special addresses. \u201cWe cannot afford to act without a rational strategy and a vision what we want to achieve and how we want to get there,\u201d said Federica Mogherini about the upcoming global strategy, stating that defence and security will be part of each chapter. High Representative also emphasised the European Defence Agency\u2019s achievements in terms of capability development. A common element of speeches of both Federica Mogherini and Jens Stoltenberg was the focus placed on the EU-NATO complementarity and partnership in facing common challenges. As NATO Secretary General stated: \u201cEuropean security is interconnected\u201d. He also emphasised that determination for closer cooperation is on both sides: \u201cit is not something we should do but something we must do.\u201d Roundtable 2 \u201eNew research opportunities at EU level: a game changer for the industry?\u201d The discussions of the second roundtable were steered by Michel Barnier, Special Adviser to the European Commission President on defence matters, Antoine Bouvier, President & Chief Executive Officer of MBDA Millie Systems, Ana Gomes, Member of the European Parliament and Tassos Rozolis, Chief Executive Officer of AKMON and Chairman of the Hellenic Manufacturers of Defence and Security Material Association. The speakers were especially referring to the reduced \u00a0funding of European defence research as well as the Preparatory Action, which is expected to include financing defence research by the EU budget for the first time in history. \u201cNo Member State has the means to ensure the full capability spectrum,\u201d admitted Michel Barnier. Antoine Bouvier drew attention to the need of identifying the level of ambition and \u201cset a new dynamics in Research & Technology\u201d.\u00a0Also Ana Gomes stated there is a need for political will that will be translated into concrete programmes. Tassos Rozolis called for an industrial strategy so that \u201cthe industry knows where it should go\u201d and underlined the importance of practical implications of the programmes that shall lead to procurements.

The conference began with one minute of silence to pay tribute to the victims of terror attacks in Paris on 13 November 2015.\u00a0 Welcome speeches\u00a0 Jorge Domecq, the EDA Chief Executive urged for more cooperation in defence: \u201cit needs to be part of our DNA,\u201d and the necessity to underpin a political will by actions: \u201cWe will only be able to adequately respond if the Union\u2019s foreign policy ambitions are backed by the right defence capabilities at the right time, supplied by a globally competitive and technologically advanced industrial base in Europe.\u201d El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska, the European Commissioner for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and Small Medium Sized Enterprises (SME), a keynote speaker, stressed that Europe is able to provide security and contribute to international peace and stability. She underlined the importance of synergies between defence and industry. She also presented the EU Commission\u2019s \u00a0approach to defence, the work plan to follow as well as some ideas for stimulating defence research. Among other things, she insisted on reversing declines in spending to stimulate research:\u00a0\u201cEuropean funding of research priorities can be a strong tool to bring all relevant actors together.\u201d Roundtable talks on defence capabilities\u00a0 During the first roundtable discussions Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, Minister of Defence of the Netherlands, General Mikhail Kostarakos, (designate) Chairman of the EU Military Committee, Giovanni Soccodato, \u00a0Executive Vice President Strategy of the Markets and Business Development at Finmeccanica and Daniel Ko\u0161toval, Deputy Minister for Armaments and Acquisition of the Czech Republic, shared their ideas on how to improve EU defence capabilities.\u00a0 Among the conclusions of the vivid discussions, there was a need formulated to noticeably increase defence cooperation and restrain from spending in national isolation on defence capabilities. The lack of a proper political guidance as well as too much of a national focus were recognised as prime reasons for a too slow-paced progress in terms of cooperative capabilities development. A financial aspect and a popular phrase \u201cdoing more with less\u201d was considered outdated by the speakers who underlined the gravity of European defence capabilities. In this context, a new financial instrument, the VAT exemption for EDA-led programmes and projects, was accessed positively. Second part of the conference The second part of the conference initiated Conrad Bruch, Director of Defence at the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs of Luxembourg, who took the floor on behalf of Etienne Schneider, Vice-Minister, Minister of Economy & Minister of Minister of Defence: \u201cWe welcome work on a global strategy that will encompass all the tools at our disposal to create a stronger and more secure Europe,\u201d he said. He also emphasised that closer cooperation is necessary to avoid threats and challenges to \u201ccome closer\u201d, and gave examples of \u00a0Luxembourg\u2019s involvement in cooperative projects and missions.\u00a0 Special addresses\u00a0 The highlight of the annual conference were two special addresses delivered by Federica Mogherini, Head of the European Defence Agency, High Representative and Vice-President of the European Commission, and Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary General. Both prominent guests emphasised solidarity, partnership of the EU and NATO as well as the need to stand united to face the current threats. The both condemned the terrorist attacks conducted on 13 November 2015 in Paris. \u201cWe will strengthen our resolve,\u201d Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary General, stated.\u00a0 \u201cWe cannot afford to act without a rational strategy and a vision what we want to achieve and how we want to get there,\u201d said Federica Mogherini about a global strategy for Europe that is currently being prepared. As she admitted, defence and security will be part of each chapter. Federica Mogherini also stated that the EU is a security provider for many and it is ready to mobilise all the instruments, including the military ones. She reassured the need to cooperate with the EU neighbours and emphasised the relations with NATO. \u00a0\u201cThere is no security without defence, there is no defence without capabilities and no capabilities without industry,\u201d said Federica Mogherini addressing the capability dimension of defence and stressed the important role of the European Defence Agency when it comes to deepening cooperation and capability development.\u00a0 Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary General stated that \u201csecurity is interconnected\u201d and reassured that both organisations are determined to develop closer cooperation. He also listed possible areas for stronger partnership, including countering hybrid threats or helping partners in neighbourhood. \u201cWe share the same values and commitment to freedom, democracy and human rights. Those valued are under threat; this is what we saw in Paris on Friday. Those values must be defended by us. That is why we work together and that is why we will take our cooperation to the next level: not just side by side but also hand in hand,\u201d said Jens Stoltenberg about the EU-NATO partnership. \u00a0 Roundtable talks on defence research The second and also the last panel discussion of the Annual Conference brought defence research on the agenda. Recognised as a key factor for capability development, defence research funding has experienced a significant decrease in the recent years. Along with the Preparatory Action, the EU might finance defence research for the first time in history, which may steer research development.\u00a0 The experts \u2013 Michel Barnier, Special Adviser to the European Commission President on defence matters, Antoine Bouvier, President & Chief Executive Officer of MBDA Millie Systems, Ana Gomes, Member of the European Parliament and Tassos Rozolis, Chief Executive Officer of AKMON and Chairman of the Hellenic Manufacturers of Defence and Security Material Association \u2013 discussed the requirements to set the level of ambition in Research & Technology and to define a way ahead. They also stressed the need to translate political will into concrete programmes and procurements in order to help a strong European defence industry base to develop. Ideas of balancing the co-existence of Small Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) and big players as well as the implications of dual-use technologies were also widely discussed.\u00a0 A final word \"There is no alternative to defence cooperation,\"\u00a0said Jorge Domecq, the EDA Chief Executive, in a\u00a0summary for this year\u2019s Annual Conference. He also underlined the necessity of better spending of available resources and supporting industry in order to develop a strong European industry base.\u00a0\u00a0 More information\u00a0 EDA website on Annual Conference 2015\u00a0 ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/11/17/-european-defence-matters-eda-annual-rendez-vous"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0505", "date": "2015-11-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "The first part of EDA Annual Conference", "text": " The first\u00a0part of this year\u2019s European Defence Agency's (EDA) Annual Conference \u201cEuropean Defence Matters\u201d has been accomplished.

He also underlined the necessity to underpin political will by actions, and to translate it into military objectives. Jorge Domecq stressed that \u201cCooperation in defence is not a natural reflex. It needs to become so: to be part of our DNA.\u201d Keynote Speech A keynote speech was delivered by El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska, the European Commissioner for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and Small Medium Sized Enterprises (SME). She underlined the importance of synergies between defence and industry. She also presented the Commission\u2019s\u00a0approach to defence, the work plan to follow as well as some ideas for stimulating defence research. El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska stressed that Europe is able to provide security and contribute to international peace and stability. Regarding research, she insisted on reversing declines in spending to stimulate research:\u00a0\u201cEuropean funding of research priorities can be a strong tool to bring all relevant actors together.\u201d \"We will only be successful if we are work together: the Commission, the European Parliament, the European Defence Agency, the European External Action Service and the Member States and industry,\u201d she concluded. Roundtable 1: \u201eEuropean defence capabilities: what\u2019s next?\u201d The first roundtable discussions on the European defence cooperation and capabilities were led by prominent guests: Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, Minister of Defence of the Netherlands, General Mikhail Kostarakos, (designate) Chairman of the EU Military Committee, Giovanni Soccodato,\u00a0 Executive Vice President Strategy of the Markets and Business Development at Finmeccanica and Daniel Ko\u0161toval, Deputy Minister for Armaments and Acquisition of the Czech Republic. The panel discussion raised the question of the future of European defence capabilities. Moreover, defence cooperation was analysed from a political, military and industrial viewpoint. Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert assessed that \u201cwe do not need more wake-up calls\u201d and insisted that the only way to protect national sovereignty through military means is by defence cooperation. She also called for sharing plans for capability development plans among the Member States. General Mikhail Kostarakos drew attention to the defence spending stating that \u201cto do\u00a0more with less\u201d is no longer a good solution as it may lead to loosing combat capabilities. Daniel Ko\u0161toval emphasised that \u201ca political will is required to allocate more money to defence and formulate where we are going\u201d. He also identified the need to maintain \u201cbalanced armies\u201d taking into consideration the whole spectrum, the light and heavy equipment.\u00a0 Giovanni Soccodato stressed the need for a common European market and a proper environment\u00a0 for defence industry to consolidate. The speakers recognised an important role of the European Defence Agency to play in terms of capability development.

The recently adopted revised Council Decision\u00a0defining the statute, seat and operational rules of the EDA includes the clause that cooperative defence projects and programmes are exempt from VAT as long as the Agency adds value to the initiative.\u00a0 \u201cThe VAT exemption is a strong incentive to European defence cooperation: it generates an attractive business case for cooperative projects and programmes in the framework of the EDA. We will soon propose roadmaps for potential future cooperative programmes for which Member States will be able to benefit from the VAT exemption and thus achieve considerable savings\u201d, comments Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency. With the entering into force of the revised Council Decision on 13 October, the new provision can be applied immediately for any new EDA initiative meeting the Decision\u2019s conditions. VAT exemption is not linked to the nature of the activity. It can thus be applied to any project and programme where the Agency adds value ranging from technical expertise, pooling demand, building a multinational capability or synergies with EU wider policies, promoting interoperability to full administrative and contractual management of a cooperative initiative. Member States are and remain the end-users of the capability.\u00a0 \u00a0 Concrete savings \u201cWhile the VAT exemption should not be the driver for defence cooperation, tight defence budgets limit investment in research, innovation and capabilities. Any breathing space is appreciated. By incentivising defence cooperation financially, we will be able to do more and better together\u201d, says Jorge Domecq. One of the projects the VAT exemption will be immediately applied to is the EU SatCom Market, an EDA project where the Agency provides for satellite communication services for currently eleven Member States and the Athena mechanism. The EDA is responsible for procurement and contract tasks, manages orders as well as payments and provides technical advice as needed and thus adds clear technical and administrative value to the project. As a consequence, each order \u2013 which comes from Member States individually or by groups \u2013 benefits from VAT exemption.\u00a0 One Member State has for example recently submitted an order of about 1.3 million Euros for one year of services. Due to the VAT exemption, this Member State will not have to pay VAT for a corresponding value of 273 thousand Euros which represents about three months of free services. Legal basis The Council Decision defining the statute, seat and operational rules of the EDA (Council Decision (CFSP) 2015/1835) was adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council on 12 October 2015. It foresees that VAT exemption applies to activities where the role of the Agency in administering projects or programmes in support of Member States brings an added value.\u00a0 The legal basis for VAT exemption are Protocol No 7 of the EU Treaties on the privileges and immunities of the European Union and Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax. The VAT exemption is compliant with EU law; and is not market distorting. \u00a0 Background The European Defence Agency was set-up in 2004 to support the Council and the Member States in their effort to improve the European Union\u2019s defence capabilities for the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). This means running and supporting cooperative European defence projects; supporting research and technology development; boosting the European defence technological and industrial base; and working on wider EU policies. \u00a0 More information: News \"Guide to VAT exemption now available!\" (14 April 2016) Council Decision CFSP 2015/1835 News \"Outcome of the EDA Steering Board\"\u00a0(28 October 2014) - ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/11/04/vat-exemption-new-incentive-for-defence-cooperation"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0508", "date": "2015-10-20", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Consultation for sustainable energy in defence and security launched", "text": " The European Commission and the European Defence Agency (EDA) launched the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector today. The Consultation Forum highlights the importance of energy and energy security as a defence capability. Its aim is to examine how energy efficiency measures and renewable energy sources might be better implemented within the European defence sector.\u00a0 \u201cEurope\u2019s armed forces are continuously working towards improving their energy efficiency as well as energy security. The consultation now offers an opportunity to explore important areas of energy policy implementation which will be of benefit to the armed forces as well as the EU as a whole. It also confirms the Agency\u2019s unique position as interface between armed forces, European institutions as well as the expert community\u201c, said Jorge Domecq, EDA Chief Executive, at the occasion of the consultation\u2019s launch.\u00a0 \"The Consultation Forum is part of a wider EU action to bring energy efficiency in all areas, including in the defence and security sector, allowing the sector to be a more competitive and efficient and to reap the full benefit of single market. The sector has a strong interest in reducing its energy footprint and could thus make an important contribution to the Union\u2019s energy targets\", said Paul Hodson, Head of Energy Efficiency Unit in the Energy Directorate General in the European Commission.\u00a0 The Consultation Forum brings together European experts from the energy and the defence sectors with the aim to deliver benefits in support of the European Commission\u2019s energy efficiency and renewable policies.\u00a0 The Consultation Forum is divided into three working groups. The first examines the management and behavioural aspects of energy efficiency. The second tackles energy efficiency in relation to infrastructure primarily, but also in wider defence estate and \u2013 on request of Member States \u2013 in deployed camps within Europe and EU operations as well as other military platforms. The third addresses the use and production of renewable energy sources.\u00a0 All in all, it is estimated that 120 defence policy and planning as well as engineering and logistics experts plus representatives from academia, industry and national ministries will contribute to the work. The first plenary session of the Consultation Forum for Sustainable Energy in the Defence and Security Sector will take place on 14-15 January\u00a0 2016 in Brussels. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Background\u00a0 The work is conducted under the umbrella of EDA\u2019s Energy and Environment programme. The programme is designed to identify areas of common interest for European armed forces as well as to create and understand the framework for a comprehensive approach to energy management for military forces. The programme also aims to identify fully integrated solutions where both energy reduction and environmental impact are assessed together. The EDA Energy and Environment Working Group was established in June 2014 and has so far worked on a number of projects including the Strategic Research Agenda, a Demand Management (Smart Camp) Technical Demonstrator which has recently been deployed to Mali and Power Purchase Agreements (Go Green).\u00a0 \u00a0 More information: Energy & Environment project page Dedicated website on the Consultation Forum ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/10/20/consultation-for-sustainable-energy-in-defence-and-security-launched"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0509", "date": "2015-10-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Increasing awareness of European Armament Cooperation", "text": " From 27 to 29 October 2015, an Awareness Level Module of the European Armament Cooperation Course (EAC) is taking place at the European Defence Agency\u2019s premises. Organised by the European Defence Agency (EDA), the European Security and Defence College (ESDC) and the Austrian Ministry of Defence (MOD) and Sports, the course has attracted the highest number of attendees in its four-year history. Forty-six enrolled students represent thirteen EDA Member States, the European Commission, European External Action Service (EEAS) and Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR).\u00a0 The aim of the EAC course is to enhance mutual understanding of the armaments cooperation issues and to serve as a useful networking platform to foster and harmonise armaments cooperation among the Member States. Most of all, it addresses junior personnel who need to gain knowledge and experience in international acquisition and project management. The course also complements the curriculums of available national courses. \u201cWe believe that the practitioners who work in national and international armament cooperation can highly profit from the course. We are able to provide them with practical knowledge and understanding of the armament sector along with its frameworks, the stakeholders\u2019 tools and processes as well as challenges and benefits available at the EU level,\u201d says Massimo Guasoni, the EDA Head of Unit Education, Training & Exercise. Towards Europe\u2019s strategic autonomy\u00a0 Rini Goos, the EDA Deputy Chief Executive, welcomed the course participants and, in his speech, he pointed out the key elements for European strategic autonomy and freedom of action: \u201cApart from working on capabilities, first of all, we must strive to enhance investment in traditional defence research, particularly in collaborative Research & Technology. Secondly, we need a sound European industrial policy. Thirdly, I would like to mention standardisation: a pan-European standardisation approach is the key to increase European competiveness on a global scale and to strengthen the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base Strategy; it is also the main driver for interoperability. And last but not least, civil-military \u2018dual-use\u2019 synergies need to be better exploited. It is only if we move ahead along these four strands of work that Europe will be able to attain strategic autonomy and become a security provider rather than a security consumer\u201d. \u00a0 Dr Wolfgang Sagmeister from the Austrian MOD being the Course Director will make sure that all the course objectives will have been met. The topics on the agenda are much varied and include the presentations of the EDA and the ESDC; military dimension of the Common Security and Defence Policy; EU military capability development along with the EDA Capability Development Plan, current trends in military defence capability development; intercultural aspects in international cooperation; EU Defence policies in a wider context, and other. \u00a0 The EAC course traditionally comprises two parts: an Awareness Level Module taking place in Brussels, and an Expert Level Course, which will be held from 23 to 27 November 2015 in Warsaw, Poland. However, in order to attend the course, it is mandatory to complete an Internet-based Distant Learning (IDL) module offered by the ESDC.\u00a0 Shaping an educational platform Since 2006, the EDA had been working towards establishing a proper training frame in response to the growing needs for harmonised education in the armament acquisition field. In 2009, the Czech Republic\u2019s EU Presidency supported the creation of a new European armaments cooperation course, providing an EU-wide training platform where a common understanding of a European approach to armaments cooperation could be promoted. The EDA Member States welcomed the initiative and later that year the EDA Steering Board, in the National Armaments Directors configuration, approved the top-level European Armaments Cooperation (EAC) Framework, under which the current course was established. In 2013, thanks to the initiative of Austria and other like-minded countries, including the Czech Republic, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, the course took its current form. It followed the success of the pilot European Armaments Cooperation Course organised in Brussels and Stadtschlaining in 2012.

The workshop was directed to national test centres, project managers and coordinators who may request the EDA T&E Collaboration support.\u00a0 The workshop\u2019s agenda covered the whole package of available tools, not only the Defence Test and Evaluation Base (DTEB). Additionally, it offered practical training opportunities with exercises and tests to improve the understanding of the T&E Collaboration operation.\u00a0 The workshop started with the theory part, during which the participants were presented with how the EDA T&E Collaboration works, along with some way ahead for the future. The practical part of the training included live exercises with the use of dedicated support tools. In particular, the Defence Test and Evaluation Base (DTEB) was used for initiating cooperation, the Collaboration Database (CODOBA) tool for the management of the cooperation, and the Capability Development Plan (CDP) \u00a0for capability implications. Additionally, the training touched upon the standardisation aspects in accordance with the European Defence Standards Reference System (EDSTAR).\u00a0 The workshop participants discussed the utility of support tools and the practical ways of cooperation under the different schemes, e.g. test arrangements, Category A/B projects, working groups and EDSTAR expert groups. \u201cThe \u00a0constructive feedback from the participants will enable us to further optimise the tools and make them as user-friendly as possible,\u201d said Thomas Honke, an EDA project officer on T&E, Qualification and Standardisation.\u00a0The T&E Collaboration Workshop ended with an official hand-over ceremony of certificates.\u00a0 The EDA plans\u00a0to offer further annual T&E collaboration training events using this format. Background The European Defence Agency has taken up the initiative of supporting European Test and Evaluation (T&E) Collaboration in 2013 in a systematic approach. Since that time, the DTEB database has been created enabling enhanced networking amongst T&E facilities and capabilities in Europe. The database is additionally linked to the EDSTAR, CODABA and CDP tools in order to allow swift identification of potential cooperation opportunities and future T&E capability requirements for common staff targets. Moreover, the EDA has initiated a crosscutting T&E expert group in EDSTAR to identify best practice T&E standardisation and to further stimulate T&E cooperation.

EUTM Somalia is the first CSDP military mission to draw on the option of the Agency to cover its requirement for SatCom services. Earlier this year, Athena - the mechanism established to finance CSDP military operations - joined the Agency\u2019s EU SatCom Market as part of its efforts to improve the procurement process of the different operations.\u00a0 Through the Agency, the mission benefits from a strategic link between Somalia and Europe. The services include rental, shipping and installation of a C-band remote terminal in Mogadishu International Airport as well as a high data rate unclassified satellite link with anchoring in Europe. The services include also 24/7 technical support and on site-intervention if required. In the coming months, the Agency will also take over the provision of Mobile Satellite Services for the operations EUNAVFOR Atalanta, EUTM Mali and EUTM Somalia as well as ATHENA Central. Speaking about the cooperation, Brigadier General Antonio Maggi, EUTM Somalia Operation Commander said: \u201cThanks to the excellent cooperation between the EUTM J6 team, EDA and the contractor, EUTM Somalia will benefit from a reliable and secure connection with Europe for its Command and Control chain.\u201d EDA\u2019s Chief Executive, Jorge Domecq added: \u201cSupporting CSDP operations is one of the core missions of the EDA. I am confident this first example will pave the way for other CSDP military operations to make extensive use of all the support the Agency can provide.\u201d EUTM Somalia On 10 April 2010, the European Union launched a military training mission in Somalia (EUTM Somalia) in order to contribute to strengthening the Federal Government and the institutions of Somalia. This support is part of the EU's comprehensive engagement in Somalia, which aims to support stabilising the country and to respond to the needs of the Somali people. Since 2010, EUTM Somalia has contributed to the training of approximately 3,600 Somali soldiers with a focus on the training of Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs), Junior Officers, specialists and trainers.\u00a0 EU SatCom Market Within the EU SatCom Market project, EDA acts as the central purchasing body on behalf of the contributing members. It purchases the services from a commercial provider. The project uses a \u2018pay-per-use\u2019 model, so members do not have to contribute with regular fees, instead they only pay for what they order. Since May 2013, 24 orders have been passed for a total value of around \u20ac4 million. Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxemburg, Portugal, Romania, the United Kingdom and the Athena Mechanism are members of the project. Further participation is open to all EDA participating Member States as well as all entities entitled to take part in Agency activities. The Athena Mechanism Athena is the mechanism established to administer the financing of the common costs of European Union operations having military or defence implications governed by Council Decision 2015/528/CFSP. The Council Decision allows for arrangements to be signed with union bodies to facilitate procurement in operations in the most cost-effective manner. \u00a0 More information News \"EDA supports EUTM Mali to enhance medical facilities\" (8 September 2015) News \"Athena joins EU Satcom Market\" (18 June 2015) News:\u00a0\"EDA signs cooperation arrangement with Athena\"\u00a0(2 March 2015) EU SatCom Market\u00a0project page Operations Support\u00a0project page \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/10/13/eda-provides-satellite-communications-services-for-eutm-somalia"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0512", "date": "2015-10-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA Continues Mine Counter Measures Activities - Two Maritime Conferences on the Way", "text": " The European Defence Agency (EDA) is continuing to promote maritime affairs and to develop, with Member States, the next generation of mine counter measure solutions via the successful delivery of Unmanned Maritime Systems projects.\u00a0 The latest of the fifteen coordinated projects to be successfully delivered, that comprise the Unmanned Maritime Systems (UMS) Programme, one of the largest in the Agency, is the SIRAMIS project. This Dutch-led project, consisted of seven Contributing Members and addressed the knowledge gap of ship signatures with the overall aim of understanding ship signature interaction with multi-influence mines at a close range. This project presented a considerable challenge for the consortium, which comprised of industry, national research centres and academia, both in terms of signature measurement and signature analysis. It also placed an emphasis on cooperation and mutual support, which are the hallmarks of the EDA projects.\u00a0 With the successful delivery of this project, plans are at an advanced stage for a follow-on project that will build on the advancements already made and will further address the modelling and simulation dimensions. A feature of the UMS programme is the coordination between projects, and the developments and gains made have positive implications for the follow-on Modular Lightweight Mine Sweeping project that will be launched shortly.\u00a0 Maritime Conferences The EDA is co-organising two conferences on maritime topics. These conferences present an opportunity to engage with key stakeholders and to fully explore and address the pertinent issues relating to the maritime domain.\u00a0 The first conference will be held on 29th October 2015 in Berlin and is co-organised with EuroDefense Deutschland.

The delegates will discuss several operational and training challenges with a single objective of tangibly improving European air transport interoperability. \u201cThe 2015 Symposium is the sixth to be organised by EDA in support of the European Air Transport Fleet Programme and builds on the success of the other air transport training events we have ran over 2015 in France, Italy, Portugal and Spain. \u00a0My thanks go to the Austrian Ministry of Defence and Sport for hosting what I am sure will be another excellent event\u201d, said Roland Van Reybroeck, EDA\u2019s Director for Cooperation Planning and Support Brigadier General Karl Gruber, Austria\u2019s Air Chief, said,\u00a0\u201cIt is a very honourable task for the Austrian Armed Forces to host the 2015 Symposium in our capital Vienna. In times of limited resources, but permanently growing mission challenges, cooperation will play a decisive role to maintain our operational freedom of action. One of the most important cooperation fields is military air transport, enabling us to project our forces and to sustain operations, even when civil transport and ATC systems are no longer available.\u00a0The Symposium offers an excellent opportunity, to discuss our common challenges and concerns.\" \u00a0 EDA continues to build strong links with the Europe\u2019s air power experts across a range of capabilities. The air transport programme remains vibrant with plans to further expand a range of training opportunities over 2015 and to establish a European Air Transport Training Centre in Zaragoza Spain by the end of 2016. \u00a0 Background The European Air Transport Fleet project (EATF) is designed to improve airlift provision within the European Union. EATF provides a flexible and inclusive partnership for national and multinational military air transport fleets and organisations in Europe. It addresses the way different air transport assets are acquired, operated, supported, and managed to ensure this is done in the most efficient way possible. The long term vision of the EATF is to establish a robust network linking various European air transport entities aiming at the efficient employment of all present and future air transport capabilities made available by the participating Member States for military needs, regardless of type or origin.\u00a0 Deliverables of the EATF are among others yearly training events (European Air Transport Training) and life airlift courses (European Airlift Tactics Training Course) as well as the European Air Transport Symposium. \u00a0 More information\u00a0 More information on the EATF is available\u00a0here.

It is important to underline the fact that previously involved industry unanimously supported the idea and joined in for the second session. Whilst LAVOSAR I focused mainly on mission systems of land vehicles of participating member states, LAVOSAR II went one step further to specify in more detail areas not covered before, e.g. selected aspects of maintenance and logistics. Several work packages which are currently under investigation in the ongoing LAVOSAR II study were incorporated in the workshop agenda. These included elements such as Architectural Domain Analysis and Requirements, Workflow and Procedure Update, Through Live Capability, Open Reference Architecture Standards Update, Alignment with NATO General Vehicle Architecture (NGVA) and Architecture Contribution to the EDA Repository. An important aspect of the LAVOSAR project is how it dovetails with NATO General Vehicle Architecture (NGVA) standardization efforts. As highlighted by Member States at the CapTech Ground Systems meetings, the LAVOSAR work should \u00a0complement other international organisations\u2019 efforts regarding the construction of an efficient open architecture\u00a0Marek Kalbarczyk, EDA moderator of the CapTech stressed the importance of the initiative: \u201cImplementation of open architecture to mission systems for land vehicles would bring not only whole life cost savings of between 10 - 25% to Member States, but would also simplify logistics and increase operational functionalities.\u201d Lively and fruitful discussions held throughout the workshop added substantial value to the ongoing LAVOSAR II study and will be integrated in the study results to advance work in the open architecture domain.

Jorge Domecq, the European Defence Agency (EDA) Chief Executive was among the keynote speakers to present the EDA work and priorities regarding tackling hybrid threats.\u00a0 The opening remarks were delivered by HE Ambassador Stephan M\u00fcller, the Luxembourg Representative to the Political and Security Committee (PSC), whereas the keynote speeches were presented by Mr Maciej Popowski, the EEAS Deputy Secretary General, Jorge Domecq, the EDA Chief Executive, and a representative of the Space, Policy, Copernicus and Defence Diractorate of the European Commission. \u201cOne thing is certain, hybrid warfare poses a significant challenge to the EU, its citizens and its interests, and time is of the essence to develop a joint approach to effectively tackle hybrid threats,\u201d said Jorge Domecq and presented three main areas the EDA activities are currently focused on. In particular, Jorge Domecq indicated capability development, civil-military synergies and EU-NATO relations. The EDA Chief Executive announced the upcoming EDA-led war-gaming exercise in February 2016 that shall stress-test available defence capabilities against hybrid threats. \u201cThe aim is not to re-invent and come up with a set of new capabilities, instead, the exercise will allow us to see where extra attention is needed and how the capability that exists should be used,\u201d he explained. Moreover, Jorge Domecq underlined the necessity of dual use within Research & Technology domain to avoid \u201cspending twice\u201d, thus to enhance civil-military synergy. Additionally, he emphasised the EU-NATO complementary approach in both directions regarding countering hybrid threats, claiming that this is \u201cnot an option, but an absolute need\u201d. Jorge Domecq\u2019s speech, along with the two other keynote presentations, provided solid grounds for fruitful discussions continued in three panels, which were devoted to various aspects of facing hybrid threats. Among a number of topics raised, the conference participants dwelled upon identifying vulnerabilities hybrid warfare makes use of, shaping awareness of hybrid threats, resilience and deterrence against possible threats, aspects of information sharing \u00a0or EU-NATO cooperation. As a matter of fact, Roland van Reybroeck, the EDA Director Cooperation Planning and Support was a speaker of the third panel discussion and talked about building resilience. Beyond achieving better understanding on hybrid threats, the discussions held at the conference will contribute to the ongoing works on the Joint Framework on Hybrid Warfare that shall be prepared by EEAS by the end of December, together with the Commission and EDA. \u201cIf Europe succeeds in offering a credible answer to hybrid treats, it will certainly enable us to make a very meaningful contribution to the security view, becoming a relevant partner and a security provider rather than a security consumer,\u201d said Jorge Domecq, the EDA Chief Executive.

Forty representatives from the Austrian Federal Chancellery, the Ministries of Interior, Justice, European and International Affairs, Defence and Sports as well as from seven private companies participate in the exercise which is hosted at the Austrian Defence College. The exercise is also observed by 40 national and international cyber security experts. The main aim of the exercise is to prepare strategic leaders to deal with cyberspace crisis management processes in complex situations and to promote a cyber security and cyber defence strategic culture. It also concentrates on stimulating national synergies and to foster EU member states cooperation.\u00a0 The exercise set-up includes presentations as well as a decision-making exercise and an in-depth feedback session. The exercise audience is confronted with a customised fictional political scenario where a crisis situation outside \u00a0EU boundaries spills back to an EU member state, here Austria. Manifestations of this spill over are an escalating sequence of targeted cyber-attacks of different degree of severity which are affecting both Austrian public and private sector entities, including national critical infrastructures such as telecommunications and Internet service providers, the energy sector, water supply and the public health care sector;all of this has had an impact on the public up to the level of casualties. The exercise audience is asked to apply the existing Austrian legal and political framework to the escalating scenario.

The exercise is following a playbook of more than 200 pages.\u00a0 Cyber defence \u2013 a key capability The previous two cyber defence exercises for decision-makers were organised in Portugal in May 2014 and Prague in June 2015. The initiative is part of the EDA\u2019s cyber defence work strand which among others aims at improving training, education and exercises opportunities as highlighted in the \"Cyber Defence Policy Framework\" which was adopted by the European Council in November 2014.\u00a0 \"The 2013 EDA landscaping study on cyber defence capabilities among EDA member states revealed a need for harmonised cyber training for decision makers.

Background Cyber defence is the military dimension of cyber security. The military requirements are to prepare for, prevent, detect, respond to, recover from and learn lessons from attacks, damage or un-authorized access originated from cyber space affecting systems and services that support and enable military tasks and operations.\u00a0 In the EDA\u2019s capability development plan, cyber defence is one of the priority actions. A project team of EDA and its participating Member States' representatives is responsible for jointly developing cyber defence capabilities within the EU common security and defence policy (CSDP). A network of EDA and Member States research & technology experts support this work by collaborative activities delivering the required technologies at the right time. All of this is positioned next to existing and planned efforts by civil communities (national and EU institutions) and NATO. Given that threats are multifaceted, a comprehensive approach is taken, seeking to enhance synergies between the civilian and military domains in protecting critical cyber assets. \u00a0 More information News \"Cyber defence exercise for decision makers\" (22 June 2015) Cyber defence project page ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/09/16/complex-cyber-crisis-management-exercise-in-vienna"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0524", "date": "2015-09-15", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "\"European Guardian 2015\" welcomes distinguished guests", "text": " Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) continue to cause significant casualties in operations as well as in civil surroundings.

This is no small feat: as is often pointed out, military fleets with some 9,500 diverse aircraft form the single biggest \u2018airline\u2019 operating in European airspace,with more than 150,000 flights each year. The unique structure of the EDA,whose experts interact on a daily basis with Ministries of Defence, allows us to gather inputs and requirements very early on. A dedicated \u2018SESAR Cell\u2019 set up within the EDA early last year provides us with a strong platform for interaction with all parties involved in the implementation of SESAR.\u00a0 As an Agency of the European Union, we\u2019re also in the best position to ensure smooth interactions with other EU actors, especially the Commission which needs a consolidated view of the defence community's specific needs regarding the Single European Sky.\u00a0 But the EDA is also closely coordinating with the EU Military Committee and EU Military Staff, especially with regard to operational implications and requirements, aswell as training aspects. This is all the more important now that SESAR has entered its Deployment Phase and newair traffic management functionalities will be introduced, some of whichmight have an adverse impact onmilitary operations. What process will you put in place to ensure a smooth interaction with Member States? Civil and military general air traffic (GAT) flights in 2013 Jpeg file (363Kb) The EDA is facilitating the coordination of military views on SES and SESAR. The idea is to analyse the technological projects submitted by other Single European Sky stakeholders ahead of their actual implementation, and to identify those who can impact the military community, from a financial or operational point of view.\u00a0 In support of this process a three step consultation mechanism was established with the aim of involving NATO and EUROCONTROL, who include military airspace users and navigation service providers beyond those of the European Union. The mechanism entails staff-to staff coordination and access to relevant expertise available in all three organisations, in order to develop joint military impact assessments of the SESAR deployment programme. These assessments are subsequently submitted to States for comments. The outcome of the mechanism is a consolidated opinion exported by the EDA as a collective view of the military. We have used this process for several initiatives: the adoption of EU Regulations, the development of the ATM Master Plan and now SESAR deployment. The work with Member States also involves identifying potential mitigation actions as and when required. This involves avoiding duplication of effort and reducing potential investment burdens, by recognizing that certain military systems are sufficient and robust enough to face SESAR requirements, based on equivalent level of performance. On the other hand it may include effectively ensuring the incorporation of military requirements in future SES development and SESAR deployment and ensuring access to EU-funding for related military projects which are already part of defence ministry investment plans or newly planned. In the regulatory domain it may include obtaining exemptions for the military, but only when absolutely necessary. The military indeed strive to be \u2018as civil as possible\u2019 but also need to remain \u2018as military as required\u2019. In which areas do EU air forces have specific requirements that need to be addressed? The defence community has always emphasized the prerequisite for air forces to have free and safe access to European airspace for training purposes, air-policing and air defence missions. There is also the need to safeguard their ability to deploy to external operation theatres from within the European airspace, as and when required. Let me clarify that by elaborating on a few examples.\u00a0 \u201cThe unique structure of the EDA, whose experts interact on a daily basis with Ministries of Defence, allows us to gather inputs and requirements very early on\u201d Preserving the capacity of the military to train properly means that military pilots need to reach dedicated manoeuvring areas that are often contiguous with airspace used by civil traffic. Access to these areas needs to be ensured in the context of a new SESAR environment which might induce some changes to current procedures or routes for military pilots.\u00a0 Safely operating across national and European airspace, including in the most dense and complex areas involves both operational and general air traffic, and ranges from logistic air transport to urgent military interventions in case of contingency situations. And, in the not so distant future, it may also involve safe and efficient integration of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), on a routine basis.\u00a0 The specific needs of state actors flying public-service missions such as search and rescue, airborne surveillance or firefighting also have to be taken into account.\u00a0 With all these requirements in mind, adverse impacts on both military and civil stakeholders should be avoided through systematic and enhanced civil-military dialogue at the earliest possible stage, first at national levels and then at a European level. Both parties should, side-by side, willingly engage in the cooperative development of harmonised solutions and common mitigation actions. Looking ahead, what do you expect will be the longterm benefits of this approach? The European Defence Agency clearly recognizes and acknowledges the crucial importance of the Single European Sky initiative of the European Commission, which aims at achieving, in the foreseeable future, improved efficiency, increased capacity, enhanced aviation safety, diminished environmental impact of flights and reduced costs of air traffic services. It is after all in themutual interest of all airspace users, private and public, commercial and governmental, civil and military, to reach these objectives which will contribute to increased efficiency, flexibility and safety, for all. It is a shared vision The highest priority for all stakeholders is clearly the safe operation of aircraft. The military fully support this objective and anything that can be done to make the airspace safer should be duly considered. Another major benefit shall be the harmonization of procedures and interoperability of systems across Member States to ensure appropriate access to airspace for all, civil and military alike. This implies the development of harmonised and coordinated civilmilitary implementation roadmaps governing the introduction of new technology or organisational and structural change, to ensure sustained compatibility if not interoperability. Furthermore, developing air traffic insertion solutions for RPAS, with a view to exploiting all potential synergies and developing common standards. But also, considering common education and training solutions for basic RPAS operations in non-segregated airspace, relying on existing experience and expertise from various operational environments. The EDA is ideally placed to facilitate cooperation in all of these areaswith relevantmilitary stakeholders and to provide access to a number of existing cooperation platforms for the development of harmonised civil/military solutions. The Military Airworthiness Authorities Forum, the Material Standardisation Group and the Defence Test and Evaluation Base are just a few examples of such cooperation platforms. The necessity to put into practice the legislative framework for the Single European Sky in a coherent and consistent way is fully shared, taking full account of economic necessities, but also of the requirements resulting from common and national security and defence policies. The shared vision of a Single European Airspace, delivering the benefits which are envisaged, can be achieved through constructive cooperation between civil and military stakeholders, based on the collective willingness to achieve the SES performance objectives, while at the same time enhancing military mission effectiveness. This endeavour should start at national levels between civil andmilitary airspace users, service providers and operators, through joint deployment projects that concretely will help building the Single European Sky piece by piece. It is clear that aviation industry as well can play a key contributing role in this perspective. The European Defence Agency is reaching out and ramping-up its coordination with all relevant stakeholders, in order to be a strong and reliable partner for civil-military cooperation and harmonisation, with a view to jointly building a Single European Sky in which the views and needs of the defence community are duly taken into account. \u00a0 \"Airspace is a single resource\" What is the timeline for the implementation of SESAR? Florian Guillermet SESAR JU Executive Director www.sesarju.eu Thanks to a strong collaboration between its members, the SESAR Joint Undertaking is already delivering the needed operational and technological improvements (\u2018SESAR Solutions\u2019) for industrialisation and deployment. Over the course of 2015 and 2016, our goal is to add many more to this catalogue of SESAR Solutions. In parallel, an extended programme (SESAR 2020) will address new challenges and evolutions in ATM and aviation necessary to reach the next level of performance. These activities will be fully aligned with the next edition of the ATM Master Plan, which will be finalised by the end of 2015. What are the specific requirements of the armed forces and how are they taken into account? SESAR is founded on the principle that European airspace is a single resource shared by all airspace users, whose diverse needs are fully recognised and answered. Thanks to a very sound cooperation with our military partners from States and military organisations, we have been able to integrate and respond to the needs of the armed forces through a number of dedicated projects. One area of focus has been the exchange of air-ground data messages between military aircraft and ATM systems. In response to concerns that SESAR Solutions could bring into the cockpit an assembly of costly avionics, SESAR members recently demonstrated how civil-military interoperability is possible on the principle of equivalence, using existing military capabilities thereby reducing implementation costs. What have been the most recent deliverables of the SESAR JU? A number of recently-delivered SESAR Solutions have already been implemented, such as the world\u2019s first Remote Tower Services (RTS) in Sweden supporting mobility and thereby economic sustainability for remote regions in Europe. Another significant milestone is the world\u2019s first 4D flights, which allows for more efficient flight paths and traffic flows, and ultimately more predictable flights. But perhaps, the most convincing proof of SESAR\u2019s readiness is the EU decision to deploy the first set of SESAR Solutions into the Pilot Common Project (PCP). This will allow for the crucial synchronised deployment across Europe (2015-2020). \u00a0 \"SESAR... is a powerful catalyst\" What is the role of the deployment manager? Massimo Garbini Managing Director SESAR Deployment Manager www.sesardeployment manager.eu The SESAR project is a powerful catalyst to transforming Europe\u2019s ATM network into a modern, cohesive and performance-based operational system. Proof of the readiness of SESAR research is the decision by the European Commission (EC) to package a first set of SESAR solutions into a Pilot Common Project (PCP), that are considered mature enough for synchronised deployment across Europe (2015-2020). This will be managed by the recently established SESAR Deployment Manager (SDM), an alliance of European ATM actors collaborating under a framework partnership agreement with the EC, who will ensure that new technologies and solutions that have already been tested and validated through the SESAR JU are delivered into everyday operations across Europe, delivering significant benefits to airspace users and the environment. This means that Europe now has all the blocks necessary to build the ATM system that it needs to increase the performance and sustainability of its aviation sector.\u00a0 How is the coordination of military and civil views organised in that context? The military is a very important stakeholders of the SESAR Deployment Manager (SDM). SDM will conclude a cooperative arrangement with EDA to formalise the exchange of information crucial for drawing up the Deployment Programme (DP).Also input from the operational military stakeholders shall be taken into account, through representation by the EDA, in the Stakeholder Consultation Platform.\u00a0 What will be the main milestones of the SESAR deployment programme? The Deployment Programme (DP) is not just another plan. The DP is direct input for the subsequent INEA-calls (Innovation & Networks Executive Agency) aimed at investing the CEF-funds (Connection Europe Facility). So there will be a sequence between the INEA-calls and the versions of the Deployment Programme. For now the first version of the DP should be delivered to DG Move by end of June 2015, as input for INEA-call expected by the end of 2015. Another INEA-call is expected by end 2016, so a second version (DP v2) is expected by mid-2016.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"Much greater focus on performance\" What impact does the military community have on European ATM \u2013 and vice versa? Philippe Merlo Director ATM, EUROCONTROL www.eurocontrol.int Europe has a single airspace shared between civilian and military airspace users. The military have a vital role to play, with specific needs for reserved airspace as certain times. They also have to be able to transit through airspace that is also being used by civilian traffic. There is today a much greater focus on performance \u2013 safety, capacity, cost efficiency and the environment. At the same time, civilian traffic is starting to increase again, with the latest forecast showing that 2021 will see nearly 1.8 million more flights than in 2014 \u2013 an increase of over 18%. So ATM has to evolve in order to maintain and even improve its performance. This will have implications both for how airspace is shared and also or for military aircraft flying in civilian-controlled airspace. How does EUROCONTROL take the specific needs of the armed forces into account? EUROCONTROL is a civil-military organisation and has a long and unique record of fostering civil-military and even military-military cooperation. One good example of this is the fact that one of the first of our new Centralised Services (CS4) is the Advanced Flexible Use of Airspace service, which is being developed to help ensure that military missions can be carried out effectively while maximising the availability of airspace for civil users. Just as important is the work done to ensure that the needs of the armed forces are considered when developing new ATM technologies and procedures. Here we can see the focus on developing ground infrastructure, rather than more aircraft equipage and on performance-based regulation. So rather than specifying what equipment aircraft should carry, the emphasis is more on what that equipment should be able to do. How do you interact with SESAR in that domain? We are a founding member of the SESAR Joint Undertaking, as well as being involved in a significant number of the SESAR projects including, in particular, the European ATM Master Plan. We are also developing our working relationship with bodies such as the European Commission, EASA, the new SESAR Deployment Manager as well as, of course, the EDA with whom we have a joint work programme. \u00a0 \"Higher civil /military interoperability\" How are the industry\u2019s interests represented within the SESAR endeavour? Luc Lalouette Head of SESAR Task Force with\u00a0the ASD\u00a0 www.asd-europe.org \u201cAll of us have to keep in mind that the European Air Forces are the biggest fleet operators and airports owners and as such have a key role to play in the SES developments\u201d The industry\u2019s interests are both directly and indirectly represented within the SESAR endeavour. Directly, through the pro-active contribution of the key air traffic management (ATM) industrial stakeholders in the SESAR Joint Undertaking structure on the ground and in the air, more than 30% of the funding of the SESAR JU is provided by industry. Indirectly, and in a larger manner than the SESAR JU members, the industry\u2019s interests are represented through its active involvement in SESAR deployment preparation in support of discussions with European bodies and, as recognized by the European bodies, at a later stage through the support of the Deployment Manager. The AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe is involved in the SESAR deployment phase in governance and financing and in the synchronization and interoperability between SESAR and NextGen deployment. What is the technological spillover effect of SESAR on the global ATC/ATM industry? As the technical evolutions in the ATM market are strongly dependent on standardization and norms, SESAR is, in Europe, the key driver to facilitate and accelerate such evolutions due to its large scope and its consensus approach to functional and technical contents. Potential benefits also exist outside Europe, pending SESAR capabilities to disseminate its outcomes and to be synchronized - both in term of planning and content \u2013 with NextGen. SESAR coordinates ATM research and development (R&D) activities in Europe, however the human and financial resources that SESAR asks of companies leads to questions about its remaining capability to create technological differentiators amongst them. Do you see potential specific developments linked to the military needs regarding the Single European Sky? The Single European Sky, due to its nature, calls for higher ATM civil/military coordination and interoperability in order to increase the ATM performance while maintaining the military\u2019s freedom to operate its various missions assigned by its national authorities. The degree of coordination will depend of the situation (peace/war), the nature of the fleet (transport/combat fighter/rotorcraft) and the operational concepts in place within European nations.\u00a0 However, we can already foresee the need for specific developments \u2013 both at the technical and procedural level \u2013 in the following areas: Command and control (C2) and military ATC systems to allow interoperability with civilian ATC systems (trajectory management, airspace management, etc) Non-radar surveillance due to its impact on military and governmental flight security (automatic dependent surveillance \u2013 broadcast [ADS-B], multilateration [MLAT] etc) Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) integration into non-segregated airspace (sense and avoid capability) Military fleet equipment to limit the need for exemptions Those needs require fast progress in military cooperation within the framework of the SES. This could be achieved through a deep analysis of potential achievements through performance equivalence and experiments to validate the technological and procedural enhancements needed to fill the gaps. All of us have to keep in mind that Europe\u2019s air forces operate the largest fleets of aircraft and own the largest number of airport so they have a key role to play in SES developments. SES benefits for Europe\u2019s citizens will not be achieved without the active role of Europe\u2019s air forces. \u00a0 \u00a0 A", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/08/03/sharing-european-skies"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0531", "date": "2015-07-15", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Protecting marine mammals", "text": " Three Member States gathered under the framework of the European Defence Agency to launch a project aimed at developing European navies\u2019 knowledge of marine mammals activity while mitigating the adverse effect of military operations on these species. The formal signature of a technical agreement is expected for the 2nd semester of 2015. With a planned total budget of \u20ac1,5 million, the project is led by Germany with participation from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The main objective of the PoMM2 (Protection of Marine Mammals 2) project is to establish a common risk assessment methodology and evaluate mitigation procedures regarding the potential adverse effect of naval operations on marine mammals. For instance, the use of active sonars or underwater explosions in anti-submarine warfare operations has previously been linked with strandings of whales. Developing knowledge-based risk-mitigation measures and precautionary restrictions on the use of certain military systems could help reduce this adverse effect while developing European navies\u2019 knowledge of marine mammals. This new project is a follow-up to the original PoMM study carried out between 2010 and 2013 under an EDA framework. It helped establish an initial marine mammal database of 126 different species which will serve as a basis for the common risk-assessment methodology to be developed as part of PoMM2.\u00a0 Picture credit: Patrick Hawks / Wikimedia Commons More information Maritime Mine Counter Measures\u00a0 Unmanned Maritime Systems ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/07/15/protecting-marine-mammals"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0532", "date": "2015-07-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Federica Mogherini appoints new chairmen for EDA Steering Boards", "text": " Federica Mogherini, Head of the European Defence Agency, appoints three new chairmen for the EDA Steering Boards in National Armaments Directors, Capability Directors and R&T Directors compositions.

In this interview we address the topic with EDA project officer Axel Butenschoen. Axel\u00a0 Butenschoen\u00a0is Project Officer for Capability Development Plan within the European Defence Agency. How does hybrid warfare differ from \u201cconventional\u201d warfare? Is it really something new? From an academic point of view we have to state that a broadly accepted definition of \u201chybrid warfare\u201d does not exist yet.\u00a0One reason could be that by nature the characteristics of this new type of threat is evolving nearly on a daily basis. However, amongst analysts there are common elements describing this phenomenon of new threats by \u201cviolent threats that are simultaneously carried out by state- and non-state actors along all conventional and unconventional lines of operation within a not exclusively military but also diplomatic, information and economic dimensions of conflict in order to achieve a political goal\u201d. From my perspective all the individual elements, for example information warfare, cyber-attacks, conventional military aggressions and destabilisation operations are individually well known but the synchronized, combined approach adds a new dimension to our understanding of aggression. Why does hybrid warfare matter to EU Member States? During the past years Europe\u2019s security has been challenged significantly by this new dimension of conflicts at its eastern and southern borders. The paramount question now is how to counter these so called hybrid threats? Are EU Member States prepared for this challenge and do we have the adequate set of tools in our toolbox? How can EU instruments also support Member States? During the recent European Council, Heads of States and Governments acknowledged the importance of the subject and it can be expected that the EU global strategy on foreign and security policy, to be delivered in 2016, will address the hybrid dimension accordingly. \u00a0 \u00a0 What role could the Agency play in supporting its Member States\u2019 counter hybrid capabilities ? First of all I believe that exclusive counter-hybrid \u00a0capabilities do not exist. As explained earlier the new character posed by Hybrid threats is the coordinated combination of more or less existing capabilities by potential adversaries. Consequently, any kind of response also requires a comprehensive but effective approach. In this regard the EDA will not enter into an academic discussion but focus on the military capability dimension.\u00a0 Together with Member States and other relevant stakeholders we will conduct a series of subsequent assessments in order to identify the implications of Hybrid warfare for defence capability development in Europe. The results will be presented to Ministers and Capability directors for their consideration; it will support Member States\u2019 efforts in countering Hybrid threats. At the same time the objective is to stress test existing Priorities and identify possible need for amendments.\u00a0 This EDA activity will also supplement other initiatives carried out in this context, \u00a0for example within the European External Action Service, in charge of preparing a joint communication on hybrid warfare. \u00a0At this stage one cannot anticipate the results but the key question: \u201cAre European Member States prepared to counter hybrid threats?\u201d may be answered with findings in line with \u00a0\u201cWe have adequate capabilities in place but we need to rethink the way we deploy in a more coherent, comprehensive way\u201d. Also such possible outcomes would be of added value and could trigger effective follow-on activities so that Europe stands ready for these new threats. \u00a0 More information Hybrid warfare project page ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/07/22/interview-the-hybrid-warfare-challenge"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0536", "date": "2015-07-09", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Support to operations: new opportunities", "text": " The European Defence Agency (EDA) recently published two calls for tender from operation EUFOR ALTHEA on its Contractor Support to Operations (CSO) platform.

Several activities are now ongoing to develop the role of the Agency in support of CSDP military and civilian operations or missions as well as EU Battlegroups at the request of Member States. Procurement of contracted solutions has become increasingly relevant for EU military operations not only to fill capability gaps in the force generation process, but also as a general planned support for ongoing operations. The arrangement with ATHENA opens the option for the Athena Administrator or any Operation/Mission Commanders as Contracting Authorities to call upon EDA to provide, upon its expertise and available means and capabilities, technical and overall administrative support for procurement of infrastructure works, as well as a variety of services or supplies, through direct contracts or pre-mission solutions, e.g. through framework contracts. The Agency plans to further upgrade the CSO platform to respond to new requirements and to turn the platform into an one-stop solution for procurement by operations.

It is widely expected to lead to new and improved applications for defence. On 2 June, 25 experts from Ministries of Defence, European entities, industry and academia participated in an EDA workshop to discuss current and future areas of application of graphene in defence at the Swedish Defence Research Agency FOI in Link\u00f6ping. Graphene has a wide number of potential applications interesting for defence such as advance camouflage systems and lighter or stronger protections. The objective of the workshop was to gather experts in related fields to discuss possible future defence applications and areas of applicability of graphene technologies. The discussion was focused on how to enhance composites and coatings by including graphene and on its possible use in adaptive camouflage, due to its thermal and electrical conductivity properties, and protection systems, based on its strength and low weight. The outcomes of the workshop will be further analysed to identify how graphene technology can support the EDA Capability Development Plan (CDP), taking into account the Materials & Structures CapTech Strategic Research Agenda (SRA), and if possible, to create a technology roadmap towards achieving the required maturity of graphene based applications for defence.

This should improve cyber resilience and raise the levels of awareness, insight and expertise of national and EU personnel. The EU Cyber Security Strategy recognises cyber defence as one of its strategic priorities. The military requirements on cyber defence capabilities are inter alia to prepare for, prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from cyber-attacks. In June 2012, the EDA made an initial proposal for cooperative cyber defence training, exercises and testing under the Pooling & Sharing agenda. Interoperability of cyber ranges will have a positive effect on cooperation among operational cyber defence systems, organisations and processes, thereby improving the effectiveness and efficiency of CSDP operations and multinational exercises. The project will be carried out under the EU Pooling & Sharing agenda and aims at: Increasing availability of existing cyber range facilities; Increasing occupation rate and efficiency of existing cyber ranges and platforms; Mainstreaming and improving cyber defence training, exercises & testing at European level. The military requirements approved now describe the way ahead through an EDA ad hoc project on cyber ranges in a spiral approach until 2018 (full operational capability).

Its purpose is to establish efficient cooperation and support between the two organisations with regard to SESAR deployment. \u201cEurope\u2019s military fleets include some 9,500 diverse aircraft accounting for more than 150,000 flights each year. In other words, they form the single biggest \u2018airline\u2019 operating in Europe today. The challenges of the Single European Sky programme and the modernisation of European air traffic management are manifold. However, it is the role of the EDA to ensure that the European air forces will continue to have free and safe access to European airspace for training purposes, air-policing, as well as air defence missions. The financial and technological impacts of the programme need to be mitigated to ensure that they do not adversely affect European defence capabilities. Only through constructive cooperation between military and civil stakeholders, our shared vision of an efficient, safe and flexible European airspace can be realised. It is in this spirit that we sign the Memorandum of Understanding today\u201d, said Jorge Domecq at the signature ceremony.\u00a0 Massimo Garbini, \u201cThis MoU reflects the kind of relationship we aim for with all stakeholders. Only through efficient cooperation and mutual support between both civil and military stakeholders, we can deliver the modernisation of European Air Traffic Management technology together.\u201d Memorandum of Understanding The scope of the MoU covers the SESAR deployment of sets of functionalities in accordance with the relevant regulations1. The EDA and SDM will work together to support the Member States in translating the regulation into projects to be deployed nationally with financial support from the EU. The EDA will ensure that military viewpoints and needs are captured in the SESAR Deployment Programme and support the bidding and execution processes of the projects. At the same time, the Deployment Manager will coordinate with the military through the EDA to avoid any adverse impact on national and collective defence capabilities. This involves inter alia enabling and exploiting military contributions as well as optimising the use of expertise and avoiding duplications. The EDA and SDM also agree to put in place effective coordination procedures to ensure efficient synchronisation and the timely exchange of relevant information. A Steering Committee will be set up to ensure the effective functioning of the Memorandum. \u00a0 Single European Sky ATM Research The Single European Sky (SES) aims at realising the optimisation of the airspace organisation and management in Europe through a combination of technological, economic, and regulatory efforts. SESAR (Single European Sky ATM Research) is the technical pillar of this. SESAR involves developing a new ATM system to handle more traffic with greater safety and at a lower cost. Its new technologies and procedures will also seek to reduce the environmental impact of flying. The resulting efforts will be deployed in a synchronised manner involving all stakeholders, civil and military. \u00a0 About SESAR Deployment Manager SESAR Deployment Manager (SDM) is the industrial partnership that synchronises and coordinates the modernisation of Europe\u2019s air traffic management system under the political oversight of the European Commission. The main task of the SESAR Deployment Manager is to develop, submit to the European Commission for its approval and execute the Deployment Programme, a project view strictly drawn from the Pilot Common Project (PCP) set by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 716/2014, as well as any subsequent Common Projects in future regulations. Through the Deployment Programme, the SESAR Deployment Manager will ensure efficient synchronisation and coordination of implementation projects required to implement the PCP, as well as the related investments. The tasks of the Deployment Manager are described in Article 9 of\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 409/2013. \u00a0 Role of the EDA In order to ensure that the effects on military aviation are understood and taken into account, Member States entrusted EDA with the task of facilitating the coordination of military views from and in support of Member States and relevant military organisations and to inform military planning mechanisms of the requirements stemming from SESAR deployment. In 2014, EDA established a dedicated SESAR Cell to ensure that the military views and requirements are taken into account in the implementation of SESAR. \u00a0 More information Single European Sky project page SESAR Deployment Manager website ----------------------------------------------\u00a0 1\u00a0Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 409/2013 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 716/2014 ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/06/30/eda-and-sesar-deployment-manager-seal-cooperation"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0545", "date": "2015-06-30", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Commissioner Christos Stylianides visits EDA", "text": " European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management Christos Stylianides visited the European Defence Agency today to exchange views and cooperation opportunities with EDA staff and top management.

As with previous HEP live-flying exercises, Italian Blade\u2019s main objectives will be to train European helicopter crews in conditions likely to be faced in possible future operations, while promoting cooperation in helicopters training and developing joint interoperability between multinational elements, both in the air and on the ground. A particular focus will be given to the integration of ground forces into the exercise\u2019s scenarios so as to develop common procedures and build trust between flying crews and ground personnel from different nations. The HEP exercises are only one of multiple projects undertaken by the European Defence Agency to increase the overall availability of European military helicopters, with other initiatives such as the Helicopter Tactics Course (HTC) or the Helicopter Tactics Instructor Course (HTIC) now ongoing. These efforts demonstrate that at very low-cost, quick operational benefits can be yielded to ensure success on tomorrow\u2019s battlefields.

Working on a tasking from the December 2013 European Council, the European Defence Agency is bringing its expertise to this work strand through the organisation of workshops with the Commission and the discussion of modalities related to the future Pilot Project on CSDP Research. The High-level Group is chaired by Commissioner El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska and supported by the High Representative, Commission Vice-President and Head of the European Defence Agency Federica Mogherini \u2013 who has been represented by EDA Chief Executive Jorge Domecq in the Group of Personalities. It is expected to make recommendations for a long-term vision for EU-funded CSDP-related defence research in support of European defence cooperation. While the Group will report in full in early 2016, it offers now the following considerations as a preliminary contribution in the run up to the June 2015 European Council. Official Statement by the Group of Personalities on defence research \u00a0 The EU's security role and the need for a strong EDTIB To ensure its long-term security, the EU and its Member States need political will and determination underpinned by a broad set of relevant instruments, including strong and modern military capabilities. These will enable the EU to live up to its responsibilities as a security provider and to be a relevant and reliable partner at global level. Investing today in future-oriented defence research programmes is crucial to developing the capabilities that will be required tomorrow. It is widely recognised that Europe needs to retain robust military capabilities in its Member States, which, however, can no longer afford to sustain a full range of defence industrial assets on a purely national basis. Years of defence spending cuts by EU countries risk producing a net loss of combined military and industrial capabilities. And while defence-related research is pivotal in maintaining the technological edge that ensures military advantage, European investment in defence R&D has declined by more than 29 % since 2006 \u2013 and by more than 27 % in R&T. The European defence industry needs therefore to become more integrated and more sustainable in order to maintain critical mass and global competitiveness, to remain an equal and attractive partner internationally, and to generate the key defence technologies needed to ensure Europe\u2019s long-term operational autonomy. A common understanding of the capability-driven research areas that should be developed cooperatively - and of the ways to identify and select them - will be required, taking into account all existing processes at EU level. The role of future collaborative programmes in addressing capability gaps Cooperative defence research programmes will clearly be essential for sustaining and fostering key military capabilities in Europe and addressing well-known shortfalls. Currently, however, only 8% of national defence budgets are spent on collaborative projects. The Preparatory Action and its follow-on programme can contribute significantly to the development of crucial military capabilities for Europe and help ensure the sustainability and competitiveness of the European defence industrial sector - from prime contractor level through to SMEs - thus also underpinning the Union\u2019s long-term security. The Preparatory Action should therefore pave the way to a substantial and ambitious CSDP-related defence research programme in the next EU multi-annual funding framework, thus making a quantitative and qualitative difference to the current situation and demonstrating the added value of a permanent EU scheme. Key principles for EU-funded CSDP-related defence research The future research programme must be clearly defence-oriented, coherent with and complementary to existing national defence research efforts, and must take fully into account the unique aspects of the defence sector in its governance principles and modalities. It must help address specific capability needs stemming from the evolving security environment, avoid duplications, and catalyse collaborative research efforts. The Preparatory Action needs to properly test the effectiveness and relevance of EU-funded defence research and the appropriateness of the proposed governance model. As such, it should be endowed with appropriate and credible means \u2013 preferably up to the maximum budget allowed by the legal framework.

The initiative is an important contribution to the implementation of the EU Cyber Defence Policy Framework, notably on awareness raising for CSDP structures, missions and operations. By joining the pledge, the signatory Member States promise to adopt and implement internal guidelines for best behavioural principles for cyber hygiene by the end of 2016. This includes, for example, introducing a mandatory e-learning platform. Initiated by the Latvian Presidency of the Council of the EU and the Estonian Ministry of Defence, the initiative calls to strengthen cyber security culture as low awareness and human-related risks are a common cause of cyber incidents. A large number of cyber incidents can be avoided, or their effects greatly mitigated, if certain behavioural cyber security procedures and implementation measures are applied. It is part of a wider project, which aims to educate the members of defence sector institutions on secure behaviour while using online resources.\u00a0 Beyond its commitment to implement internal guidelines, the Agency will contribute to expanding this initiative to other interested EU Member States. EDA activities The December 2013 European Council identified cyber defence as one of the priority areas to take forward in the European Union. Furthermore, in November 2014 the Council adopted the EU Cyber Defence Policy Framework. Cyber defence has also been identified as a priority area in the EDA\u2019s Capability Development Plan.\u00a0 The armed forces are reliant on cyberspace both as a user and as a domain to achieve defence and security missions. The Agency is active in the fields of cyber defence capabilities and in the research & technology domain. In the last three years, the Agency has completed ten cyber defence related projects with a financial volume of about two million euros. This equals to approximately 10% of EDA\u2019s operational budget. Among these ten projects are a stocktaking study of cyber defence capabilities among all EDA Member States and EU institutions, the establishment of a cyber defence research agenda and cyber defence training courses for senior military decision makers as well as the assessment of the feasibility of a EU Cyber Defence Centre for CSDP.\u00a0 Copyright picture: European Union, 2015.\u00a0 From left to right: Ms. Jeanine HENNIS-PLASSCHAERT, Dutch Minister of Defence; Mr Gerald KLUG, Austrian Federal Minister for Defence and Sport; Mr Sven MIKSER, Estonian Minister of Defence; Ms. Federica MOGHERINI, High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy; Mr Raimonds VEJONIS, Latvian Minister for Defence; Mr Juozas OLEKAS, Lithuanian Minister for National Defence; Ms. Piritta ASUNMAA, PSC Ambassador of Finland More information: EDA factsheet on cyber defence News item Latvian Ministry of Defence\u00a0 ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/05/19/initiative-to-mitigate-human-related-risks-in-cyber-space-signed"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0563", "date": "2015-05-20", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "2015 EDA-Egmont PhD prize awarded", "text": " The European Defence Agency and the Egmont Institute are proud to announce that the 2015 EDA-Egmont PhD prize has been awarded to Mr. Andrea Gilli for his research work on armaments cooperation.

It complements the contributions from the High Representative /Head of Agency Federica Mogherini and Commissioner Bie\u0144kowska. Among others, Ministers agreed on analysing the implications of hybrid warfare for European defence capability development, on further incentivising defence cooperation including the Preparatory Action on CSDP-related research, on a SME Action Plan, on potential basic principles, objectives and actions for a Security of Supply regime as well as future priorities of the Agency.\u00a0 Capability development During today\u2019s meeting, Defence Ministers welcomed the progress achieved in the implementation of the 2013 European Council Conclusions. The four capability programmes on Air-to-Air Refuelling, Cyber Defence, Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems and Governmental Satellite Communications endorsed by the European Council in 2013 are making good progress in line with their roadmaps.\u00a0 Cooperative programmes are important for enhancing capabilities in Europe, but also for clarifying priorities for industry. Defence Ministers agreed that potential additional priority capability areas could be investigated using the Agency\u2019s Capability Development Plan, an assessment of cooperative opportunities derived from the Collaborative Database (CODABA) and EU wider policies.\u00a0 The Agency was also tasked to conduct an analysis of the implications of hybrid warfare for European defence capability development in light of the changed security environment to the East and South. The analysis might form part of wider efforts, co-ordinated by the External Action Service and also including the Commission, to analyse the impact of hybrid warfare on the European security environment and to identify, and recommend improvements to existing EU tools and instruments that are best suited to counter this threat. \u00a0 Incentives for defence cooperation While Member States spent 26% of their defence equipment budget in collaborative procurement in 2011, this ratio was 16% in 2013. There is a need to spend better on defence, and to do more together.\u00a0 Defence Ministers today confirmed the need for \u00a0EDA to work on \u00a0non-market distorting fiscal and financial measures to further incentivise defence cooperation. Tangible progress has been achieved on VAT exemption for ad hoc projects in EDA, with the support of the Commission and the Belgian authorities. Three pilot cases currently benefit from VAT exemption. Formalisation of this VAT exemption is pending the currently ongoing review of the EDA Council Decision. EDA is investigating with Member States financial engineering mechanisms in support of defence cooperation, including a potential European investment fund for defence, for example to improve the availability of funds and the synchronisation of budgets allocated to cooperative programmes. This fund could be part of the pooled procurement mechanism. In addition, EDA has initiated contacts with the European Investment Bank to investigate potential financial support to the industrial sector and cooperative programmes of a dual-use nature. In November 2014 the EDA proposed and Member States approved a Policy Framework for long-term and systematic cooperation. Its objective is to provide a coherent basis for defence cooperation in Europe, from priority-setting through in-service support to disposal/decommissioning. \u00a0 Preparatory Action on CSDP-related research There is a need to halt the continuing decline in investment of defence R&T and maintain competence in areas of critical technologies. The Preparatory Action on CSDP-related research, and its potential follow-on action in the next Multiannual Financial Framework, could provide fresh impetus. Ministers of Defence supported the progress achieved towards the development of the Preparatory Action by the European Defence Agency and the European Commission in close cooperation with the Member States. \u00a0They endorsed consolidated views pushing for a defence-oriented and CSDP-related Preparatory Action. The European Council in June 2015 is expected to provide further guidance.\u00a0 SME Action Plan Defence Ministers furthermore agreed on revised guidelines for facilitating access to the defence market for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), supporting the implementation of the \u00a0Agency\u2019s SME Action Plan. SMEs are considered to be the backbone of the EU economy in terms of jobs creation, growth and innovation. The role of SMEs in the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) has gradually increased over time, partly as a result of greater outsourcing. The non-binding guidelines were prepared in close cooperation with the Member States and the European Commission. They contain recommendations dedicated to access to supply chain, access to finance, support to innovation, competitiveness and industrial performance, and security of supply aspects.\u00a0 Security of Supply Security of Supply arrangements are indispensable for the sustainment of operations, the development of long-term planning and cooperation, and the functioning of the internal market for defence. The December 2013 European Council called on the Commission to develop with Member States and in cooperation with the High Representative and the EDA a roadmap for a comprehensive EU-wide Security of Supply regime, which takes account of the globalised nature of critical supply chains. Due to the significance and multi-dimensional nature of the Security of Supply and taking into account experience gained from its work and activities, the EDA has together with its Member States identified potential basic principles and objectives of such a \u00a0regime as well as actions that could be taken at the intergovernmental level. Proposed actions include establishing specific measures to ensure access \u00a0to critical capabilities and technologies, e.g. through an early-warning or prioritisation mechanism, developing a mechanism to address concrete short term shortfalls, promoting cross-border cooperation, and bringing the supply and demand side closer together, for example through user-clubs. \u00a0 Future priorities of EDA\u00a0 Ministers of Defence today endorsed the future priorities of the EDA including three core activities to further strengthen defence cooperation: support the development of capabilities and military cooperation; stimulate defence R&T to prepare the capabilities of tomorrow and support the EDTIB; and ensure that the interests and specificities of defence are taken into account in wider EU policies. Under the authority of Federica Mogherini, the Head of the Agency, EDA is a key instrument for supporting and facilitating defence cooperation in Europe. EDA\u2019s strength is that it is Member State-owned and -driven. To date, EDA has managed around 150 R&T projects with a total aggregate budget of almost \u20ac500m.\u00a0 \u00a0 More information: The Council Conclusions on CSDP are available here.\u00a0 ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/05/18/outcome-of-the-eda-steering-board"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0565", "date": "2015-05-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Jorge Domecq meets Maltese Minister of Home Affairs and National Security", "text": " In the margins of the EDA Steering Board, Jorge Domecq, EDA Chief Executive, met with Carmelo Abela, Maltese Minister of Home Affairs and National Security to exchange views on Malta\u2019s involvement in EDA projects.

The DeSIRE II demonstration is expected to run for 18 months with a total budget of \u20ac2,6 million. An industrial consortium led by Telespazio, one of the world\u2019s leading company in space applications and end-to-end satellite communications services, will act as prime contractor and system integrator. The main results and recommendations coming out of the project will be disseminated to support European standardisation and regulatory activities, especially for the definition of future satellite-based command & control datalinks. During DeSIRE II, a Piaggio Aero P.1HH HammerHead will be used as a flying testbed for the development, integration and testing of a set of capabilities designed to allow safe RPAS operation in civilian airspace in support of missions such as environment monitoring, maritime surveillance or crisis management. The joint EDA-ESA project will also aim at characterising Satcom command and control datalinks in different frequency bands through simulation, emulation and flight demonstration campaigns. Meanwhile, DeSIRE II will be also be supported by end users (Italian Coast Guard, Italian Civil Protection Department, Guardia di Finanza, European Fisheries Control Agency, Ceren and Armasuisse) who will consolidate their operational and regulatory requirements to operate RPAS in non-segregated airspace.\u00a0 This new project is a follow-on to the first DeSIRE demonstration, an EDA-ESA project led by Spanish company Indra which ran from 2011 to 2013.

During the visit Cyprus confirmed its participation in the Agency\u2019s EU Satcom Market pooled procurement initiative for commercial satellite communications. Mr. Domecq also held discussions with the Cypriot Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Ioannis Kasoulides.\u00a0 \u201cI would like to underline my satisfaction for the productive meeting we had today with the Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency. I had the opportunity to reiterate our firm will to further enhance our contribution and support to the common initiatives and efforts of the Agency. The signing today of the Satcom Market Joint Procurement Arrangement is just an indication of this. In addition, we have also agreed today to co-organise an important Maritime Security Conference here in Cyprus next November which reflects the emphasis that we want to attribute in this field but also the role that Cyprus can play\u201d, stressed Minister Fokaides. \u201cSatellite communications are a scarce and investment-intensive capability. The Agency\u2019s approach to pool Member State\u2019s demand of commercially available satellite communications aims to reduce costs, ease access, and improve operational efficiency. There are only advantages for Member States, since they only pay what they use at the best price and when needed. This is why I welcome Cyprus\u2019 decision\u201d, stressed Jorge Domecq during his visit in Cyprus.\u00a0 EU Satcom Market Commercial satellite communications are used by all nations to provide extra capacity on top of their own military and governmental satellite communications. The EU Satcom Market provides a flexible and cost-effective way of doing this, with the European Defence Agency acting as the central purchasing body for all participating countries. So far, Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxemburg, Poland, Romania, and the United Kingdom take part in the project. Since the launch of the project, 20 orders have been processed through this procurement cell, for a total value of about 2.5 million euros. Member States are already forwarding their requirements for 2015 and it is expected that their interest and usage will increase significantly. Visit to Member States The visit in Cyprus also allowed for meetings with other high-ranking officials of the Ministry of Defence, as well as briefings about the armed forces of Cyprus and research initiatives.

Major milestones included fully automatic avoidance manoeuvres of a Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) relying on fusion of non-cooperative sensors. Successful completion of flight tests Flights with a demonstrator Detect & Avoid (D&A) system integrated in the Sky-Y RPAS test bed have been conducted since December 2014 at Grazzanise Air Force Base, Italy. First fully automatic coupled avoidance manoeuvres were performed by the RPAS based on combined cooperative and non-cooperative detection as well as non-cooperative detection only and put on collision course with a manned aircraft. The MIDCAS system had full authority over the RPAS flight control system.\u00a0 The formal flight test permit to perform the automatic manoeuvre was obtained using results from earlier flight tests demonstrating the readiness to safely perform such critical manoeuvres.\u00a0Flight tests have covered numerous scenarios and sensor combinations bringing RPAS traffic integration a significant step closer to reality. The Detect and Avoid system tested, performs collision avoidance and traffic avoidance using data fusion for various combinations of the included detection technologies, i.e. the cooperative IFF and ADS-B equipment and the non-cooperative electro-optical, infrared and radar sensors. Important simulations Several types of simulations (including Monte Carlo simulations and real-time simulations) have been completed which will allow the project teams to demonstrate that the functional design of MIDCAS can be compliant with the safety levels for manned aviation. Simulations in Air Traffic Management (ATM) environment have also been performed to validate the system requirements in an operational context. \u201cWe are pleased with the outcome of the simulations where the involved air traffic controllers concluded that they were confident to control RPAS within their airspace and did not get any additional workload from the RPAS, whose behavior was fully in line with manned aviation\u201d, MIDCAS project leader Johan Pellebergs explains. MIDCAS is the European Detect & Avoid project The MIDCAS project is laying the groundwork for future developments in the field of RPAS air traffic integration. The project has gathered European industries within the field of D&A with the purpose to achieve jointly agreed results with European and global standardisation stakeholders.The MIDCAS project was launched in 2009 by five contributing Member States (France,\u00a0Germany, Italy and Spain under the lead of Sweden) under the framework of the European Defence Agency, with a total budget of \u20ac50 million.\u00a0 \u201cThe project has produced tangible results in the field of air traffic integration, which is a critical enabler for the use of RPAS in European skies\u201d, Peter Round, EDA Capability, Armament & Technology Director, says. \u201cIn order to improve Member States\u2019 RPAS capabilities, technological and regulatory issues need to be taken into account as early as possible\u201d, he adds.\u00a0 MIDCAS has been carried out by an industrial consortium composed of 11 partners: Saab (project leader) from Sweden, Sagem and Thales from France, Airbus D&S, Diehl BGT Defence, DLR and ESG from Germany, Alenia Aermacchi, Selex ES, CIRA from Italy and Indra from Spain. Throughout the project, external stakeholders such as EASA, EUROCONTROL, EUROCAE or JARUS, were involved in the process. \u201cThe only way to achieve a high level of acceptance and reach a common European agreement on how to resolve the D&A issue is through close cooperation\u201d, Johan Pellebergs concludes.

Improving interoperability Initiated by the European Defence Agency and run by the European Air Transport Command, the EAATTC series of courses aim to provide air transport crews with a robust airlift tactics training syllabus in order to enhance interoperability between European air forces. The next edition of the course, EAATTC 15-2 will take place 18-29 May in Orl\u00e9ans and will be hosted by the French Air Force.\u00a0 The EAATTC series of courses is one of the deliverables of the European Air Transport Fleet partnership, launched in 2011 by 20 participating nations under the framework of the European Defence Agency.\u00a0 More information Link to EAATTC 15-1 factsheet Story on the European Air Transport Command's website European Air Transport Fleet project page ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/04/10/european-aircrews-graduate-from-eaattc-15-1"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0583", "date": "2015-04-17", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Meeting with Croatian Defence Minister in Zagreb", "text": " Ante Kotromanovi\u0107, Minister of Defence of the Republic of Croatia and Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the EDA met yesterday to exchange views ahead of the June 2015 European Council and to discuss Croatia\u2019s participation in EDA projects. Minister Kotromanovi\u0107 underlined the important role of the Agency in fostering cooperation between Member States and improving their capabilities. He said: \"We see the Agency as an important platform and mechanism for strengthening and further development of European defence capabilities. As a new EDA member, Croatia recognises the possibilities the Agency can provide to Member States, and we're analysing programmes in which we see the potential for cooperation. Those projects will have our full support.\u201d The Minister also emphasised capacities and significance of the Croatian defence industry sector and its achievements. \u201cI strongly believe we need to support participation of small and medium enterprises in cooperative programmes, where dual-use programmes have great importance and potential\". \u201cCroatia has joined the European Defence Agency not even two years ago. Notwithstanding this short period of time, Croatia is actively participating in some of our key projects as for example the military implementation of the Single European Sky. The role of the Agency is to act as an interface between the European Commission and the national Ministries of Defence to ensure that the military views are well taken into account in the modernisation of the European skies. At the same time, we also inform the Member States of the latest developments in Brussels. The Agency can furthermore provide valuable support to the national defence industry and in particular small and medium sized enterprises by providing information on funding for dual-use research\u201d, Jorge Domecq stated during his visit in Zagreb. The visit also included meetings with other high-level officials of the Croatian Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs and the Croatian Chamber of Economy. It is part of a series of visits by Mr. Domecq to all EDA Member States following his appointment as EDA Chief Executive and ahead of the Ministerial Steering Board on 18 May 2015. So far, Mr. Domecq visited Spain, Lithuania, Latvia, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany, Portugal, the Netherlands, Ireland, France, Romania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Slovenia.

Major issues such as security of supply or support to the European defence technological and industrial base (EDTIB), including efforts in favor of a balanced EDTIB, can also be tackled through the EDA\u2019s framework. To this specific end the EDA will dedicate a roundtable to the defence industries of Central and Eastern European countries during the IDET defence exhibition which will take place next month in Brno. During my visit here, I also had the chance to get a glimpse at some of Czech Republic\u2019s industrial capabilities and I am convinced that the European approach can be greatly beneficial to local actors. Our flexible structure allows us to meet a wide spectrum of demands from our Member States, including through regional cooperation\u201d, Jorge Domecq said during his visit.\u00a0 The visit is part of a series of visits by Mr. Domecq to all EDA Member States following his appointment as EDA Chief Executive and ahead of the Ministerial Steering Board on 18 May 2015.

Not only for security and economic reasons but also to keep our strategic autonomy. One way to support the industry is by consolidating military requirements, by pooling the demand side. Strategic autonomy is also important to keep prime contractors in the European Union in the long run, as one of their main functions is to supply the armed forces. But the European Defence Agency also advises small and medium sized enterprises how to gain better access to the markets in Europe, i.e. through EU funding and market information.

We fully support the Agency\u2019s activity carried out in preparation of the upcoming European Council on security and defence and we commend the EDA for its efforts to connect the defence realm with the other EU institutions and policies that have an impact on this domain. I cannot emphasise enough the importance we attach to EDA\u2019s activities aimed at facilitating a deeper involvement of Small and Medium Enterprises in European armament programs, which should lead to a balanced, modern and competitive European Defence Technological and Industrial Base/EDTIB, to the \u00a0benefit of all Member States. Small and Medium Enterprises and their integration in the supply chain remain a constant preoccupation for us, for they represent the engine for economic growth and a key driver for innovation\u201d highlighted Mircea Du\u015fa, Romanian Defence Minister. Romania is taking a firm European approach to defence cooperation and it is involved in several EDA projects. The Agency\u2019s flexibility proves an asset for Romania\u2019s national requirements as the EDA can also support regional cooperation, such as cooperation around the Black Sea region. A strong European perspective \u201cThe European Defence Agency advises European defence industry, i.e. in accessing EU funding for dual-use research. Our efforts are multiplied by the active support of the Romanian Ministry of Defence. These efforts have a strong European perspective. The competitiveness of the European defence industry as a whole is of utmost importance for our security, our economies as well as our strategic autonomy. The European Defence Agency is keen on taking the specificities of the Central Eastern European\u2019s defence industry into account and to further enhance measures to facilitate their\u00a0 access to supply chains throughout the EU\u201d, said European Defence Agency Chief Executive Jorge Domecq in Bucharest.

Click here to access the full digital edition Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq\u2026 The Cold War aftermath has seen European armed forces engaged in a wide variety of operational commitments around the globe, vastly expanding the set of missions they have to conduct. \u201cNowadays, soldiers often operate among civilian populations in a set of missions ranging from emergency humanitarian relief to crowd and riot control, counter-insurgency and interposition between warring factions\u201d, Jean Michelin, detached to the EDA as an intern from France and acting as Project Officer Engage, points out. But in these complex and demanding situations, the soldier on the ground can no longer rely on the sole use of his weapon if he wants to avoid a catastrophic escalation of violence; somewhere in the broad range of requirements that have fallen on the shoulders of modern armed forces, the need for non-lethal capabilities (NLC) has emerged. Lessons from Kosovo For western armed forces, the Kosovo conflict acted as an eye-opening experience in that regard. \u201cIn 1999/2000, we had to resort to using non-lethal capabilities during our mission in the city of Mitrovica, where Austrian units were deployed within German, British and French troops in order to prevent the escalation of riots\u201d, Colonel Erich Weissenb\u00f6ck, Deputy Head of the Force Development Division in the Austrian Ministry of Defence, explains. \u201cAs soldiers were attacked with stones and explosives, they used wire barriers and other tactics to try and contain the threat. But eventually they had to use tear gas, shotguns and even snipers to stop the demonstrators\u201d, he adds. With today\u2019s military experience from various theaters of operation around the globe, non-lethal capabilities could be regarded as a logical step forward for military expeditionary forces, especially when operating under the UN flag and the blue helmet \u2013 and yet, somehow, their development has been very slow. Currently, apart from the notable crowd and riot control era experienced by NATO forces in Kosovo, they are virtually non-existent in land forces across the globe, despite an identified shortfall.\u00a0 \u201cTo ensure that a potential threat doesn\u2019t enter a protected perimeter, or to deter an angry crowd from approaching a compound, it often boils down to the use of the warning shot, which is most of the time impractical and dangerous, let alone can lead to collateral damage\u201d, stresses Jean Michelin, who is also a French Army officer with significant operational experience. \u201cMoreover, using conventional weapons in a non-lethal manner will usually deter a potential hostile action by an individual, but its impact on a crowd is less reliable, especially when there is a threat of violence escalation\u201d, he adds. Maritime domain But land forces are not the only ones who might benefit from the development of NLC. The EU-led counter-piracy operation Atalanta conducted off the Somali coast has demonstrated the need for naval forces to neutralise potential pirates before they can attack nearby commercial ships. \u201cIn combination with audible or visual warnings, non-lethal weapons provide a stand-off with regards to the threat, thus allowing to identify the real intentions of a potential adversary\u201d, Colonel Weissenb\u00f6ck details.\u00a0 With an identified capability gap on one hand and a proven operational need on the other, ten Member States (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden) expressed in October 2007 their will to set up a dedicated NLC project team under the framework of the European Defence Agency. Over the last seven years, and under a proactive chairmanship from Austria, the project team focussed on four main strands of work, starting with a development of a NLC concept by the EU Military Staff (EUMS), in synergy with similar efforts previously conducted under a NATO framework. The project team also dealt with information exchange between Member States, so as to provide them with a forum to remain aware of national initiatives in terms of procurements, cooperation potential, interoperability as well as research and technology (R&T). The effects of non-lethal capabilities were also explored, with a specific attention on legal issues and the medical impact of NLCs. Future systems \u00a9\u00a0Austrian MOD Perhaps the most visible output of the project team\u2019s work in the field of NLCs, two R&T studies are conducted in order to assess technologies available for future non-lethal weapon systems. \u201cBased on operational experience, a need for longer-range capabilities has already been identified\u201d, explains Colonel Erich Weissenb\u00f6ck, who also happens to be the Chairman of EDA\u2019s NLC project team. \u201cAdditional applications, such as the protection of vehicles and convoys, also need to be explored\u201d, he points out. While one of the studies focuses on microwave-based NLC systems, the other explores optical and acoustic solutions. These two studies help to provide a comprehensive picture of the current state-of-play regarding NLC technology development, as well as of the challenges arising in research. \u201cFor example, the technology to direct a non-lethal energy beam at a hostile individual already exists\u201d, Jean Michelin underlines. \u201cHowever, it is still far from the technology-readiness level needed to integrate it into a portable, easily deployable, autonomous and ruggedized device that would match basic operational requirements\u201d, he adds.\u00a0 Equipment opportunities Although it is still being discussed, the project team\u2019s next step could be the identification of NLC equipment opportunities for Member States, as well as the definition of a set of common requirements based on the available technology and an agreed concept of operation. \u201cThis in turn could lead to the establishment of a common project whose exact scope will have to be decided by the Member States\u201d, Jean Michelin underlines.\u00a0 The end objective is to provide European soldiers with a common tactical doctrine and even a common set of tools when it comes to NLC operations, thus greatly increasing their effectiveness and interoperability. But this will not be a quick win. \u201cIn contemporary operations like in cooperative capability development, the only lasting achievements require commitment, caution, time and effort\u201d, the French army officer points out. \u201cIt is through small victories and determination that we will succeed in reaching our objective, however far it may seem.\u201d\u00a0 More information Non-lethal capabilities Non-Lethal Micro-Wave State-of-the-Art (HPM) Non-Lethal Optical and Acoustic Systems (NLOAS) \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/04/02/demand-grows-for-non-lethal-capabilities"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0590", "date": "2015-03-31", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Member States sign Helicopter Tactics Instructor Course agreement", "text": " Today, in a signing ceremony held as part of the EDA Steering Board, Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the European Defence Agency brought into force an agreement to work together to deliver the European Helicopter Tactics Instructor Course (HTIC).\u00a0 This course is designed to give selected European helicopter crews an enhanced awareness of helicopter tactics, operational employment and multi-national integration.\u00a0 At the end of the course, which is divided into three phases (ground-school, simulator and live flying), graduates will be qualified to delivering tactical instruction during home-based training; multinational courses and exercises; and on operations. They will also be capable of providing helicopter tactical advice at 1 Star level, as well as leading multi-platform complex Composite Air Operations (COMAOs). \u00a0 A proven concept The concept of creating the HTIC was approved by the EDA Steering Board on 9 March 2011. The EDA in partnership with the UK Joint Helicopter Command and the Armed Forces of Sweden developed the concept during 2011/12 and the first course, jointly funded by Sweden and the UK was delivered at RAF Linton-on-Ouse and FMV Test Range, Vidsel in Northern Sweden in April-May 2013. The course consisted of 14 Students from Germany and Sweden and 14 instructors from the UK and received unanimous praise from all participants.\u00a0 Consequently, a year later, a second course was delivered.\u00a0 Enlarged and with additional financial support from the Multinational Helicopter Initiative, the 2nd course graduated students from Austria, Czech Republic, German, Sweden and the UK.\u00a0 Swedish graduates for the first course became staff instructors on the second \u2013 beginning the process of creating a self-sustaining cadre.\u00a0 Nineteen students graduated from six helicopter types: Kiowa, Mi-171, CH-53, UH-1, AS330, and NH90. The course also involved eight fast-jets (Alca 159, Hawk, Gripen) from the Czech Republic, Sweden and the UK.

Click here to access the full digital edition What are the most important lessons learned from defence cooperation in the Netherlands so far? What should be the way forward in that regard? Often, when we talk about cooperation, we tend to focus on specific areas such as training or procurement. In my view as Director of the Defense Materiel Organisation (DMO), I think that when considering cooperation on new capabilities, we have to look at it from the widest angle possible: maintenance, life-cycle support, doctrine, simulators\u2026 Everything must be taken into account if we want to yield significant benefits. When we look at potential new programs, we seek partners that share this same vision. The partnership we have built over the years with Belgium in the naval domain is a great example of this. Our navies have set an integrated force sharing tasks, people as well as capabilities. What we did more than 30 years ago with France and Belgium as part of the Tripartite-class minehunter program is one of the oldest examples of European defence cooperation. Building on this equipment program, we have established a common training and exercise facility, and today the Belgian and Dutch navies are working in an entirely integrated fashion, for example to clear the North Sea of maritime mines. And in the future, we will look together at future plans for the acquisition of next-generation mine countermeasures capability. The F-35 has been selected as the Netherlands\u2019 next-generation combat aircraft. What will be the benefits of this program for the Dutch defence industrial and technological base? The program is now in good shape, and two aircraft are already participating fully in the Operation Test & Evaluation program in the United States, as well as Dutch pilots. A parliamentary debate is planned for late February, during which we will propose to sign the first low-rate initial production (LRIP) contract. Meanwhile, preparations are ongoing for the transition from the current F-16 fleet to the future F-35. The objective is to reach an Initial Operating Capability (IOC) in 2021. In terms of cooperation, it seems important to us to align with other future European F-35 users \u2013 something that we already take into account in our decisions. It would be a missed opportunity not to cooperate on the whole lifecycle of this capability. At the same time, we are also looking at the future logistic footprint of the aircraft in Europe. The Netherlands were recently selected to be one of three maintenance shops for F-35 engines in Europe. The Netherlands are leading a European effort to develop a new-generation MRTT fleet. How important is that project to your country\u2019s armed forces? This is an extremely important capability which is used every day by our armed forces. There is a clear need to replace it in order to field a new aircraft as early as 2019, while avoiding a capability gap. We have looked at cooperation in that domain since the very beginning. In 2007, I was personally involved in the SAC C-17 project and I witnessed firsthand the benefits of pooling and sharing when it comes to strategic capabilities. The new MRTT (multirole tanker transport) project is building on previous experiences such as this one, and we were pleased by the role the European Defence Agency played in project, bringing nations together and harmonising requirements between them. At the end of the day, what matters most is to have the capability available wherever and whenever we need it, no matter the flag on the aircraft or the location of its main operating base. Together with Poland and Norway, and maybe other partners in the future, we will share the costs of this common fleet and in the end we will benefit from an increased capability.\u00a0 A new Defence Cyber Command was recently established in the NL. What are your priorities in terms of developing new cyber capabilities? Vice admiral Matthieu Borsboom, former Commander of the Royal Netherlands Navy and Admiral Benelux, has taken office as DMO Director in 2014.\u00a0 The DMO is responsible for the whole Information Technology (IT) domain, with around 3.000 staff focusing on this issue. Part of them are working on cyber defence issues, under several work strands such as the protection of essential defence networks or the detection of anomalies. As part of our official defence cyber strategy, our first priority is to have an integrated approach in order to put all capabilities of the Cyber command available to the government agencies that might need them. We also look at improving our digital responsiveness as part of a \u201cdefensive cyber\u201d approach, while exploring potential offensive capabilities. We have regular exchanges on these issues with our EU and NATO partners. Our overarching objective is to build a comprehensive knowledge base, then to deliver this expertise to the armed forces.\u00a0. Is interoperability with other EU allies now a top priority for the Dutch armed forces when it comes to capability development? I would almost say that this is our number one priority. If you don\u2019t have a built-in interoperability in your equipment, you can join a NATO, EU or coalition mission but if you\u2019re not able to connect with other partners, you\u2019re simply useless. You might have sensors, effectors, command-and-control systems \u2013 but if we cannot plug into the global network, we\u2019re out of the game. Interoperability is very difficult. It has always been important in the NATO framework, but now with the changing geometry of ad-hoc coalitions it gets more and more complicated. Hybrid connectivity between civil and military systems also has to be taken into account and this is no easy feat, considering the pace at which new commercial standards are emerging. All this seems to be well understood by the defence community, but we need to increase our efforts if we want it to be as effective as possible. In the short to mid-term, which capabilities could benefit most from an increased cooperation at EU-level? The opportunities are widespread. I should not exclude any capability from the cooperative approach, which should in fact be the default approach. Of course, when we start talking about completely new capabilities, the complexity lies in the industrial strategy and the alignment of defence industries at a European level. In my experience, the desynchronisation of national budget cycles can be overcome. What matters is that we have to tackle issues as early as possible, be it for the identification or requirements or the procurement strategy. Part of the reason why we need to cooperate is also to maintain the knowledge base \u2013 something we might not be able to afford on a national basis anymore. Eventually, we need to look at an increased interdependence with our EU allies. What do you expect from an Agency like EDA to boost defence cooperation in Europe? I have known the European Defence Agency from the capability side for several years now, thanks to my previous postings within the Dutch MoD. I think what EDA does best is bringing together countries at the earliest stage possible, thus making it easier for Member States to get going with new cooperative programmes. I see more and more countries that just cannot do it on their own anymore; we need to cooperate, but we must not wait until it\u2019s too late. One of the reasons why we chose to take the lead on the MRTT project is to send a clear signal to other nations, trying to convince them that cooperation is the way forward. For the Agency to keep proving its added value, it needs to make it as easy as possible for Member States to join such initiatives. Every time EDA succeeds in reducing their workload, this a clear victory for European defence cooperation.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2015/03/27/interview-with-vadm-matthieu-borsboom-defensie-materieel-organisatie-director"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0595", "date": "2015-03-31", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Latest defence data published", "text": " The European Defence Agency (EDA) today published the aggregated defence data for 2013 of the 27\u00a0EDA participating Member States.\u00a0 2013 was no exception to the recent years\u2019 trend across EDA Member States to cut defence spending. Despite the fact that EDA increased from 26 to 271 Member States in 2013, the total defence expenditure of its Member States decreased by EUR 1.7 billion or 0.9%, compared to 2012, to EUR 186 billion. In real terms\u00b2, the total defence expenditure has been declining since 2006, dropping by over EUR 32 billion or about 15% from 2006 to 2013. Both as a share of GDP and as a share of the total government spending, defence expenditure has decreased for the seventh year in a row to its lowest value since 2006, 1.45% and 2.97%, respectively. Defence expenditure breakdown\u00a0(billion EUR and % change on previous year) Operation and maintenance and R&D/R&T expenditure increase slightly In terms of the distribution of defence expenditure, there were some shifts in 2013. Personnel-related expenditure decreased by over 4%, from EUR 95.7 billion in 2012 to EUR 91.8 billion in 2013, and for the first time since 2006, its share in the total defence expenditure dropped below 50%, to 49.3%. Personnel expenditure expressed per person employed in defence (military and civilian) has been increasing since 2006 to reach its highest value of EUR 51,475 in 2011, and started to decrease the year after. It decreased further from 2012 to 2013 (-2.6%), to EUR 49,836. With a share of 25.1% - the biggest since 2006 - operation and maintenance expenditure remained the second largest component of the total defence spending in 2013, and, despite minor annual fluctuations, it appears to be on an upward trajectory. From 2012 to 2013, it increased by EUR 2 billion or 4.4%, to EUR 46.8 billion, and almost reached its highest level of EUR 46.9 billion recorded in 2007. By contrast, defence investment, comprising equipment procurement and R&D (including R&T) expenditure, following a sharp decrease in 2011 (-10.5%), increased slightly in 2012, but decreased again in 2013 below the level it was in 2006, to EUR 37.5 billion or 20.1% of the total defence expenditure. This resulted from a decrease in one of its components - equipment procurement - which reduced by EUR 1.5 billion or 4.9%, to EUR 30 billion (16.1% of the total expenditure). The second component - defence R&D expenditure - increased slightly to EUR 7.5 billion (4% of the total expenditure), breaking a downward trend observed since 2006 (with the exception of 2010, when it marginally increased). R&T expenditure - a subset of R&D - followed a similar path. Being on a decline since 2006 (except 2011), it increased by just over 3% from 2012 to 2013, to reach EUR 2.1 billion. In real terms, defence investment decreased by EUR 4.8 billion or 11.3% from 2006 to 2013, whereas its components \u2013 equipment procurement and R&D - decreased by EUR 1.7 billion (-5.3%) and EUR 3.1 billion (-29.1%), respectively. Defence expenditure in current and constant1 prices\u00a0(billion EUR) Collaboration3: a sharp decrease in procurement and a marginal increase in R&T Since 2012, it has not been possible to have a comprehensive picture of the total EDA Member States\u2019 expenditure on collaborative (including European collaboration) defence equipment procurement and R&T projects or programmes, as several Member States were not able to provide this data. A glimpse into the partial 2012-2013 data reveals a worrisome trend, particularly for defence equipment procurement. Between 2012 and 2013, reported collaborative equipment procurement expenditure decreased by 20.7% to the lowest level since 2006 of EUR 4.75 billion. In relation to the total defence equipment procurement, collaborative expenditure accounted for 15.9%, suggesting that over 84% was spent nationally. European collaborative equipment procurement experienced an even sharper decrease of 21.6%, and in 2013, amounted to EUR 4.5 billion, accounting for 94.6% of the total collaborative equipment procurement. The total collaborative defence R&T expenditure of the EDA Member States that provided the data also shrank, though less dramatically (-0.9%), to EUR 203 million. Its share in the total defence R&T was 9.7%, the remaining 90.3% being regarded as national expenditure. Although the reported European collaborative defence R&T expenditure increased by 21.4% between 2012 and 2013, with a total of EUR 168 million, accounting for 82.5% of the total collaborative defence R&T, it nevertheless remained record-low. \u00a0 Defence expenditure and investment per military decrease despite reduced personnel numbers 2013 saw the seventh consecutive reduction in the number of personnel working in defence (both military and civilian), caused mainly by internal restructuring processes. The total personnel decreased by almost 600,000 or 24% between 2006 and 2013, while the number of military and civilian personnel decreased by over 500,000 (-26%) and almost 80,000 (-16%), respectively, during the same period. In 2013, there was a total of 1,435,693 military and 407,245 civilian personnel in EDA Member States - a decrease of 0.9% and 3.6%, compared to 2012. A share of military in the total personnel has also been decreasing from the highest of 80.6% in 2008 and 2010 to the lowest of 77.4% in 2012. In 2013, it was 77.9%. For the first time since 2006, defence expenditure expressed per military decreased by 0.05%, from EUR 129,878 in 2012 to EUR 129,814 in 2013. So did defence investment per military, which has been on an overall increasing trend since 2006 due to declining military personnel, rather than increasing Member States\u2019 investment. In 2013, defence investment per military was EUR 26,122 - a 2.9% reduction on the 2012 figure of EUR 26,906. \u00a0 Increasing numbers of troops available for deployment and actual deployments Between 2012 and 2013, the average number of troops deployed outside the EU territory increased for the first time since 2008, both in absolute terms (+17.2%) and as a share of military personnel (from 3.4% to 4%). EDA Member States together deployed on average 58,086 troops on a continuous basis throughout 2013, which constituted 4% of the overall strength of their military personnel. In 2013, there was also an increase in the total number of deployable (land) forces (+7%) and that of sustainable (land) forces (+1.5%). The 27 EDA Member States had in total 481,001 deployable (the highest number since 2006) and 110,433 sustainable (land) forces. The ratio between sustainable and a pool of deployable (land) forces remained stable at 1:4.4. Meanwhile, after a five-year-long upward trend, the costs related to deployed operations4 decreased for the second time in a row, both in absolute terms - from EUR 9 billion to EUR 7.4 billion (-17.1%) \u2013 and as a share of the total expenditure - from 4.8% to 4% - between 2012 and 2013. Operations costs per military deployed decreased by 29.3% and stood at EUR 127,989 in 2013. \u00a0 Background The European Defence Agency (EDA) collects defence data on an annual basis.

This requires significant efforts in a large array of domains such as skills, sustainable European industrial capabilities, appropriate public policies and regulations as well as forward-looking research and technology. Europe\u2019s ability to get access to \u00a0key enabling technologies is crucial to both space and defence capabilities. Considering the similarities between the defence and space domains, since 2009, ESA, EC and EDA have run the European non-dependence process through a joint task force for critical technologies. Its objective is to map key technology needs and to identify priority actions to be implemented within European or national programmes.\u00a0 On 13 February 2015, the 3rd European non-dependence process results were presented to Member States and industry. The final list of urgent actions for the time frame 2015-2017 was finalised on 18 March 2015. From October 2014 to February 2015 the joint task force together with the relevant Member States organisations, industry and academia conducted a consultation process to find consensus on the most urgent research actions. The current action list contains 39 non-dependence actions in technology domains such as materials, electronic or photonic components, green propellants or complex structures. It promotes synergies between ESA, EC and EDA activities and serves as input for the upcoming H2020 Space workplan. This succesful joint process illustrates the commitment of both Member States and European institutional actors in securing those key technologies that reinforce Europe\u2019s supply chain and thus its strategic independence and security.

National Armaments Directors discussed how to promote cooperation of European states in the area of joint procurement, project planning and implementation, support for EDA capability programmes and ways to strengthen the European defence industry. National Armaments Directors concluded that the involvement of small and medium sized companies in supply chains is beneficial for the European economy and long-term defence capabilities and should be enhanced. Evaluating the current security challenges, Member States agreed that cooperation is paramount; therefore, it is crucial to strengthen the cooperation with partners, such as NATO and the U.S. \u201cThis is a significant forum because it tackles the European capabilities at their core and allows our countries to cooperate in the area of procurement, armaments and assistance to our defence industries\u201d, stressed Raimonds V\u0113jonis, the Minister of Defence of the Republic of Latvia, welcoming the participants of the meeting. \u201cIn the light of recent developments in the European security architecture, cooperation within the EU and our partners is essential, therefore the back-to-back event with the NATO and the U.S. gave an opportunity to discuss issues of mutual interest and standardization, government to government sales and Single European Skies\u201d, said R.V\u0113jonis regarding the back-to-back event with the NATO and the U.S. that took place during the informal meeting and was hosted by the Latvian EU Presidency. \u201dEDA\u2019s role is to support Member States in their efforts to develop capabilities. In light of new security challenges paired with budgetary constraints, the case for cooperation becomes ever more compelling. The meeting of National Armaments Directors in Riga was an important opportunity towards the preparation of the European Council discussion on defence in June since they are responsible for delivering the capabilities our armed forces need today and in the future\u201d, said Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the EDA \u00a0after the meeting.

Peter Round, EDA Director Capability, Armament & Technology was invited to brief member of the subcommittee on EDA activities in the area of cyber defence. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), emphasised in his presentation on cyber security the increasing number of security incidents. Rudolf Roy, Head of Security Policy Division, Conflict Prevention and Security Policy Directorate (EEAS) highlighted among other topics the importance of secure cyberspace for CSDP missions and operations equally important to other domains of warfare (land, sea, air and space). In his presentation, Peter Round concentrated first on successful EDA projects in the area of cyber defence, on the EU cyber defence policy framework, EDA support to operations and preparations for the European Council discussion on defence in June.\u00a0 In the last three years, the Agency has completed ten cyber defence related projects with a financial volume of about 2 million euros. This equals to approximately 10% of EDA\u2019s operational budget. Among these ten projects are a stocktaking study of cyber defence capabilities among all EDA Member States and EU institutions, the establishment of a cyber defence research agenda and cyber defence training courses for senior military decision makers as well as the assessment of the feasibility of a EU Cyber Defence Centre for CSDP.\u00a0 \u201cThe Agency continues to give high priority to providing cyber domain support to ongoing operations and missions\u201d, Peter Round highlighted. So far, the Agency has delivered three cyber awareness seminars for the staff in charge of the EUFOR RCA operation. The finalisation of the feasibility assessment for an EU Cyber Defence Centre provides several options on the set-up for such a centre for CSDP operations and missions. EDA\u2019s project team cyber defence with experts from 24 EDA Member States and EU institutions is currently evaluating these proposals. A consolidated report will be introduced to the political decision-making process by the end of the semester.\u00a0 Finally, Peter Round emphasised the limited resources dedicated to cyber defence within the EU institutions. He underlined the need for increased civil-military cooperation in the field to maximise synergies.\u00a0 Members of the European Parliament congratulated the speakers on the progress made in the domain of cybersecurity and defence following the taskings of the European Council in December 2013.

Organised and hosted by Sweden in Karlsborg, the exercise gathered 23 students from 12 countries. Instructors from France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden as well as Canada shared their knowledge and experience of personnel recovery (PR) matters with a group of students coming from Belgium, Canada, Finland, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland. PR is usually defined as the sum of efforts needed to recover isolated civilian or military personnel. The main focus of the course was to train staff officers to support their commanders on PR-related issues. It is intended for personnel who will be manning a personnel recovery position in a tactical operation centre (TOC), a personnel recovery coordination cell (PRCC) or a joint personnel recovery cell (JPRC). This may be within an EU, NATO or national staff as part of exercises or deployed operations. \u00a0During the first week of the course, students were briefed on the four main elements of the PR system (preparation, planning, execution and adaptation) and learned how to control and oversee PR operations. Most of the students also attended the second week of the course to learn how to properly plan PR operations and to develop a PR annex to an operations plan. Training involved classroom lessons as well as work in study groups where participants faced a variety of PR challenges. Next stop: Hungary The next EU PRCPC will take place from 25 May to 5 June 2015 in Hungary. The newly-developed Personnel Recovery Functional Area Service Advanced Technology Demonstrator (PR FAS ATD) will be tested. This system is designed to provide headquarters-level PR staff with a planning tool to manage PR missions in a PRCC or JPRC. It has been developed as part of EDA\u2019s work to improve interoperability amongst European armed forces in the field of personnel recovery. The EU PRCPC project was established on 30 May 2013 as an EDA Category B project, under the lead of Sweden. As of today, it gathers six contributing EU Member States: Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands and Sweden. EDA has already initiated a process to extend the project and allow a smooth handover of the course to a suitable entity.

Materials modelling is becoming well-established in the civil and military domains. As conducting experiments is costly and often difficult owing to environmental constraints (high strain rate, high temperature, hazardous environments), integrating materials modelling with experimental programmes yields benefits.\u00a0 The main objective of the workshop on Materials & Structures Modelling & Simulation (M&S2) \u00a0was to identify the potential impact of these technologies on defence. The workshop concentrated on discussing active and future directions on materials modelling around four key topics: new materials, new structures, new processes and defence specific phenomena. Generally speaking, two main topics related to polymer composites and ceramic materials came out of the discussions:\u00a0 There is a need to provide diagnostic and prognostic methods for structures and also relevant characterisation of defence and dual-use specific phenomena, such as ageing, fatigue stress, impact damage, etc.; and\u00a0 In order to improve the materials performance under extreme conditions, a better understanding of their behaviour at atomic and molecular level is needed. Therefore, there is a need to further develop modelling at nanoscale level which could be integrated in mesoscale models, described in the microscale until reaching current macroscale.

This arrangement builds upon a successful pilot case conducted in 2014 in which the European Defence Agency (EDA) supported the acquisition of Air to Ground Surveillance and Reconnaissance Services for Operation EUFOR Althea. Procurement of contracted solutions has become increasingly relevant for EU military operations not only to fill capability gaps in the force generation process, but also as a general planned support for ongoing operations. This broader arrangement opens the option for the Athena Administrator or any Operation/Mission Commanders as Contracting Authorities to call upon EDA to provide, upon its expertise and available means and capabilities, technical and overall administrative support for procurement of infrastructure works, as well as a variety of services or supplies, through direct contracts or pre-mission solutions, e.g. through framework contracts. Greater flexibility Speaking about the cooperation, Hans-Werner Grenzh\u00e4user said: \u00a0\u201cI am convinced that our cooperation would be of huge benefit for supporting EU-led military operations. The European Defence Agency can play a significant role. It holds a considerable knowledge of the industry, as well as in-house technical expertise and experience in contracting. The cooperation with EDA will therefore increase flexibility, optimise procurement procedures and save scarce resources by providing contractor support solutions to operations and Athena central.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Talking about the arrangement, Jorge Domecq added: \u201cThe ultimate goal of any EDA project is to support operations. Today\u2019s arrangement allows us to do this by providing a procurement service directly to the Administrator or an EU mission.

Improvised explosive devices remain the single largest killer of coalition soldiers in the war in Afghanistan \u2013 and a favoured weapon of Europe\u2019s home-grown terrorists as well. This has put the devices at the forefront of public debate, with the acronym \u2018IED\u2019 now used and widely understood well beyond just military circles. However, even if they have gained a lot of public attention in the last few years, IEDs are nothing new. With their low cost and ability to cause significant damage they have been the weapon of choice for insurgents fighting technologically superior forces for decades. Counter-IED training\u00a0\u00a9 EDA Biggest threat With this asymmetric warfare likely to remain the norm, IEDs will continue to be the biggest single threat to our soldiers on the ground \u2013 as well as being a growing threat to civilian populations. It is vital that the experience and knowledge gained in fighting IEDs in Afghanistan is not lost. Moreover, we need to ensure the best possible collaboration between military and civilian law enforcement entities. The European Defence Agency (EDA) has played an important role in ensuring that skills and knowledge in tackling IEDs are maintained. One important element of its counter-IED work is technical exploitation. This refers to the recording and analysing of information related to events, scenes, technical components and the materials used in an IED attack. The objective of counter-IED exploitation is to gather the technical and tactical data about the attack whilst at the same time identifying the IED \u201csupply chain\u201d in order to gather intelligence about those involved in IED production and use. Exploitation allows bomb disposal experts to better understand the threat they are dealing with, helping them to predict future activity and allowing them to attack the network involved in producing the devices. A number of the EU\u2019s civil security research projects financed by the European Commission aim for similar goals, for example. Counter-IED exploitation was the rationale behind the 2011-2014 deployment of a multi-national theatre exploitation laboratory in Afghanistan, where it helped disrupt networks making and using IEDs. In parallel to that effort, a new programme, called the \u201cJoint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory\u201d (JDEAL) was begun in May 2013. Under Dutch lead, its aim was to establish a permanent IED exploitation training facility in the Netherlands, staffed by a permanent multinational team. Under the project, a further two deployable laboratories could be procured for use in future operations. Pooling and sharing Initiatives such as JDEAL aim to ensure that the knowledge gained at a considerable price in wartime is not lost to other defence actors, but also made available to the bomb disposal community as a whole, whether military or civil. Indeed, IEDs are not only a threat to our soldiers overseas: for decades, they have also been used against civilians in Europe often with lethal results. They will continue as the weapon of choice for individuals planning terror attacks against Europe\u2019s homeland. In order to ensure an efficient \u201cspillover\u201d of know-how between these two interconnected worlds, dedicated events have recently been jointly organised by the EDA and Europol. These have brought together experts from as many as 16 different European countries. The overarching idea is really quite simple: participants take part in realistic training scenarios that involve homemade explosives based on situations experienced in the real world. By doing so, they share best practices and improve their skills through multinational and civil-military cooperation. Even the United States has showed interest in the initiative by sending experts from the FBI and US Department of Justice. Winning the IED war This combined approach ought to be extended to the whole spectrum of C-IED activities \u2013 and not just for the disposal of homemade explosives. Other critical skills, such as exploitation techniques currently tackled via the JDEAL project, are needed to win the IED war. If we want to effectively predict and prevent further IED-related incidents on the battlefield or the homeland \u2013 and develop the means to safely neutralise them in a variety of conditions \u2013 then we need to push this civil-military cooperation as far as we can. The lives of European soldiers and citizens might very well depend on it.

These projects, to be submitted to the national Ministries of Defence (MoD), will be selected by MoDs and EDA based on eligibility and performance criteria. Small & medium-sized entreprises, large companies, research centres, academia as well as public bodies can assume the role of a project holder. Selected projects will benefit from free and tailored technical assistance provided by an international consulting firm, specifically contracted by EDA to support this initiative. This technical support aims to fully develop the project folder (to be ultimately submitted to ESIF managing authorities) and, therefore, maximise its chance to access ESIF co-funding.\u00a0 New procedure This new procedure builds on a successful EDA pilot call launched in 2013. It led to the selection of project \u201cTurtle\u201d as part of which a Portuguese consortium was granted access to an ESIF financial support in order to develop key enabling technologies for sustainable and long-term presence in the deep ocean. The total budget was over \u20ac1 million, 60% of which was provided through ESIF. Originally created to implement EU policy by reducing economic disparities at regional level, structural funds have an important role to play in the development of dual-use technologies. Over the current programming period that runs from 2014 to 2020, around \u20ac200 billion have been earmarked as part of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), one of the ESI funds under which research and innovation activities can be supported. Dual-use research aims at developing technologies that could benefit both the civil and the defence sectors, for instance in the field of electronics, nanotechnologies, materials, sensors, or propulsion.

Opening a high-level seminar organised in the framework of the Latvian EU Presidency\u00a0on 19 January, he argued that the European Council in June presented a significant opportunity to address common threats and challenges. During his speech, Minister V\u0113jonis outlined a review of strategic defence documents as one of Latvia\u2019s priorities for the European Council. In particular, an update of the European Security Strategy should be assigned. Secondly, cooperation and coordination between EU bodies active in the field of CSDP should be enhanced. Minister V\u0113jonis mentioned the four capability programmes on air-to-air refuelling, remotely piloted aircraft systems, satellite communications, and cyber defence, the European Defence Agency was entrusted with as successful examples of increased cooperation. He emphasised that the EU\u2019s comprehensive approach including cooperation between military and civilian actors should be bolstered to address hybrid threats. Finally, cyber defence and the EU\u2019s maritime security are two areas Latvia will put special emphasis on during its presidency. The seminar \"Building consensus towards the June 2015 European Council - next steps?\" was attended by representatives from the EU Ministries of Defence, European institutions as well as representatives of the academic community.

For this year\u2019s edition, this event of major importance for the space community focused on the rising demand for space services and applications in Europe and on ways to reinforce the EU\u2019s position in that domain. It gathered high-level speakers from governments, industry and EU institutions. Govsatcom Speaking as part of the sixth session dedicated to the increasing civil and security & defence synergies of space services, EDA European Synergies & Innovation (ESI) Director Denis Roger put the focus on the Agency\u2019s role in the cooperative Govsatcom (Governmental Satellite Communications) programme. \u201cA common set of requirements has been approved by participating Member States in 2014\u201d, he pointed out. \u201cThe European Defence Agency is now preparing the technical studies that will allow us to offer options to Member States by late 2016, early 2017\u201d, he added. From the outset, this future Govsatcom programme will need to benefit from a dual approach, taking into account military and civil needs. \u201cNot taking advantage of such synergies will be a waste of efficiency and taxpayer\u2019s money\u201d, Denis Roger stressed. He also discussed the topic of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS), another capability priority supported by the December 2013 European Council with an important space dimension: \u00a0\u201cThe DESIRE program, ran jointly by EDA and the European Space Agency, will investigate if satellite communications are compatible with safety and navigability requirements for the air traffic insertion of RPAS\u201d. \u00a0 Dual-use approach Denis Roger stressed again the benefits of a dual-use approach on these topics. He also mentioned cyber defence as a field where close coordination between civil and military users is needed and should be taken into account at the very beginning of any new programmatic initiative. He concluded on the fact that the progress made to better exploit civil-military synergies did not diminish the need for specific defence research and had to be pursued through the full use of EU funding instruments to support them as well as other dual-use initiatives in the space domain.

The initiative is expected to grow based on the building blocks that have already been put in place. With an objective to address the airlift shortfall in the European Union, the European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) partnership \u2013 initiated in 2011 as a European Defence Agency (EDA) programme \u2013 aims at developing cost-effective solutions to optimise the use of existing and future national fleets of military transport aircraft in Europe. A three-phase strategy has been agreed upon to achieve that ambitious objective. \u201cThe first phase of the EATF strategy, which ran from 2012 to 2014, has now effectively come to an end\u201d, Laurent Donnet, EDA Project Manager Airlift & Air-to-Air Refuelling, explains. \u201cThis allowed us to lay out the partnership\u2019s foundations with a number of tangible deliverables and activities such as the harmonisation of diplomatic clearances mechanisms and procedures, but also live exercises and training events\u201d, he adds. Growing interest A testimony to this successful first phase, the European Air Transport Training (EATT) events organised in Europe keep gathering more and more participants, with 14 aircraft and 30 crews expected to join the next edition in June 2015. This year, three editions of the European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course (EAATTC) will also take place, as well as three European Air Transport Instructor Courses and the annual European Air Transport Symposium (see below). \u00a0 EATF Phase 2, expected to run for three years, will see a strengthening of these activities through several initiatives, such as the development of a permanent multinational training centre in Zaragoza (Spain) expected to reach its initial operational capability by mid-2016. Meanwhile, harmonisation of rules, regulations, tactics, techniques and procedures will continue. User groups developed around aircraft such as the A400M, A330 MRTT, CN295 or KC-390 will also be explored, based on a model currently being tested with the European C-27J Spartan community of users. All these efforts will be pursued in close cooperation with the European Air Transport Command (EATC) in Eindhoven, which has become the major centre of airlift expertise in Europe. \u201cThe EATF partnership hit the nail on the head\u201d, Laurent Donnet stresses. \u201cEuropean airlift is being trained like never before and interoperability between Member States keeps growing\u201d, he adds. Ultimately, a third EATF phase is expected to run from 2017 to 2021.

Back then an esoteric and expensive material, it\u2019s become price-competitive with its intense strength and durability for its weight. Similarly, head-up displays were developed to enable fast jet pilots to have key information presented in their view of the outside world, rather than having to frequently look down into the cockpit. This technology has progressively spread into civil aviation and more recently into cars, with the advantage of always keeping one\u2019s eyes on the road. These are only two of many examples illustrating how defence research can benefit the global economy and power Europe\u2019s re-industrialisation. Reciprocally, the fast development of technologies in the civilian world can be essential to the emergence of cutting-edge defence systems. The difficult times our economies are facing today mean that Europe is losing ground to its faster-growing Asian and American counterparts. This concern of the defence community is shared by Heads of State and Government: in this context, it is of paramount importance to invest in all the technologies and production capabilities that are essential to maintain Europe\u2019s competitiveness. However, Europe still suffers from legal and psychological barriers between civilian and military research \u2013 barriers that our competitors do not have. These limitations seriously hamper our capability to \u201ccross-fertilise\u201d developments from both worlds. The issue has been acknowledged at the highest level: in December 2013, the European Council itself tasked the European Defence Agency and other bodies to better exploit civil-military synergies. This issue should be tackled in three ways: 1/ Desegmentation of civil and military research If we want the civilian and defence worlds to effectively cross-feed each other, then it is necessary to proceed with the desegmentation of civil and military research. By allowing funding to flow from one side to the other, major spin-offs between defence and civil research could be achieved. It is worth remembering that few technologies are military or civil by nature, especially at low technological readiness. Only when applied and used in a given system does a specific technology become military or commercial. Today, this cross-fertilisation is limited by several factors, such as the legitimate confidentiality surrounding sensitive defence applications, but also the competitive advantage that might result from a cutting-edge civil technology. However, security regulations and intellectual property rights are here to address this issue. The main barrier is the lack of a comprehensive policy approach for all parties involved. 2/ Optimisation and prioritisation of technology-based production capabilities The application of innovative technologies often requires considerable investments to move from the lab to serial production. And very often, such investments are only viable if this production is designed to address all potential markets: civil, defence and space. The European Defence Agency, in close cooperation with the Commission and industry, is investigating which key enabling technologies need a priority and focused investment effort to sustain the European supply chain. These are technologies such as components (silicum, gallium arsenide, infrared detectors), carbon fibre or optical devices. Europeans need to invest in these domains to levelthe playing field then to define priorities on related key industrial capabilities. Meanwhile, it is essential to optimise available resources. The civil, space and defence domains need to be addressed together by a comprehensive business plan to yield cost savings while boosting innovation capabilities. This is the only way forward if we want to see Europe re-industrialise. 3/ Increase funding for defence research Claude-France Arnould\u00a0is the Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency Defence research budgets have been cut by 20% over the last six years. The risk is real to lose the ability to reach critical mass in a number of technology areas. This would not only jeopardise Europe\u2019s strategic autonomy, but would also impede the long-term competitiveness of its high-tech commercial industry. It has been said that defence and space are to aviation what Formula One is to the automotive industry: a formidable cradle of innovation and technological breakthroughs. The situation is all the more worrying since, according to a study commissioned by the European Defence Agency, the multiplier effect on GDP growth for an investment in defence research & technology is 12 to 20 times higher than in other areas of public spending. Therefore, investment in defence R&T must be a logical component of any comprehensive growth policy. The Agency is also supporting Member States by contributing to the Commission\u2019s work on an R&T Preparatory Action related to the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), as called for by the December 2013 European Council. If successful, this Preparatory Action could give birth to a wider defence research programme at European level, the impact of which will be all more the important since cross-fertilisation with other European research and innovation initiatives will be maximised. The benefits can be enormous, both for the civilian and defence sectors.

Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing as it is more commonly known, has received widespread media attention in the past few years. From prototypes for car manufacturers through to a fully 3D printed house in the Netherlands, the technology has the potential to radically change manufacturing across a host of industries, defence industries. As such Additive Manufacturing has been recognised as a key cross-cutting technology that could enhance defence capabilities in the EDA\u2019s group working on Materials and Structures. 3D printing has particular benefits for the defence industry \u2013 where the need for tailored or adapted components is important. The technology will enable the manufacturing of pieces on demand, reducing the logistics of deploying spare parts and also making possible to develop tailored parts for a damage system in operations. Connecting European experts The main objective of the EDA workshop was to identify the potential impact of these technologies in Defence. Twenty-two speakers from eight different MS provided an exhaustive overview of the technology. The workshop gave background information on the state of the art of different additive manufacturing technologies, on-going work at EU level, and provided an overview of related projects, their synergies and future activities. The needs of the air, maritime, energy industry for defence applications were presented, highlighting the capability gaps and the need for research & technology. In addition, presentations on specific technologies and steps in the value chain were included, such as: High strength steel by SLM, protection and highly dynamic behaviour, functional integration and weight reduction, novel materials and structural repairing, process modelling, qualification, certification, international standards development, metal powder processes, and the road to production. The information gathered during the workshop will help to identify the areas were further research is needed for the application of this technologies in the Defence sector. Furthermore, the synergies created during the event will create a network of experts on Additive Manufacturing within the EDA framework.

The participating nations would welcome other nations to join the initiative either before an actual procurement or subsequently. This initiative, facilitated by the European Defence Agency, consists of the pooled acquisition and operation of a common fleet of aircraft by the three nations. Other nations will also be able to contribute to the overall programme through joining the acquisition phase and/or in-service phase. An initial operating capability is expected for 2019.\u00a0 After market research supported by a targeted request for information, the three nations have identified that only one military off-the-shelf solution met their key requirements in terms of capabilities and timeframe. The nations therefore agreed to create a NATO Support Agency (NSPA) partnership which tasked the Organisation Conjointe de Coop\u00e9ration en mati\u00e8re d\u2019ARmement (OCCAR) to prepare negotiations with Airbus Defence and Space for a possible acquisition of a fleet of A330 MRTT. This engagement in further negotiations does not constitute a commitment by EDA, NSPA, OCCAR or the Participating nations to place an order either as a result of this dialogue or at a subsequent stage. A single configuration has been selected for this common fleet of multirole tanker transport aircraft, which should all be equipped with a rigid boom as well as underwing pods, thus allowing to refuel a large variety of receivers. They will also meet the users\u2019 requirements in terms of passenger transport, strategic airlift, and medical evacuation. By developing synergies with similar fleets, the nations will further contribute to a reduced fragmentation and increased interoperability of air-to-air refuelling aircraft in Europe.

The workshop was organised jointly by the European Commission, the European Defence Agency (EDA) and the European association of development agencies (EURADA). The event was divided into three successive panels, the first one focusing on the European Union\u2019s existing policies and tools to support dual-use research and clustering. \u201cThe EU is working to support clusters as a good breeding ground for innovative small & medium-sized enterprises\u201d, a Commission representative pointed out. \u201cThis is all the more important as 38% of European jobs are based in clusters\u201d, he added. Actions and tools Presentations were given on the COSME, Horizon 2020 programme, European Structural and Investment Funds as well as EDA actions and tools in support of defence-related SMEs, clusters and the defence supply chain. An EDA official underlined that \u201cthose SMEs and clusters that participate in defence markets are typically involved in dual-use activities and the increasing convergence of defence and security creates even greater emphasis on dual-use\u201d. A second panel offered stakeholders from defence-related clusters an opportunity to share their experiences and the associated challenges. Clusters from Estonia, France, Poland and Portugal were represented. They emphasised the need for greater cooperation at EU level in order to develop their dual-use activities. \u201cDual-use is in our DNA\u201d, stated Jean-Luc Logel, president of the French EDEN cluster. Opportunities After a networking session held over lunch, a third and final panel focused on ways to develop dual-use opportunities at European level and saw interventions from the ECSEL Joint Undertaking, the European Commission and EDA. Reinhard Marak, from the Austrian National Defence Industry Association, provided industrial views on the subject: \u201cWe have to identify new funding schemes to alleviate the decline in defence spending and investment, but dual-use is no cure for all: if you want to access those funds you first need national buy-in\u201d, he stressed. In their concluding remarks, Tarja Jaakkola (EDA) and Sylvia Kainz-Huber (European Commission) underlined that this event provided a good opportunity for European policy-makers and representatives of the defence-related clusters and industry to exchange views on current and on-coming policies and tools with impact on clusters and dual-use activities.

It was an important opportunity for Defence Ministers to assess the progress achieved since December 2013. It was also an ideal forum for the new High Representative and Vice-President of the European Commission to discuss cooperation on military capabilities with European ministers and to prepare for the June 2015 European Council. Progress on the four key programmes Four projects have been endorsed by the 2013 European Council: Air-to-Air Refuelling (AAR), Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), Governmental Satellite Communications (GovSatcom) and Cyber Defence. In line with their respective roadmaps, the progress made in each of these four key capability areas has been welcomed by Defence Ministers during the Steering Board: Air-to-Air Refuelling: under the lead of the Netherlands, work is progressing towards the establishment of a European strategic tanker capability by 2020. A contract for new air-to-air refuelling aircraft is expected to be placed by the end of 2015. RPAS: EDA supports the development of a European Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) RPAS through a number of projects focusing on certification, air traffic insertion, airworthiness and harmonisation of flight crew training. The Agency is facilitating efforts to develop a new MALE RPAS capability for the next decade by supporting Member States willing to join such an initiative. EDA is also backing a \u201cEuropean MALE RPAS community\u201d for systems that are already in service. GovSatcom: the requirements of European military users (Common Staff Target) for the next generation of Governmental Satellite Communications have been formally endorsed by Member States. This paves the way to the preparation phase of a future cooperative programme, to be completed by the end of 2016 under Spanish lead. Cyber Defence: in line with the EU Cyber Security Strategy, EDA is working on specific projects to increase its Member States\u2019 capabilities in this domain. The Agency has already supported the operational headquarters of Operation EUFOR RCA by providing cyber awareness training. Work is underway to develop deployable \u201cCyber Defence situational awareness kits\u201d by 2015. Incentives for cooperation As tasked by the European Council, the Agency has developed proposals to incentivise cooperation, mainly through non-market distorting fiscal measures and pooled procurement. During the Steering Board, Defence ministers welcomed this progress as a basis for further work. Fiscal measures: in March 2014, the Belgian Ministry of Finance granted VAT exemption to EDA\u2019s ad hoc projects and activities. Three projects have already benefitted from that exemption: JDEAL, C-IED Manual Neutralisation Techniques and EU Satcom Market. This VAT exemption gives a real bonus to defence cooperation among Member States. Pooled procurement: Proposals were discussed for the establishment of a pooled procurement mechanism to facilitate cooperative acquisition and support of defence equipment, while improving interoperability. This mechanism, whose creation still requires deeper discussion among Member States, would address priorities defined by them. Strategic outlook As requested by the December 2013 European Council, Defence Ministers have adopted a Policy Framework to foster more systematic and long-term defence cooperation. This document aims to provide a coherent basis for defence cooperation in Europe, from priority setting through to in-service support, disposal and decommissioning. It offers tangible support to national defence reviews and provides a platform for greater convergence in defence planning. Complementing this Policy Framework, the revised Capability Development Plan (CDP) endorsed by Member States earlier this year will be an essential element for the setting of cooperative capability development priorities. It provides a list of priority actions based on lessons learned from European operations, future security scenarios and long-term trends. It addresses the Member States\u2019 priorities for their armed forces and, as such, will form the basis of future European collaborative programmes.

The Joint Deployable Exploitation and Analysis Laboratory (JDEAL) provides a permanent technical exploitation training capability in the Dutch town of Soesterberg. Under the project a further two deployable laboratories could be procured for use in future operations. JDEAL, which was facilitated by the European Defence Agency (EDA) and lead nation the Netherlands, focuses on training the full range of skills needed for technical exploitation. This involves the recording and analysing of information related to events, scenes, technical components, and material used in IED attacks. The project makes use of equipment and knowledge gained from the EDA developed Counter-IED Technical Exploitation Laboratory previously deployed with ISAF in Kabul. Alongside the Netherlands, ten other EDA Member States \u2013 Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden \u2013 plus Norway have joined the project. Denmark, the United Kingdom, the United States and the NATO Counter-IED Centre of Excellence have also sent observers. Warrant Officer Bert Westers, from the Dutch armed forces, was previously stationed at the laboratory in Afghanistan and will now act as a trainer at JDEAL. He commented: \u201cThis new facility allows us to maintain and build on the skills and experiences that we gained in Kabul. It also helps to improve our forces\u2019 ability to deal with threats from IEDs in the future.\u201d Education, research, and deployable capabilities The training facility will host both national and multina\u00adtional training events, tailored to the needs of the Member States involved. Alongside the training aspect, JDEAL is intended to be a platform for research and development and is specifically designed for subprojects to be launched under its framework. It will also work closely with other actors and cooperative bodies working in the counter-IED field. In a second step the establish\u00adment of two deployable laboratories is planned, in order to have at least one available for upcoming operations/missions by the second half of 2015. Background The JDEAL project will work across the entire scope of IED exploitation. This includes detailed visual examination and high quality image capture; technical exploitation report\u00ading; biometric analysis (latent finger print recovery); elec\u00adtrical circuitry (primarily radio parts); document and me\u00addia recovery (focused on the mobile phones often used as IED triggering devices); chemical analysis; mechanical exploitation as well as other material exploitation. This is done in close cooperation with intelligence services, which can use the results to attack the networks involved in manufacturing the IEDs. The JDEAL project was born out of the EDA developed mul\u00adtinational counter-IED Exploitation Laboratory (MNTEL), which was deployed in Kabul under French management. During the laboratory\u2019s three year deployment in Af\u00adghanistan more than 6 000 IEDs were forensically ex\u00adamined, providing invaluable support to law enforce\u00adment and leading to numerous terrorist prosecutions.

Called MMCM-NG (New Generation), the project will run until 2017 and prepare the next generation of mine countermeasures ships.\u00a0 Belgium, Estonia, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden as well as Norway agreed on 8 October 2014 to launch a new research project regarding future Maritime Mine Counter Measures (MMCM) capabilities. Dubbed MMCM-NG (New Generation), the project arrangement was signed at the European Defence Agency\u2019s premises during a Steering Board of the Capabilities Directors. Germany is the project\u2019s lead nation.\u00a0 Easy to deploy and cheap to acquire, maritime mines and other underwater improvised explosive devices pose a real threat to naval forces and civilian ships by restricting freedom of movement in shallow waters, harbours and strategic choke points. Being able to detect, avoid, and defuse these weapons is therefore a key requirement for European navies. Preparing the next generation The MMCM-NG project has a planned duration of 36 months during which contributing Member States, based on an agreed operational concept, will work on a set of common requirements to prepare the future generation of mine countermeasures ships and systems that could become operational in the 2030 timeframe. At the end of this 3-year project, Member States will have gathered enough information to decide on the potential launch of a procurement phase for these new systems. Compared to existing solutions, future MMCM capabilities are expected to bring increased flexibility through a modular \u201ctoolbox\u201d comprising a range of systems adaptable to different platforms, environmental, or operational conditions. The use of unmanned vehicles will also be developed and new detection techniques could be introduced. Future MMCM operations are also expected to be conducted with state-of-the-art sensors and effectors carried and deployed from dedicated or hybrid platforms as well as from stationary or mobile shore installations. Based on the different national requirements, several technical solutions will be assessed as part of the project. Standards, protocols and interfaces will be described and agreed upon commonly in order to ensure future interoperability and to enable synergies in the fields of training, logistics, and maintenance. Background The European Defence Agency conducts several activities in the maritime domain. One of the Agency\u2019s largest programmes, called UMS (Unmanned Maritime Systems), brings together all EDA Member States under a single programme arrangement and 15 different coordinated projects that can be joined by any number of countries. EDA is also involved in the Marsur (Maritime Surveillance) project, which has been joined by 17 Member States as well as Norway to date. It has led to the development of a technical solution that connects European navies\u2019 surveillance systems to improve global maritime awareness and enhance interoperability.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/10/28/new-european-maritime-mine-counter-measures-project-launched"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0643", "date": "2014-10-28", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "European Defence Matters: Issue 6 Released", "text": " The sixth issue of European Defence Matters, the official magazine of the European Defence Agency, is now available online.

More than 40 participants from sixteen\u00a0EDA Member States and Serbia, as well as the European Commission, the European Parliament, the EU Military Staff (EUMS) and the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR), started a three-day European Armaments Cooperation Course. This course, the third of its kind, is organised jointly by EDA and the European Security and Defence College (ESDC). It is divided into two parts: the Awareness Level, now ongoing in Brussels, and the Expert Level, which will take place from 24 to 28 November in Prague, Czech Republic. The course is intended primarily for practitioners working in national and international armament cooperation who need to gain knowledge and experience in European acquisition and project management. It aims to provide them with a better understanding of frameworks, stakeholders, tools, and processes of European armaments cooperation, as well as its many benefits and challenges. Learning from each other As the EDA Deputy Chief Executive, Rini Goos, said today: \u201cWe, in Europe, need to be clear on how we work together, learning from each other and tackling co-operation from a European perspective. This is essential and in the long-term I would like to see a common understanding and approach emerge, supported where required through training and education courses like this one. This is where I see the EDA adding the most value and impact; improving the delivery of future European military capabilities to make the Common Security and Defence Policy more credible in line with the 2013 European Council conclusions.\u201d EDA's work in this domain started in 2006 when the Agency commissioned a study on cooperative lessons learned. Best practice and education were shortlisted among key enablers for cooperative programmes. The topic received widespread support from Member States and in 2007 the EDA Steering Board, in National Armaments Directors configuration, directed the Agency to focus in particular on education in European armaments acquisitions. Education and training platform In 2009, the Czech Republic\u2019s EU Presidency supported the creation of a new European armaments cooperation course; providing an EU-wide education and/or training platform where a common understanding of a European approach to armaments cooperation can be promoted and nurtured. EDA Member States welcomed the initiative and later that year the EDA Steering Board, in National Armaments Directors configuration, approved the top-level European Armaments Co-operation (EAC) Framework, under which the current course has been established. In 2013, thanks to the initiative of Austria and other like-minded countries, including the Czech Republic, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, the course took its current form. It followed the success of the pilot European Armaments Cooperation Course organised in Brussels and Stadtschlaining in 2012. A real and urgent need Giampaolo Lillo, EDA Cooperation Planning and Support Director, said: \u201cThe technical, legal and administrative complexities of cooperation programmes \u2013 and the lack of expertise on how to tackle them \u2013 appear to be part of the reason why the potential of European armament cooperation remains largely untapped. This is why I think this course aims at the right target, responding to a real and urgent need. Apart from the obvious interest to practitioners, it is also very useful for anybody involved in the legislative process at EU level.\u201d EDA, in its effort to offer Member States the most effective and tailored support to enhance their interoperability, upon its restructuring created in the Cooperation Planning and Support Directorate a dedicated Education, Training and Exercises Unit to address education and training activities in an harmonised way. This course is one of its outcomes.

A demonstration will be conducted during the Euronaval defence exhibition taking place 27-31 October in Le Bourget, north of Paris. One of the longest-running projects undertaken by the European Defence Agency (EDA), Marsur is a technical solution that allows dialog between European maritime information systems. Containing 17 Member States plus Norway, the project aims to improve the common \u201crecognised maritime picture\u201d by facilitating exchange of operational maritime information and services such as ship positions, tracks, identification data, chat or images. The Marsur network The interface is installed in each participating Navy\u2019s operational headquarters. A key characteristic of the Marsur network is that there is no central EU component that collects and distributes information. Each Member State is responsible for correlating its own data with the data received from other countries and for boosting the services within the community. Reflecting on this important milestone, Claude-France Arnould, EDA Chief Executive, said: \u201cMarsur is a great example of efficient Pooling & Sharing of existing capabilities. The project has now reached the point where it is ready to be used by European navies\u201d. Marsur is designed to become the potential \u201cmilitary layer\u201d of the wider Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE) project led by the European Commission. Marsur could work in conjunction with other \u201csystems of systems\u201d to ensure efficient interaction with other European maritime security stakeholders and also in support of CSDP missions.\u00a0 During Euronaval, an event will be held on 28 October at 1430 (Paris time) to mark the beginning of Marsur\u2019s operational phase and the symbolic handover of the system. The Marsur demonstration will be available throughout the show at the CSC booth (B46). Background The Marsur project was formally launched in September 2006 by 15 Member States. It was first tested in June 2011 when six countries successfully conducted an initial networking demonstration in Brussels.

Lt Col Farmer is the medical planner for the EU Military Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali).\u00a0 She has been a nurse within the British Army for almost 30 years, being deployed to Afghanistan, the Balkans, and a range of other countries. Alison, what does EUTM Mali do and what is your role within it? Lt Col Farmer is the medical planner for the EU Military Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali). The aim of EUTM Mali is to contribute to the training and advice of the Malian Armed Forces (MaAF). The Mission began in February 2013, following the request of the Malian authorities (and UNSCR 2071), to help Malian troops overcome the insurgency in northern Mali.\u00a0 More than 23 EU Member States have contributed military personnel to the mission to date. As the Joint Medical Planner for the Mission, I am responsible for all aspects of medical support and advice in the Mission Area. Within my team of 3, we conduct planning to ensure all our medical assets (medical treatment facilities including Ground and Air MEDEVAC), can deliver continuous 24 hour care for EUTM MALI personnel. We also undertake health surveillance of our Population at Risk and health threats from the local environment. What challenges do you face in Mali? What do you need to take into account when formulating medical plans? The main one is that of logistics; the training of the MaAF takes place at different locations in southern Mali \u2013 so we implement a medical plan to mitigate against any possible incident at the sites. Our plan has to be robust to make sure we can medically evacuate a seriously injured casualty from the point of incident to our Role 2 within the 10-1-2 medical planning guidelines. This can be challenging considering the distances that we need to cover, and the infrastructure within Mali. We test all our plans through recces and by monthly medical exercises before the plans are agreed by the Mission Commander. How does your team work? Do you work in separate national teams within the mission? No, my team is multinational, and medical planning is conducted for the whole of the mission, not for a single nation; so for all French, German, Belgian, Spanish etc.; whichever Member State personnel are part of EUTM MALI. What are the advantages and challenges of this multinational environment? It\u2019s a great opportunity to share our knowledge and experience with each other.\u00a0 I see it as overwhelmingly positive; we all have different backgrounds and skills. We may have different approaches to the challenges we face, but our common goal in making the mission a success, gels our methods. Much of that is about information sharing and finding the best way to manage situations. Lastly why are you here at the EU medical symposium? And have you found it a useful experience? The EUMS medical advisor told me about the symposium. The event and the programme drew my attention, as the topics were broad and varied.\u00a0 It\u2019s also a great way of meeting those at strategic level and fellow planners from other missions to have a broader understanding of what else is going on. I\u2019ve really enjoyed the\u00a0two days and have learnt a lot.\u00a0 I have spoken to lots of people during the symposium which has opened up new information exchange areas.

In total, 29 students from Spain, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands completed the course. Over the course of the exercise, 56 sorties were flown accounting for about 100 flight hours, 31 drops were conducted as well as 92 tactical approaches and 15 landing on unprepared airstrips. A combination of academic lessons and actual flights, this first edition of EAATTC was hosted by the Spanish air force on Zaragoza airbase. \u201cSpain provided great support to the event\u201d, Michele Rega, EDA Project Officer Fixed-Wing Aircraft and EAATTC14 exercise director, points out. \u201cWe were able to deliver high-level training to our first class of crews and this successful first edition paves the way towards future EAATTC events\u201d, he adds.\u00a0Three \u00a0additional courses, including single-ship, multiple-ship, and night vision goggles (NVG) training, are expected to take place in 2015 in Bulgaria, France, and Spain.\u00a0 Designed at the request of Member States to provide European air transport crews with an advanced academic and flying training syllabus, EAATTC was initiated by the European Defence Agency in close cooperation with the European Air Transport Command (EATC), which brought major support to the course in terms of human resources and expertise.\u00a0 The course is intended to become a European alternative to the American AATTC initiative, a rendezvous that has been attended for decades by airlift crews from the US and allied nations. However, European Member States are now seeking different ways to provide their crews with this much-needed training. EAATTC is the perfect answer to that ever-growing challenge, with European air forces now able to benefit from a high-level training closer to their home bases, thus saving the cost of a return trip across the Atlantic.\u00a0 Background EAATTC is one of the tangible outputs of the wider European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) partnership launched in 2011 and now gathering 19 Member States plus Norway (AT, BE, BG, CZ, DE, EL, ES, FI, FR, IT, LT, LU, NL, PL, PT, RO, SK, SE and HU).

Michele Rega, EDA Project Officer Fixed-Wing Aircraft and EAATTC14 exercise director, discusses the objectives and the program of the event. What is the scope of EAATTC14, and what are its main expected outcomes? Considering the success of previous European Air Transport Training (EATT) events delivered since 2012 under the auspices of EDA, Member States from the European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) partnership decided that besides offering combined training on a recurrent basis, a tactics course should also be established in Europe. The main objective of EAATTC is therefore to provide a robust airlift tactics training syllabus to enhance interoperability between aircrews. We take qualified crews into a theatre deployment mindset and we make them fly airland and airdrop missions in a tactically-challenging environment, including surface-to-air and air-to-air threats. What will be the program of the coming days? The first week of EAATTC is a combination of academic lessons and flights, in accordance with the agreed syllabus. Twelve hours of classroom time are planned: these academics will rely upon the EAATT Tactics Techniques and Procedures (ETTP) and will be delivered by a cadre of instructors provided by the European Air Transport Command (EATC). Nine flights will also take place as part of the course, for a total of 18 hours. The flight schedule will be based on single-ship missions, with all but one sortie being flown in a single wave. Crew training will of course include the mission planning phase as well. And at the end of the course on 2 October, a certificate will be delivered to the graduating students. What are the synergies with other European efforts in the air transport domain? Michele Rega\u00a0is EDA Project Officer Fixed-Wing Aircraft and EAATTC14 exercise director\u00a0 First, I think it is worth keeping in mind that all the Agency\u2019s activities in the field of air transport are initiated out of the EATF partnership, signed in 2011 by 19 EU Member States as well as Norway. The EATC in Eindhoven is also a major partner and provides outstanding support to the planning and execution of those activities. As far as EAATTC is concerned, we are currently working on the establishment of a permanent European advanced airlift training centre whose location should be decided by the end of 2014. Originally, it was envisioned that the EAATTC would replace the EATT events, but Member States expressed an interest in keeping both in order to keep practicing national training objectives. This is why in 2015, we will see one EATT and three EAATTC events taking place around Europe. Topics of interest to the air transport community are also discussed thoroughly during the European Air Transport Symposium (EATS) organised each year by EDA. Background EAATTC is one of the tangible outputs of the wider European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) partnership, launched in 2011 and now gathering 19 Member States plus NO (AT, BE, BG, CZ, DE, EL, ES, FI, FR, IT, LT, LU, NL, PL, PT, RO, SK, SE and HU). The initiative aims to achieve a higher level of interoperability between airlift crews from different nations and to increase harmonisation of advanced tactical training. Other activities undertaken as part of EATF include the European Air Transport Training (EATT) series of events as well as the European Air Transport Symposium, both organised once a year by the European Defence Agency; the further development and management of the diplomatic clearances technical arrangement; and the development of a common maintenance and training project for operators of the C-27J Spartan transport aircraft.

Metamaterials are artificially engineered materials that have been altered to exhibit properties not found in nature. Research and development of metamaterials is a rapidly growing field, which could eventually result in a huge range of new applications for both the civilian and military domains. An important area of research is concerned with new antennas for applications, such as communications, EW (Electronic Warfare), or even multifunctional sensing. This purpose behind the MIMCRA project was to show how antennas developed using metamerials can provide significantly higher levels of performance than conventionally developed antennas. The project perfomed a study which established a robust set of requirements for three different types of antennas. These requirements outlined the limitations of current antennas and considered possible applications of new materials and designs, focusing particularly on benefits for aeronautical platforms. Building on this study, demonstrator structures were developed (see picture above)\u00a0that pushed the boundaries of material design and illustrated how using metamaterials could produce antennas with performance levels significantly greater than those using conventionial design methods and materials.\u00a0\u00a0 The research performed highlighted the enhancements that these new approaches can bring, however more work is needed before these technologies can produce commercially viable solutions. The project was managed and funded by France and the UK, within the framework of the European Defence Agency. The work was carried out by a wide consortium of different companies and universities: Airbus, Dassault Aviation, Thales, Telecom ParisTech, Institut d\u2019\u00c9lectronique Fondamentale, BAE Systems, MBDA (UK), Queen Mary College London, and Oxford University.

From 21 September to 3 October, the European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course (EAATTC) will be joined by seven Member States and hosted by the Spanish Air Force. Initiated by the European Defence Agency in close cooperation with the European Air Transport Command (EATC), this first-of-its-kind initiative is a perfect example of pooling and sharing. Its aim is to provide air transport crews with academic as well as flying training tactics and procedures through three main courses: single-ship, multiple-ships, and night-vision goggles (NVG). A dedicated tactics techniques and procedures manual will form the basis of this syllabus. The EATC is an important contributor to the EAATTC initiative, providing major support to the course in terms of human resources while also leading the cadre of instructors that will deliver the syllabus to the students. This course was designed by the EDA as a European alternative to the American AATTC initiative, a rendezvous that has been attended for decades by airlift crews from the US and allied nations. However, European Member States are now seeking different ways to provide their crews with this much-needed training. EAATTC is the perfect answer to that rising challenge, with European air forces now able to benefit from a high-level training closer to their home bases, thus saving the cost of a return trip across the Atlantic.

From 1 to 12 September 2014, fourteen Counter-IED experts from Austria, Germany, Italy, Ireland, and Sweden took part in an intensive Manual Neutralisation Exercise at the Austrian Army\u2019s Logistics School in Vienna. The exercise was organised by Austria as lead nation\u00a0in close cooperation with the European Defence Agency (EDA). Manual neutralisation refers to situations where a trained operator has to manually defuse an improvised explosive device. This occurs when it is not possible to tackle the device remotely, for example when the device is attached to a hostage or with chemical or even radiological material. It is one of the most mentally and technically challenging jobs performed by anyone in the armed forces, requiring high-level skills and training. The aim of the exercise was to give participants the chance to use and develop\u00a0 these skills in a highly demanding, multinational environment. Over the two-week period, they were given a series of different and increasingly complex scenarios and devices to deal with. One operator from Ireland, who participated in the exercise, commented, \u201cfor most of us, this is only one element of our jobs, thankfully we do not encounter devices like this every day. Training like this is vital, to ensure that we are as sharp and up-to-date as possible when we do encounter a complex device or hostage situation.\u201d The Austrian officer in charge, explained the advantages of running the course at a European level, \u201cobviously one important element is cost. By pooling demand from different countries with similar needs, we can afford to do more than we would be able to do individually. However, another important part is bringing together operatives from across Europe, learning from each other, and developing a European network of manual neutralisation experts\u201d, he said. Manual Neutralisation Techniques Courses and Exercises The course is part of the EDA\u2019s Manual Neutralisation Techniques Courses and Exercises programme. It is the second event to be held under the programme in Austria this year, after the completion of the first European Manual Neutralisation Training Course in May. Both the course and exercise made use of specially designed manual neutralisation kits for defusing improvised explosive devices. These kits were purchased by EDA and given to the Austrian Armed Forces to be stored at the logistics school, however they are available on request for operational use by all participating EDA Member States.

This is the first time EDA has provided this type of support to an EU mission. In\u00a0July and September 2014, the EDA provided Cyber Awareness training to a total of 150 EUFOR RCA staff from the Operations headquarters in Larissa, Greece. The seminars were designed to raise the situational awareness, in terms of Cyber operations, of each staff member of the Operation Headquarters as well as to inform about the development and establishment of EU capabilities. The seminars also provided the opportunity to exchange views on the next steps to be taken to enhance the Cyber Defence capabilities of operation EUFOR RCA and other EU-led military operations. Speaking about the cooperation Brigadier General Christos Drivas, EUFOR RCA Chief of Staff added,\u00a0 \u201cCyber Defence is high on our agenda. The decision to use the expertise from EDA is, of course, based on EDA\u2019s technical knowledge in this field. Another advantage will be to benefit from the lessons learned in conducting such a training for other EU operations in the future.\u201d The seminars were conducted with support from the EU Military Staff and Tallinn Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence. Observers from the Greek General staff(as representatives for the OHQ parent nation) and from the Italian EU OHQ core staff also participated. The fifth domain of warfare Cyberspace today is often described as the fifth domain of warfare equally critical to military operations as land, sea, air, and space. Success of military operations in the physical domains is increasingly dependent on the availability of, and access to, cyberspace. The armed forces are reliant on cyberspace both as a user and as a domain to achieve defence and security missions. Cyber defence is one of the ten priorities in the EDA capability development plan (CDP). Given that threats are multifaceted, a comprehensive approach is taken, seeking to enhance synergies between the civilian and military domains in protecting critical cyber assets. At the EU Summit of December 2013, Heads of State and Government endorsed the Agency\u2019s cyber defence roadmap for strengthening - in close coordination with Member States, EEAS, and the European Commission \u2013 European cyber defence capabilities. Its main elements are training, improving cyber situational awareness, improving civil/military cooperation, the protection of EU assets during missions, and operations and technological aspects. EUFOR RCA The Council established on 10 February 2014 an EU military operation to contribute to a secure environment in the Central African Republic, as authorized by the UN Security Council in resolution 2134 (2014). EUFOR RCA is to provide support in achieving a safe and secure environment in the Bangui area, with a view to handing over to the UN incoming operation. The force will thereby contribute to international efforts to protect the populations most at risk, creating the conditions for providing humanitarian aid.

A distinguished visitors (DV) day is taking place today at Ovar airbase, Portugal, as part of the European helicopter exercise Hot Blade 2014 held 16-30 July. The EDA-supported event again delivered tangible results by allowing cooperative training and improving interoperability between the six participating Member States. As of July 23, 163 sorties had been flown by the participants in support of Hot Blade 2014, amounting to a total of 345 flight hours. Missions have been designed specifically to maximize integration between national detachments and to enhance interoperability. The exercise addresses the ability to lead large-scale multinational missions, as well as fulfilling some national training objectives. Organised as part of the European Defence Agency\u2019s Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP), Hot Blade 2014 is hosted by the Portuguese Air Force for the third time since 2012. Ovar airbase, located 40 kilometers south of Porto, has been home of 25 helicopters and their crews since July 16, with a total of 3.000 military personnel directly involved in the event. Cooperative training \"One can only be impressed by the outstanding contribution of the Portuguese Armed Forces and the other participating Member States to today\u2019s event. This once again underscores the wide interest shown for EDA\u2019s training and exercise initiative,\" stressed Rini Goos, Deputy Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency, during the DV Day. Six European countries have brought their rotary-wing aircraft to Ovar: Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal and the United Kingdom. Observers from Italy, Sweden, Hungary, Brazil and NATO Special Operation Forces Headquarters (NSHQ) are also attending. Training together The aim of Hot Blade 2014 is to increase interoperability between participating Member States while at the same time allowing crews to train in a hot, high and dusty environment similar to the one they might encounter on the battlefield. Multiple sorties have been flown each day with increasingly complex tactical scenarios and missions, including large-scale Composite Air Operations led by each national detachment. Hot Blade 2014 is the seventh exercise supported by EDA under the umbrella of the Helicopter Exercise Programme. The fact that these events are now integrated into the nations\u2019 training syllabus is a testimony to their success and relevance for European operators. The Agency is conducting similar efforts in the field of tactical air transport and air-to-air refueling, respectively with the EATT (European Air Transport Training) and EART (European Air Refueling Training) series of exercises. \u201cThe European Defence Agency is an output and capability-driven organization. We focus on supporting our Member States with concrete programs and projects\u201d, Rini Goos added. \u201cThis is why, upon its restructuring, the Agency established a dedicated Education, Training & Exercise Unit.\u201d Background The European Defence Agency\u2019s Helicopter Exercise Programme is part of the wider Helicopter Training Programme (HTP) initiative. This also includes the Helicopters Tactics Course (HTC), the Helicopter Tactics Instructor Course (HTIC), the OELC (Operational English Language Course), the DisSim CCD (Distributed Simulation Capability Concept Demonstrator) and the Basic Helicopter Flying Training (BHFT) initiative. The first EDA-supported multinational helicopter exercise took place in Gap (France) in March 2009. It has since been followed by six subsequent exercises of various scope and size, held in Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Future editions are expected to take place in Italy and Finland.

What are the main objectives of Hot Blade 2014 ? Since we started work on the multinational helicopter exercises in 2009, we\u2019ve always tried to achieve the same basic set of objectives. First, we\u2019re trying to improve interoperability between our Member States\u2019 helicopter crews, because there is a very good chance that they will have to work together on the same battlefield in the years to come \u2013 and we truly mean working together, integrating national capabilities into a multination coalition, not the just the deconfliction that has been used in the past. \u00a0We\u2019re also working on improving individual skills, and in order to achieve that we need a training environment that replicates as closely as possible the conditions that we might find in a given theatre of operations.\u00a0 Here in Portugal, we naturally focus on \u201chot, high & dusty\u201d conditions, not unlike the ones you could find in Afghanistan or in some parts of Africa, but we also intend to practice in other environments, for instance extreme cold. \u00a0The overarching objective is really quite simple. Future operations will be coalition operations and we know we should train the way we fight, so we must train together. We need to learn how to work together today, in a controlled environment, not tomorrow, when we have already been deployed and have hostile forces to worry about.\u00a0 \u00a0 Are there specific outputs expected from this year\u2019s event ? We have to be careful not to increase the complexity of each exercise too much as each time it is a new set of crews and you need to build the exercise to suit them. My main output will always be to see the crews experience and competency improve. For Hot Blade, this specifically addresses the ability to lead a large-scale multinational mission \u2013 this is very hard for them to organise at home and so the exercise is designed to give them that opportunity. \u00a0Within that we also have specific individual training objectives: for instance, the Netherlands use Hot Blade for its low visibility landing training \u2013 its \u201cdust landing\u201d training. \u00a0This is particularly important to them, as these are the conditions they are encountering in Mali \u2013 the Dutch Detachment Commander here deploys to Mali in September.\u00a0We are always aware that the exercise should have a direct link to the operational needs of the participants and again this is at the heart of the exercise design. \u00a0 A particularly pleasing aspect of this year\u2019s exercises is the participation of infantry from Netherlands and Germany. \u00a0One of the reasons I am so focussed on aircrew training is that on operations we place our soldiers in each other\u2019s aircraft. \u00a0We need to make sure that all crews on a coalition, no matter what flag they have on their uniform, are capable of completing the mission safely and competently. \u00a0We have recognised standards for the aircraft, but not for the pilots that fly them. \u00a0I think this is necessary and that we owe it to our troops to understand the capabilities of our coalition partners. There is no high level agreement in place, so we are trying to build this understanding from the bottom up.\u00a0 \u00a0 Could you describe some of the missions that have been conducted in Ovar so far in a little more detail? We have already launched two large scale Composite Air Operations (COMAOs). \u00a0 Each detachment takes a turn in leading the mission; the first was led by Portugal and the latest one by the UK. \u00a0Today\u2019s main mission is CSAR (Combat Search and Rescue) extraction, but there are sub-missions, which have been planned to pull the \u201cenemy\u201d focus away from the main event. \u00a0These include suppression of a mortar position and a potential seizure of a high value target, possible through a vehicle interdiction. The scenario and the mission are complex and are conducted in a fluid, ill-defined context \u2013 very much like real life. The main mission package today shows how integrated the forces are as it involves four Portuguese F-16, providing over-watch and Close Air Support; two Belgian A109 providing escort to a Portuguese EH -101, which will do the CSAR pick up. The diversionary attacks will be carried out by two British Pumas, two Dutch CH-47 Chinooks, three Austrian AB212 and five German UH1-Ds carrying infantry from Portugal, Germany and the Netherlands. And this is only the second COMAO, so the complexity of these missions will increase as the exercise progresses.\u00a0 More information Hot Blade 2014 mini-site Link to the Hot Blade 2014 factsheet Pictures of the exercise on our dedicated Flickr gallery ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/07/22/hot-blade-2014-interview-we-know-we-should-train-the-way-we-fight-"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0669", "date": "2014-07-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Counter-IED lab arrives in the Netherlands", "text": " The EDA-developed Multinational Theatre Exploitation Laboratory Demonstrator, or MNTEL (D), arrived in the Netherlands on 24 July from Afghanistan, where it was deployed since 2011.

What is the real effect of today\u2019s pressure on national defence budgets? \u00a0A recent Agency study sought to answer this precise question. Some of its conclusions are revealing: for example, for each \u20ac100m cut in EU defence expenditure, there is a \u20ac150m fall in EU gross domestic product (GDP), and a \u20ac40m fall in EU tax revenues. However, the consequences of such cuts extend far beyond the pure economical realm. The study, which was conducted by British consultancy firm Europe Economics, also highlighted that a similar \u20ac100m cut in defence spending would translate into the loss of about 3.000 jobs, 800 of which would be high-skilled.\u00a0 \u00a0 Greater impact. In some key dimensions, the overall macroeconomic benefit of investing in the defence sector may exceed that of investing in other domains. For instance, the study confirmed that defence investments have a far great impact on highly-skilled employment and research and development, hence potentially leading to a long-term GDP growth rate. The results of the study estimated that the impact is 12 to 20 times greater than that generated by other forms of public spending. Of equal importance is the fact that defence R&D creates a \u201cspillover\u201d of technologies to the civil sector. \u00a0This often significant \u201cspillover\u201d, means that investing in defence R&D is essential to the emergence of breakthrough technologies which has a knock on benefit in other areas eg civil aircraft market. More generally, the study demonstrated that the macroeconomic impact of investment in the defence sector is greater at EU level than at the national level, because of the inherent \u201cEuropeanised\u201d nature of the defence industry.\u00a0 \u00a0 Case studies. The study also reviewed a number of case studies to try and quantify the micro-economic impact of several acquisition programs in the EU, like fighter aircraft. It confirms, for instance, that programmes such as Eurofighter or Rafale helped EU companies to acquire the competitiveness they enjoy today on the commercial aircraft market. \u00a0Another example is the Leopard 2 main battle tank programme which was launched in the last years of the Cold War. \u00a0It enabled the German Army to equip its cavalry regiments with a highly capable system, at a cost that was 45 per cent lower than the next best alternative.\u00a0 This was the first study which looked at the EU as a whole; previous efforts were focused only at national level. \u00a0It demonstrates tangible rationale to support investment in the European defence industry, confirming that there are considerable opportunities to increase the efficiency of European collaborative programmes and at the same time European economic prosperity.\u00a0 ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/07/28/spending-that-matters-the-economic-case-for-investing-in-europe-s-defence-industry"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0671", "date": "2014-07-09", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "One week to go until Exercise Hot Blade 2014", "text": " The multinational helicopter exercise supported by the European Defence Agency will kick off on July 16th at Ovar airbase, Portugal.

A multinational research and development project under the leadership of the European Defence Agency (EDA) has succeeded in implementing the entire supply chain for the realization of power electronics components based on gallium nitride within Europe. With the optimisation of development and manufacturing techniques for power electronics based on gallium nitride (GaN), researchers and industry partners from five European countries pursue the aim of producing high quality GaN-based electronic devices in Europe, without relying on international suppliers. Due to the high efficiency and robustness of the semiconductor, GaN-based power electronic components already replace established technologies, mainly in the fields of radar and broadband amplifiers. \u00a0With respect to the increasing application of the efficient components in electronic defense and combat systems, the European defence industry is facing an increasing demand for the reliable supply of power electronic components. The technology is critical and will provide key enabling capabilities to a broad spectrum of Defence applications, reaching from advanced radar and communication \u00a0antennas to electronic warfare. \u00a0 An independent supply chain in Europe Guided by the European Defence Agency (EDA), leading research institutions, universities, as well as defence related companies from Germany, France, Italy, Sweden and the United Kingdom worked together during the past four years in the project MANGA (Manufacturable GaN-SiC-substrates and GaN epitaxial \u00a0wafers supply chain) in order to optimize gallium nitride technologies in Europe. To facilitate an independent production of GaN-based electronic devices for military applications, it is necessary to implement the entire supply chain within Europe \u2013 reaching from the availability of Silicon Carbide (SiC) substrates for the epitaxial growth of gallium nitride, to the industrial manufacturing of High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMT). In the scope of the project, GaN-based transistor layers were grown epitaxially on newly developed, high quality SiC-substrates. Applying established foundry processing, these transistor layers were finally used to produce fully European state-of-the-art High Electron Mobility Transistors. Both the quality of the SiC-substrates and the performance of the HEMT are comparable to equivalent benchmark-setting components produced in the United States. \u00a0 Systems with increased reliability Also in future projects, it will remain the goal of the EDA to further reduce the European defense industry\u2019s dependence on international trade regulations. After having successfully realized the independent development and production of state-of-the-art transistors suitable for military applications, the project partners want to focus on the improvement of the reliability and material quality of the transistors. Results from universities participating in the project MANGA, where scientists studied the impact of variations in layer structures on the devices\u2019 performance, will help to further optimize the HEMT-technology.

Previous course participants and indeed all of the instructors have gained operational Personnel Recovery experience in various operations such as in ISAF in Afghanistan, Operation Unified Protector (OUP) in Libya and Operation SERVAL in Mali. \u201cThis course is indeed very helpful for our operational planning. The instructors are very experienced and motivated\u201d, said course participant Captain G\u00e1bor Kren\u00e1cs from the Hungarian Air Force. As well as the Hungarian staff instructors, a multi-national instruction team from Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, France, Sweden and the United States deployed to Veszpr\u00e9m in order to support the training and to evaluate the 2nd PRCPC. Staff were also sent from NATO associated entities and the European Personnel Recovery Centre (EPRC). Major Tor Cavalli-Bj\u00f6rkman, a Swedish instructor and the main initiator of this European project, is convinced: \u201cSince we started, first with a series of four pilot courses in 2011 and then with the establishment of a CAT B project in 2013, we have all benefited tremendously from this multi-national training and information exchange.\u201d The contributing Member States at the moment are Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands under the lead of Sweden. The first course under the Cat B arrangement was conducted in February/March this year in Karlsborg, Sweden. Major Cavalli-Bj\u00f6rkman also stressed that \u201cthis initiative increases the number of trained personnel available to support on-going operations as well as the EU Battle Group and national staffs.\u201d Standardise Personnel Recovery Training in Europe The initiative to standardise Personnel Recovery training emerged from the Project Team Personnel Recovery (PT PR) in EDA at the end of November 2010. Peter Round, Capability, Armament & Technology Director at EDA, stated: \u201cI am most grateful that Hungary agreed to offer this opportunity and hosted it so successfully at its Air Command and Control Centre\u2019s facilities. This initiative has made a significant contribution to Personnel Recovery capabilities in Europe.\u201d Major Konrad Ertl from the German Air Operations Command in Kalkar and Chairman of the PT PR said \u201cWe all, students as well as instructors, are deeply impressed of the tremendous effort the HDF and the Hungarian Air Force has put in to setting-up this course. The facilities at the ACCC in Veszpr\u00e9m are very suitable for this course. Also the professionalism and the very high dedication of the Hungarian Hosts to this course was amazing. Finally, we all benefitted from an outstanding learning experience while enjoying the great hospitality in Hungary. Overall this made it very easy for us to do what we do, so \u2018that others may live \u2013 and return with honour\u2019. \u2018K\u00f6sz\u00f6n\u00f6m sz\u00e9pen\u2019 (many Thanks) to the Host nation!\u201d An officer from the ACCC said: \u201cIt was not an easy job to organise and run the course, but with the unselfish help of our colleagues and with one of the best instructor teams I have ever seen we accomplished the mission.\u201d Mitigating the risk of isolation, capture, and exploitation Personnel Recovery is aimed at mitigating and reacting to the risk of isolation, capture, and exploitation of military or civilian personnel for instance during a Crisis Management Operation (CMO). The Personnel Recovery Course, held regularly by various host nations, is one of several results of the respective Project Team at EDA. Other initiatives include a Personnel Recovery Concept, a Personnel Recovery Functional Area Service to be connected to command & control systems in tactical and operational Headquarters for planners and controllers, a personnel registration tool and the preparation of a Personnel Recovery Baseline Training Tool.

The course, run jointly by the European Defence Agency and Europol, brought together 28 experts from 16 different countries.\u00a0 The participants took part in highly realistic training scenarios involving homemade explosives, in order to improve skills and to share best practices. The training consisted of identifying, processing, and disposing of different types of\u00a0 homemade explosives that can be found in improvised laboratories, such as those of\u00a0criminals and/or terrorists. The cooperation between EDA and Europol reflects the need for a combined civil-military approach to the threat not only of homemade explosives but the whole C-IED spectrum. This approach helps to ensure that there are clear lines of communication between the two and the need to share skills and experiences among military and civilian law enforcement agencies. EU-US Cooperation The course also showed the increasingly close ties between EU and US actors in the field of explosives security and safety issues with participation and support from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The course received very positive feedback from participants, with organisers looking at the possibility of arranging a second course to meet the high level of demand.\u00a0 The course forms part of EDA\u2019s comprehensive approach to tackling improvised explosive devices (IEDs). These efforts include areas such as \u00a0the counter-IED Technical exploitation lab Level 2 Multinational Technical Exploitation Laboratory, MNTEL (D) which \u00a0has been stationed in Afghanistan since 2011, a Manual Neutralisation Techniques Category B programme, for which the first exercise will be held in September in Vienna (1 to 12 September), the Joint Deployable Exploitation Analysis laboratory (JDEAL) initiative, which its operational life is intended to start in November 2014 as well as another ongoing C IED related activities and projects.

EATT14 takes place between 15 - 27 June and is the only European multinational air transport training of its kind. It brings together 460+ participants, 19 crews, and 10 transport aircraft from 10 different countries.\u00a0 EATT14: results so far As of 24 June, more than 80 missions have taken place with over 130 flying hours. 100 paratroopers have been dropped alongside more the 32,000 KGs of cargo.\u00a0The training objectives have been tailored to the needs of the different participating countries, with the missions developing on an increasing complexity basis. \u00a0Training objectives include airdrops, low level flying, and night operations \u2013 with around 10 hours of night flights having already taken place. The overall objective of the training is to achieve a far reaching level of interoperability between tactical airlift users in the area of operations and training. Challenging Conditions The first week of training was disrupted by severe weather conditions, which made flying conditions difficult and which caused serious and even fatal flooding in other areas of Bulgaria. Laurent Donnet, the Deputy Director of the Exercise, commented: \"The flying conditions in the first week presented significant challenges for training, I would like to thank the Bulgarian authorities for the flexibility and support they have provided under these circumstances. However, in operations we need to be able to react to challenging conditions and we need to be able to do so together, that is why training events like this are so important. It allows us to pool resources and share knowledge, meaning ultimately that we can work more effecitvely and more efficiently together.\u201d Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Spain, and Norway have all sent transport aircraft, with Bulgaria and Greece supporting the event with fighters and a Greek AEW&C aircraft.\u00a0As well as the participating countries, observers from Austria, Finland, Hungary, Portugal, Sweden, UK, USA, and the Heavy Airlift Wing based in Hungary also followed the training, with some of them indicating their intention of joining the exercise next year. \u00a0 Background The exercise takes places within the framework of the European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) partnership, which has been signed by 20 European countries in 2011. It aims to alleviate the existing airlift shortfall in the EU as well as to identify potential projects to optimise cooperation and coordination amongst air forces in the area of operations and training.

They have proven essential in modern-day operations around the world : Remotely Piloted Air Systems, or RPAS, are now a key priority for the European Defence Agency whose teams are working on several ways to improve Member States\u2019 capabilities in that domain. Speaking today during the 16th UVS (Unmanned Vehicle Systems) Annual Conference held 23-26 June at the Royal Military Academy in Brussels, and which drew over 200 participants from 30 countries, Jean-Youri Marty, RPAS program manager at EDA, stressed that this domain was recognized a major priority by Heads of States and Government at the last European Council in December 2013. \u201cWe know we have the skills and industries in Europe not only to do this but also to become a first class player in the field\u201d, he added. Five pillars EDA\u2019s work on RPAS in channeled into five main workstrands. The first one focuses on the preparation of a future European Male RPAS programme, based on a Common Staff Target endorsed by Member States in November 2013. Outputs of this ongoing preparation phase are now expected around 2016. Another area aims at optimizing the operational use of Male (Medium Altitude Long Endurance) RPAS currently in service in Europe. Seven EDA Member States have already decided to set up a dedicated Male RPAS community. EDA also helps its Member States harmonizing airworthiness certification processes, in collaboration with the European Aviation Safety Agency. In the meantime, the Agency conducts several studies on the critical issue of military RPAS integration insertion in the general air traffic, again in close cooperation with the EASA but also with the European Commission, the Sesar Joint Undertaking and Eurocontrol.

Gaining the benefits of harmonisation Whereas civil aviation falls under the auspices of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), Military aircraft are exclusively subject to national legislation. To counter this the EDA was entrusted with establishing the Military Airworthiness Authorities (MAWA) Forum to increase cooperation and harmonisation between Member States authorities. This approach offers many benefits, including enhancing Military aviation safety, improving Military-military and civil-military cooperation, reducing the time and cost for new aircraft development and optimising interoperability during joint air operations. Harmonised national airworthiness regulations are also a key enabler to unlock the benefits for all aviation related \u2018pooling and sharing\u2019 initiatives. Advantages of mutual recognition This year\u2019s conference will be the sixth time the event has been held.

Thirty participants from 10 countries and 25 organizations (industry, research centers and government) attended and discussed the results of the LAVOSAR study funded by the EDA in the frame of CapTech Ground Systems. The objectives of LAVOSAR study were to analyse standards and best practices, create a framework containing agreed definitions of context and terminology as a basis for more detailed studies, study and develop a functional and technical Mission System architecture, and study and develop a Business Case supporting an Open Architecture approach. Concrete results The topic generated substantial interest and is regarded as key for a comprehensive implementation of information technology in military vehicles resulting in drastic increase in performance and flexibility whilst, at the same time, achieving cost savings for procurement and especially for maintenance and logistics. One recommendation arising from the discussion was that the LAVOSAR current and future activities should\u00a0 support NATO General Vehicle Architecture (NGVA) standardization efforts and not to proceed to develop a separate standard. At the workshop, the LAVOSAR team presented the results of the\u00a0 study. In summary: This study provides an architecture which covers overarching concepts and methods. The architecture consists of a number of views covering aspects of Military Land Vehicle Mission Systems. However, an additional layer is needed for the architecture to be directly applicable to target applications. A modular approach could then be taken with additional, replacement or upgraded sub-systems. Logistics are simplified \u2013 including exchange of spare subsystems. Qualitative advantages such as situational awareness, operational efficiency and effectiveness in a networked environment are the most important drivers for this approach. Qualitative advantages are achieved without significant cost increase Overall cost savings were estimated at 10% to 25%\u00a0 of the Mission System cost Recommendations include development of Data Models; of Validation, Verification and Accreditation organization and procedures; and of a demonstrator for the App Store The full results presented at the work shop are available below.

This cooperation will help highlight the expertise and added value EDA can bring in the field of procurement.\u201d Supporting CSDP Missions and Operations As part of the restructuring conducted in January 2014, the Agency aims to play a greater role in supporting CSDP operations and missions. Speaking about the cooperation General Bradshaw added, \u201cThe decision to use the expertise from EDA in this procurement for Air to Ground Surveillance services for Op ALTHEA is, of course, based on EDA\u2019s technical knowledge in this field. Another advantage will be to benefit from the lessons learned in conducting such an arrangement between the operation and the EDA directly, in order to establish the necessary procedures which will potentially enable closer cooperation between our organisations in the future.\u201d This meeting was also an opportunity for Claude-France Arnould to introduce General Bradshaw, who took his functions in March 2014, to the mission and tasks of EDA. EUFOR ALTHEA The EU military operation ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina was launched on 2 December 2004 and has contributed to the maintenance of the safe and secure environment in BiH ever since. Operation ALTHEA is carried out with recourse to NATO assets and capabilities, under the \"Berlin Plus\" arrangements. After a review in 2012 the main objective is to provide capacity building and training for their armed forces whilst retaining the capability to support the BiH efforts to maintain a safe and secure environment.\u00a0 The Athena Mechanism ATHENA is the mechanism established to administer the financing of the common costs of European Union operations having military or defence implications governed by Council Decision 2011/871/CFSP.

The updated Framework Arrangement has broad applicability, covering both peacetime and times of crisis and all kinds of acquisitions. Hence, differing from its predecessor it is not limited any more to operational urgency nor to acquisitions conducted under Article 346 TFEU. The Framework Arrangement is also fully adapted to the new legal framework of the Defence and Security Procurement Directive 2009/81/EC and the Intra-Community Transfers Directive 2009/43/EC. All 27 EDA participating Member States, as well as Norway, have now decided to subscribe to and therefore participate in the implementation of the Framework Arrangement, highlighting the importance of Security of Supply. In coming years the EDA will act as a facilitator to support national implementation and application of the Framework Arrangement. In addition, the May 2014 Steering Board adopted a voluntary Code of Conduct on Prioritisation, associated with the Framework Arrangement, as a means to involve industry in the EDA Security of Supply framework, by establishing a way for industry to demonstrate its commitment to meet Member States enhanced Security of Supply requirements in defence procurement. The Code of Conduct is now open for subscription to the states participating in the Framework Arrangement.\u00a0 Subject to the national subscription to the Code of Conduct, defence industry can sign up to this voluntary Code on a case-by-case basis. Whilst doing so industry will accept a set of principles to ensure delivery and provision of defence equipment and services to the Member States. Both the Framework Arrangement and the Code of Conduct on Prioritisation are considered as substantial steps contributing towards the establishment of a comprehensive EU-wide Security of Supply Regime, as requested in the December 2013 European Council conclusions.

In February 2014 \u201cProject Turtle\u201d \u2013 a proposal from a consortium of Portuguese small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs), research institutes and universities to research ascent and descent energy-efficient technologies for robotic underwater vehicles \u2013 became the first of seven dual-use research initiatives supported by the EDA to access European Structural Funds (ESF). ESF are financial instruments that provide for \u201cthe implementation of EU Cohesion Policy to reinforce economic and social cohesion within the EU\u201d. The potential benefits for Europe\u2019s defence industry is considerable from accessing this\u00a0 source of finance are considerable .The new programming period, 2014-2020, contains more than \u20ac379 billion in European Regional Development Funds (ERDF), one of the ESF funds under which research and innovation ac\u00adtivities can be supported. According to Vassilis Tsiamis, who manages the ESF project within EDA nobody had, until recently, seriously considered the application of this type of funding for dual-use research and technology (R&T). \u201cThe real issue was to challenge the perception of eligibility,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just a question of \u2018can do\u2019 \u2013 but much more a question of can we do it, and what, precisely, is it that we can do?\u201d \u00a0 Vassilis Tsiamis, Project Officer, EDA Increasingly dual nature of technology The starting point has been recognition of the increasingly dual nature of technology and the significant potential that exists for synergies between civil and defence research. Energy, telecommunications, information technology, automotive and materials technologies, space, aeronautics and the chemicals industry provide examples of the potential benefits accruing to a wide variety of defence and civil applications. So why not use the facility afforded by ESF to recognise some of these benefits, the EDA asked? A new EU innovation policy concept called the Research and Innovation Smart Specialisation Strategy (RIS3) has been developed to promote the more effective use of public investment in research at a regional EU level. \u00a0Regional - and in a few cases national - authorities have been asked to identify the unique characteristics, assets and capabilities of their respective regions to focus policy support and investment channelled through ESF. Supporting the regions Including Croatia, there are some 273 identified EU regions, with almost 500 managing authorities directing the use of ESF.\u00a0 When the EDA put out a call for proposals for the use of ESF in development of dual-use technologies in 2013, it received 72 proposals from 12 Member States. Of these, the Agency decided to support seven as initial pilot cases. From Bulgaria came a proposal for the improvement of urban security and defence applications through use of advanced sensor systems, while from Poland an intruder-detection and collision avoidance system for aircraft has been proposed. A French consortium has offered a Europe-wide icing testing platform for aeronautics, while an industry proposal in the United Kingdom has put forward a project in Epitaxial Microwave technology \u2013 a critical capability for improving radar performance in both civil and military applications. From Spain came a proposal for the development of an underwater signature monitoring and analysis centre, while from Germany an adaptation of short wave infrared (SWIR) technology for high resolution hyper-spectral and imaging applications has been suggested. The seventh proposal, from Portugal, became the first of these pilot cases to reach a sufficiently mature level to win. It is important to recognise the fact these proposals have come from project holders in the various nations, and are not official \u2018national\u2019 project proposals. Ensuring we have the expertise \u201cThe first priority has been to acquire the expertise within the Agency and share it with the managers in the Ministries of Defence and then to arrange for in-depth knowledge transfer and capacity building with industry,\u201d said Tsiamis. Four seminars have already been held \u2013 in Bulgaria, Ireland, Poland and Portugal \u2013 aimed at increasing awareness of the opportunity and the methodology of successfully applying for supportive funding. Engaging the community \u2013 both governmental and industrial \u2013 and building capacity within that community to be able to benefit from this innovative approach to stemming the decreasing investment in defence-related R&T has been a key priority for Tsiamis and his colleagues throughout the process. Benefits for SMEs \u201cIt\u2019s important to recognise we are not creating process and we are not looking for more structural funds. What we are doing is helping defence actors to address these projects and to develop the application folders, ensuring the responsible authorities (in each region or nation) recognise the benefits SMEs can bring to the process and ensuring that the projects selected to move forward reflect the larger priorities of the EU,\u201d said Tsiamis. \u201cThe way forward is for more pilot projects and more seminars, offering pragmatic advice and support, not simply explaining theoretical policies. We are now training EDA project officers \u2013 approximately 15 of them \u2013 and are looking at possibilities in key EDA prioritised areas such as space, the cyber domain, maritime security, energy efficiency and remote piloted aerial systems (RPAS) \u00a0- as examples of what we can do from a positive and concrete results perspective,\u201d said Tsiamis. \u201cIndustry follows the money, and we are convinced there are enough significant opportunities for industry to recognise that engaging in this programme will have tangible and measurable results on its R&T activities,\u201d said Tsiamis. He said that one of the new actions the Agency will be following during 2014 is to assess the degree to which European Territorial Cooperation on dual-use technology projects can be part of cross-border programmes financed by the European Regional Development Fund \u00a0(ERDF), to create an even larger pot of financial resources on which to draw. EDA\u2019s programme commitment to exploiting these opportunities currently has a three year timescale. \u201cLooked at from all directions, we are in a win/win situation here \u2013 we\u2019re supporting SMEs, we\u2019re supporting regional research and technology development while simultaneously stimulating dual-use research, we\u2019re supporting EU policy and most importantly, we\u2019re conforming with the EU Common Security and Defence\u00a0 Policy (CSDP) key priorities, as adopted by December 2013 EU Council conclusions ,\u201d said Tsiamis. The Agency\u2019s role in this can be seen as one of being a facilitator, encouraging SMEs in particular to come forward with innovative proposals and providing assistance and support in the process of applying for funding that will see those proposals come to fruition. \u00a0\u201cThe message is simple,\u201d said Tsiamis. \u201cWe\u2019re here to help \u2013 we can reduce hesitations \u2013 come talk to us!\u201d More Information Your Guide to European\u00a0Structural\u00a0Funds for Dual Use Technologies ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/05/27/eda-achieves-new-source-of-dual-use-research-funding"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0695", "date": "2014-06-03", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Norwegian Minister of Defence Visits EDA", "text": " Ine Eriksen S\u00f8reide, the Minister of Defence of Norway, met with Claude-France Arnould, Chief Executive European Defence Agency\u00a0(EDA) at the Agency's\u00a0headquarters\u00a0on 3 June 2014.

Network Enabled Capabilities While the concept of network enabled capabilities (NEC) has become integrated into European national military structures over the last few years only recently has work begun to take this to the next stage \u2013 to develop a single secure command and control (C2) network to support multinational operations involving military and civil organisations in support of the EU\u2019s common security and defence policy (CSDP). \u00a0 \u201cThere are three elements to this:\u00a0 technology issues, the way you deal with the information being exchanged and an understanding of the people who use it,\u201d said Chris Stace, Project Office Command and Control -Information. \u201cWe now have a series of work-streams to address these specific challenges in these areas and to connect to communications technologies.\u201d \u00a0 Developing a common information sharing and decision-making architecture for military forces of allied nations is difficult enough, as different national headquarters (HQs) have different standard operating procedures, different ways of managing information and different technical ways of communicating between different levels. \u201cFor operation Atalanta, for example, the UK provided the operational headquarters but the force headquarters is based on a ship and rotated every six months, so the C2 challenges are substantial.\u201d \u00a0 But when there is a need to involve civilian organisations in the C2 network the challenge becomes even more complex. \u00a0As EU expeditionary missions are becoming increasingly multi-national, involving growing numbers of small size deployments and linked to civilian missions, the flow of information at the strategic, operational and tactical levels needs to be carefully managed.\u00a0 Need for Operational Security \u201cA general can use a Smart Phone to speak to, and exchange data with, anyone in the world along with a map of anywhere in the world,\u201d said Chris Stace. \u201cBut we face constraints in providing the \u2018military iPhone\u2019: operating in areas where there are no Wifi connections can be addressed but\u00a0 principally it is facing security threats that most developers simply don\u2019t worry about; and balancing the need to share information while securing information, and therefore maintaining operational security.\u201d \u00a0 The EDA\u2019s NEC work culminated in November 2013 with a demonstration in Poland of how information could be exchanged between participating member states during a multi-national expeditionary operation (see \u201cShared situational awareness in Warsaw\u201d).\u00a0 This demonstration has led to the formation of the latest EDA project team which focuses on the information sharing needs within the EU\u2019s command and control arrangements.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0This involves linking C2 information technology (IT) and communications networks between participating Member States and developing new ideas for exchanging information between military and civil agencies during operations and missions. Integration with national networks The first part of the work is to study how the separate the functional area services (FAS) can be better integrated with C2 national networks \u2013 as used in EU HQ-providing \u00a0Member States.\u00a0 The benefit is to improve the access from C2 platforms to key information areas such as administration, personnel recovery, operational planning, countering surface to air fires (C-SAFIRE), and logistics. \u00a0 \u201cWe shall be researching what are the hurdles and what needs to be agreed between Member States \u2013 the technical standards, procedures, training regimes for example - by the end of 2014,\u201d said Chris Stace. \u201cNext year we will develop a business case for follow-on capability demonstrations, providing evidence to decision-makers on a more integrated approach to be followed in the future. \u00a0 \u201cBy the end of 2015 we will also have the outcomes of the information-exchange gateways demonstration project,\u201d said Chris Stace. \u201cThis will look at linking two C2 systems - one national and one EU system. That won\u2019t solve the whole problem; but it is an important technical building block.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cWe are trying to add value by seeing whether best-practice military solutions can be taken on board by the civil side.\u201d This also involves linking to the EU\u2019s Horizon 2020 research programme, \u00a0where there are proposals to research work into civil mission \u201csituation assessment, information exchange and operational control\u201d systems. Command and Control in the Information Age The success of military operations has for centuries depended on sound command and control.\u00a0 This has not changed.\u00a0 But the realities of the information age, the current security environment and the shape and size of the EU\u2019s comprehensive approach to security and defence challenges have all made it more important than ever to develop a more systematic approach to deploying effective command and control networks. Decision-makers at all levels need improved situational awareness and they need to interact with growing numbers of actors, to speed-up processes and to keep ahead of their adversaries.\u00a0 The EDA is working with Member States to put in place such enabling C2 measures.\u00a0 \u00a0 More Information European Defence Matters Issue 5 ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/05/19/building-effective-command-and-control-for-multi-national-missions"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0699", "date": "2014-05-12", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "First European Manual Neutralisation Training Course Begins", "text": " Experts from Austria, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Sweden are taking place in the first European Manual Neutralisation Training (MNT) in Vienna this week.

Peter Round, the EDA\u2019s Capability Director, explains what this means for the Agency. Air-to-air refuelling (AAR), remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS), governmental satellite communications and cyber defence are the key issues which the European Council has identified as areas in which the EDA should work to fill in immediate capability gaps. \u201cAlthough these four tasks certainly occupy pole position in the Directorate\u2019s thinking, they are not our only concerns. We need to examine these priorities in the context of our work as a whole. However, each of these four areas is on the priority list for a reason and they are worth examining in some detail,\u201d said Round. There can be no doubt there is a fundamental shortfall in European AAR capability. In operations over Libya, over 80% of all AAR missions were flown by US aircraft. One of the first challenges to be overcome, according to Round, is that the requirement for AAR is very different in peacetime to that in time of crisis \u2013 and that leads to all sorts of priority setting issues. \u201cThe obvious issue is that more capacity is required, but the background is complex and varies from nation to nation, so some strategic thinking has been necessary,\u201d he said. The first issue, therefore, has been to determine the best method of exploiting the existing fleet and satisfying short term demand. One solution has been to improve the efficiency of allocating various national assets and \u2013 in a move that mirrors some of the initiatives undertaken for the European Air Transport Command (EATC) \u2013 to improve and accelerate the process for gaining diplomatic clearance for AAR missions over foreign territories. A parallel and potentially difficult issue to resolve is the two types of AAR technologies available \u2013 \u201cbooms\u201d and \u201creels/hoses and drogues\u201d. \u00a0Not all aircraft can accept fuel from both systems. The Royal Air Force, for example, currently has no indigenous refuelling capacity for the Rivet Joint signals intelligence platforms it is currently bringing into service and must depend on other nations assets if AAR is required. Increased efficiency also comes from assuring adequate (and regular) training and the EDA is organising a number of what Round describes as \u201cpractical flying events,\u201d the most recent of which took place at Decimomannu in Sardinia in late 2013. The next such event will focus on the use of Italian Boeing B767 tankers later this year. Apart from improving the efficiency of current assets, the EDA is also working on initiatives including one looking at exploiting excess national capacity (with the UK\u2019s Voyager fleet being a prime example. \u00a0A key piece of work is support to a Dutch and Norwegian led initiative to acquire a fleet of Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft which will make a significant contribution to European Capability through Pooling and Sharing, this aircraft will not only be a tanker but a very significant air transport asset as well. The issues in the further evolution of RPAS are no less complex, but are significantly different. With the overwhelming majority of current requirements coming from the military \u2013 most of which, as Round said, have a provenance in the world of Urgent Operational Requirements \u2013 there is a tendency to forget that RPAS are most effective in an environment in which air supremacy is assured. Extending the RPAS capability from the military to the civil environment \u2013 in which the size of the market will be infinitely larger in the not-too-distant future \u2013 requires that attention be paid to a host of issues surrounding safety and public perception. \u201cWe absolutely have got to make RPAS acceptable ,\u201d said Round. The issue is one of the Agency\u2019s Pioneer Projects, and aims at harnessing synergies in both military and civil domains, maximising dual-use technologies and overcoming the limitations of greater RPAS-use imposed by the lack of a harmonised framework allowing them to operate in civil airspace. Some of the problems associated with overcoming these limitations centre on the regulatory and certification domains. In an important milestone, the MIDCAS (Midair Collision Avoidance System) project showed the capability of RPAS to operate safely beyond line of sight in a flight test in April 2013. \u201cMIDCAS showed we are progressing towards \u2018sense and avoid ;\u2019 we have flown the airplane \u2013 it\u2019s not pie in the sky,\u201d said Round. He said \u201cit has taken a long time \u2013 and great expense \u2013 to get to this stage but we have now reached the stepping-off point for the next generation: we\u2019ve done it once, now we need to stop talking, and deliver a usable capability.\u201d he said. The DeSIRE programme (Demonstration of Satellites enabling the insertion of RPAS in Europe) has been a joint EDA/European Space Agency (ESA) initiative since 2010 and in spring 2013 achieved a significant progress during flight tests in Spain. Building on the capabilities the programme demonstrated, a joint investment programme, which was launched in 2012, will focus attention on solving the individual components of the issue \u2013 including sense and avoid, air traffic management interfaces and decision architecture - from this year. \u201cThere is cooperation in a host of disciplines \u2013 technological, training and maintenance among them\u201d , said Round. Most importantly we now have a Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) community of users established through which we will continue work to move from our current Common Staff Requirement towards a Common Staff Target to define the next generation of RPAS for Europe.\u00a0 \u201cThis is a very exciting development and clearly demonstrates the support within Europe for this type of Capability\u201d said Round.\u00a0 A similar approach is being applied to the EDA\u2019s work in the cyber domain, where the Agency provides \u201cthe defence element of a cross-Brussels cyber effort,\u201d said Round. It is a domain that is sensitive, relatively new and not yet fully understood, though there have been no end of discussions trying to scope and size the credibility of the threat and therefore the appropriate nature of the response. \u201cThere is a lot of knowledge already in place, so the questions becomes where can we add value,\u201d said Round. The issue in cyber seems to revolve more around people than technology. Some observers estimate there is a requirement for fully trained cyber specialists is a hundred times the number in existence. This may seem like a scaremongering statistic \u00a0\u2013 but it is difficult to refute given current knowledge available in the public domain. As a result of the recognition of this and the picture revealed by the Agency stocktaking study, an unclassified version of which was presented in May last year, it is readily apparent that while there are strengths across Europe in leadership, personnel and interoperability work has to be done on doctrine, organisation and training. So the EDA has conducted\u00a0 a detailed Training Needs Analysis and currently works on building a comprehensive cyber defence curriculum. It is working closely with the US-led Multinational Capability Development Campaign to develop cyber defence operational planning and deploy situational awareness toolkits at headquarters level, thereby integrating consideration of cyber tasks into daily routines in missions and operations. It is working to promote its recently established Cyber Defence Research Agenda, the end result of which will be an R&T roadmap stretching out for the next ten years. It has already launched a project addressing the requirements for timely detection of advanced persistent threats \u2013 an area in which industrial espionage is as great a threat as military security. It has begun consultations under the umbrella of European Framework Cooperation to determine how to exploit the wealth of academic expertise in cryptology and information protection, turning it into practical solutions for timely implementation. \u201cWe have done a lot of work in quite a short period and are confident we are heading towards early implementation of some effective solutions for Member States\u2019 requirements in this critical domain,\u201d said Round. In terms of satellite communications (satcom) Round said this is \u201cthe ultimate Pooling & Sharing example.\u201d The requirements for governmental satcom are very different in peacetime than in a period of crisis which, coupled with the high levels of capital expenditure involved in launching and maintaining satellites, means the incidence of capability is limited to a few nations \u2013 and even in those cases, despite the fact that satellites are \u2018living longer,\u2019 these capabilities will require replacement in the medium term future. \u201cSpace is not a military domain \u2013 the requirements for exploitation of this type of capability stretch right across government. There is a real opportunity here to share capability,\u201d said Round. The establishment of the European Satellite Communication Procurement Cell has enabled Member States with or without such capability to supplement or procure capability on an ad hoc basis. The French military, for example, bought capability through the European Satellite Communication Procurement Cell (ESCPC) to support their operations in Mali at extremely short notice. Conclusions While these four work strands dominate EDA capability development activity at the moment, they are not the be all and end all of this genre of effort. \u201cOne of the effects of recession is the need to work together \u2013 not the aspiration, the need. The longer Member States are involved in working together, the greater the level of trust that develops and therefore the clearer and swifter the path to success. Which leads to the likelihood of continued cooperation,\u201d said Round. \u201cWe have significant experience of collaborative projects \u2013 and we have real, concrete, demonstrable success stories.\u201d More information European Defence Matters Issue 5 Air-to-Air Refuelling Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems Cyber Defence Governmental Satellite Communication ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/05/15/peter-round-european-council-prioritises-eda-capability-development-initiatives"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0701", "date": "2014-04-14", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Italian Chief of Defence visits EDA", "text": " On April 9 2014, Claude-France Arnould Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency (EDA) met Admiral Luigi Binelli Mantelli the Italian Chief of Defence in Brussels.

The main elements of the Agency\u2019s report were on the four capability programmes, standardisation and certification, dual-use research, and the initial elements for a policy framework for long-term cooperation. Claude-France Arnould Chief Executive of the European Defency Agency commented, \u201cthis Steering Board has come only some four months after the European Council on Defence in December, which set a wide range of tasks for EDA. This meeting was an intermediate step, providing us with the first opportunity to update Defence Ministers collectively on the progress made before the first\u00a0 deliverables are due to be presented in June 2014. It also gave us the opportunity to get their views on the initial proposals for the policy framework for long term cooperation.\u201d The Four Key Capability Programmes The European Council in December gave EDA responsibility for four key capability programmes. Air-to-Air Refuelling (AAR) In AAR the EDA has taken a global approach, focusing on improving the refuelling capabilities in Europe in the short, medium, and long-term. Regarding the optimisation and pooling of existing assets, the first collective AAR clearance trial was successfully completed in Italy in September 2013 with a second one scheduled for September this year. The first multinational European Air-to-Air Refuelling Training (EART) was completed in Eindhoven in April 2014. Regarding longer term capabilities, work has progressed on the pooling of national requirements for new multi-role aircraft. A Request for Information was sent to industry in February on behalf of five participating countries -BE, ES, NL, PL and NO. A decision on the best-value option will be made by the end of 2014. Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) Work continues to support the development of RPAS capabilities in Europe and exploit possible civil-military synergies. EDA is developing the requirements and business cases for a Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) capability.\u00a0During the Steering Board, France confirmed that it would take the lead within this work strand.\u00a0This is being supported by the EDA\u2019s other activities on air traffic insertion, airworthiness, and operational support. Governmental Satellite Communications (GOVSATCOM) The Common Staff Target is being prepared for submission to the Steering Board in autumn 2014, with a view to proposing a comprehensive programme by early 2016.\u00a0During the Steering Board, Spain offered to take the lead on GOVSATCOM. Cyber Defence Activities are continuing in the area of Cyber Defence, including education, training, and technologies. Ad hoc projects are also under way for Cyber Ranges and deployable Cyber Defence kits for headquarters. Research The European Council tasked the EDA to further stimulate dual-use research. At the Steering Board, an initial roadmap with actions to stimulate synergies between civil and military research was presented. EDA is conducting this work in close cooperation with the European Commission in support of Member States. Standardisation and Certification EDA is active in the field of military airworthiness with an initial set of European Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) already published. Building on this experience, EDA is exploring the potential benefits of a harmonised approach to certification in other areas with Member States and the Commission. Work is on track for developing a roadmap for future hybrid and defence standards by mid-2014 in cooperation with the Commission. Long term cooperation The European Council Conclusions asked for a policy framework on long-term cooperation by the end of 2014. The objectives are to provide a coherent basis for defence cooperation in Europe, with appropriate mechanisms to support policy-review. Defence Ministers discussed the initial elements of this framework at the Steering Board.

Between 31 March and 11 April aircraft and crews from Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands will participate in realistic Air-to-Air Refuelling training scenarios within a modern air combat environment.\u00a0 EART14 offers participants a unique opportunity to plan and execute missions within a multinational framework. The exercise has been developed by the European Defence Agency (EDA) in close cooperation with the European Air Transport Command (EATC) and the Dutch armed forces. Critical force enabler As most transport and fighter aircraft are not able to cover intercontinental distances in just one sortie, Air-to-Air Refuelling (AAR) is a critical force enabler and is a requirement for sustained air combat operations. Despite the importance of AAR, European armed forces have suffered from both a lack of equipment and a lack of interoperability in this field. This has led EU countries to rely heavily on US assets in past operations.\u00a0 In 2011, Defence Ministers tasked the EDA to propose measures to mitigate the capability gap in European military AAR-matters. The EDA has since developed and implemented a global approach to tackling the shortfall of AAR capabilities, which involves increasing the overall AAR capacity, reducing fragmentation of the fleet, and optimising the use of assets. This approach was endorsed by the European Council in December 2014, where Heads of State and Government approved the Agency\u2019s roadmap on AAR. Dedicated AAR scenarios Eindhoven Air Base will be used as Tanker Forward Operating Base (FOB) during the exercise period. The exercise will be done in cooperation with the Dutch Frisian Flag 2014 to provide crews with the opportunity to take part in dedicated AAR scenarios embedded in a highly recognised fighter exercise. EART14 will be developed gradually with exercises becoming increasingly complex in nature over the two weeks, starting from single ship missions and evolving to become part of COMAO missions within Frisian Flag. Background The EDA has a comprehensive plan to improve the AAR capabilities in Europe. Mandated by Defence Ministers, EDA is engaged in four work strands in this domain: short-term gap filling; optimisation of existing assets; optimisation of AAR capacity offered by the future A400M fleet and enhancement of Europe\u2019s strategic tanker capability by creating a multinational Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) capability.\u00a0 As part of this global approach, the EDA, Italy and the Movement Coordination Centre Europe (MCCE) jointly organised the first collective European Air-to-Air Refuelling (AAR) clearance trial on the Italian KC767 in September 2013. This enhanced AAR capabilities, as technical and operational clearances are mandatory to provide or receive fuel and they are thus a prerequisite to interoperability in multinational operations. Aircraft from France and Sweden participated in the campaign to obtain technical and operational AAR clearances against the Italian strategic airlift tanker.\u00a0 More information A media day will take place on 3 April 2014, more information is available here\u00a0 EART14 factsheet available here Pictures of EART2014 are available on Flickr\u00a0 First Collective Air-to-Air Refuelling Clearance Trial European Council Conclusions Air-to-Air Refuelling Factsheet EATC\u00a0web page on EART14 ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/03/31/launch-of-first-european-air-to-air-refuelling-exercise-today"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0709", "date": "2014-04-10", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "European Air-to-Air Refuelling Training Delivers First Results", "text": " A Distinguished Visitors (DV) Day is held as part of the first European Air-to-Air Refuelling training (EART14) at Eindhoven Air Base on 10 April 2014.

EART14 runs from 31 March to 11 April, with German and Dutch aircraft and crews present for the entire period and Italy joining for the second week. The training was developed by the European Defence Agency (EDA) in close cooperation with the European Air Transport Command (EATC) and Dutch armed forces.

The training has allowed tanker and logistic crews to enhance their skills in realistic AAR scenarios, helping ensure that crews remain proficient in areas outside of their daily AAR tasks. Crews have built up knowledge of the characteristics of aircraft used by other EU countries, while flying sorties in the morning and afternoon has allowed them to practice their quick turnaround procedures. \u00a0 Multinational cooperation Speaking about the training, Giampaolo Lillo, EDA Director for Cooperation Planning & Support, commented \u201cthis first European Air-to-Air Refuelling training is a prime example of how Europe can optimise the use of its existing assets through multinational cooperation.

Students from 14 EDA Member States and EDA took part in the course. On the details of the course and the course delivery one student says: \u201cThis was a mind blowing exercise. All the challenges and technical details were covered to a very deep extent.\u201d The course provided the students with the foundational competencies and skills to enable them to pass the exam for the widely recognised certification as GIAC (Global Information Assurance Certification) Certified Forensic Examiner (GCFE) in the weeks to come. The course instructor, Mr. Chad Tilbury from SANS Institute says: \u00a0\u201cAs a former military and long-time cyber-defence practitioner, teaching a digital forensics class for the European Defence Agency was an honour.\u00a0 Students from EU member countries conducted in-depth analysis and media exploitation of multiple systems.\u00a0 Attendees conducted data triage and learned to extract forensic meaning from computer memory, files system and operating system artifacts, the Windows registry, email, removable devices, chat clients, web browsers, and event logs.\u00a0 During the final day, students divided into teams and competed in a realistic forensic challenge requiring thousands of artifacts to be recovered, authenticated, and analysed.\u00a0 From the results presented at the end of the forensic challenge, I am confident that this team can take their new skills home and immediately put them to use in real world operations.\u201d This course is the starting point for a new EDA initiative to pool the demand of EDA Member States for such specialist training that should lead to certifications. Pooling the demand will allow Member States to benefit from economies of scale\u201d.\u00a0 The EDA Progamme Manager Cyber Defence, Mr. Wolfgang Roehrig\u00a0 says: \u201cIn a lot of areas of cyber defence specialist training the military will continue to rely on private sector training capacities and expertise. \u00a0Therefore EDA is looking for ways for streamlining military training requirements in these fields. The starting point for further exploration was this on-site pilot course at EDA premises for data collection in an area of Cyber Defence expertise, in which the military most probably will continue to rely on industry-expertise, such as Digital Forensics. Digital Forensics training is a highly specialised field, in which, even putting the requirements of all EDA Member States together, relative small numbers of military students per year can be expected. Trainers in that field require special hands-on expertise that has to follow latest trends in attack techniques and technology - mere theoretical knowledge would not bring much benefit. Building-up and maintaining such trainer expertise within the military even at a European level is expected to be difficult and would be very expensive.\u201d The initiative will be launched within the EDA framework after the final course evaluation.

Graham Muir, Head of Strategy and Policy at the EDA, reflected on some of the successes in the Agency\u2019s ten year history, such as AAR, helicopter crew training and maritime surveillance, reminding the audience also of the achievements made in support for industry \u2013 particularly SMEs \u2013 and security of supply.\u00a0 \u201cBut there is scope to do so much more,\u201d he said, introducing the first panel of the afternoon. General Vincenzo Camporini, former Chief of Defence in Italy and now Vice President of the Istituto Affari Internazionali, addressed the question as to how better to use EDA from the perspective of a marketplace that is crowded with initiatives and said that the EDA has the luxury, perhaps, of choosing the role it can play. He underlined the need to involve EDA from the outset of preparing future projects. Professor Sven Biscop from the Belgian Royal Institute for International Relations drew the analogy of European defence as an apartment building, in which the Member States could each afford their own apartment, but the question then became \u2013 who should be the architect? Proposing EDA\u2019s role be considered as the architect in this case, he went on to say that \u201cafter completion and when we all move in \u2013 then the EDA becomes the building manager.\u201d Professor Anand Menon from King\u2019s College Department of War Studies in the UK felt that the answer to the question how to generate additional success \u201cis to engage the Member States, not Europe. We have not yet arrived at a Single European Market moment in defence.\u201d Before we get to that point, he felt, we would have to achieve three things. Member States first needed to see defence as an element of socio-economic policy rather than the preservation of wider interests. Secondly, national defence is not enough and that no nation can \u2018go on its own.\u2019 Finally there is a need to persuade everybody involved that the EU is the best available institution for [the management of] collective defence. With the EDA to play a central role. Graham Muir concluded that EDA was not a procurement agency but had the flexibility to bring together Member States with similar requirements in an \u00e0 la carte approach. He recalled that there was provision in the Treaties for the European Commission to participate in and financially contribute to EDA activities.\u00a0 More information News \"European Defence Matters: Speech by Dimitris Avramopoulos\" (28 Mar 2014) News \"European Defence Matters: Keynote Speech by Catherine Ashton\"\u00a0(27 Mar 2014) News \"European Defence Matters: Speech by Pieter de Crem\"\u00a0(27 Mar 2014) News \"European Defence Matters: Securing the Future Through Research and Innovation\"\u00a0(27 Mar 2014) News \"European Defence Matters: How to Move Defence Cooperation Further and Faster\"\u00a0(27 Mar 2014) News\u00a0\"European Defence Matters: Turning Political will into Practical Implementation\" (27 Mar 2014) News \"Debating European Cooperation on Defence Capabilities\"\u00a0(27 Mar 2014) News \"EDA Annual Conference Update: Roundtables on Capabilities & Defence Industry\"\u00a0(11 Mar 2014) News \"EDA Annual Conference: European Defence Matters\" (3 Feb 2014) Pictures of the Annual Conference are available on Flickr EDA Annual Conference webpage ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/03/28/european-defence-matters-free-debate-on-role-of-eda"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0714", "date": "2014-03-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "European Defence Matters: Speech by Pieter de Crem", "text": " Pieter de Crem - Belgian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence - outlined his commitment to a more systematic and long term approach to European Defence cooperation, in his speech at the EDA Annual Conference today.

He said, \"we do not need special incentives, we just need programmes\u2026 Research and development is only worthwhile if we have the ambition to build the next generation of products. If we don\u2019t have that ambition then it makes no sense to spend the money.\" Michael Gahler, Member of the European Parliament and its Committee on Foreign Affairs & Subcommittee on Security and Defence agreed about the need to have a clear idea of what Europe wanted to achieve. He went further and called for a European defence review, to assess the situation at the moment, and to reverse the trend of industry and expertise leaving Europe.\u00a0 He also argued strongly that that the artificial divide between civil and military research needs to be scrapped. He said \"We must make use of any funds that are available.\" This was reiterated by Claudia G\u00e4rtner, CEO, Microfluidic ChipShop. She pointed out that for most new innovations, whether they had military or civil applications, the technology underpinning it was the same. Jenny Body, President of the Royal Aeronautical Society was particularly concerned by the long term effects that current budget cuts for research and development would have. \"We have to ensure that we do not lose the expertise. Remember the engineers who will build the next generation of civilian aircraft are probably only aged 3-4 today,\" she said. \"We already face a shortfall of engineers now, if you don\u2019t invest in research you will lose not only the technologies but the people capable of developing them in the future.\" More information News \"European Defence Matters: Free Debate on Role of EDA\" (28 Mar 2014) News \"European Defence Matters: Speech by Dimitris Avramopoulos\" (28 Mar 2014) News \"European Defence Matters: Keynote Speech by Catherine Ashton\"\u00a0(27 Mar 2014) News \"European Defence Matters: Speech by Pieter de Crem\"\u00a0(27 Mar 2014) News \"European Defence Matters: How to Move Defence Cooperation Further and Faster\"\u00a0(27 Mar 2014) News\u00a0\"European Defence Matters: Turning Political will into Practical Implementation\" (27 Mar 2014) News \"Debating European Cooperation on Defence Capabilities\"\u00a0(27 Mar 2014) News \"EDA Annual Conference Update: Roundtables on Capabilities & Defence Industry\"\u00a0(11 Mar 2014) News \"EDA Annual Conference: European Defence Matters\" (3 Feb 2014) Pictures of the Annual Conference are available on Flickr EDA Annual Conference webpage ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/03/27/european-defence-matters-securing-the-future-through-research-and-innovation"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0716", "date": "2014-03-24", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Pilot Exercise for Strategic Decision Making in Cyber Defence", "text": " A pilot Decision-Making Exercise on Cyberspace Crisis Management will take place in Lisbon in May 2014.\u00a0 The pilot exercise aims to prepare strategic leaders for situations involving\u00a0 a major cyber-attack.

He went on to talk about the danger of a growing arc of instability on Europe\u2019s borders, stretching from North Africa through to Ukraine, and the need for enhanced cooperation to tackle common threats to Europe\u2019s stability. He concluded calling for an enhanced role for the EDA to put defence more permanently on the European agenda.

The Nordic defence cooperation (NORDEFCO) system works, she said, because cooperation is based on practicalities and a shared strategic view. \"NORDEFCO does not have a telephone number.\" \"My fear is that we risk an uncoordinated approach between countries,\" she said, \"and the foundation to successful cooperation is trust. The difference in planning cycles for countries can be a major obstacle.\" She added that it takes between 15 and 20 years to plan, specify and take delivery of a submarine, one of the most costly of all military capabilities. The best way to move the process forward is to identify best cases and focus on capability shortfalls. There are a number of drivers behind the process, according to General Patrick de Rousiers, Chairman of the EU Military Committee. The ability to create a capability collectively which would not be possible singly is a primary driver \u2013 so a single ship may conduct anti-piracy operations under a national flag but training and maintenance back at base is conducted collectively. Improving efficiency was the driver behind the formation of the European Air Transport Command (EATC)where 150 tactical and strategic air lift aircraft from five nations now work together. And then there are the political and industrial motivations not just to produce a single platform but to ensure it to support it for 20 or 30 years. \"Pooling is the way of the future,\" said General Sverker G\u00f6ranson, Chief of Defence, Sweden. \"I\u2019m not convinced nations will necessarily lose capabilities otherwise but they could be degraded.\" Experience has shown that a good way to start is with just two nations and then grow from that. Tim Rowntree, Director of OCCAR, spoke of the need to build confidence now that the process can and will work. \"We need to learn to look objectively at what we have achieved,\" he said. Nations risk losing sovereign capabilities if their requirements remain diverse. \"We do need to plan further ahead, to align requirements between nations\u2026 Platforms such as the A400M have shown that our industry can rise to the occasion and deliver world beating solutions.\" Numbers can be a powerful persuader \u2013 if you can show how much can be saved through cooperation then this can be presented to policy makers and they then can be challenged to say \"no\", he said. And cooperation is not just an issue of long term, large scale capability developments \u2013 around 90% of urgent operational requirements have been delivered through international cooperation because many of these could not be delivered through national budgets. But the changed mind-set required has not yet fully happened, said Alexander Vershbow, NATO Deputy Secretary General. Nations still show a reluctance to lose jobs or compromise on requirements. But there are positive changes, such as the emergence of the framework nation concept, where some full spectrum capability nations team with smaller nations to agree areas of specialisation and prove full capabilities between them, \"so both can get more bang for the buck,\" he said. NATO has developed a successful strategic airlift command where C-17s are operated on a time share basis.\" To move defence cooperation further you will have to create incentives.

The main objective of the conference was to discuss the development of defence standards. The conference added a substantial contribution to the preparation of a roadmap for the development of defence standards as tasked by the European Council in December 2013. Speakers from EDA, the European Commission, all three European Standardisation Organisations including the chairman of the Stakeholder Forum for Defence Procurement Standardisation (SFDPS), NATO, ASD-STAN, EUROCAE and UK DSTAN with BSI contributed with their high level of expertise on the subject. It was underlined that the Member States will assess the need for standard development through the EDA Materiel Standardisation Group (MSG) at an early stage after the identification of potential materiel standardisation gaps. Furthermore the MSG will play an important role to coordinate security and defence standardisation activities with the European Commission to avoid any duplication of standardisation efforts. There was also consensus that the European Standardisation Organisations will play a coordinating role in harmonising the standardisation landscape. EDA will prepare through the MSG and together with the stakeholders of the SFDPS a more detailed roadmap for the development of defence standards based on the outcomes of this conference.

This cooperation is the result of the successful DeSIRE I project carried out in 2012 and 2013, through which EDA and ESA demonstrated the use of satellites enabling the insertion of RPAS in Europe. This project effectively demonstrated that RPAS complemented by satellites can be safely inserted in non-segregated airspace and thus fulfil user needs in maritime surveillance services. Following respective approval processes, EDA\u2019s Chief Executive Claude-France Arnould and Magali Vaissiere, ESA Director of Telecommunications and Integrated Applications, have today concluded the signature of the next step of this cooperation. DeSIRE II will demonstrate that services, such as environment and maritime surveillance applications, can be rendered with RPAS flying beyond radio line of sight through the use of safe and secure satellite-based command and control data links.\u00a0 This demonstration project will also seek to illustrate the benefits of the integration of space assets, such as communication satellites, navigation satellites and Earth observation satellites, with terrestrial infrastructure for enabling new services. It will further tackle the implementation of an initial set of elements for air traffic management and related safety issues in order to support the evolution of air traffic insertion regulations and standards.

This year, the European Defence Agency is organising in close cooperation with the respective host nations, contributing Member States and Air Transport Organisations four training exercises in the areas of Air-to-Air Refuelling, transport aircraft and helicopters. First European Air Refuelling Training While the fighter community has trained to operate together for years, the same cannot be said for Air-to-Air Refuelling. From 31 March to 11 April 2014, EDA together with the European Air Transport Command and the Netherlands are organising the first multinational Air-to-Air Refuelling (AAR) training opportunity in support of the Dutch Frisian Flag exercise. To this date, the Netherlands (KDC-10), Germany (A310) and Italy (KC-767) have confirmed to send their tankers to the flying event which will be an excellent opportunity to train dedicated AAR scenarios embedded in a highly recognised fighter exercise. The Air-to-Air Refuelling \u00a0planning cell will be split between Eindhoven and Leeuwarden air base to foster overall air refuelling planning and tanker operations. Third European Air Transport Training Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Norway will participate in the third edition of EDA\u2019s European Air Transport Training flying event with ten transport aircraft of four different types; Greece will\u00a0 support the training with fighters and AWACS. Taking place from 16 to 27 June 2014 at the International Airport in Plovdiv in Bulgaria, the training offers participants a unique opportunity to plan and execute missions within a multinational framework and achieve flexible training objectives. The crews will be trained in a variety of airlift disciplines. The aim is to increase interoperability, to consolidate existing qualifications or to regain them in a short period of time and with dedicated assets. \u00a0 European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course The new European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course (EAATTC) aims at achieving a higher level of interoperability between airlift crews from different nations; at increasing harmonisation of advanced tactical training that will lead to higher effectiveness and survivability in operations; at sharing knowledge and providing cost efficient airlift training in Europe. Based on an agreed syllabus Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Norway will participate in the first course with eight aircraft of five different types. The flying event will be hosted by Spain at Zaragoza airbase from 22 September to 03 October 2014. This permanent training event is developed in close cooperation with the European Air Transport Command and EDA Member States; it is similar in set-up to the advanced airlift tactics training course that has been offered in the US since 1987. \u00a0 Hot Blade 2014 Between 16 and 30 July, the Ovar Air Base in northern Portugal will host the third sequel of the successful series of Hot Blade exercises, powered by the Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP). Currently, some 30 helicopters, four fast jets, three transport aircraft and one Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance platform have been committed by Austria, Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden and United Kingdom. Additional to Portuguese ground forces, 450 ground troops from the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom are scheduled to participate as well allowing for a more integrated mission planning and execution. So far, roughly 50% of participant to one of the previous helicopter exercises organised in France, Spain, Italy, Portugal and Belgium have later been deployed to operations.\u00a0 More information: EDA Helicopter Initiatives \u2013 project page Pictures of Hot Blade 2013 are available here\u00a0 Read more about the European Air Transport Fleet\u00a0 View the EATT13 Factsheet Pictures from EATT13 are published on\u00a0Flickr.\u00a0 Videos from previous exercises are available on YouTube.

The taskings by Heads of State and Government stemming from the EU Summit for the European Defence Agency are substantive. In terms of capability development, we will push forward four key programmes: Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), Air-to-Air Refuelling, Satellite Communications and Cyber. The Council supports a more systematic and long-term approach to cooperation through increased transparency and information-sharing in defence planning. In this context, we will continue to assess progress on the implementation of the Agency\u2019s Code of Conduct on Pooling & Sharing and propose an appropriate policy framework by the end of 2014, as mandated by the European Council. Within the same timeframe the Agency will also propose ways in which Member States can cooperate more effectively and efficiently in pooled procurement projects. As regards the strengthening of Europe\u2019s defence industry, EDA will closely work together with the European Commission to develop proposals to stimulate further dual use research, to develop defence industrial standards and a roadmap for a comprehensive EU-wide Security of Supply regime. This year was marked by intensive preparations for this EU Summit, which gave a fresh boost to European defence matters.

Their implementation in the areas of capability development, support to industry and enhanced defence cooperation will be the Agency\u2019s top priority for 2014.\u00a0 Capability development The endorsement of four proposed capability programmes on Air-to-Air Refuelling, Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), Governmental Satellite Communications and Cyber Defence is an important boost for European defence cooperation. The programmes will contribute to filling critical capability gaps identified during recent operations; and they should deliver \u2013 through cooperation \u2013 high-tech capabilities that no Member State can afford on its own. The associated roadmaps provide clear instructions on time schedules for each of the programmes.\u00a0\u00a0 Support to industry Heads of State and Government made clear that a strong European defence needs to be underpinned by a healthy defence industry. What industry needs above all is concrete programmes and the timely implementation of the four capability programmes will be of direct benefit for them.\u00a0 EDA will increase its cooperation with the European Commission in order to maximise access for Member States to existing EU instruments particularly in the field of dual-use research. The Council acknowledged the importance of SMEs for the defence supply chain, as a source of innovation and a key enabler for competitiveness; by implementing its Action Plan on SMEs, EDA actively supports defence SMEs in their interactions with the European Commission and its existing instruments, improves information sharing about business opportunities, and enhances defence SME market conditions.\u00a0 EDA\u2019s enhanced Framework Arrangement on Security of Supply is an important tool for the development of long-term planning and cooperation, and for the functioning of the internal market for defence. EDA will use the experience gained in supporting Member States and industry in improving cross-border cooperation, associated measures and tools to assist the European Commission in developing a roadmap for a comprehensive EU-wide Security of Supply regime.\u00a0 \u00a0 Standardisation and certification The European Council has also asked for standards and certification procedures for defence equipment to reduce costs, harmonise demand and enhance interoperability. EDA and the Commission are tasked to prepare a roadmap for the development of defence industrial standards by mid-2014. A first conference to help preparing this roadmap is organised by the Agency in mid-March. Building on the work of EDA\u2019s Military Airworthiness Forum which has already produced a series of harmonised military airworthiness requirements, the Agency \u2013 together with the Commission and Member States \u2013 will develop options for lowering the costs of military certification, including by increasing mutual recognition between EU Member States.\u00a0 \u00a0 Long-term cooperation The European Council made a clear case for increased defence cooperation and welcomed the progress achieved by the Agency\u2019s Code of Conduct on Pooling & Sharing. Heads of State and Government asked for a policy framework to foster more systematic and long term cooperation by the end of 2014. At the same time, the positive example of the European Air Transport Command was highlighted and the Agency will study in which areas this model could be replicated. Finally, financial incentives for cooperation such as non-market distorting fiscal measures as well as ways to more effectively and efficiently cooperate in pooled procurement projects will be further developed.\u00a0 More information Statement by Claude-France Arnould\u00a0following the Council Conclusions on CSDP (20 December 2014) News\u00a0\"The Time is Now\"\u00a0(17 Dec 2013) News \"Background Information EU Council\" (16 Dec 2013) News \"Defence Ministers Commit to Capability Programmes\" (19 Nov 2013) Factsheet on\u00a0Air-to-Air Refuelling Factsheet on\u00a0Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems Factsheet on\u00a0Governmental Satellite Communciations Factsheet on\u00a0Cyber Defence Factsheet on\u00a0Support to Industry Video European External Action Service\u00a0\"CSDP in Action\"\u00a0 European Council dedicated\u00a0Summit webpage ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2014/01/31/council-conclusions-implementation-way-forward"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0736", "date": "2013-12-17", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "The Time is Now", "text": " In order to be a credible security provider and to protect its interests, the EU requires the full suite of tools: diplomatic, economic, development, and of course military. But as recent operations have demonstrated, Europeans are still faced with critical gaps in military capabilities. There is, moreover, fragmentation of demand and supply. Investment in the technologies that will be needed to field the systems of tomorrow is in decline. And because of the rising costs of major defence systems, coupled with the on-going squeeze on defence budgets, no single Member State is able alone to have the full inventory of capabilities. The choice is simple: cooperate to acquire and maintain capabilities, or risk losing them altogether. The issues are political. What defence needs is a political boost. That\u2019s why the discussion by EU Heads of States and Government at the European Council this December is so important. For it is they, and they alone, who can arbitrate in favour of defence.\u00a0 Cooperation in defence is not new and the European Defence Agency has been created to facilitate it more systematically. We launched many new joint projects in some vital capability areas such as air-to-air refuelling, counter improvised explosive devices, satellite communications or medical field hospitals. None of these could have been realised by one Member State alone; and all of them are absolutely vital for operations.\u00a0 Welcome though these projects are, a more systematic approach to cooperation or Pooling & Sharing is necessary, so that cooperation becomes second-nature; so that we avoid the mistakes of the past when, for example, over twenty variants of the same helicopter were produced; so that we extend cooperation beyond the acquisition phase into the whole life of the system; so that we improve interoperability; so that we get as much effect from our hard-pressed Euros.\u00a0 Three outcomes from the European Council in December would be really significant. First, a commitment to major projects: air-to-air refuelling, Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS, or drones), satellite communications, and cyber defence. Not only are these capabilities a military necessity, our American partners have clearly expressed that they will not \u00a0go on providing most of the key enabling capabilities. Europeans must be able to act by themselves.\u00a0 Second, investment in innovation and technology, including dual-use. Europe needs to stay independent when it comes to critical technologies. Europeans have already missed the first generation of RPAS. EDA has made concrete proposals for the next generation of European medium altitude, long endurance RPAS. We have also made suggestions on governmental satellite communications and cyber defence. All have significant civil and military applications. It is important to harness synergies, maximise dual-use technologies, generate economies of scale and extend the comprehensive approach into the area of capabilities development.\u00a0 And third, support to industry, in particular Small and Medium Enterprises, so many of which are at the cutting edge of technological innovation. Defence is vital. But it is not just about the immediate ability to project force based on a healthy defence and security industry which is an essential component of the industrial fabric of Europe that generates growth, innovation and jobs. It is probably unrealistic to expect defence budgets to increase in the near future. But we need EU Heads of State and Government to take defence to the next level. We have to move away from expensive fragmentation to cost-effective cooperation.\u00a0 Claude-France Arnould, Chief Executive, European Defence Agency More information:\u00a0 News \"Background Information EU Council\" (16 December 2013) News \"Defence Ministers Commit to Capability Programmes\" (19 Nov 2013) Factsheet on\u00a0Air-to-Air Refuelling Factsheet on\u00a0Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems Factsheet on\u00a0Governmental Satellite Communciations Factsheet on\u00a0Cyber Defence Factsheet on\u00a0Support to Industry Video European External Action Service\u00a0\"CSDP in Action\"\u00a0 European Council dedicated\u00a0Summit webpage ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/12/17/the-time-is-now"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0737", "date": "2013-12-18", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA Assists Dual-Use Projects to Access Funding", "text": " The European Defence Agency (EDA) together with the European Commission (EC) support industries and institutes active in dual-use research to access European Structural Funds (ESF), with special focus on SMEs. Recently, seven projects have been selected according to technical eligibility criteria and R&T priorities and assisted in the application process. EDA and EC coordinate their research efforts in the areas of defence and security. Moreover, exploiting existing EU supporting tools and funds for dual-use research projects is a means to promote innovation in the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) while retaining key technological and industrial capabilities in Europe. \u00a0EDA\u2019s work on ESF analyses the potential of accessing ESF for dual-use R&T projects and to provide interested stakeholders with a methodology to do so. SMEs are the backbone of the European economy with more than 20 million SMEs in the EU representing 99% of business. European SMEs often develop dual-use goods or services in a wide range of industries: energy, telecom and ICT, automotive, material, chemical, aeronautics and space etc. Innovation in the supply chain depends massively on SMEs, which are a key enabler for future industrial competiveness. EDA consequently developed and currently implements an SME Action Plan with a menu of supporting measures including facilitating access to ESF. \u00a0 \u201cThe main goal of EDA\u2019s Action Plan on SMEs is to ensure that key technical and industrial priorities are developed and maintained in Europe. In a climate of budget constraints, we need to efficiently use existing EU instruments to harness synergies for civil-military research\u201d, said Claude-France Arnould during a press briefing on 12 December. Daniel Calleja Crespo, Director-General of DG Enterprise and Industry at the European Commission added at the same occasion that cross-fertilisation between civil and defence was an increasingly important factor for the future of the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base. The European Commission thus encouraged and promoted civil-military synergies.\u00a0 Awareness, project support & methodoloy The main objectives of EDA\u2019s work on ESF are to raise awareness among Ministries of Defence and defence industry as regards the use of ESF and a series of dedicated workshops in different countries have been organised so far; to identify and support eligible pilot projects in R&T and industrial capabilities for the European Structural Funds; and to develop a methodology to be used by the Ministries of Defence to increase eligibility for future projects. In terms of concrete support to projects, twelve Member States submitted 72 project proposals for screening. While the Agency provided guidance and support to 44 projects, it selected seven pilot projects (from Bulgaria, Poland, Germany, Portugal, France, UK and Spain) which were actively assisted in the development of the application folders. Out of the selected projects, two applications have been successfully submitted by the project holders to the national managing authorities for co-funding, while the rest will be submitted during the current or the next financial framework 2014-2020. Janusz Michalcewicz, CEO of the Polish SME EUROTECH which applied for project funding for developing an airborne collision avoidance system for Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems and Very Light Aircraft in low-altitude airspace based on numerical image processing, confirmed during the press briefing that access to additional funding was essential for innovative dual-use research. He highlighted that the necessary administrative procedures to access ESF pose a heavy burden on SMEs. The support provided by the EDA and the Polish Ministry of Defence was therefore essential for his company to proceed with the research. \u00a0 Next steps ESF has the potential to become an additional source of funding research and innovation dual-use projects in the field of security and defence.\u00a0After an experimental phase in 2013, EDA will promote a more systematic approach in support of Member States, taking advantage of the programming period 2014-2020.

It represented approximately 1.50% of their total GDP and 3.04% of their total government expenditure, both values being the lowest since 2006. In real terms\u00a0(2), total defence expenditure has been decreasing since 2006. During the period from 2006 to 2011, it dropped by \u20ac 21 billion or almost 10% and between 2011 and 2012 it reduced further by almost 3%. \u00a0 \u00a0 Equipment procurement increases, but R&D expenditure reduces Personnel-related expenditure decreased by almost 3% from 2011 to 2012 and reached its lowest level since 2006 (\u20ac 95.7 billion). Nevertheless, it continues to account for over 50% of total defence expenditure. The second biggest component \u2013 operation and maintenance expenditure \u2013 also decreased by almost 3% and accounted for 23.7% (\u20ac 44.8 billion) of total defence expenditure. On the other hand, after a sharp decrease in 2011, defence investment, comprising equipment procurement and R&D expenditure, increased by over 5% in 2012 to reach the same level it was in 2006 (\u20ac 39.0 billion or 20.6% of total expenditure). But the two components of investment moved in different directions: while equipment procurement increased by 17% to \u20ac 34.2 billion (18.0% of total expenditure), close to the highest level achieved in 2010, \u00a0R&D expenditure experienced the sharpest decrease since 2006 (-38%) and amounted to \u20ac 4.8 billion (2.5% of total expenditure), half its 2006 value. As for R&T\u00a0(3), after a slight increase in 2011, it reduced to \u20ac 1.93 billion (1.02% of total expenditure), both being the lowest values since 2006.\u00a0 \u00a0 Collaboration: increases in procurement but decreases in R&T 2012 data shows a significant decrease in collaborative expenditure. This is partially due to the fact that one EDA pMS was not able to provide data on collaboration this year. If aggregated data of the 25 pMS for which collaborative figures are available is compared, between 2011 and 2012 collaborative equipment procurement increased by 10% while European collaboration increased by 16.5% and accounted for 95.5% of total collaborative equipment procurement. As for R&T, expenditure on collaborative projects and programmes decreased by almost 15% during the same period. European collaborative R&T expenditure experienced an even sharpreer decrease of 38% and accounted for 67.6% of total collaborative R&T expenditure. \u00a0 Number of military personnel continues to drop while expenditure and investment per military increases 2012 saw the sixth consecutive reduction in military personnel (77.5% of total staff working in defence, the lowest ratio since 2006) and decreased by 6.3% to 1.45 million. On the other hand, the number of civilian personnel increased for the first time since 2006 by 12.8% to 422 315. Whilst military personnel numbers reduced, defence expenditure per military increased by over 6% reaching \u20ac 130 457. Defence investment per military also increased by over 12% and stood at almost \u20ac 26 821. \u00a0 Reduction in troops deployed and in costs of operations As regards deployed operations outside the EU territory, similarly to the last three years, the average number of troops deployed decreased both in absolute terms (from 53 744 to 49 550) and as a share of military personnel \u00a0(from 3.5% to 3.4%) and is now at its lowest level since 2006. For the first time since 2006, costs related to deployed operations decreased by 8% to \u20ac 10.8 billion or 5.7% of total defence expenditure. Operations costs per military deployed also marginally decreased for the first time and stood at \u20ac 217 000 in 2012.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Progress made on one out of four collective benchmarks In 2007, EDA pMS agreed on a set of four collective benchmarks for investment. There is no obligation in terms of timeline or adoption of these benchmarks into national targets. In 2012, only one of the four indicators made progress towards the benchmarks. Due to an increase in defence equipment procurement expenditure, the proportion of investment (equipment procurement and R&D) of total defence expenditure increased from 19.4% to 20.6% thus exceeding the agreed target of 20%. After an increase in 2011, the share of R&T expenditure in total defence expenditure decreased to its lowest level since 2006: 1.02% (the benchmark is 2%). \u00a0\u00a0 Due to incomplete collaborative data, it is not possible to measure progress towards the two other benchmarks: European collaborative equipment procurement as a percentage of total equipment procurement (the benchmark is 35%) and European collaborative defence R&T as a percentage of total defence R&T (the benchmark is 20%). _______ (1) Data in this publication does not include Croatia which became the 27th EDA Member State on 1 July 2013, and Denmark which is not an EDA Member State.

The Agency will be organised in three operational directorates: Cooperation Planning & Support; Capability, Armaments & Technology; and European Synergies & Innovation. This will facilitate prioritisation of tasks and improve operational output, in particular on key activities such as Air-to-Air Refuelling, Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems, Satellite Communications, Airworthiness, Certification, SESAR, and Energy & Environment. The Defence and security environment is evolving rapidly. Defence cuts are leading to greater cooperation on programmes. In addition, many wider EU policies such as Single European Sky or Radio Spectrum have major implications for the defence community. The overall objective of the restructuring is to ensure that the Agency is properly equipped to: anticipate and react to developments; improve its operational output; facilitate the prioritisation of tasks; and serve the needs, expectations and interests of Member States effectively and efficiently. Cooperation Planning & Support The Cooperation Planning & Support directorate will focus on the early identification of requirements at European level and the through-life aspect of capabilities. It will be responsible for capability planning through the Capability Development Plan and the Cooperative Programme Database; and Pooling & Sharing including the Code of Conduct. It will deal with Defence & Industry analysis to complement the identification and development of capability demands. The directorate will also be responsible for key enablers to support defence cooperation and enhance interoperability: military airworthiness, standardisation and certification, and education and training. In addition, it will support CSDP operations and EU Battlegroups at the request of Member States. Capability, Armaments & Technology The Capability, Armaments & Technology directorate will prepare the programmes of tomorrow by maximising synergies between capabilities, armaments and Research & Technology. The directorate will bring together the Agency\u2019s work in the areas of: Information Superiority (Communication & Information Systems, Surveillance & Reconnaissance, Space, Cyber Defence); Air (Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems, Air-to-Air Refuelling, airlift and aerial systems technologies); Land (Counter-IED, armoured systems, camp protection and land systems technologies); Maritime (Maritime Surveillance, Mine Counter Measures and naval systems technologies); and the Joint domain (mobility, transport, medical and Ammunition). Particular attention will be given to identifying future Critical Defence Technologies needed to support military capabilities. European Synergies & Innovation This directorate will act as an interface between defence ministries and wider EU policies that have implications for defence. Its main tasks will be to promote and support innovation through innovative research in the areas such as: Components, Radio-Frequency & Optical Sensors, Materials and Structures, Energy, and CBRN protection. It will develop synergies and greater complementarity with EU programmes such as Horizon 2020 and European Structural Funds. The directorate will also be the Agency\u2019s focal point on Space Policy, on which it will have a close dialogue with the Commission and the European Space Agency. It will be responsible for Market & Industry policy, including SMEs, Security of Supply, the REACH regulation, market efficiency and global aspects of the defence market. The directorate will also deal with the military dimension of the Single European Sky, with a particular emphasis on the SESAR deployment phase, as well as the Agency\u2019s activities in the areas of Green Energy.

Increased cooperation in the areas of Air-to-Air Refuelling (AAR), Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), Governmental Satellite Communication and Cyber Defence as well as support to industry including SMEs with a focus on research & innovation and military airworthiness certification result from the meeting. They will also constitute a contribution of Defence Ministers to the European Council in December addressing defence and security issues.\u00a0 The objective of the EDA Steering Board on 19 November was to finalise Defence Ministers\u2019 contribution to the European Council in December as regards capabilities and industry. Against the backdrop of constrained defence budgets, the focus is on the preparation of the capabilities of tomorrow through cooperation, supported by a healthy and competitive industry as well as technology. \u201cThe discussion by Heads of State and Government at the forthcoming European Council is of utmost importance for European defence. We need recognition at the highest political level that defence \u2013 considering the diversity of threats and challenges \u2013 is a priority. In view of today\u2019s constrained financial situation, this effort for defence must be fully efficient which implies cooperation and searching for synergies. Clearly, we cannot do \u2018more with less\u2019\u201d, said Claude-France Arnould.\u00a0 EDA developed proposals to further enhance the development of defence capabilities and to support Europe\u2019s defence industry. Defence Ministers today endorsed these proposals and committed to programmes and their associated roadmaps in the areas of AAR, RPAS, Governmental Satellite Communication and Cyber Defence. They also supported measures to support European defence research and innovation and industry, including SMEs.\u00a0 Air-to-Air Refuelling Air-to-air refuelling (AAR) is a critical enabler for air power projection and it is required to enable sustained air combat operations. Recent operations have demonstrated an important European capability gap in this area. EDA has thus developed a global approach with three objectives: increase overall capacity; reduce fragmentation of the fleet; and optimise the use of assets. The Agency together with the Member States is engaged in four work strands to close this important capability gap, of which the most important for the future is the acquisition of a European strategic Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) capability from 2020. This builds on the Letter of Intent signed by nine Member States (BE, EL, ES, FR, HU, LU, PL, PT, NL) and NO at the Steering Board in November 2012. Work is led by NL. Synergies with other such capabilities are key to maximum efficiency; France is offering support from its own planned acquisitions, the UK Voyager is also an important contribution to this capability. Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) RPAS have proven their value in the military sphere in recent operations demonstrating their operational capacities, particularly for surveillance and information gathering. Defence Ministers endorsed a roadmap on RPAS which aims at laying the foundations for a European solution in the 2020-2025 timeframe. The roadmap includes four actions:\u00a0 RPAS Certification. In the context of the Military Airworthiness Forum, the Agency is exploring together with national authorities and the European Aviation Safety Agency how to streamline the certification process for military RPAS on the European level.\u00a0 Signature of a Joint Investment Programme on RPAS for Air Traffic Insertion. The programme will focus on technological priorities such as sense and avoid, taxi, automatic take-off and landing, air traffic management interfaces, safe automated monitoring and decision architecture. These demonstration projects will be complementary to the activities of the European Commission in support of RPAS in order to seek synergies. Eight Member States (AT, BE, CZ, DE, ES, FR, IT, UK) signed the programme during the Steering Board.\u00a0 Future European RPAS MALE Programme. Defence Ministers today endorsed the Common Staff Target for Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) RPAS as the basis for those Member States which intend to participate in any future project to develop a Common Staff Requirement; in this context Ministers tasked EDA to prepare the launch of a Category B project. Establishment of a MALE RPAS community. The objective of this community is to exchange information as well as to identify and facilitate cooperation among Member States which currently operate or plan to operate RPAS. At the Steering Board meeting on 19 November 2013 seven Member States (FR, DE, EL, ES, IT, NL, and PL) signed a Letter of Intent to join the Community. Governmental Satellite Communications Satellite communications have become critical elements for defence, security, humanitarian, emergency response or diplomatic communications. They are a key enabler for civil and military missions/operations in particular in remote and austere environments with little or no infrastructure. Additionally, there is strong potential for a dual-use cooperative approach. The objective of EDA\u2019s proposal for Governmental Satellite Communications (GOVSATCOM) is to prepare the next generation in the 2025 timeframe. In close cooperation with Member States, the European Commission and the European Space Agency, the programme includes (i) establishing a GOVSATCOM Operators User Group of the five Member States (DE, ES, FR, IT, UK) that operate systems; (ii) identifying and producing Common Staff Targets for future mission requirements; (iii) on this basis, undertake a gap analysis and an updated Strategic Research Agenda; (iv) coordinating civil and military requirements; and (v) preparing a Category B project for Member States interested in due course. Cyber Defence On Cyber Defence, EDA was tasked to develop, in close coordination with Member States, EEAS and the European Commission, a comprehensive roadmap for strengthening Cyber Defence Capabilities. Based on the work already commenced by EDA, the main elements of the roadmap are training, improving cyber situational awareness, improving civil/military cooperation, the protection of EU assets during missions and operations and technological aspects. Support to industry Defence industry in Europe, including SMEs, underpins the development of the capabilities of tomorrow. Research and innovation and certification provide strong industrial leverage. In this regard, Ministers agreed to support research and innovation in Europe through prioritisation (list of European critical defence technologies), through exploring new instruments for investing in critical technologies and greater synergies with EU instruments. Special attention is given to supporting SMEs. Airworthiness The development of a full suite of harmonised European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs), together with mutual recognition between participating Member States is a \u2018key enabler\u2019 to reduce defence expenditure. At the same time it contributes to an improved and more competitive European defence aerospace industry. The implementation of the EMARS into national regulations will unlock benefits for both Member States and industry to reduce aircraft support and certification costs (for both future and legacy platforms). It will also enable an open European market for the \u2018Pooling & Sharing\u2019 of aircraft maintenance resources, enhance \u2018test and evaluation\u2019 activities and significantly drive down the duplication of effort between and within Member States. Defence Ministers signed a Political Declaration on Certification and Airworthiness to achieve long-term results. The Agency is also tasked to prepare, in close coordination with Member States, the European framework conditions for certifying RPAS.

In this short interview here below, Mr Lind reflects on the importance of innovation on defence, critical defence technologies and his expectations regarding EDA's upcoming R&T conference in December. EDA's R&T conference will look at the issue of innovation in and for defence. How important is innovation in defence and what is the state of innovation in Europe? Innovation is a key driver for capability building in defence and beyond. We may not normally talk about innovation in defence technology programming, but it aptly describes what we do; generating new knowledge, as well as practising existing knowledge and technology to new purposes and in novel ways. The defence world is very used to program and fund long-term knowledge generation activities against targeted capability goals. In the civilian world, the capability focus is perhaps not always that articulated but that does not mean that our innovation and knowledge generation is not of use for the civilian world, perhaps in particular for security purposes. My own research agency works, for instance, for front-line services (police, fire and rescue services), health and welfare services, etc. To a greater extent we have to be able to benefit from innovation and development in the civilian R&T sphere. The EDA could play an important role in assisting Member States in this respect. EDA developed a first list of critical defence technologies. How does this work relate to national approach in Member States? The list developed by the Agency is a good first step and we need to continue to discuss and agree on a version that we can start working on. Member States together with the Agency need to constantly review such lists in order to make sure that they are up to date and targeted towards the challenges currently at hand. The need to analyse technology dependencies is, for some nations, a relatively new approach to research and technology orientation. There is great potential for exchange of lessons learned and establishing good practices. The Agency could play a vital role here. What can participants expect from the conference? The conference focuses on two vital aspects of the current challenges in research and technology - the dependencies we face and the need to employ innovation for defence purposes, across the board, from both military and civilian research. I hope that the participants will find new thoughts and ideas from the podium that they can bring home and perhaps start employing or at least starting a national discussion. But, perhaps equally important, are the not so tangible benefits that discussions \u00a0with similarly minded people can bring, together with exchange thoughts and experiences in the margins of the conference, over a coffee during the break.

The European Defence Agency promotes European cooperation in innovative technologies. EURidea is your new forum to pitch novel ideas for defence research. Research and innovation have a critical role to play in the creation of the next-generation of technologies that will underpin the capabilities for our armed forces. Europe benefits from a leverage effect when innovation is done with partners across the continent. Industry and academics can reduce risks and gain critical mass for innovation when work is conducted between trusted partners across sectors. It is a win-win situation when the best minds work together to tackle major challenges we are facing, now and in the future. We invite you to propose ideas in critical areas that impact the following three technology areas:\u00a0 1. Materials and Nano technologies The areas of material and particularly nanotechnologies is moving very quickly at the moment. Nano-scale technologies that exploit materials and electronic and optronic components for military but also civil applications (dual use) are of interest to EDA. Especially those technologies which are critical, key enabling or cutting-edge technologies. European supply chain deficiencies, technology dependency risks, standardisation needs or industrial production capabilities can be addressed. We are interested in ideas that are an evolution of the current state of the art but we are also open to ideas that look disruptive (ie not necessarily an evolution of current trends). These may be combinations of new technologies and could be applicable to any domain. 2. Energy Achieving energy efficiency by novel energy supply technologies working alongside conventional and smart grids across all services (land, sea and air) covering all systems levels down to nano level. Focus areas: fossil fuel dependencies, renewable / alternative energy sources, energy / power storage, efficient distribution and conversion, energy management and efficiency components. 3.

Pilvi-Sisko Vierros-Villeneuve, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Finland to the European Union, opened the event by underlining the growing importance of the region due to changing circumstances. In her speech, she highlighted that diminishing ice would lead to more activity in the Artic. New resources and logistic opportunities were of interest; a European Union Maritime Security Strategy, currently in preparation, would be a key opportunity to address the EU\u2019s support to the Arctic area. Claude-France Arnould, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency, recalled the growing importance of the Arctic for European security and economic interests, at the same time requiring\u00a0 close attention to be paid to environmental protection. \u201cThe opening of the Sea Lines of Communication, the North West and North East passages for example, have required the naval community to focus more on navigational safety, the need for maritime surveillance and maritime security in the Arctic region. One of EDA\u2019s key tasks is to anticipate capability requirements and cooperation opportunities on this basis in the Arctic area, where a truly comprehensive approach will be required.\u201d Vice Admirals Fernando Del Pozo, Anthony Dymock, Lutz Feldt, Patrick Herbrard and Ferdinando Sanfelice di Monteforte of Wise Pen International presented their study on naval challenges in the Arctic region which concentrated on current strategies and practices; resources, challenges and capability needs; the EU and the Arctic, and gave some conclusions and recommendations. They argued that potential risks to maritime security could only be addressed collectively and internationally; they see the EU as being well placed in playing a key role. However, the group members also highlighted that raising the scientific knowledge baseline and generating a shared vision of how to harness the riches while preserving the environment was a prerequisite. Experts on the Arctic from Finland, Dr Juha-Matti Flinkman, and Sweden, Niklas Granholm, highlighted the need to develop cooperation in the Arctic area in a close cooperation between governmental authorities and scientific research, acknowledging the specific requirements of the delicate and evolving Arctic environment.\u00a0 \u00a0 More information: Finlands Permanent Representation to the European Union MARSUR Networking project page ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/09/26/naval-challenges-in-the-arctic"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0759", "date": "2013-10-15", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Head of Agency Publishes Report on CSDP", "text": " Catherine Ashton, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Head of the European Defence Agency, published her final report in preparation of the European Council in December where Heads of State and Government will discuss security and defence topics. The report follows the three clusters defined by President van Rompuy in December last year to guide the Council discussion: strengthening CSDP, enhancing defence capabilities, strengthening Europe\u2019s defence industry. Mainly the second and third cluster include suggestions and proposals in EDA\u2019s area of responsibility of which key points are highlighted here below. \u00a0 Systematic and long-term European defence cooperation Cooperation in the area of military capability is essential. The report asks for a strong impulse at European Council level, both to embed Pooling & Sharing in Member States\u2019 defence planning and decision-making processes, and to deliver key capabilities through major projects. Key elements are more transparency between Member States, sharing of future plans for key capabilities and of lessons learned, rationalisation of demand as well as a push for harmonised requirements. Through the Code of Conduct on Pooling & Sharing EDA is ready to act as a framework of coordination and transparency to enhance and facilitate synergies and identify best practises. Systematic and long-term defence cooperation with agreed priorities and milestones could be supported by a strategic level Defence Roadmap. This roadmap could also lead the way to closer synergies with OCCAR, the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation. The report makes a case for incentives for defence cooperation which could include innovative financing arrangements as well as protecting cooperative projects and initiatives from budget cuts. \u00a0 \u00a0 Commitment to major projects Taking into account severe gaps in some capability areas, the report points out the need for Member States to commit to major projects in air-to-air refuelling, satellite communication, remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) and cyber defence. As regards air-to-air refuelling, EDA is already working on short, mid and long-term solutions to increase tanker/receivers interoperability and maximise the use of existing assets, the establishment of a multinational multirole tankers fleet, foreseen for 2020, is under way. Pioneer Projects have been promoted by EDA to develop capabilities that have both military and civil applications They are designed to harness synergies in the military and civil domains; maximise dual-use technologies; and generate economies of scale. Defence ministers have already endorsed proposals to prepare projects in the areas of remotely piloted aircraft systems and cyber defence. RPAS are very likely to constitute a key capability for the future with applications in the civil and the military domains. EDA is ready to prepare a programme for the next generation of Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) RPAS. Such a programme needs to include regulatory aspects regarding insertion into normal airspace as well as technology development possibly through joint investment programme between the European Commission, EDA, Member States and the industry. In terms of governmental SATCOM, the report mentions the objective of a future dual civil-military capability by 2025 via a user-driven approach based on a detailed roadmap. As regards cyber defence, the objective is to establish a comprehensive European approach. EDA activities, based on the recently adopted cyber strategy, focus on realistic deliverables within its remit and expertise: training, exercises, protection of headquarters, and Cyber Defence Research Agenda (focusing on dual use technologies). \u00a0 Strengthening Europe\u2019s defence industry In the chapter on measures to strengthen Europe\u2019s defence industry a strong, healthy and globally competitive European Defence and Technological Industrial Base is acknowledged as a prerequisite for developing and sustaining defence capabilities and securing the strategic autonomy of Europe. Its importance for the wider economy is mentioned as well. This industrial base has to be safeguarded through substantive and strengthened cooperation at European level, including through major new cooperative programmes. While big industry plays a leading role in the defence sector, the defence supply chain and notably SMEs play a very important part and should be supported. EDA together with its Member States is also working on concrete measures to increase both short- and long-term Security of Supply, whether related to supply chains, European non-dependencies, raw materials, or investments in key industrial and technological capabilities. Some tangible measures EDA is already working on in cooperation with the European Commission and the European Aviation Safety Agency to improve competitiveness and to reduce development and production costs include standardisation, military airworthiness and certification. \u00a0 European commitment to R&T National defence research and development expenditure decreased substantially in the last years with possible negative impact on the long-term competitiveness of the European industry. Strong investment is needed if Europe is to retain its R&T expertise. Building on the list of critical defence technologies elaborated in the EDA framework, the technologies that need to be developed at the European level for defence, space, and the civil sector should be identified on a systematic basis to underpin long-term planning for European R&T. It will also ensure that Europe is addressing the challenge of technology non-dependence on a strategic level. The report therefore suggests that Member States should be encouraged to commit to multi-annual investment in defence R&T through cooperation. Synergies between civil and defence research for dual-use technologies should be exploited. EDA closely works with the European Commission and European Space Agency on dual use research; important areas of cooperation are key enabling technologies, critical space technologies, CBRN, cyber defence and RPAS. \u00a0 More information Statement by EU High Representative Catherine Ashton on her Final Report on the CSDP available here.

This was the 5th conference arranged under the auspices of the Military Airworthiness Authorities (MAWA) Forum and built upon the success of previous EDA Military Airworthiness Conferences and workshops that had been organised in the Czech Republic, Sweden, Poland and Cyprus.\u00a0 This year presentations focused on \"Building upon the foundations of military airworthiness harmonisation in order to realise future benefits\u201d and on exploring the way forward now that the full suite of European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) and other associated documents will be available in the near term.\u00a0 The conference brought together 95 military airworthiness experts from European Member States, governmental organisations, aerospace industry and the European Aviation Safety Agency as well as representatives from Australia, Canada, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Turkey. The wide variety of presentations, interspersed with valuable Q&A sessions and discussions, posed a number of challenging questions for the Military Airworthiness community, as well as providing an exciting insight into the way-forward for European Military Airworthiness. The conference provided key opportunities for networking, ensuring that delegates were able to maximise their time with each other and to follow-up individual \u00a0presentations with more detailed discussions of specific national issues.\u00a0 Conference feedback from all attendees has been very positive, and will provide further impetus to the EDA-chaired MAWA Forum as it prepares for the national consultation of several critical documents over the next few months, including EMAR 66 and the Acceptable Means of Compliance & Guidance Material linked with EMAR 21 and EMAR 147.

The data show that the US spent \u20ac503 billion on defence in 2011 compared to \u20ac193 billion spent in the EU: around 2,5 times more. In 2011, the governments of the 26 EDA pMS spent a total of \u20ac193 billion on defence. The US spent the equivalent of \u20ac503 billion (or $699 billion). Between 2006 and 2008 the aggregated defence expenditure of the 26 EDA pMS has been about half that of the US. During the years 2009-2011 this difference increased. While the EU aggregated defence expenditure decreased from \u20ac201 billion in 2008 to \u20ac193 billion in 2011, US expenditure increased from \u20ac416 billion ($612 billion) to \u20ac503 billion in the same period.\u00a0 Comparing defence spending with other macroeconomic data, in 2011 US defence expenditure represented 4.7% of GDP and 11.2% of overall government expenditure. In the EU these ratios were, respectively, 1.6% and 3.2%. As for defence expenditure in relation to the total population, the US spent \u20ac1 610 ($2 242) per capita in 2011, while the EU spent on average \u20ac387.\u00a0 The EU data represent spending of 26 EDA participating Member States (all EU Member States except Denmark and Croatia which joined the EU on 1 July 2013).

This article was first published in the second issue of the EDA magazine \"European Defence Matters\". Project officers at the EDA need special skill sets if they are to make a real difference to enhancing Member States military capabilities and help close the gaps that can hamper joint operations. Operational experience, a firm grasp of the blockers and enablers to improved capabilities and a determination to succeed, no matter how complex the problems might seem, are often key ingredients. Like all EDA staff members Axel Butensch\u00f6n will be with the Agency only temporarily before returning to a national post in the German armed forces in four, or at most six, years. \u201cIf you come from operational background and a national capability development unit, as I did in the Ministry of Defence in Germany, you see the benefits of national processes but also see their limitations,\u201d he said, \u201cEspecially in operations - we had some situations where we had very good national equipment but we were not able to interact the best way we could with other Member States. \u201cFor example the coordination with units of other nations especially in a high intensity situation was challenging during my slot in 2010 due to different national communication systems and procedures. So that was my motivation to join the EDA - I realised there were definite limits of national capability development and at some stage you need coordination from something like this Agency to really build something together.\u201d Capability Development Plan The Capability Development Plan (CPD) is a key EDA initiative to overcome the challenge of increasing collaboration between EU countries and improving capabilities. Axel moderates and organises with his team the set-up of the CPD between Member States on closing the capability gaps. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the Member States to assess future threats. Then we can integrate our experts from the Agency with those of the Member States. For example, in the future we most probably will see - due to various strategic drivers like global warming, new technologies or shortages of resources - new areas and modalities of conflicts and new threats and challenges. First we look at this from the point of view of a possible adversary - what can he or she do with that? As a second step we assess what we would then need to counter it and ask what should we start to develop now to be fit for purpose in time. The CDP gives an objective orientation and supports our Member States in the assessment of whether future challenges can be met by existing assets or whether a new capability needs to be developed now and, preferably, jointly.\u00a0 The strength of the CDP is that Member States work on this assessment together and agree on a common picture of the future threats as the starting point for cooperative answers to that. The findings of the CDP can highlight the area where Member States should invest, said Axel Butensch\u00f6n. \u201cIn cooperation with them the Agency has to prepare and offer as a follow-on step substantial actions to convince its members to participate to their real benefit. \u00a0As an example of this, recalling my time as a national representative until 2008, let me mention the Helicopter initiative. Although already highlighted as a CDP prioritized area only the concrete EDA proposal of a helicopter pilot training initiative convinced my national stakeholders to participate in a significant manner to prepare aircrew before sending them to real operations such as Afghanistan. \u201c Operational experience Axel Butensch\u00f6n is a German General Staff Officer with expertise in logistics. As well as staff officer training in Germany he joined the Spanish General Staff Course in Madrid for 12 months and had a chance there to learn about the multinational perspective on defence matters. When he returned to Germany he was the national German representative to several EDA activities.\u00a0 He also served three tours of duty in Afghanistan, one of it as a Battalion Commander. \u201cI commanded quite a complex battalion in Afghanistan composed of logistic, communication, reconnaissance and engineer assets, which is useful to the job I am doing now as it gives me a kind of intellectual reality check on all the theoretical things I do on a daily basis,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that in an Agency like the EDA you have more credibility if you can show Member States that besides your technical skills you also know what is going on operationally. Not each operation is the same; Atalanta is a different story from Afghanistan and the Afghanistan as I experienced is a very different story to the Afghanistan of today and tomorrow. \u201cHowever, if you make clear that what the Agency does is to support troops in missions it gives you more credibility if you have had time out there. To understand what the overall aim is. My job is not to produce a huge amount of papers - but to assist Member States to take the right decisions in capability development and by that help to deliver the right equipment, training or concepts in support of our troops in operations\u201d This experience helps him to analyse national capability plans with colleagues from Member States and to look for what is missing. \u201cFor example, you can look at the cyber or nano technology areas, assess how this will change future war fighting, look what Member States have already planned to develop and then assess with experts how to the best way to approach the issue in a cooperative manner . \u201cWe look at the issues from the European side of what is needed and try to match that with what Member States have and what are the shortfalls to be matched by collaborative actions.\u201d The financial crisis across Europe has increased the willingness of national ministries of defence to cooperate and Axel Butensch\u00f6n detects a more positive attitude to the EDA initiative than ever before. \u201cThe CDP has received more importance now than maybe in its initial stage when we came up with the first priorities in 2008. If you look at pooling and sharing in a more structured way and really think not only about cooperation for cooperation\u2019s sake, but really start tackling the important things, then you do start to see the added value. And that\u2019s what Member States are interested in.\u201d \u00a0 More information: Capability Development Plan (CDP) European Defence Matters, issue 2 ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/09/03/passing-on-the-lessons-of-bonn-madrid-kabul-and-brussels"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0763", "date": "2013-09-09", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "National Breakdown of Defence Data 2011", "text": " The European Defence Agency (EDA) has just published the National Breakdown of Defence Data for 2011.

European Union (EU) defence ministers have agreed that cooperation should be systematically considered from the outset to support EU defence departments to develop defence capabilities. A key enabler to this is a new Code of Conduct on Pooling & Sharing. The objective now is for the Code to be implemented by individual defence departments in the most effective manner. At the informal Ministerial meeting under the Belgian presidency in 2010, Sweden and Germany proposed that the Agency should examine Pooling & Sharing intensively, with a view to identifying specific areas in which early progress could be achieved. Many initiatives had already begun but others had yet to get off the ground, so during 2011 the Agency looked at the overall state of play and identified key areas where progress could be made quickly.\u00a0 At the EDA Steering Board meeting in November 2011 EU defence ministers endorsed a list of 11 Pooling & Sharing opportunities. \u201cIt\u2019s very much work in progress. We have made significant achievements but nobody should assume we are anywhere near mission accomplished. I think this is going to be a long haul \u2013 an iterative process,\u201d said Graham Muir, Head of the Policy and Planning Unit at the EDA. Pooling & Sharing It quickly became apparent that if the initiative were to be successful it could not be done only on an ad hoc basis. In April 2012 four nations \u2013 Belgium, Finland, Greece and Luxembourg \u2013 suggested a more structured approach to define a concrete framework in which Pooling & Sharing could be advanced. The Agency decided, in parallel with the specific project work in which it was already engaged, to try to create such a structured approach. \u201cWe were pretty clear about the content \u2013 the challenge was to secure Member States\u2019 buy-in,\u201d said Muir. At the informal Ministerial meeting in Cyprus in September 2012 the EDA tabled a paper outlining its suggestions for the Code, which Ministers approved two months later. \u201cEDA will continue to drive Pooling & Sharing forward as a pragmatic, flexible and cost-effective model, and avoiding bureaucratization. The Code of Conduct will facilitate cooperation, and make Pooling & Sharing sustainable now and in the future\", said Claude France-Arnould, EDA\u2019s Chief Executive after the Cyprus meeting. \u201cWe have continued to add projects to the list but we now have a better framework within which to work. We don\u2019t for a moment claim all these ideas as our own \u2013 a lot of them were inspired by the four-nation paper issued in April last year,\u201d said Muir. A structured approach There are several benefits to adopting a more structured approach, rather than continuing with the former ad hoc process, according to Muir. \u201cThe EDA is not the only actor working on cooperation; there is considerable effort expended in other institutional frameworks, such as NATO, as well as bilateral and regional clusters. There is a plethora of such initiatives but what\u2019s clear is that Member States want coherence between the various initiatives, thereby achieving the twin objectives of avoiding unnecessary duplication and ensuring gaps are filled where possible. \u201c Another objective was to try to embed the Pooling & Sharing in Member States\u2019 defence planning and national decision-making processes. In Sweden, for example, cooperation is the default option. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to collaborate on a particular capability, you have to demonstrate why going it alone is a better option,\u201d said Muir. The Code will now be implemented nationally, on a voluntary basis. \u201cThe signals we have had have been positive.\u00a0 There will also be an assessment process, which is why at the end of the Code we have a section outlining how implementation will be assessed,\u201d said Muir. \u201cThere will be an annual report, the first one of which will be towards the end of this year.\u00a0 I think this will be an important contribution of ours to the deliberations of the European Council on defence issues at the end of 2013,\u201d said Muir. He continued: \u201cWhat we want to be able to provide is a clear broad picture. Where are the gaps? Where are the duplications and redundancies? What obstacles have Member States identified in implementing the Code? What is the pan-European effect of defence cuts? Part of this will be a mapping exercise to determine the effect these cuts have on the retaining and developing capabilities. But this isn\u2019t just about capabilities - it\u2019s also about the impact on research and technology. Although much of our Pooling & Sharing work lies within our Capabilities Directorate there is a lot on-going in other directorates. But we must work in an integrated manner, which means that our overall approach is coherent.\u201d Annual assessment The first annual report will be a critical milestone in the implementation of the Code of Conduct. Will national differences in attitudes towards methods of achieving this implementation make an objective and impartial report more difficult to achieve? \u201cItt is clear there is not a single Member State that is not involved in some form of cooperation with regard to capability development, though to significantly different degrees. We are assuming they have an inventory of these cooperative projects or initiatives and I am therefore pretty sanguine that we will receive meaningful\u00a0 inputs or reports from them\u201d, said Muir. \u201cWhat will also be useful is to use EDA as a platform of information exchange on bilateral or regional initiatives both to share best practice and facilitate synergies. The result should be a clear picture of the capability map across Europe,\u201d said Muir. How does one define \u201ccapability\u201d? Would military air traffic control qualify, for example? \u201cYes I think it probably would,\u201d said Muir. \u201cAnything required to enable operations and deliver the necessary military effect is a capability. Some of these are lethal, but there is a huge range of such capabilities that might be less visible, but without which an operation could not succeed. When issues of sovereignty come to the fore it is sometimes easier to get nations to cooperate on capabilities that are not necessarily front line, such as logistics, medical support or training. Cooperating in support functions not only brings efficiencies and economies; it also proves the concept.\u00a0 And it should demonstrate that shared sovereignty does not mean loss of sovereignty,\u201d Muir said. The annual report, when produced towards the end of 2013, will have to answer questions on how it relates to other EU initiatives, particularly the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). Muir believes that, in line with the code\u2019s \u201cwork in progress\u201d status, the report will address substantive issues at the same time as recognising the need for continual effort. \u201cI would expect to see acknowledgement of the requirement for further work in as yet unidentified areas. This process \u2013 especially the capability mapping process \u2013 is going to help identify gaps and redundancies. This could help Member States to determine capability development on a coherent basis for the future,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a great degree of solidarity and trust between Member States in terms of operating and fighting alongside each other. The real benefit of the Code of Conduct may eventually be to embed that solidarity and trust within the DNA of Member States so that they also pool and share the very capabilities needed to conduct those operations in the future,\u201d he concluded.

Starting on 5 September, aircraft from France (Mirage 2000, Rafale) and Sweden (Gripen) participate in the campaign to obtain technical and operational AAR clearances against the Italian strategic airlift tanker. AAR is a critical European capability gap and one of the eleven Pooling & Sharing priorities of the European Defence Agency (EDA). Mandated by Defence Ministers in March 2012, EDA is engaged in four work strands in this domain: short-term gap filling; optimisation of existing assets; optimisation of AAR capacity offered by the future A400M fleet and enhancement of Europe\u2019s strategic tanker capability by creating a multinational Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) capability. \u201cItaly\u2019s AAR clearance initiative is a cost efficient way to quickly close an important capability gap regarding tanker-receiver certification; given the urgency based on lessons learned from recent operations, we would have welcomed more nations to participate in the clearance campaign\u201d, says Claude-France Arnould, Executive Director of the European Defence Agency. Aerial Refuelling Clearance Technical and operational clearances are mandatory to provide or receive fuel and they are thus a prerequisite to interoperability in multinational operations. Taking place in Italy at Decimomannu airbase from 5 to 12 September, France and Sweden will be able to perform the necessary ground and in-flight tests to obtain missing AAR clearances. Today Europe can deploy 42 tanker aircraft of twelve different types for which more than 40% of required clearances are missing. While for critical requirements and war-time operations clearances limited to a specific operation can be issued on a case by case basis, this campaign allows for a coordinated approach for full and unrestricted clearances. This increases the flexibility of AAR operations and facilitates immediate deployment of assets in future. Benefits EDA\u2019s collective AAR certification campaign is first of its kind; it allows several Member States to obtain the necessary technical and operational clearances in the minimum amount of time for a maximum amount of receivers. Up to now, this process had to be organised on a bilateral level. Organising a collective campaign facilitates the procedure for Member States, increases interoperability and saves time, human resources and costs. Background AAR is a critical enabler for air power projection and it is required to enable anything beyond short range air combat operations. A unique force multiplier, it is a fundamental capability embedded in modern aircraft design, not just in combat aircraft, but across the full spectrum of air platforms \u2013 including in the near future Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems. \u00a0 More information Pictures are available on Flickr.\u00a0 News\u00a0\"Aerial Refuelling Clearance for Italian KC-767\" (8 Feb 2013) News \"Increasing Europe\u2019s Strategic Tanker Capability by 2020\" (28 Nov 2012) Air-to-air refuelling project page \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/09/05/first-collective-air-to-air-refuelling-clearance-trial"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0766", "date": "2013-08-14", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Innovative Unmanned Maritime Systems Research", "text": " The EDA has developed an innovative, flexible way to manage complex, long-term defence research, reports Philip Butterworth-Hayes in the third issue of the Agency\u2019s European Defence Matters magazine. It is one of the biggest challenges facing defence organizations around the world: how can you flexibly manage a vital, strategic military research programme encompassing a host of related but independent technologies \u2013 from initial academic research to developing a systems platform \u2013 over a long period, when economic conditions and threat environments change? When this challenge is spread across a whole continent the institutional and economic issues become even more complex. This has been the challenge that EDA has faced with its \u20ac53.7 million Unmanned Maritime Systems (UMS) programme, which aims to deliver advanced maritime mine counter-measures and related technologies in the second half of this decade (see also European Defence Matters, issue one). Its solution has been to develop a flexible, integrated research programme within the research and technology (R&T) Directorate of the Agency, with 14 different projects and encompassing a total of 11 participating Member States (pMS), each with different areas of interest. In parallel, pMSs have launched Maritime Mine Counter Measures (MMCM) work in the Armaments Directorate which aims at the common development and procurement of MMCM assets in the shorter term. Maritime Mine Counter Measures a Capability Priority From the outset the MMCM work strand has been a \u2018live\u2019 exercise, expanding and developing to meet the needs of the participants. \u201cIt was initiated within the Capability Directorate in 2008, as MMCM was identified as one of the 12 capability priorities. The idea was to bring nations together to develop further a Common Staff Target already developed at an earlier stage and to prepare for the replacement of MMCM capabilities currently in service in EU nations,\u201d said Bart Stoelinga, Senior Officer For Maritime Programmes. \u201cWhen the concept was further developed it became obvious we were looking at a stand-off, unmanned solution. We had a number of discussions in the Agency and among pMSs and from the broad idea of an unmanned, standoff concept a number of projects were identified that would need a technical solution by 2018. The UMS programme was started to work on these different areas.\u201d Ministers approved the UMS programme as an R&T programme in 2009, but it has evolved considerably over the years. New work strands have been added and others were redefined; this year will see the start of a new work strand on the use of fuel cells in unmanned underwater vehicles while other elements of the work are being extended. \u201cIt\u2019s a living programme,\u201d said Jari Hartikainen, Technology Manager R&T Directorate. \"Different smaller projects can be introduced by Member States into the wider programme framework to meet their own national interests. This supports specialisation, so small countries can participate in work which reflects their own expertise and it also means these countries, with relatively small budgets, can acquire a great deal of knowledge in this important area of research.\u201d The aim is to develop technologies, within the R&T programme, which can be carried forward into an Armaments Directorate development project. By closely linking the detailed R&T work with the strategic Capability Development Plan (CDP), which is being constantly updated, the idea is to minimize waste in resources from duplicated research. The CDP gives direction to the work carried out in the programme. The Capability Directorate has carried out a landscaping study on future naval requirements to highlight (future) capability gaps and the R&T Directorate has organised a number of workshops on the strategic research agenda to identify critical areas where work needs to be carried out. Meanwhile, the Industry and Market Directorate has commissioned a study of key industrial capabilities in the naval domain. Reliance on civilian R&T developments is a growing trend and in research areas such as batteries, navies invest only in defence specific R&T as this is a generic technology with relevant work being undertaken elsewhere. \u201cWe also organised a joint workshop with the European Commission in May 2012 to compare what we are both doing and to see how defence and civilian R&T can support each other,\u201d said Jari Hartikainen. \u201cKey technology challenges, such as autonomous operation, underwater communications, sensors and efficient power systems are common to both military and civilian systems.\u201d Identifying Opportunities for Collaboration in Research The work in the UMS programme spans also more general issues, such as systems integration, standardization, safety and regulations. \u201cUnmanned systems are not recognized in international shipping rules,\u201d said Jari Hartikainen, \u201cwhich is a major obstacle against their widespread use.\u201d Standardization is also an absolute prerequisite for more affordable and more interoperable systems. Participants in the UMS programme include defence organizations, industry and research institutes. \u201cStudies which require specific scientific or industrial expertise are sometimes launched by EDA on behalf of the member states\u201d said Bart Stoelinga. \u201cSo it\u2019s not just about technology push. The framework of UMS allows countries to identify opportunities for collaboration in research, which will feed in to their national programmes. Some defence industries may bring technologies that they have developed trying to find solutions to problems in the air and land environment for use in the naval environment. We can capitalise on this.\u201d One of the other major challenges is institutional: trying to find ways to align the budgets of different nations so common funding streams to agreed timelines can be developed, making best use of the collaborative process. Despite the challenges, the flexible, integrated structure of the UMS programme has worked well and EDA is in the first stages of exploring whether a similar structure could be used for research in other areas like mission modular naval ships or unmanned aerial systems. \u00a0 UMS programme facts There are 11 contributing Members funding the UMS programme: Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. Of the \u20ac53.7 million budget, the industrial contribution is \u20ac6.7 million. The key UMS project areas are listed below: Robust acoustic communications for underwater networks Harbour and base protection systems Systems integration Standards and interfaces for more interoperable European unmanned maritime systems Safety and regulations for European unmanned maritime systems Conformal array performance estimation modeling Modular lightweight minesweeping Signature response analysis of multi-influence mines Network enabled cooperation system of autonomous vehicles Increased autonomy of AUVs \u2013 mission planning and obstacle avoidance Buried mines Evaluation of thin line array technologies Submarine coupled 6dof motions, including boundary effects Drifting mines detection More information:\u00a0 Projects search ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/08/14/innovative-unmanned-maritime-systems-research"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0767", "date": "2013-08-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Effective Procurement Can Slash Equipment Costs", "text": " One of the objectives of EDA\u2019s pooling and sharing initiative is to promote the adoption of effective procurement methods, through the development of practical and innovative ways of ensuring greater collaborative activity. Member States could potentially make savings of between 20 to 50 per cent in military equipment and services by adopting shared procurement practices. A number of Member States have asked the agency to suggest a series of best practices in equipment procurement which could deliver substantial savings and, according to EDA\u2019s Senior Officer for Defence Market Reinhard Marak, these are realistic savings. In implementing a \u2018user club\u2019 for Leopard main battle tanks which includes common purchasing of spares, Germany \u2013 as the lead nation \u2013 demonstrated for 21 predefined items where full competition could be applied very rapid savings of \u20ac9 million, or 25 per cent.

The biggest burden on equipment procurement rests with the development phase, so any capacity to short-cut the path to collaborative acquisition using off-the-shelf methods has to be worthy of serious consideration. The agency has no plans to become a procurement agency but rather focuses on its capability to facilitate joint or harmonised acquisition of a wide range of products and services. It has a unique capability in that it can provide a full spectrum of commonality from concept development through to implementation. Furthermore EDA has a good understanding of market issues and has established a number of tools, such as the Collaborative Database (CODABA), the Third Party Logistic Support (TPLS) Platform and the Procurement Experts Network (PEN) that can be used to identify matches of demand. EDA is the only body specifically mentioned within the EU Defence Procurement Directive as having a potential central purchasing role. With an estimated 20 to 30 per cent of European defence procurement cases potentially standing to benefit from harmonisation of requirements and collaborative procurement, this is an initiative whose time has most definitely come. \u201cAnd the really good thing about this is that this is what industry wants too. As a contribution to both consolidation of demand and standardisation, this is an initiative that serves the Member States\u2019 requirements for cost-effective procurement as well as the requirements of industry for greater efficiency,\u201d said Marak. Feedback from the Member States on early implementation of the initiative has been very encouraging. In a data collection exercise on pooling and sharing conducted by the EU Military Committee in late 2011, Member States identified procurement as their preferred option for pooling and sharing in a number of domains, including transport and logistic support \u2013 medical support and evacuation, helicopter availability, camp construction and supply, education and training \u2013 ranging from flight and pilot training through to chemical warfare and logistics support training, vehicles, ammunition, weapons and individual equipment \u2013 from light weapons, mines and explosives to rocket launchers and auxiliary field artillery equipment \u2013 and communications. While not, perhaps, completely exhaustive, such a list is at least comprehensive and gives EDA wide scope to implement further measures to promote effective procurement methods. The challenge now is to translate common demand into common action and, in Marak\u2019s words, \u201cto use existing tools in a better way.\u201d Experience as a former international legal officer for the Austrian Ministry of Defence, prior to coming to EDA in September 2008, provides him with a thorough background against which to measure the viability and effectiveness of such measures in the complex arena of multilateral procurement. \u00a0 This article was first published in issue 1 of EDA\u2019s magazine \u201cEuropean Defence Matters\u201d.

After the signature of the leading document of the HEP Programme Arrangement by the 13 cMS in November 2012, the focus in HB13 DVD was directed to the military operators from the operational and tactical levels in order to promote the need for even more helicopter assets to be participating in the future exercises. The EDA Helicopter PM briefed the visitors from PT, CZ, DE, AT and NL on the status of the EDA helicopter projects and he underlined the important links amongst the HEP, HTC and HTIC as well as the need bring furher players into the projects. The Portuguese delegation was led by the Secretary of State Attached to the Minister of defence, Chief of Defence and Chiefs of Staff of Air Force, Army and Navy. Together with the EDA Deputy Chief Executive and international visitors from the HEP cMS, all guests had an excellent opportunity to watch the capabilities in a live demostration, which was the Composite Air Operation (COMAO) training mission. \u00a0 The graduates from the EHTIC (SE and DE) and UK instructors are present at the exercise this year to have the direct influence on the exercise mission planning and execution. They are part of the brief sequence and get on board of helicopters to assist during the complex missions. They provide the immediate feedback to the mission commanders, package leaders and crews making sure that the mission conduct reflects the standards set in the HEP SOP. This document is reviewed in the course of the exercise by the participating crews to contain the latest lessons from the training missions. The concept of employing the EHTIC instructors into the HEP exercise proves to be the right way ahead and these experts will be involved already in the planning process of the next HEP exercise. So far seven COMAO missions and more than 450 hours have been flown during HB13 in the 'day' and 'night' multinational training scenarios. \u00a0 More information: Visit EDA's\u00a0HB13 webpage.

The recently launched EDA Joint Procurement Initiative on the common purchase of different kinds of ammunition for the Carl Gustav recoilless multi-purpose rifle attracts additional customers. Given the opportunities of pooling demand and the communalities of the ammunition purchased through this common procurement, initiated by the three Baltic Countries, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and Polish national needs, Poland decided to join the Joint Procurement Initiative in early July. On Monday this week, their accession became valid by virtue of an exchange of letters between the Polish Ministry of Defence and the EDA. Additionally, the Czech Republic announced today that they too want to become a contributing Member State to this common project and join the Joint Procurement Initiative. EDA acts as a central purchasing body in this common effort and is tendering a respective five years framework agreement, with a possible renewal of two more years, allowing all contributing Members to purchase ammunition according to their national needs. EDA\u2019s Deputy Chief Executive, Rini Goos, welcomed the expansion of the Common Carl Gustav Procurement by saying: \u201cEDA is a facilitator and multiplier for European defence cooperation.

This week offered some new and challenging missions testing the capabilities of the involved military and allowing European helicopters crews to train and qualify in complex scenarios, similar to real operations theatres, as well as to improve the interoperability among the participating Nations. Formation flight session To fly in formation was on one of the possibilities that the HB13 provided to its participants during this week of exercise. Formation flight means the disciplined flight of two or more aircraft under the command of a flight \u201cLeader\u201d. All the other aircraft involved are called \"wings.\" There are several possible formations and the 751 Squadron, EH-101 Merlin already had the opportunity to flight in formation with the Dutch and the Austrians in this edition of HB13. The Austrian OH-58 KIOWA and the Dutch CH-47D CHINNOOK joined the Portuguese EH-101 Merlin and put into practice the theory gained. The military use this kind of flight for mutual support training and for capabilities sharing. It is a type of flight that increases the capabilities of the aircraft involved: greater security and the possibility of more cargo and personnel transport. Furthermore, the flight formation can significantly increase the overall aerodynamic efficiency. It can also reduce drag, increasing the flight range. This fulfills one of the objectives of HB13: to increase the participating forces interoperability. Aviation aficionados 1st visit \u00a0Tuesday 23 July was the day dedicated to aviation enthusiasts, either professionals or amateurs. There were sixty people who assured their place at Ovar Air Base with a prior registration. The objective was to capture the aircraft best moments and images. These aviation experts had the opportunity to go through several observation points which were set up for this purpose, a privileged access to all air operations. At the end of the day, a closing briefing took place where an overall opinion about the day was collected. The enthusiasts said they had enjoyed each moment and the exercise had surpassed their expectations.

While taking stock of such cooperative items as Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), Ms. Arnould and Mr. Dordain have agreed to pursue their cooperation on such key policy topics relating to space and security as governmental satellite communications, navigation, or Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR). \u00a0 Claude-France Arnould and her delegation visited ESA\u2019s Concurrent Design Facility (CDF), where a comprehensive overview of ESA\u2019s asset was given with specific focus on the now concluded ESA-EDA cooperation on ISR Capability Package Assessment (ICPA). Visiting ESA\u2019s Test Center allowed EDA to learn more about BepiColombo, an ambitious European scientific mission to Mercury, and to exchange views with Didier Faivre, Director for Navigation, on Galileo. Space is a key area of action within EDA\u2019s mandate to develop, for its Member States, key defence capabilities necessary both for decision-making and operations. Following the signing of the 2008 ESA-EDA Administrative Arrangement, cooperation has significantly increased between the two European organizations, spurring increased momentum and civ-mil synergies in this intrinsically dual use area. Space is embedded in several EDA initiatives. \u201cEDA\u2019s Member States are expressing support for exploring future capability packages in governmental satcoms, which I believe would greatly benefit from a civil-military approach with ESA and Member States alike, building on the strong experience of ESA. ESA and EDA will be looking at the best way to synchronize to make sure we reap the most benefits from civ-mil synergies for our respective activities and mandates, for example the Advanced Research in Telecommunications Systems programme\u201d, said Ms. Arnould. \u201cA second workstrand is Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems. In this regard, the successful DeSIRE demonstration of satellites enabling the insertion of RPAS in Europe, an ESA-EDA cooperation demonstrating the ability to use satellite communications to pilot a UAV in general air traffic, which took place on 24 April, is a very solid project\u201d, she added. EDA is now looking into expanding activities in this regard with DeSIRE II, linked to the larger issue of traffic insertion and single European sky, which is being undertaken in collaboration with ESA\u2019s Integrated Applications Programme. A novel cooperative avenue will be Cyber defence. \u201cCyber security needs to incorporate the space segment in capabilities development\u201d, said Ms. Arnould. EDA is committed to pursuing the space policy drive in the context of the European Council of December 2013, where Heads of States and Governments will address defence. The April 2013 Steering Board of EDA already paved the way towards this end, namely in the area of governmental satellite communications, cyberdefence and RPAS.

More than 700 military personnel, 26 helicopters and seven fixed wing aircraft from Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Portugal participate in the exercise, which lasts until 31 July 2013. HB13 is part of the European Defence Agency's Helicopter Training Programme. HB13 allows European helicopter crews to practice operations in a hot, high and dusty environment, simulating the challenge and the dynamic conditions that participating forces encounter if they deploy to current theatres of operation. Besides the focus on flying in challenging environmental conditions, the exercise is developed to train joint interoperability tasks including Air Assault (AA), Special Operations Aviation (SOA), Combat Service Support (CSS), Close Air Support (CAS) including Urban CAS and Emergency CAS, Convoy/helicopter escorts, Reconnaissance and Security (R&S) operations, Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR), Personnel Recovery (PR), Military/Non Military extractions (NEO Ops), Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) and Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC). The exercise is developed on a building block approach design, starting with cross-training activities on small COMAO missions, in order to build a mutual understanding of each participant\u2019s equipment and standard operational procedures. As the exercises progresses the complexity and numbers of assets in each COMAO missions increase. Crews from all nations will use for the first time standing operating procedures. Helicopter Training Programme HB13 builds on EDA\u2019s Helicopter Training Programme which is consisting of the HEP (Helicopter Exercise Programme), HTC (Helicopter Tactics Course), EHTIC (European Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course), OELC (Operational English Language Course), DisSim CCD (Distributed Simulation Capability Concept Demonstrator) and the Basic Helicopter Flying Training (BHFT) projects/programmes. The exercise programme has so far delivered five multinational exercises with 123 helicopters, 227 crews and over 5,000 personnel participating. Over 50% crews that have attended these exercises later subsequently deployed to Afghanistan. In November 2012, defence ministers of thirteen nations signed a ten years programme arrangement for the Helicopter Exercise Programme. This commitment is a concrete indication that training together is an integral part of European capability and interoperability. \u201cHB13 is the 6th EDA helicopter exercise, but it is also the first in many ways. It is the first exercise in a 10-year programme agreed by thirteen countries, it is the first exercise where we are flying to commonly agreed procedures, and most excitingly for me, it is the first exercise where we have been able to introduce instructors \u2013 who themselves are graduates from the first European Helicopter Tactics Instructors Course. These instructors drawn from Germany, Sweden and UK are the \u2018best of the best\u2019 and I am looking forward to seeing them mentor some of the less experienced crews, as they meet the planning and flying challenges of the exercise\u201d, said Wing Commander Andy Gray, in charge of EDA\u2019s Helicopter Training Programme.

Total defence expenditure down by \u20ac 1 bln In 2011, total defence expenditure of EDA 26 pMS amounted to \u20ac 192.5 billion - a reduction of \u20ac 1 billion or 0.5% compared to 2010 \u2013 representing approximately 1.55% of their total GDP and 3.17% of their total government expenditure, both values being the lowest since 2006. In real terms , total defence expenditure has been decreasing since 2006 and between 2010 and 2011 it dropped by over 2%. Defence investment (procurement and R&D) at its lowest level since 2006 Personnel-related expenditure of \u20ac 98.6 billion accounted for 51.1% of total defence spending \u2013 virtually unchanged since 2009. The second biggest component \u2013 operation and maintenance expenditure \u2013 increased by 3.6% and accounted for 23.5% (\u20ac 45.2 bln) of total defence expenditure. However, defence investment, comprising equipment procurement and R&D expenditure, saw a sharp decrease of almost 14% bringing its value down to the lowest level since 2006 (\u20ac 37.0 billion or 19.2% of total expenditure). Both components of investment contributed to the decrease: equipment procurement dropped by 15% (\u20ac 29.2 bln or 15.2% of total expenditure), and R&D expenditure \u2013 by 9% (\u20ac 7.8 bln or 4.0% of total expenditure). As for Research and Technology , expenditure increased by 3.5% up to \u20ac 2.15 billion reversing a downward trend since 2006. Increase in collaborative procurement and R&T In 2011, 27,1% or \u20ac 7.9 bln of total defence equipment procurement expenditure was spent on collaborative projects \u2013 a slight increase compared to 2010. Of this, 92,7% (\u20ac 7.3 bln) were European collaborations. Although the share of European collaborations in total collaborative equipment procurement decreased by 2% from 2010 to 2011, it nevertheless remained higher than in previous years. As for R&T, expenditure on collaborative projects and programmes increased by 25.6% breaking a downward trend since 2009, and in 2011 it stood at \u20ac 331 mln representing 15.4% of total R&T spend. European collaborative R&T expenditure also increased in absolute terms by over 15% reaching \u20ac 283 mln (13.2% of total R&T spend), but as a share of total collaborative R&T expenditure it decreased from 93.1% in 2010 to 85.4% in 2011, its lowest value since 2007. Numbers of military and civilian personnel continue to drop while expenditure per soldier increases In 2011, there was a reduction of both civilian and military personnel for the fifth consecutive year. Military personnel (81% of total staff working in defence) decreased by 4.3% to 1.55 million. Civilian personnel decreased by 3.9% to 374 thousand. Whilst personnel numbers reduced, defence expenditure per soldier increased by almost 4% reaching \u20ac 124 thousand. Defence investment per soldier, however, decreased by almost 10% and stood at \u20ac 24 thousand in 2011. Reduction in troops deployed, but cost of operations increase As regards deployed operations outside the EU territory, similarly to the last two years, the average number of troops deployed decreased in 2011 both in absolute terms (from 66 to 54 thousand) and as a share of military personnel (from 4.1% to 3.5%) and is now at its lowest value since 2006. However, costs related to the deployed operations increased substantially (by 12.4% from 2010 to 2011) for the fifth consecutive year, reaching \u20ac 11.7 million or 6.1% of total defence expenditure. Operations costs per military deployed have also been steadily increasing, and from 2006 to 2011 it nearly tripled reaching \u20ac 218 thousand. Progress made on three out of four collective benchmarks In 2007, EDA pMS agreed on a set of collective benchmarks for investment. There is no obligation in terms of timeline or adoption of these benchmarks into national targets, but they can assist pMS in spending more on investment. In 2011, three out of four indicators made progress towards the agreed benchmarks. R&T expenditure broke a downward trend for the first time since 2006 increasing its share in total defence expenditure slightly from its lowest value in 2010 (1.07%) to 1.12%. It, nevertheless, remains well below the agreed 2% benchmark. At the national level, not a single participating Member States reached the 2% target in 2011. The share of European collaborative R&T expenditure in total defence R&T spend also increased reaching 13.2% but remains below the 20% benchmark. The biggest progress was observed in European collaborative equipment procurement. As a share of total equipment procurement, it increased by 4 percentage points from 21.2% to 25.2%, the highest value since 2006, although still below the 35% benchmark. There was, however, a retrograde step in defence investment (equipment procurement and R&D). Being above the 20% benchmark between 2007 and 2010, in 2011 it dropped to 19.2% of total expenditure on defence, which is lower than the 2006 level. Background The European Defence Agency collects defence data on an annual basis. The Ministries of Defence of the Agency\u2019s participating Member States provide the data. EDA acts as the custodian of the data and publishes the aggregated figures. 1 In order to measure real growth and ensure a \u201creal\u201d comparison between years, inflation needs to be taken into account. Thus, data from 2006 to 2010 has been inflated to 2011 economic conditions (Source of deflator: European Commission ECFIN \u2013 based on weight of EU 27). 2 R&T is a subset of R&D which includes only basic research, applied research and technology demonstration, leaving out expenditure for demonstration or development for which a decision to procure has been taken.

Although the presence of armed forces in Afghanistan will reduce significantly, the threat of the IED still remains.\u00a0 It is the weapon of choice among adversaries and will continue to be that in the future. The difference is that in the future they will combine IEDs with other asymmetric threats to spread chaos and fear among the general public in order reach their goals. The only way to defeat the IED is to defeat the network and the only way to do that is through a comprehensive approach. The RTM 2013 conference embraces that approach as can be seen from the proceedings. It further highlights the need to learn from recent operations in order to be better prepared for the future. It also shows the need for increased civil-military cooperation across borders and between international organisations. Technology has also a role to play but requires proper guidance in order to be able to deliver effective capability enhancing contributions. Within EDA a number of activities have been successfully running since 2008. Key achievements to date include: A novel train-the trainer approach enabling Member States to nationally develop key skills resulting in programmes on Search, Ground Sign Awareness, Combat Tracking and Manual Neutralisation Techniques; The definition, acquisition, design and deployment of an in-theatre forensic exploitation capability manned by a multinational team in record time. Operational since autumn 2011, EDA\u2019s Counter-IED laboratory shows the effectiveness of forensics as an integral part to the ISAF operation; A wide range of efforts and projects addressing new protective systems for vehicles and personnel; a scenario-driven approach to optimising the use of detection techniques and technologies; a \u201cBlack Box\u201d concept for vehicles. \u00a0 Following the March conference the Project Team Counter IED has been developing a solid strategy for the future. It is envisaged that first edition of the new strategy will be ready in the autumn of 2013.

This is not a complex new system. We simply feed available information from a number of open sources into one tool\u201d, said Peter Scaruppe, Director Industry & Market at the European Defence Agency. Aimed at enhancing transparency in the European Defence Equipment Market, the web-based tool offers unique access to a comprehensive set of European defence procurement information and business opportunities. The gateway provides information on defence procurement opportunities published at EU level through Tenders Electronic Daily, the online version of the Supplement to the European Official Journal dedicated to European public procurement, as well as other defence contract opportunities published at national level or by European organisations and agencies such as the EDA. Specifically for governments the gateway contains such functions as the new EDA e-QUIP portal and CODABA. In addition, it brings together in one single place all relevant EU Regulations (e.g. directives and specific guidance notes published by the European Commission), court and infringement cases, EDA Codes of Conduct, EDA Procurement Rules & Regulations, specific EDA portals (i.e. EDSIS, REACh, Security of Supply), national directories (including access to national procurement policy related websites), industry directories (containing also information on defence industry associations at EU and national level) as well as information on relevant training and conferences. The Defence Procurement Gateway will additionally include an industry directory (\u201cYellow Pages\u201d section) serving as a platform for European defence industry to market its knowledge and expertise in the defence domain.

Currently, five European nations operate military satellite communication assets: the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain and Germany. In the timeframe 2018-2025 all these assets will need to be replaced. This creates a unique opportunity for Pooling & Sharing this type of satellites which EDA is promoting with its \u201cSecure Telecom by Satellite\u201d (SECTELSAT) concept for a European-wide use of governmental SATCOM. The intergovernmental approach proposed by EDA suggests a cross-use of future governmental assets on a broader basis and significant synergies if future programmes can be coordinated.\u00a0 \u201cWith its European Satellite Communication Procurement Cell (ESCPC), the European Defence Agency has already delivered a concrete Pooling & Sharing tool in the area of commercial satellite communications. Our proposal for governmental SATCOM goes one step further. Pooling & Sharing of critical assets is an opportunity as much as a necessity in times of tight defence budgets and eroding capabilities\u201d, says Claude-France Arnould, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency, at the opening of the high-level seminar. Secure Telecom by Satellite EDA\u2019s concept includes the pooling of future assets with a coordinated approach to collect and harmonise national requirements of EU Member States that operate MILSATCOM, and possibly to pave the way for future cooperative ad hoc programmes. At the same time, it proposes to share future assets by leasing parts of governmental SATCOM for defence and security services to additional Member States (including Norway and Switzerland) with significant requirements. Future assets would also be shared by offering a new capability package that could benefit from EU funding for its internal and external connectivity needs through more resilient networks. High-Level Seminar The high-level seminar was divided into an open seminar on SATCOM policies and plans with speakers from the EDA, the EU Military Committee, the European Commission, the European Space Agency, EU Member States and industry representatives. During the closed afternoon session capability planners and governmental SATCOM programme managers discussed the way ahead, an action plan as well as possible Pooling & Sharing options. Background \u00a0In military operations satellite communications are fundamental for Communication, Command and Control. They also allow operational effectiveness of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance platforms, including Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems. In 2012 the Agency launched the European Satellite Communications Procurement Cell (ESCPC) to pool and share commercial satellite communications services. Five Member States (France, Italy, Poland, Romania and the United Kingdom) participate in a framework contract the Agency concluded with Astrium Services to use commercial bands. ESCPC can for instance support outsourced logistic services with the provision of a backbone network for any national, EU-led or coalition operation.

The conference aimed to advance the debate on European Union Member States\u2019 preparedness to face cyber threats at national level and across the EU as a whole. The growth of cyber attacks on critical private, government and defence networks requires a coordinated response at the EU level and across Member States. To successfully counter this emerging cyber threat, cooperation between national security, defence, law enforcement and technical incident response organisations within and between Member States needs to be encouraged to identify and exploit synergies. The conference brought together key policy-makers across the EU cyber community to highlight preventative measures, the need for cooperation and crisis response procedures to the mounting cyber security challenge. After keynote speeches delivered by Mr Alan Shatter, Ireland\u2019s Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence and Mr Jaak Aaviksoo, Estonia\u2019s Minister for Education and Research, the first panel concentrated on a strategic view as to how the EU can protect itself against cyber threats. Mr Maciej Popowski (EEAS), Amb Gabor Iklody (NATO), Mme Claude-France Arnould (EDA) and Amb Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Blarel (French Ministry of Foreign Affairs) discussed how to develop increased information sharing, early warning, and crisis response as well as closer cooperation between EU and NATO. While the second panel looked at crisis response systems, the third panel discussed cyber resilience in the EU with a view to public and private cooperation. Looking ahead to the European Council in December including defence topics, the final session of the conference dealt with requirements and capability development in cyber security and cyber defence. Topics discussed were cyber defence requirements for CSDP operations, synergies between civil R&D and military R&T as well as cyber security/defence \u201cDual-Use\u201d capabilities.

Through e-Quip national governments can exchange information on available assets ranging from Defence Systems and equipment, ammunition, or even space systems to services such as logistics and maintenance. With national armed forces across Europe undergoing changes, a surplus of in-service or new military equipment is expected. This trend might increase as European nations gradually withdraw from operations around the globe over the coming years. In the current financial climate European nations need to make best use of military surplus equipment. In March 2012 the European Defence Agency proposed and Defence Ministers supported the set-up of a government to government (G2G) electronic on-line market place to sell or transfer this equipment. Consequently, EDA developed, with the support of Member States\u2019 experts, EDA\u2019s new G2G online defence market tool, called e-QUIP. \u201cE-Quip is a concrete and practical tool to foster cooperation among Member States. By exchanging information on available surplus equipment and services, it will help Member States not only to get best value for money but also to maintain and develop military capabilities in an environment of shrinking defence budgets\u201d, says Giampaolo Lillo, Armaments Director of the European Defence Agency. \u201cWe see the launch of e-Quip both as a follow-up to the Ghent-initiative on enhancing national capabilities with decreasing defence budgets and as another element in the efforts towards a better functioning European defence equipment market, ensuring cost efficiency and value for money for the tax payers. EDA\u2019s work on both dimensions is crucial. I am sure that e-Quip will be a helpful tool for both Pooling & Sharing and for a better functioning market. We welcome and support EDA\u2019s initiative and will certainly make use of e-Quip from a national perspective\u201d, confirms Ulf Hammarstr\u00f6m, Director General of the Swedish Defence and Security Export Agency. Features E-Quip allows contributing Member States to exchange information on available assets. Currently,\u00a0thirteen Member States have access to the platform which is open for all EDA participating Member States as well as states with which the Agency has an administrative agreement. E-Quip is designed as a cost-free, non-commercial market platform that brings together potential buyers and sellers. E-Quip allows Member States to exchange information on land, air and space as well as \u00a0naval equipment but also on cross-cutting issues such as, logistics, maintenance or other services (CBRN, training, etc.). Items under the land systems category for example can cover ammunition, protected vehicles or radar; air and space contains e.g. transport aircraft or space systems; while naval equipment can include for example sub-surface vessels. Development Process It was developed in close cooperation with the Member States to ensure meeting their exact needs. EDA does not form part of any transaction process between sellers and buyers; the Agency puts the tool at the disposal of Member States who then bilaterally finalise the transaction process. E-Quip will not be open to the public for reason of sensitivity of the offered equipment. \u00a0 More information e-Quip factsheet ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/06/14/european-defence-agency-launches-e-quip-the-on-line-defence-market"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0787", "date": "2013-06-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Workshop: Doing Business with European Security and Defence Bodies", "text": " On 12 June 2012, the European Defence Agency together with the Austrian Ministry of Defence and Sports and the Austrian Defence and Security Industry Association was hosting a workshop on Doing Business with European Security and Defence Bodies in Vienna.

The arrangement specifically covers the harmonisation of military aviation safety requirements with a primary focus on airworthiness. \u201cThe EDA-EASA Cooperation Arrangement will improve European civil-military cooperation in aviation safety. EDA and its Member States will profit from EASA\u2019s experience in the field of harmonised airworthiness requirements. EDA on the other hand brings in its experience from the military side\u201d, said Claude-France Arnould during the signature ceremony at the International Paris Airshow \u201cLe Bourget\u201d. Patrick Goudou added, \u201cI am delighted to sign this agreement with EDA. The combined expertise of our two agencies is a great asset that will enable to pave the way for an effective partnership. Our common objective is to promote the highest possible aviation safety standards, in the civil and military domains.\u201d\u00a0 Both agencies expect to achieve considerable benefits from this increased cooperation, especially in areas of \u2018dual use\u2019 aircraft. One such example will be the A400M which had recently been certified by EASA in its civil aircraft configuration. This civil certification can serve as a baseline for the subsequent military certification by the respective national Military Airworthiness Authorities. Some Member States have already agreed to use EDA\u2019s harmonised European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) for the in-service support phase of this aircraft programme.\u00a0 In the field of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) close cooperation and harmonisation of civil and military rules and regulations to enable safe operations in Europe will be essential. EDA projects on air traffic insertion (DeSIRE) and mid-air collision avoidance (MIDCAS) can be preliminary enablers towards joint civil and military certification. Background In European civil aviation, EASA ensures that all civil aircraft operating within Europe are airworthy and safe. The relevant legal framework is detailed in EU regulations. This means that EASA issues aviation safety rules which are implemented the same way in all Member States following the agency\u2019s mission of achieving a \u201chigh uniform level of civil aviation safety in Europe\u201d.\u00a0 On the military side, Member States currently have their national aviation safety systems in place. These systems are independent from each other, as each Member State is responsible for the regulation of its military and state aircraft. The results of an EDA initiated study underlined that the use of harmonised certification procedures for the development phase of multinational military aircraft programmes could generate at least 10% cost savings on industry as well as on the governments\u2019 side, and up to 50% reduction in the programme duration. The EDA Military Airworthiness Authorities (MAWA) Forum was established by Defence Ministers in 2008 with the main objective to harmonise the European military airworthiness regulations of Member States. The MAWA Forum has already developed and approved harmonised European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) on type certification, maintenance and training as well as other supporting documents.\u00a0 On invitation of EASA, EDA experts already participate as observers in EASA rulemaking groups on air traffic management, airworthiness and flight operations (RPAS).

A common approach to the type-certification of military aircraft, together with approvals of airworthiness organisations and personnel, is essential for future Pooling & Sharing activities. During\u00a0the high-level seminar on military airworthiness, organised on 18 June\u00a0by the European Defence Agency (EDA) at the Paris Air Show \u201cLe Bourget\u201d, key European decision-maker\u2019s discussed the enablers and perceived barriers to increased cooperation. European Member States previously operated military aviation safety systems independently from each other, with each Member State being individually responsible for the regulation of their own military and state aircraft. As a result, military airworthiness activities were conducted and regulated on a national basis, with European harmonisation only being achieved at an individual programme level and having to be repeated and developed for each new programme. This generated many challenges for multinational aircraft programmes and has been identified as one of the primary causes of delays and additional costs.\u00a0 The EDA Military Airworthiness Authorities (MAWA) Forum was established by Defence Ministers in 2008 to harmonise the European military airworthiness regulations of Member States through the establishment of European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) for implementation into national military regulations. The MAWA Forum comprises of representatives from the Military Airworthiness Authorities of Member States and industry representatives. It is chaired by the EDA. High-Level Seminar The Agency\u2019s high-level seminar aimed at increasing key European decision-maker\u2019s awareness and visibility of the achievements made to date in the area of military airworthiness and exploring the next steps. The EDA MAWA Forum has for example approved three European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs): EMAR 21 for the initial and continued certification of military aircraft \u2013 including the approval of the design and production organisations, EMAR 145 covering the approval of maintenance organisations and the activities they undertake and EMAR 147 detailing the responsibilities of organisations responsible for the training of maintenance personnel. The EDA MAWA Forum has also approved other supporting documents and is on-track to deliver the complete set of EMARs by the end of 2015.\u00a0 Panellists in the seminar included high level representatives from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), European aerospace industry, Ministries of Defence and National Military Airworthiness Authorities. The event also provided an opportunity to reflect on the progress made towards delivering the \u2018Roadmap Objectives\u2019 given to the EDA MAWA Forum by European Defence Ministers.\u00a0 The discussions addressed the political implications of this activity, areas for closer cooperation with EASA, together with governmental, industrial, and European National Military Airworthiness Authorities\u2019 views on the positive impact that increased harmonisation will have on current and future military airworthiness activities. Basic Framework Document Additionally, several Member States provided their national approval and restating their commitment to the principles of the updated \u201cEuropean Harmonised Military Airworthiness Basic Framework Document\u201d which defines the role and functions of the MAWA Forum. The previous version of the document had been nationally approved by 20 Member States and with the addition of Poland today brings the total to 21 Member States. Further national re-approvals are anticipated over the next few weeks. The document clarifies the principles of a common approach to military airworthiness and addresses issues such as the mutual recognition between National Military Airworthiness Authorities which is essential to realise the expected benefits from regulatory harmonisation.\u00a0 \u201cEDA has received the mandate by Defence Ministers to work towards the harmonisation of military airworthiness. In close partnership and cooperation with the MAWA representatives from the National Military Airworthiness Authorities, we have created the necessary regulatory framework and principles. What we need now is additional political will for the next step: the implementation of the EMARs into national military regulations in order to achieve mutual recognition between Member States\u201d, said Giampaolo Lillo, Armaments Director of the European Defence Agency, during the meeting.

The event under the framework of the \u201cProject Team Soldier Systems\u201d was divided into two phases: during the first phase, the group was composed of government representatives only, while the second phase also involved industry.\u00a0 For one and a half days, participating Member States shared their experience with legacy small arms which have been in use for decades, addressed their shortfalls, and discussed possible options for the future, such as replacements or upgrades. Currently used small arms have suffered from heavy wear and tear due to intensive use in current operations which disclosed flaws and demonstrated opportunities for improvement. Stefan Nowak, a weapons consultant who supported the workshop as a co-moderator, explained \u201cRecently developed small arms feature high modularity and adaptability in terms of easy mounting of mission-related components, the ability to convert to different calibres, improved ergonomics and weapons handling, high reliability and durability and lighter weight than most legacy rifles in European Armed Forces. However, in certain cases service life extensions and enhancements through upgrades are often smarter than a complete replacement.\u201d Benjamin Fuchs, acting EDA Project Officer Engage and moderator of the workshop, stated \u201cThe rationale of this open information exchange was to broaden the mind of all individuals in terms of small arms, to question national practices, and to possibly harmonise requirements across European Armed Forces at an early stage.\u201d Lieutenant Colonel Matti Honkela from the Finnish Army Command added \u201cThe lively discussions revealed that this approach was very welcomed by the experts.\u201d The participants agreed that also small arms training is an equally important factor as are technical aspects and multi-national cooperation should be further promoted under the auspices of EDA.\u00a0 The workshop was both heavily supported by Finland and by the industry. Industry representatives used the opportunity not only to present their portfolios, but also to discuss with government experts the latest operational requirements and technical potential and feasibility in the small arms domain. This session also covered the ammunition sector and hearing protection. During the live fire demonstration on 6th June, participants were able to test and compare various assault rifles, sniper rifles, machine guns, personal defence weapons, pistols and shotguns on the firing range.\u00a0 The participants agreed that follow-up workshops on this important topic with a particular focus area should be conducted on an annual basis.\u00a0 \u00a0 More information: Pictures of the workshop are available on Flickr. \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/06/13/next-generation-small-arms-workshop-a-success"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0792", "date": "2013-06-11", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Register for European Defence Directory (Yellow Pages)", "text": " On 28 June the European Defence Agency (EDA) is opening a new section on its website dedicated to procurement for the defence community.\u00a0 This new section will serve as a one-shop gateway for users looking for procurement related information (at EU, EDA and national level) and business opportunities.

The two-weeks flying event, which is coordinated by the European Defence Agency (EDA) in close cooperation with the European Air Transport Command and hosted by Spain, allows crews to train different tactical airlift missions in an international environment. The aim is to increase interoperability in the air transport area. EATT13 As part of the EDA\u2019s Pooling & Sharing initiative to increase cooperation among participating Member States, EATT13 allows crews to train and qualify together in specific airlift disciplines.\u00a0 In particular, EATT will consolidate skills in: advanced mission planning, cargo and personnel airdrops, tactical navigation and threat reactions, tactical air land operations, short field landings, formation flying, night operations, aeromedical evacuation, as well as standardised procedures among tactical aircraft operators to enhance interoperability. 350 participants and thirteen aircraft from eight nations participate in the second EATT flying event, initiated by EDA and organised by a Core Planning Team composed of personnel from the European Air Group, the European Air Transport Command, the Joint Air Power Competence Centre, the Tactical Leadership Programme as well as from national headquarters and units. Participants to EATT13 are: Belgium (one C-130 and two crews), Czech Republic (one CN-295 and two crews), France (one C-130 and one CN 235-300 and four crews), Germany (three C-160 and three crews), Italy (one C-27 and two crews), The Netherlands (one C-130 and two crews), Spain (one C-130 and one CN-295 and four crews) and Sweden (two C-130 and two crews). Additionally, Spanish and French air forces will support EATT13 with a number of fighter aircraft (F-18s and Eurofighters from Spain; Rafales and MF1s from France). In addition the French air force will engage one AWACS and Italy one KC-767A. Bulgaria, Finland, Greece, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, UK and the US participate in the event as observers. EATT is owned by the nations since they are expressing their respective training requirements for the event.\u00a0 \u201cToday\u2019s operations are multinational ones. It is thus imperative that our trainings are as well. This second transport aircraft flying event has just begun but it is already a success. Compared to last year, we have more nations, more aircraft, more crews and more sorties\u201d, says Rini Goos, Deputy Chief Executive at the European Defence Agency at the opening of the Distinguished Visitors Day. Training together While the fighter community has been training to operate together for years, the same cannot be said for air transport. Today airlift training in Europe is very much done on a national level and since operating together becomes more the rule than the exception, the need to train together has grown as well.\u00a0 A major step towards more combined training as well as harmonisation of airlift procedures and processes was the creation of the European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) partnership in 2011. The EATF Ad Hoc Working Group Operations & Training (AHWG O&T) dealing with training at operator\u2019s level, developed amongst others, projects to increase the opportunities to train together and to exchange best practices. The current work strands of the AHWG O&T are a yearly European Air Transport Symposium, European Air Transport Training (EATT) flying events and a European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course (EAATTC) as from 2014.\u00a0 The first EATT was organised in Zaragoza, Spain in June 2012.

She specified that investment in Research & Development, attention to security of supply and increased synergies between community and defence policies were crucial. Claude-France Arnould also mentioned some of the Agency\u2019s Pooling & Sharing initiatives which successfully close European defence capability gaps in areas such as air-to-air refuelling, governmental satellite communications and traffic insertion of remotely piloted aircraft systems. General Palom\u00e9ros stressed the strategic ties between EDA and NATO SACT in improving defence capabilities; key areas of common interest were air-to-air refuelling and future solutions for remotely piloted aircraft systems. He also insisted that Europe needed to increasingly become a security provider rather than just a security user. Members of the European Parliament were in the following exchange of views interested in the state of preparation for the upcoming European Council dealing with defence topics; Arnaud Danjean, chairman of the subcommittee, highlighted the importance of Pooling & Sharing and showed concern for the involvement of all Member States in cooperative programmes and the full commitment of Member States to defence cooperation.\u00a0 More information: News \"Members of European Parliament Visit EDA\" (11 April 2013) ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/06/10/exchange-of-views-with-sede-members"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0796", "date": "2013-06-03", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Diplomatic Clearances for Military Transport Aircraft Officially Launched", "text": " The European Defence Agency launched, using its website, a diplomatic clearances portal for military transport aircraft. The portal implements the technical arrangement signed by thirteen Member States (Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Romania, Slovakia, Sweden and Norway) for common provisions and harmonised procedures for overflights and landings. The arrangement enables Member States to operate without the need to submit diplomatic clearances requests for each flight, including support to on-going operations and transportation of IATA/ICAO compliant dangerous goods. This simplified mechanism is a significant step forward to more flexible and effective military airlift operations in Europe. The portal allows Member States to easily exchange the necessary information. Presented to defence ministers in November 2012, the agreement improves the freedom of movement of EU military registered transport aircraft transiting national boundaries within the EU. The existing disparate requirements to obtain diplomatic clearances to land or overfly an EU member state cause delays and hampers swift airlift operations. This legacy mechanism needed updating to 21st century\u2019s requirements, especially with a view to the future implementation of the Single European Sky (SES) in the coming years, where a route driven system will evolve into a trajectory driven system. \u201cThe new diplomatic clearances agreement radically changes the way Member States deal with the issue. It allows substantial human and financial resource savings whilst making military transport operations more swift and efficient\u201d, says Peter Round, Capabilities Director of the European Defence Agency. The technical arrangement was implemented on 1 June and is still open for signature for all other EU member states and Schengen area signatories. Six additional Member States (Estonia, Finland, France, Latvia, Luxembourg and Spain) indicated their willingness to sign the technical arrangement soon. Diplomatic clearances portal The new mechanism provides annual diplomatic clearance numbers for up to 95% of the daily military transport missions executed above the territories of the signing countries. It also harmonises the requirements for requests and notifications of diplomatic clearances. Finally, a common diplomatic clearance form has been created. The diplomatic clearances portal on EDA\u2019s website (http://eda.europa.eu/DICPortal) is the backbone of the new arrangement. Its main purpose is to provide transparency on national policies and procedures for granting diplomatic clearances for transport aircraft. The portal will also list annual clearance numbers to be used as well as restrictions nations might have regarding certain areas or routings. Background and way forward The European Air Transport Fleet partnership signed by 20 Member States in 2011 under the auspices of the European Defence Agency is looking at improving the availability of military airlift in the EU and developing concrete solutions to increase its efficiency and effectiveness. The EDA ad hoc working group for Diplomatic Clearances that developed this technical arrangement will continue to work on different diplomatic clearance issues, including harmonisation of clearances for EU military transport aircraft outside the EU and clearances for air-to-air refuelling (AAR) operations in the European sky. \u00a0 More information: News \"EATT13: Final Preparations\" (3 May 2013) News \"Diplomatic Clearances for Military Transport Aircraft\" (21 November 2012) Project page European Air Transport Fleet partnership ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/06/03/diplomatic-clearances-for-military-transport-aircraft-officially-launched"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0797", "date": "2013-06-07", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Work on Cyber Ranges Initiated", "text": " On 30 May, Austria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Finland, and the Netherlands signed a letter of intent to work towards the Pooling & Sharing of available and future resources for cyber defence training, exercise and testing.

Last year\u2019s bash formed part of the Commission\u2019s Sustainable Energy Week gathering hundred and fifty attendants with the aim to raise awareness on the bigger picture of climate, environment and energy while exhibiting and demonstrating technological opportunities to reduce the footprint. The low key 2013 edition looks instead to develop roadmaps to deliver tangible results drawing on civil-military synergies. Addressing energy and environment is essential to sustaining defence and crisis management capabilities. Recent operations have clearly shown that energy supply in theatre is an Achilles\u2019 heel. Time and again adversaries have targeted fuel convoys, compromising the operational effectiveness and causing unnecessary loss of life.\u00a0 Increasing energy efficiency reduces vulnerability and additionally cuts costs, not only in theatre but also at home during preparations. Introducing better water and waste management as well as the use of more responsible materials and munitions provides a good base for post-conflict reconstruction while contributing to sustainable development. Furthermore, understanding how climate change affects international security supports developing capabilities that can prevent potential future disasters and conflicts. Following a strategic Government-only meeting earlier this year a number of areas were identified as quick wins, requiring little or moderate efforts. To launch the harvesting of these low hanging fruit it was decided to conduct a set of expert workshops to identify challenges, opportunities and a viable collaborative way forward. Topics that will be covered are: 6 \u2013 7 June 2013 Climate change and loss biodiversity as threat-multipliers to international security Increasing awareness on the impact of the EU directives Exploring new business models that make it attractive for all stakeholders (supplier, buyer, user and environment) to reduce the footprint 13 \u2013 14 June 2013 Catalysing the introduction of alternative fuels Integrating novel alternative and renewable energy supply technologies for land installations Eco-design \u2013 designing to endure environmental conditions responsibly Key stakeholders have already been invited to attend.

The flying event which will last from 9 to 21 June will unite 350 personnel from eight countries.\u00a0 \u00a0 1. What is your role in EATT13? I have been designated by the Spanish Air Mobility Command, where I work as the Deputy Chief in the Air Transport Section, as the Exercise Director (EXDIR) for the European Air Transport Training 2013 (EATT13). My role as EXDIR, once the designing and planning phases were concluded, is to control and command the different cells involved in the EATT13 organisation.\u00a0 2. What is the importance of the EATT13 for European Air Transport? Managing military budgets is quite difficult and complex for all European countries; joint operations are more common. Consequently, European projects and initiatives in this area must be focused on carrying out multinational air transport training programmes with Pooling & Sharing as a priority, followed by the standardisation of procedures, tactics, techniques, and cross-servicing activities. We can affirm that EATT13 is a clear example of this kind of initiative; the motto is \u201cTraining together to operate together\u201d with the aim to increase interoperability of European aircrews and fleets based on common procedures. The objective is to create a European Advanced Air Tactical Transport Course (EAATTC) similar to the American one, and following the philosophy of the Tactical Leadership Programme (TLP).\u00a0 3. How is this project supported by Spain? Spain is the Host Nation (HN) and the Spanish Air Force is in charge of leading the activities, the planning process and the coordination of the air transport aircraft from eight different nations, with the main support of the European Air Transport Command (EATC), the European Air Group (EAG), the Joint Air Power Competence Center (JAPCC) and, the most important support, the air transport units participants and their Senior National Representatives (SNRs). 4. What are the keys to EATT13's success? First of all, the multinational team has already been working very hard for more than one and a half years to design, plan and execute this multinational training programme; secondly, the great support of Spain, as Host Nation, of the Spanish Air Force, as host air force and of the Zaragoza Air Base, as a multiplication factor to achieve EATT13\u2019s goals; and finally, the flexibility of the event, which allows that air missions are planned to achieve the tactical training requirements of all participating crews.\u00a0 \u00a0 More information: Visit the EATT13 webpage Read more on the European Air Transport Fleet \u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/06/07/eatt13-interview-with-lieutenant-colonel-jose-almodovar"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0800", "date": "2013-06-03", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA at Paris Air Show", "text": " Several of the Agency\u2019s flagship projects are in the air domain: air-to-air refuelling, air traffic insertion of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems, military air transport activities, SESAR impact on the armed forces, as well as military airworthiness and governmental satellite communications.

The aim is to derive conclusions for upcoming European military capability requirements. The war game will be based on four generic scenarios that will cover the full spectrum of possible futures. \u201cGiven the often long timeframes between research, development, acquisition, training and final entry into service of new assets, we need to have a timely understanding of what future capability needs might look like. The war game is one element to support Member States in defining the military capabilities needed for Common Security and Defence Policy operations in the mid to long-term\u201d, says Peter Round, Capabilities Director of the European Defence Agency. European Capabilities Assessment Game Based on the Agency\u2019s work on future trends in the framework of the Capability Development Plan (CDP), the European Capability Assessment Game or war game will be based on four generic scenarios. These scenarios are not aimed at predicting the most probable future, nor to engage in a discussion about political developments but to test the impact on long-term capability requirements: Classic Case: The global balance of today remains unchanged in a positive and stable way. Aggressive Multi-Polarism: Several more or less equally strong powers compete for power, influence and resources \u2013 also by military means. Failing States: An increased number of states are not able to cope with the challenges of globalisation, competition for resources, climate change and other factors. Unconventional Conflicts:\u00a0Open military clashes are rare. Power blocks (states) try to undermine each other\u2019s security by supporting for example terrorist or radical opposition groups. Objectives The 25 experts will during three days crosscheck existing and planned military capabilities against the threats and challenges described in the four scenarios. This will allow them to gain experiences in order to identify decisive points and possible measures to take. Most importantly in the framework of the CDP, they will be able to identify EU\u2019s long-term capability trends in order to timely make the necessary decisions on capability development. The final results of the war game will be presented to Member States in autumn 2013.

The study, now concluded, sheds light over the actual consumption and proposes concrete measures to increase energy efficiency and in doing so reduce the overall fuel consumption. Using fossil fuels comes with an addiction that is hard to shake and we rely on them heavily to get through the day. Diesel and petrol power our cars and busses while coal and oil help us keep warm in the winter and cool in the summer. The latter types of fuels also help power the metro systems and the overhead railway lines to take us longer distances. To take us really long distances kerosene is what propels us all the way up into the Jetstream. The defence domain is no less susceptible. On the contrary, over the years the dependency has grown and although it mainly concerns logistic fuels, they are nonetheless fossil. But as shown by this Workshop there is room for change and improvements can be made today, some aided by technology others through spreading awareness. Reducing energy consumption and increasing energy efficiency of our deployed systems will reduce the overall need for fuel. Subsequently the number of convoys needed to be sent into high threat theatre can be reduced. By doing so, the exposure to risk by personnel can be reduced. The reduction in fuel consumption also results in lower materiel life-cycle costs. Furthermore the sheer reduction in overall combustion of fossil fuels reduces the hazardous emissions. These aspects are not only relevant to high threat areas but also to the other extreme in terms of CMOs, disaster relief. Also, if we can reduce fuel consumption in theatre, we can most likely do the same in the homeland. Contracted to Spanish company ISDEFE, the study with the acronym Fuel-D provides a statistical picture of overall energy consumption in operations as well as specific data associated with selected camps in theatre. The statistics have been analysed in order to identify trends and opportunities for reducing consumption. Fuel-D has further developed a software tool to allow mission planners to better understand how capabilities can be enhanced by reducing energy consumption and how this affects the cost burden positively. In addition Fuel-D has shown how camp designs can be optimised through the introduction of novel and renewable energy technologies. This is in particular feeds straight into EDA and Member States expert work in developing Best Practices for Energy Supply Systems for Camps. The successful conclusion of the Fuel-D study feeds into the continued work on energy and environment that EDA Member States are undertaking. The upcoming workshop series Military Green 2013 to be held in early June will be the first step in exploiting the results of the Fuel-D study.

The complete course is part of the EDA Helicopter Training Programme (HTP).\u00a0 The aim of course is to give selected European helicopter aircrew tactical depth and expertise, leading to an enhanced awareness of helicopter tactics and employment and multi-national integration.\u00a0 At the end of the course graduates are adept at imparting tactical instruction during training and on operations and are also competent in providing helicopter tactical advice at one star level, as well as leading multi-platform complex Composite Air Operations (COMAOs). Classroom and simulator phase The classroom and simulator phase was executed in the simulator assets of the Helicopter Tactics Course (HTC) and followed the syllabus of the UK QHTI (Qualified Helicopter Tactics Instructor) course as the baseline. Fourteen instructors of the UK instructor team of the ROWETU (Rotary-Wing Operational Evaluation and Trials Unit) ran the course which allowed a ratio of one instructor per student. This allowed a very individual and supportive training with a high-value output. The focus of the course is to not only train the pilots, but the rear crew (chiefs and door-gunners) as well. Not only the \u201cPitchers\u201d (German nickname for the front crew) had to prepare the missions or give related briefings, the \u201cMixers\u201d (German nickname for the crew chiefs) and the door-gunners where challenged as well. Life flying phase For the life flying phase, one CH-53 (Germany), one AS332 (Sweden, Super Puma) and two UH-1D (Germany) were available.The life flying phase was executed in cooperation with the UK 100 Squadron which deployed their two HAWK fast jets as red air for the evasion training phase. Swedish GRIPPEN jets were involved in this part of the course as well. The following topics are integral parts of the course: Electronic Warfare Training (EW) Evasion Training (ET) Airspace Battle Management (ATO, ACO, SPINS) Manpads/SA Helo Escort Techniques Other Operations (Wells, Tac-3D Manoeuvres, Vehicle Interdiction, Mutual Support) Tac Formations Mission Preparation & Planning COMAO Mission Planning Multinational, English language, three building-block phases Excellent support was provided by the Swedish Ministry of Defence organisation, FMV, which is running the Vidsel Test Range and which provided all necessary organisational requirements for the live flying phase in Sweden. Results and way forward The EHTI course delivers an outstanding opportunity to expose helicopter crews to the training methodology and tactical knowledge of another Member State. \u201cAn extremely challenging course, delivered by highly professional instructors, we have to keep this going\u201d, said\u00a0Major Sascha Pink from the German Army Aviation.\u00a0It is also the first step in delivering a sustainable European course where successful graduates can be awarded a qualification recognised by all pMS. Additionally, on returning home, these graduates can pass on the common understanding and methodologies to their own crews and can interact as mentors vis-\u00e0-vis other helicopter programmes. During the HOT BLADE Exercise of the Helicopter Exercise Progamme (HEP) in Portugal this July, many of the freshly trained instructors will meet together with UK instructors at OVAR Airbase and form together the first Mentor Team for an HEP Exercise, ready to support the multinational crews in preparation and execution of the challenging COMAO missions. This year\u2019s students will become next year\u2019s instructors.\u00a0 This will allow the gradual build-up of expertise and create a self-sustaining course using European Qualified Helicopter Tactics Instructors.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 More information: For more information on the Agency's helicopter activities, please visit the project page.\u00a0 Pictures from the course are available on Flickr.\u00a0 ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/05/29/first-european-helicopter-tactics-instructor-course-delivered-successfully"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0805", "date": "2013-05-24", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA Study Identifies Cooperation Prospects in Cyber Defence", "text": " The European Defence Agency (EDA) presented on 24 May 2013 results of its stocktaking study of military cyber defence capabilities. Using an in depth methodology, the study benchmarked the degree of \u201cCyber Defence Readiness\u201d of 20 participating Member States (pMS) and different EU level organisations. The landscaping exercise shows a mixed picture with respect to military cyber defence capabilities on national and European level. It recommends strengthening cooperation, exchange of information and proposes avenues for pragmatic Pooling & Sharing of some cyber defence capabilities. The study supports the relevance of the cyber defence activities launched by the EDA in the areas of cyber training ranges and deployable situational awareness kits for CSDP missions. \u201cCyberspace can be described as the fifth dimension of warfare, equally critical to military operations as land, sea, air and space. Our study reveals important gaps in military cyber defence capabilities across the EU. The Agency is offering Member States a range of projects to cooperate in the area of cyber defence capabilities as well as in the research & technology domain\u201d, says Peter Round, Capabilities Director of the European Defence Agency. The one-year stocktaking study aimed to establish a high-level understanding of cyber defence capabilities across EDA pMS to support progress towards a more consistent level of cyber defence capability across the EU. 20 countries were included in the study. Methodology This stocktaking exercise included research into the different EU level organisations involved in cyber defence activities in the context of CSDP missions as well as data collection on cyber defence capabilities in pMS. The research was carried out via document review, semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire. Cyber defence information was analysed according to a commonly understood military framework of capability, known as Defence Lines of Development. These contributors are: Doctrine; Organisation; Training; Material; Leadership; Facilities and Interoperability (DOTMLPF-I). To measure and to a certain degree benchmark the degree of \u201cCyber Readiness\u201d the study utilised a five step maturity model with 69 discrete and weighted indicators for maturity, broken down within the DOTMLPF-I structure to achieve the required granularity. Each country was qualitatively assessed for each contributor against this weighted maturity model. Results On the national level, the study revealed a mixed picture with respect to military cyber defence capability. Generally speaking, in pMS where key decision-makers are familiar with cyber-security, cyber defence capabilities are more advanced. The 20 pMS exhibit strengths in the three capability domains of Leadership, Personnel and Interoperability. In the areas of Doctrine, Organisation and Training, an early level of maturity was defined which might be linked to the fact that these three areas require more complex and longer-term efforts to establish organisational structures. Facilities is the capability domain which remains to date highly immature or non-existent. Individual country profiles are classified and cannot be made available. As regards cyber defence among EU organisations, the study highlights the complex operational set-up between the different institutions involved (e.g. EDA, the Member States, European External Action Service, European Commission, General Secretariat of the EU Council and related EU agencies). While threat analysis and cyber-intelligence gathering capability appears to be emergent, incident response capabilities could be deepened. The study also reveals that the culture of cyber-security good practice needs to be nurtured and that the use of military specific standards and tools is still poorly understood. Recommendations Military cyber defence on the European level is at a relative early stage of maturity. The study therefore makes high-level recommendations such as enhancing EU network protection, strengthening intelligence capability, deepening incident response capabilities, creating a culture of cyber-security, promulgating security standards and tools, and reinforcing links between NATO and the EU for cyber defence issues. On the national level, greater attention should be given to the development of cyber defence training and education initiatives. pMS are encouraged to consider exchanging information on equipment solutions and Pooling & Sharing for cyber defence capabilities, and on processes and shared escalation procedures, especially in EU-led missions. Finally, the study suggests pMS consider sharing \u2013 to a certain extent \u2013 facilities and to take into account interoperability aspects of cyber defence. EDA Activities Cyber defence is one of the Agency\u2019s top capability priorities. Complementary to activities derived from the EDA Capability Development Plan (CDP), such as research on human factors in cyber defence, the establishment of a cyber defence research agenda and a common cyber defence training curriculum, there is a focus on the most pressing gaps identified in the landscaping study like training and education, or cyber defence situational awareness in CSDP operations. Consequently EDA is initiating three ad hoc projects with Member States: (1) The Cyber Ranges project aims at Pooling & Sharing of current and future resources for Cyber Defence Training, exercise & testing in order to increase availability and efficiency of existing assets, and to mainstream and improve cyber defence training, exercises & testing at European level. (2) The deployable cyber situational awareness kit initiative aims at providing, Pooling & Sharing a common and standardised cyber defence planning and management platform. It shall allow Commanders and their staff in EU-led operations to fulfil their cyber defence related tasks throughout all phases of an EU-led operation. (3) The \u201cAdvanced Persistent Threats Detection (APT-D)\u201d project initiative is focusing on improved capabilities in early detection and smart mitigation of APT. Together with the Irish Presidency of the European Union and the Estonian Ministry of Defence, the EDA will also co-host a high level conference on Cyber Security Cooperation in the European Union on 20 June 2013. \u00a0 More information: Press release (PDF file) Factsheet on Cyber Defence (PDF file) News \"EDA & Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre Of Excellence Establish Liaison\" (10 April 2013) News\u00a0\"European Union Strategy for Cyber Security\"\u00a0(8 Feb 2013) News\u00a0\"EDA Participates in Cyber Defence Conferences\"\u00a0(6 Feb 2013) News \"Cyber Defence Workshop\u00a0coorganised by EDA, European Commission and European Space Agency\" (25 Oct 2012) ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/05/24/eda-study-identifies-cooperation-prospects-in-cyber-defence"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0806", "date": "2013-05-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ENNSA Second Annual Report", "text": " ENNSA, the\u00a0European Network of National Safety Authorities on Ammunition, presents in its second annual report the key activities of 2012 and their outcome.\u00a0 The network was particularly active in the EDA's work regarding the\u00a0harmonisation of ammunition qualification roadmap, demilitarisation and the\u00a0Precision Guided Ammunition Roadmap.\u00a0 For more information, download the report here.\u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/05/16/ennsa-second-annual-report"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0807", "date": "2013-05-17", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Claude-France Arnould Visits Lithuania", "text": " EDA Chief Executive, Ms Claude-France Arnould, visited Lithuania on 13-14 May, in preparation of Lithuania\u2019s Presidency of the Council of the European Union starting on 1 July 2013.

Organised for the second time this year in close cooperation with the European Air Transport Command and hosted by Spain, 350 participants from eight nations with twelve aircraft will gather in Zaragoza from 9 to 21 June 2013. Laurent Donnet, EDA Assistant Capability Manager Man\u0153uvre and Deputy Exercise Director explains the aim of the flying event and how the preparations are progressing. 1) Laurent, what is the aim of the European Air Transport Training? The allied fighter community has been extensively flying multinational training programmes for the last decades, with the Tactical Leadership Programme (TLP) and the Flag exercises being examples. Although some transport aircraft are embedded in those events, they are primarily fighter centric. Airlift training to date is very much a national responsibility while operating together becomes the rule. Therefore the aim of these EATT events is to have a dedicated framework for European air transport operators to increase the opportunity to train together but also to harmonise the training itself and exchange best practices amongst the different air forces, and this in the areas of training but also operations. The advantage of EATT is that the training is tailored to the participant\u2019s requests. No disciplines or events are imposed to the crews and the entire flying programme is scheduled in such a way that each participating crew will get the specific training it needs. This flexibility makes EATT probably so attractive. \u00a0 2)\u00a0This is the second time, the flying event is organised. What is different from last year? The amount of participants and the number of sorties that will be flown! The location is the same (Zaragoza AB, Spain) and so is the organising structure, but where last year we had six nations and eight aircraft participating, we have eight nations and twelve aircraft this year. Last year we had fourteen sorties a day, this year twenty-two. In a way we are a victim of our success. Looking at the detachment size it goes from 250 to 350 people. In order to cope with this massive increase in numbers we will organise two events as from next year. One will again be in Spain, the other one in Bulgaria. \u00a0 3)\u00a0Around six weeks before the event starts. What are the last preparations? What do you focus on now? The focus is now on fine-tuning the entire EATT flow and ensure the crews will get the training they requested. Therefore the focus is on the flying schedule and the support that is needed around it to make it happen. This being said, the core planning team of EATT is structured in such a way that different panels (Ops, Intelligence, maintenance, media & communication, etc.) take care of specific issues and hence focusses on their area. There are so many things to take care of six weeks before such an event that all people involved are pretty busy with it. Since we don\u2019t have any permanent structure to manage EATT, we\u2019re using the goodwill of a lot of experts in different organisations and structures like the EATC, EAG and JAPCC but also from the national staffs and units. Last but not least, since as you mentioned this is the second edition of EATT we have a supplementary thing to take care of and that is the pressure on our shoulders to deliver an event at least as good as last year\u2019s. This is definitely a big challenge to take. \u00a0 More information: EATT2013 event entry (here) Press release \"EDA launches European air transport training\" of 31 May 2012.

In this interview he shares his views on how Europe\u2019s defence industry can retain capabilities and profitability during challenging economic times. What do you believe should be done to strengthen and enhance the European defence industrial base? How can institutions such as the EDA contribute effectively to this process? The core role of the EDA is to help governments attain their defence objectives by outlining the efficiency gains that could be a result of doing things together. But Member States all come from different horizons and do not in all cases have homogenous security and defence policy goals. So convergence has to be created in a pragmatic way. Mostly, and particularly in this field, Europe is forging common approaches through dealing with crisis situations. \u00a0And the European Union does not see itself as a prime military power and understandably prefers to seek foreign and security policy benefits by using \u201csoft-power\u201d approaches. However we seem to be entering a period where we are witnessing a rising tension between not being a prime military power yet still being able to support doing the things we need and want to do to maintain a credible European foreign and security policy posture. Surely the current one-by-one policy where we shop around between ourselves for assets during times of crisis \u2013 such as military transport aircraft \u2013 is not an optimised process. \u00a0These crises can give us some guidelines to the future but we need to consider the equipment implications of these events becoming more prolonged and difficult, with increased demand for equipment. We need to consider what exactly we should be doing jointly and whether we have the technology investment in place for the longer term. Or whether we just go down commercial routes, that is, look for what is available, accepting the inevitable dependencies that this would create. The degree to which Member States achieve demand consolidation though harmonization, coordination and synchronization of their individual procurement initiatives is key to the preservation of a healthy defence industrial base in Europe. Member States have to define those defence areas which they need to retain under their direct influence to serve an immediate national interest and then agree collaborative approaches for the rest. There should be room within the EDA for this collaborative process to start and for governments, whether it is two or 27, to identify similar needs and discuss how to achieve the capabilities together. A key issue is agreeing a common timescale, to coordinate and synchronise national budgets. You can then develop an optimised investment plan from research and technology to actual procurement. Does this mean a single procurement agency for Europe? Maybe in the very long term but we can go a long way in the short term to synchronise approaches. We know this has provided benefits in the past. For example, with the Meteor air-to-air missile programme governments drew up common specifications, including those for the interfaces, and agreed to place orders in the same timeframe, but individually. This allowed the contractor the opportunity to benefit from a larger production run, with an appropriate reduced level of cost to the customer. We see no reasonable prospect in the foreseeable future of the EU itself becoming a significant source of demand for defence goods and services - the fundamental challenges and responsibilities continue to reside in Member States. But we think the full potential of the EDA is not yet recognised by Member States and the Agency will have to market itself more proactively. Industry was very much in support of the creation of the EDA and, although we do not in all questions share identical views, now more than ever we need to work more closely together. The EDA\u2019s role for industry is essential but the Agency has to focus on speeding up the schedule under which cooperative initiatives are being delivered, to drill down into the wide process of pooling and sharing and identify more initiatives that are directly relevant to underpin defence industrial capabilities in Europe. Time is of the essence, now more than ever. Surely we also need a well regulated European defence market but it cannot be created by regulation alone. Even if we have the same transparent rules for procurement and competition, without demand consolidation fragmentation endures. And who does that help?\u00a0 Is Europe investing enough in research and technology (R&T) and if not, what can be done to reverse the decline? Our mastery of technologies is an essential part of our industrial capability portfolio. Much of this capability has been generated by government investment from research to procurement, and governments should have an overwhelming interest in maintaining the competitiveness of \u201ctheir\u201d industries. But the paradigm is changing. We are \u2013we hope \u2013 moving towards a European, rather than a national defence market, and additionally there is a real benefit for our Member States if companies can maintain or enhance their global competitive edge.\u00a0 If industry is competitive in Europe, it will be competitive globally and vice-versa. In former times, governments had their national industries\u2019 interests at heart, but if you widen the procurement circle to include other participating governments, those same companies need to be sure the new government customers will also respect their justifiable interests, in particular in the domain of Intellectual Property rights (IPR). Each company\u2019s IPR portfolio after all is a key ingredient in its global competitiveness. In 2006 EU defence ministers in the EDA Steering Board agreed they should increase the percentage of research and technology in defence budgets from 1.6% to 2.0%. But EDA's figures for 2010 showed it has fallen to 1.2%, and today the figure is certainly lower. This does indeed represent structural under-investment. There is no doubt that the accelerating and enduring erosion of defence industrial capabilities will have serious consequences for the security and defence policies that they help to sustain. \u00a0What may be even worse is that there is no common view of which are the essential capabilities that will be needed over the next two decades; \u00a0without this view it\u2019s impossible to say whether, if you lose capabilities, this will result in a dangerous situation or not. Defence\u00a0 research and technology investment is undertaken by Member States in view of a capability need and is usually full-funded because they have an upcoming capability need and there\u2019s nothing in the portfolio to meet that need. So they work with industry to create that capability. This process will continue but we now face important questions of affordability. Member States will increasingly have to coordinate this with other Member States \u2013 though there will still be instances of some governments undertaking work on an exclusively national basis \u2013 and coordination will typically be done through the EDA. This is an EDA capability, which is currently under-exploited in our view, especially for Category B programmes. This is a valuable resource and Member States should have more recognition of them and be more open to coordinate their approaches. It is clear that not all Member States have gone down the process of understanding what they want to share and what they don\u2019t want to share \u2013from both research and procurement points of view. Across the institutional divide the EDA and the European Commission now have a tool to coordinate their investments in research and technology to prevent waste and duplication. But the Commission undertakes R&T work at a lower- tier technical readiness levels from that of the EDA \u2013 the higher you go towards technical readiness the closer you move towards putting that new technology into the defence market and that\u2019s not an area in which the Commission operates. The Commission can help through its framework research agenda with the first steps of technology research that is relevant to future defence capabilities, but not exclusively so, and then it\u2019s up to Member States and the EDA to develop the more defence specific technology. This is a process which needs to be better coordinated; the Commission also funds this work differently and makes the results freely available within the EU and sometimes beyond, which is mostly not appropriate for the defence sector. The related IPR issues are another factor \u2013 rules for intellectual property use are different for work which is funded through the grant mechanism (on the Commission\u2019s side) as opposed to defence research investments by the Member States. So how does Europe remain competitive in a market that is increasingly global and in which buyers are becoming far more intelligent in terms of procurement practices? The fall in product demand and increasing under-investment in R&T among European Member States are causing companies to seek market opportunities in more dynamic economies in an effort both to sustain profitable activities and maintain their defence industrial capabilities. But the European defence industrial community can only be sustainably successful in foreign markets if it can demonstrate that there is a national and/or EU home market for their products. Home customer demand has always been a pre-requisite for successful defence exporting. There are constraints to marketing globally \u2013 we cannot do it everywhere and we do not want to do it everywhere. In addition, many potential foreign customers expect genuine cooperation and industrial investment. So, by seeking to exploit foreign markets, we contribute to creating our competitors of the future. Then there is the problem of technology drain. These new competitors will not want an investment in yesterday\u2019s technologies; they want to create their own capabilities. So suddenly you can create a \u201creverse dependency\u201d situation where politically acceptable countries acquire technological capabilities on which Europe may soon start to depend. These implications have to be properly thought through. What effect do you forecast from the activities of Commissioner Barnier and the Task Force on defence? How much input has ASD had in these activities? The task force, as we interpret it, is there to help. It wants to help governments achieve the objectives they have set for themselves. While we welcome the Commission\u2019s interest in supporting the defence sector, the actions available to or suggested by the Commission are not central to the underlying problems faced by the industry in the short and medium term, and need to be seen and understood in this context. What do you see as the priorities for European defence in light of the EU Council\u2019s workings? How important will the EU ministerial meeting on defence be at the end of this year? In terms of raising to the level of heads of government the issue that there is more to European security and defence policy than the external aspect, the council meeting is extremely important. We have started our dialogue with the EDA and the Commission to ensure all arguments can be brought forward. We have tried the \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach but to achieve real progress, what Europe really needs now is the \u201ctop-down\u201d focus and support by Heads of State and Governments. Consolidation in the European defence industry is a hot topic, with the failed merger of EADS and BAE Systems\u00a0and rumours regarding mergers within French industry bringing a fresh focus to it. What is your view on the imperative for consolidation and the barriers that stand in the way of making it effective? Our association is not working on consolidation scenarios. These are issues where each company has its own strategy and its own portfolio of interests and those are extremely competition-sensitive. I can only offer you a few general considerations. \u201cConsolidation\u201d has become a buzz-word for journalists and analysts \u2013 it covers many underlying issues, which many people who use the word do not probably fully understand.\u00a0 It is important to understand that consolidation, in particular in our industry sector, is a result of market conditions and political concerns that are fully under control of the EU Member States. \u00a0 More information This interview was first published in the third issue of the European Defence Agency's magazine \"European Defence Matters\".

Notably, Pooling & Sharing priorities Air-to-Air Refuelling and satellite communications as well as the EDA\u2019s work as regards implications of SESAR for the military were discussed. Air-to-Air Refuelling (AAR) EDA is facilitating four complementary and parallel work-strands for short- medium- and long-term solutions to the AAR requirement. The first pillar concerns the use of short-term commercial solutions. For the second pillar, EDA together with Italy and the Movement Coordination Centre Europe (MCCE), is promoting a multinational approach using the Italian KC767 as a test case for a collective AAR clearance campaign to be concluded in September 2013 with a flight trial. This will help establish a process for collective AAR clearances on future AAR platforms. The EDA is also working with the UK on access for other Member States\u00a0 to unallocated hours in the UK Voyager programme. The third pillar involves A400M kits. For the fourth pillar - Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) \u2013 the objective is on the basis of pooled national requirements, to provide a European strategic MRTT capability from 2020. This builds on the Letter of Intent signed by nine Member States (BE, EL, ES, FR, HU, LU, PL, PO, NL) and NO at the Steering Board on 19 November 2012. This work is being led by the Netherlands.. Satellite Communications EDA is developing a concept for \u201cSecure Telecom by Satellite\u201d where, through Pooling & Sharing, significant savings could be achieved. Because of the dual-use nature of satellite communications, EDA proposes to examine how jointly funded activities could be launched in close cooperation with Member States, the European Commission and ESA. SESAR With the adoption of the Implementing Regulation on Common Projects for the deployment of SESAR, the defence community will be involved on a more systematic basis. It will also need to anticipate at political and at technical (equipment and technologies, commonalities with civilian users, funding opportunities, etc.) levels. In this context, EDA is proposing to establish an Ad Hoc Category A (opt-out) programme for SESAR implementation to reinforce expertise in EDA, increase coordination among Ministries of Defence and with other organisations, including NATO, and generate collaborative ad hoc projects. \u00a0 More information: Pictures of the Steering Board are available here News \"Steering Board: EDA Input for European Council\" (23 April 2013) News \"European Structural Funds: EDA Supports Six Pilot Projects\" (23 April 2013) News \"Baltic Defence Ministries Sign Joint Ammunition Procurement Arrangement\" (23 April 2013) Project Page Air-to-Air Refuelling Factsheet Pooling & Sharing \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/04/23/steering-board-eda-key-initiatives-make-progress"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0815", "date": "2013-04-26", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Successful ESA-EDA Flight Demonstration on RPAS Insertion into Civil Airspace", "text": " San Javier Air Base (Murcia) was selected to conduct the trials and demonstrate that satellite communications are suitable to operate Remotely Piloted\u00a0 Aircraft Systems (RPASs) and integrate them into civil airspace. The DeSIRE project (Demonstration of Satellites enabling the Insertion of RPAS in Europe) is funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Defence Agency (EDA) within an initiative to support the utilisation of RPAS complemented by satellites for commercial and governmental applications. To undertake this project the consultancy and technology multinational Indra (Spain) leads a European industrial consortium formed by AT-One (Germany and the Netherlands), SES ASTRA (Luxembourg), Thales Alenia Space (Italy and France) and CIRA (Italy). Test Flights DESIRE has undertaken a series of test flights to demonstrate the role of satellite communications for integrating in civil and military airspace RPAS flight Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS). The concepts and applicable procedures were defined in the precursor feasibility studies. In particular, the flight completed this Wednesday provided a generic terrestrial and maritime surveillance service, demonstrating the dual use of RPAS.\u00a0 In the presence of the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Francisco Javier Garc\u00eda-Arnaiz, an aircraft without a pilot on board took off from the San Javier runway at 11:00 a.m. on Wednesday 24 April and completed a 6-hour flight in civil and military airspace. The operation was timed to coincide with civil and military flights operating from the base, which shares its facilities with Murcia Airport. After take-off, the aircraft switched from its Line of Sight (LOS) data link, to its satellite data link, capable to operate Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS), and started its operational mission in segregated airspace, sending to the ground, by means of the satellite data link, the signals from its on-board sensors. The RPA then climbed to 20,000 feet (6,096 m), entering airspace class C, managed by AENA, the Spanish Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP), from Barcelona Control Centre. The pilot of the RPA, located at the Ground Control Station, followed all the indications issued by the AENA air traffic controllers, acting like any other civil or military aircraft. The difference is that the pilot was not on board and the radio communication with the control centre was transmitted from the aircraft to the operator via satellite. During this phase of the flight, a manned aircraft from the Air Force Academy approached the RPA, simulating frontal and 90\u00ba collision trajectories. The pilots of the two aircraft followed the separation instructions issued by the air traffic controllers, demonstrating the safe operation of remotely piloted aircraft even in an emergency situation such as the separation of two aircraft on a collision course. Situational Awareness Throughout the exercise, the data of SACTA, AENA's air traffic control system based on secondary radars, was available to the pilot of the RPA in the Ground Control Station, enabling him to improve the situational awareness of nearby aircraft, with more details and precision than an on-board pilot would have. A radar located on board the RPA was also used to detect surrounding traffic and the data were transmitted to the pilot through the satellite link. The aim was to define and test the air traffic control and operation procedures applicable to a remotely piloted aircraft and to evaluate the safety of the satellite link and the reaction capacity of the aircraft's ground pilot, both in routine operation and in emergency situations. All the information collected in these tests will be analysed and compared with the safety requirements being established by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the operational requirements being set by EUROCONTROL. During the flight, the payload data collected from the sensors on-board the aircraft (AIS receiver, radar and video) were transmitted in real-time to the Ground Control Station and further processed to enable ships\u2019 detection and identification. The execution of the project was possible thanks to the collaboration of the Spanish Air Force, which allowed the use of San Javier Air Academy facilities for the demonstration. Staff from the Air Force UAS School, sited in Matacan (Salamanca), supervised the operation of the RPA and San Javier military air controllers managed its take-offs and landings and its operations in military airspace. The RPA was granted an Airworthiness Experimental Certificate (AEC) by INTA to guarantee the safety of the system, under the envisaged operational conditions. AENA and AESA collaborated for the part of the flight to take place in civil class C airspace and the definition of the tests and of the applicable air traffic control and safety procedures. The civil future of RPAS The development of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems originated in a defence context. However, their utilisation for civil and security purposes has significant commercial potential. Possible uses include fire fighting; highway control; electricity line, critical infrastructures and border surveillance; environmental protection surveillance; management of emergencies and even goods transport. The take up of RPAS exploitation for civil and security use would also enable the dual use logic to take full advantage of RPAS cost reduction. Current legislation does not provide a harmonised framework in Europe for enabling RPAS to fly in civil airspace, in particular Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS). This situation is curbing their use and application in the civil sphere thus making it difficult for the European industry to develop the technologies and equipment that will make their use possible in the future. The demonstration undertaken within the DeSIRE project aims at establishing an agreed set of requirements that could serve as a basis for the future definition of the regulatory framework for RPAS Air Traffic Integration in Europe. The DeSIRE project is part of the joint initiative undertaken by EDA and ESA, which follows a number of activities and projects initiated by the two agencies in the RPAS domain. Among these, the Air4All Study and MIDCAS project managed by EDA and the SINUE and ESPRIT studies managed by ESA. \u00a0 More information: DeSIRE project page More information on the DeSIRE project is also available on the ESA website.

The proposals and actions concentrate around three clusters as defined by the European Council in December 2012: increase the effectiveness, visibility and impact of CSDP; enhance the development of defence capabilities; and strengthen Europe's defence industry. EDA has been active across these three clusters; it proposes, on top of its Pooling & Sharing projects, in particular Air-to-Air Refuelling, satellite communications and SESAR, to the Steering Board a number of actions for support to operations; the launch of dual-use \u201cPioneer\u201d projects, initially in the areas of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) and Cyber Defence; technology non-dependence, as well as an action plan on SMEs. a)\u00a0Pioneer Projects RPAS support military and civil activities alike.

Cyber Defence. EDA is developing ad hoc projects in the area of multinational cyber defence training, deployable cyber defence kits for headquarters, and research and technology. The aim is to launch these in autumn 2013, based on the EU Cyber Security Strategy and acknowledging the complementary activities of other actors in cyber defence, including ESA for space segments. To this end, EDA has established liaison arrangements with the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Tallinn. EDA is developing a roadmap for Cyber Defence technologies, closely coordinated with civil cyber security research, to address Member States\u2019 future ad hoc cooperative investments. b)\u00a0Technology Non-Dependence EDA is developing a concept and list of Critical Defence Technologies identifying technologies that should be maintained at European level. Electronic components and new materials are clear examples. European access to critical defence technologies will be key to further securing critical technologies, security of supply and European industry\u2019s competitiveness and innovation. c)\u00a0Action Plan on SMEs SMEs are an important factor for innovation. They are a key enabler of future industrial competiveness: encouraging their ability to access and prosper in the defence market is a priority. EDA work has focused on developing and disseminating best practice. EDA is implementing the SME Action Plan, including how to improve information sharing on business opportunities or facilitating interaction with the European Commission. In this regard, European Structural Funds may be used by Member States to co-fund dual-use activities in Research and Innovation.

Both major European system houses and SME\u2019s participated in the conference and presented their views and proposals for standardisation of land vehicle systems. \u00a0The conference was chaired by the EDA Armaments Director Mr Giampaolo Lillo and co-chaired by the ASD-STAN Director Mr G\u00fcnter Lessmann. The conference underlined the importance of the concept of open standard architecture. This concept offers a high potential for benefits in the competitiveness and strengthening of the European Defence Technology and Industrial Base. Certainly it is not only limited to the area of land vehicle systems, but in particularly this technical domain needs further consolidation and more efficient solutions both among EDA\u2019s Member States and the industry. One conclusion of the conference was therefore to revitalise the Expert Group for Armoured Land Vehicle Technology to identify best practice standard recommendations in this technical domain. The objective will then be to publish these recommendations on the EDA European Defence Standards reference system (EDSTAR) which is a tool to provide both governmental organisations and industry for procurement of Defence material with best practice standards. Of course, it is necessary to meet a consensus among all stakeholders and with EDA's conference a starting point was set for the revival of the technical domain of land vehicles with a successful end to suggest at least for some components of land vehicles best practice recommendations. EDA will take further actions to (re-)open an expert group competent to deliver these best practice recommendations. Furthermore the conference discussions have proven the link between the harmonisation of requirements and the standardisation activities. This underlines EDA\u2019s role in the coordination of standardisation management as the harmonisation of requirements is one of EDA\u2019s core missions. Another aspect highlighted by industry is the need of practical demonstrations (demonstrators) for supporting standardization and proving the concept of a new developed standard. Finally the importance of standardising the test requirements and procedures for the Defence Test and Evaluation Bases (DTEB) was exemplified for the qualification of ammunition.

Already in his introduction he made clear that Pooling & Sharing was not just a buzz word and that pragmatism was the answer to budget restrictions in Member States. Mr Round emphasised that the objective of Pooling & Sharing was to address shortfalls while getting more out of current capabilities and at the same time freeing resources for other activities. While Pooling & Sharing might look easy on paper, it clearly is not. However, the Agency\u2019s work since the endorsement of eleven initial Pooling & Sharing priorities by Defence Ministers in November 2011, has produced concrete results. Mr Round mentioned in his presentation the Agency\u2019s Counter-IED Laboratory as an excellent example of EU/NATO co-operation and of EDA\u2019s support to operations. Other projects with possible benefits to operations are the Agency\u2019s European Satellite Communication Procurement Cell, its helicopter training programme, the Maritime Surveillance network, the field hospitals initiative and its comprehensive work regarding air-to-air refuelling. Regarding the latter, Mr Round emphasised that the Agency was addressing shortfalls as well as fragmentation. Next to these projects, the Agency is also working on improving efficiency. Some examples are its initiatives on diplomatic clearances for transport aircraft or on innovative tools like the Third Party Logistic Support or the Effective Procurement Methods. Finally, Mr Round emphasised the importance of the recently signed Code of Conduct on Pooling & Sharing as an important signal of increased will to cooperate. \u00a0 More information: Presentation by Peter Round (Pooling & Sharing Annual Conference 2013) Pooling & Sharing factsheet European Defence Matters: summary\u00a0 Alan Shatter: Speech EDA Conference Speech\u00a0by Herman Van Rompuy, Council President Speech\u00a0by Catherine Ashton, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs & Security Policy, Vice-President of the European Commission and Head of the European Defence Agency Welcome\u00a0by Claude-France Arnould Pictures on\u00a0Flickr Event summary on\u00a0Storify Video report on YouTube ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/03/26/pooling-sharing-early-results-for-operations"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0828", "date": "2013-03-26", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "European Framework Cooperation: First Achievements for CBRN", "text": " On 13 March 2013 the European Commission and the European Defence Agency co-organised a workshop on European Framework Cooperation (EFC) CBRN in Madrid as part of the EC Security Research Event included in HOMSEC 2013. The focus of the workshop was to brief participants on \u00a0the first achievements of the EFC CBRN and the way ahead based upon the lessons learned.\u00a0Mr Marco Malacarne (EC) and Mr Christian Breant (EDA) opened the workshop and gave an introduction on EFC CBRN as the first pilot under EFC. They concluded that it has been successful so far. Co-chairs Tristan Simonart (EC) and Gerlof de Wilde (EDA) elaborated on results out of the exchange of letters signed between the EC and the EDA on 15 Sept 2011. Coordination has been covering several aspects related to:\u00a0 the preparation of research activities (i.e. calls for proposals) the evaluation of the proposals and the implementation of research activities Shared meetings and exchange of information Since 2011, EC and EDA are participating to respective programme management committees meetings (SEC programme Committee and\u00a0 EDA JIP CBRN Management Committee). They regularly exchange information on on-going and future activities.\u00a0EDA expert(s) were involved (access to proposal, consensus meetings and panel meeting) in CBRN proposals evaluations under FP7SEC-2011 and FP7-SEC-2012. They have been invited for the next evaluation FP7-SEC-2013.\u00a0EC expert(s) were involved (access to proposal, consensus meeting and panel meeting) in evaluation of the first JIP CBRN call in Sept 2012.\u00a0EC is invited to the Executive Management Groups (EMG) of the JIP CBRN projects.\u00a0EDA is participating in several FP7 projects advisory groups. Transfer and re-use of results In the frame of the EFC, several projects have established links and have considered transfer or re-use of available results.\u00a0EFC has contributed to synchronise research priorities for 2012 respective calls, taking into account areas and topics covered by each funding schemes, with a particular influence on the content of the first JIP CBRN call. JIP CBRN as EDA contribution to EFC The JIP CBRN is a managed as an EDA Category A Programme and has a budget of 12 Million Euro. Contributing members are Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Sweden and Norway. The JIP-CBRN provides a broad framework to conduct cooperative research in the fields of basic and applied science, to carry technology development up to the level of demonstration projects. The first call for proposals under the EFC was launched on 2 May 2012. The first call included the following topics: Improved Standoff detection of C agents Simultaneous analysis of CBR agents (mixed samples) Next generation point detection for B agents M&S of CBRN system architectures The first Call for proposals has resulted in 7 selected projects. Contracts are underway. Future of the EFC CBRN The second JIP CBRN call is scheduled for 2013 (under preparation with the participation of the EC). It will include the following topics: Next generation personal protection Next generation collective protection Next generation Decontamination CBRN Sensor-networking Under Horizon 2020 the cooperation on CBRN research will remain and will probably be reinforced.\u00a0Work must be done in the area of IPR and user rights as the frameworks of EDA and EC differ in this respect. \u00a0 CBRN CIV/MIL synergies addressed by workshop speakers The workshop speakers addressed several synergies between civilian and military research in CBRN protection: Dr Blatny (FFI, Norway) highlighted the standardisation efforts within FP7 projects SLAM and EQUATOX and the JIP CBRN project BFREE on CBRN sample handing.\u00a0Mrs Patricia Lopez Vicente and prof Lourdes Calvo Garrido addressed CIV/MIL synergies in Spanish research related to cleaning and decontamination technologies.\u00a0Prof Jean Luc Gala gave a presentation regarding the CIV/MIL aspects of research on contagious diseases / B threat agents. He presented an ESA project on Mobile Labs. He proposed a European Cluster of Excellence for CBRN.\u00a0Dr Ruud Busker presented the JIP CBRN project IPODS, addressing the challenge of point Detection for B threats by using a combination of technologies such as Mass spectroscopy and fast Immunological Identification.

The European Council will discuss defence topics during its December 2013 summit; conference speakers and delegates agreed that this meeting will have to take critical decisions on finance and empowering European institutions to speed initiatives such as Pooling & Sharing if Europe is to meet its defence and security commitments. But the gap between the political rhetoric on cooperation and the speed with which it is being introduced by national administrations was a key feature of the\u00a0 debate at the EDA annual conference, entitled \u201cEuropean Defence Matters.\u201d\u00a0 Capability gap \u201cWe face critical capability gaps,\u201d according to Cathy Ashton, head of the EDA, who underlined what could be done through successful EU cooperation in defence. She also mentioned the efforts of EU operations, such as seeing piracy drop by 95% over the last three years in Somalia, while over 3,000 Somali troops have been trained. \u201cIf current trends continue by 2017 we risk losing 17% of the European expenditures since the economic crisis started,\u201d said Mr Van Rompuy, President of the European Council. It was a strong message echoed by many speakers, with serious consequences for the European defence industrial base. \u201cMy main concern is not so much CSDP as such or \u201cEU defence\u201d, but rather the state of defence in Europe. That's how Presidents and Prime Ministers look at these issues together\u201d declared President Van Rompuy. \u201cThe same goes for their joint responsibility for our continent's defence; there also, decisions in one country, will affect others. There is too little public awareness of this, and in that respect precisely, Presidents and Prime Ministers are uniquely placed to convince a wider public opinion, and thereby to set things into motion. (\u2026) Upon receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo last December, [European leaders] said the European Union stands by those in pursuit of peace and human dignity. To fulfil such responsibilities, we should make sure we have the means at our disposal.\u201d \u201cFor the defence dimension of our discussion in December, for me the important thing is to make concrete progress on three key issues: (1) priorities for future investment and equipment procurement; (2) strengthening our industrial base, so that it remains competitive and innovative; (3) and finally, the preparation and availability of forces.\u201d stated the President of the European Union. Industrial base According to Tom Enders, Chief Executive of EADS, unless serious action is taken Europe risks losing key elements of its defence industrial base as skilled personnel either leave or transfer to civil industry. \u201cWe are facing a challenge of political drift,\u201d said Mr Enders, \u201cit is unlikely that EADS which was formed in 1999 could be created in 2013.\u201d \u201cThe biggest threat to European defence today is shrinking budgets. We need some light from Heads of States.\u201d said Mr Danjean. So what are the options? According to Claude France Arnould, Chief Executive of the EDA it would be unrealistic to expect a 20% increase in the budget of the EDA - but if more Member States came forward to support \u00a0individual Pooling & Sharing programmes that would be an excellent start. \u00a0\u201cMoney is not just the only sign of support,\u201d said Ms Arnould. \u00a0 Concurring with Tom Enders saying that more money should be given to EDA, Mr Klich, Senator of the Republic of Poland and former Minister of Defence also stated \u201cBut I have doubts about the current budget of the EDA\u201d, suggesting that as the EDA was the only European organisation actively working to increase defence cooperation it would need more resources to undertake its role. Success in cooperation Many speakers pointed out some of the success stories of what has been achieved through cooperation in recent years. General de Rousiers, Chairman of the Military Committee of the EU, gave the example of the European air transport command which had been created in a relatively short time and the working being undertaken to exploit civil observation satellite assets for military operations. \u201cPooling & Sharing is one of the greatest European defence achievements of the last two to three years,\u201d said Mr Klich. The priorities for European defence leaders were also discussed \u2013 Mr Missiroli, Director of the European Institute for Security Studies suggested these were securing the European homeland, securing the European neighbouring areas, securing global commerce and ensuring access to energy. Delegates also discussed the \u201cquick wins\u201d which the European Council could sanction such as improving military access to space resources, coordinating cyber defence activities, opening access to remotely piloted air systems (RPAS) in the European sky and developing air to air capabilities through Pooling & Sharing. \u201cCooperation between NATO ACT and EDA is essential and well-functioning\u201d said General Palomeros, NATO\u2019s Supreme Allied Commander Transformation. \u201cThere is a pressing need to balance defence commitments from both sides of the Atlantic, and European partners will need to deliver their full share in capabilities.\u201d In some areas, such as developing a single European requirement for an RPAS MALE system, European defence departments have already missed the boat, but in others, such as the A400M military transport, consolidated capability requirements had delivered positive results. But not all European states faced the same problems. Mr Krystowski, CEO of Poland\u2019s BUMAR group clearly said some states in central and Eastern Europe had different defence priorities to those in the West and a more vibrant economy which should be taken into account. Task force on defence A critical input into the Council\u2019s meeting later this year will come from the European Commission\u2019s task force looking at bolstering the continent\u2019s defence industrial and technological sector. Mr Calleja, Director General of the Enterprise and Industry Directorate General of the European Commission underlined some of the priorities already identified by the task force, including enhancing the common security and defence policy, building a strong industrial base, strengthening the internal defence market, developing an industrial base to include SMEs and their access to finance and improving R&T levels of funding. Another priority was energy conservation. \u201cEurope\u2019s military spends around \u20ac1 billion a year on energy,\u201d he said, \u201cthe same as a small European state.\u201d\u00a0 Despite the problems the EDA has made significant progress over the last year in meeting capability gaps through Pooling & Sharing, said Peter Round, Director Capabilities at the agency. Ten Member States are now working on a joint procurement programme to acquire urgently needed air-to-air refuelling assets in the long-term. A further procurement initiative was underway to access satellite communications services from the civil sector for a range of operational needs. Another multi-national initiative has been launched to provide medical hospitals for troops in the field. \u201cWe must now close the gap between rhetoric and reality\u201d concluded Claude-France Arnould.\u00a0 More information: Speech\u00a0by Herman Van Rompuy, Council President Speech\u00a0by Catherine Ashton, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs & Security Policy, Vice-President of the European Commission and Head of the European Defence Agency.

It is one that is wholly appropriate as the defence community prepares for Heads of States and Government discussing defence topics at the European Council at the end of the year, and beyond. This conference will serve as an important platform to prepare and shape that key event. The European Defence Agency\u2019s mission is to support Member States in their efforts to develop military capabilities as well as to enhance European cooperation in Research &Technology (R&T) . What is of key importance for me is that the Agency is at the service of European Member States, including when it comes to current or future operations. When in November 2011 Defence Ministers approved eleven Pooling & Sharing priorities, they sent a clear signal that, in times of austerity, complex operations and highly advanced technology, acting together is essential if Europe is to preserve and develop the capabilities it requires. The Agency\u2019s Pooling & Sharing projects on Air-to-Air Refuelling and satellite communications are but two examples. Their relevance was demonstrated during the Libya operation; and reconfirmed more recently in Mali. The Air-to-Air Refuelling initiative has four work-strands to take care of short-, mid- and long-term solutions. Ten Member States have agreed to work together to acquire new tanker aircraft. And in the short\u2013term, we will soon see an EDA-organised clearance campaign for Italian tankers to refuel other European aircraft. In the area of satellite communications, we have launched a procurement cell, which allows contributing Member States to benefit from commonly procured communication capacity. The cell can \u2013 and indeed shortly will \u2013 be used during operations to facilitate access to this scarce resource. The Agency is also examining longer-term activities in this domain, for example through the Pooling & Sharing of future governmental satellite communication assets. Today, we will look at lessons from past cooperative projects, at the longer-term goals, and at what new impulses are required to achieve them. Synergies between civil and military actors are cornerstones of future success. The EU needs to mobilise the instruments available through the full range of its policies. Today we are extending the EU\u2019s Comprehensive Approach into the area of capabilities. But political will at the highest level is essential. Success will require the active involvement of those who are responsible for providing our soldiers with the necessary capabilities: capabilities encompassing not only equipment, but also training,\u00a0 employment and logistic support. We need a cutting-edge industry to support our defence, our innovation, our growth and our security of supply. That is why particular attention to European industrial and technological potential is vital in this time of financial austerity. Industry needs the oxygen of a well-functioning market. But it also needs programmes, today and in the future. Industry also has a central role to play in providing solutions through cooperation. To conclude, success will require political will, engagement by national defence administrations, and the involvement of industry. We are therefore honoured to have gathered here today key players from the EU, from government, the military and industry. We look forward to your discussions. I am confident that they will provide direction to and indeed inspire our work.

The EDA-Egmont PhD Prize in European defence, security and strategy is intended to encourage and stimulate European research in the context of European defence and security. The award targets the findings of research that have been carried out in the framework of a defended and approved doctoral thesis at a recognised academic institution in a Member State of the European Defence Agency. The Prize is awarded by the EDA in partnership with the Egmont Institute. The aim is to introduce a new award that acknowledges academic excellence while putting it in a European context. The unique partnership enables Egmont to ensure academic substance while the European Defence Agency exposes the research to the heart of European policy making. The jury of the EDA-Egmont Prize, composed of Claude-France Arnould, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency (EDA), General Patrick de Rousiers, Chairman of the EU Military Committee (EUMC), Dr Antonio Missiroli, Director of the EU Institute of Security Studies (EUISS), Prof. Jolyon Howorth, University of Yale, Prof. Richard Whitman, University of Kent, Dr Hilmar Linnenkamp, Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik, and chaired by Prof. Sven Biscop, Egmont, had a difficult task assessing no less than ten PhD dissertations of high quality, but arrived at an unanimous decision. The jury especially commends Dr Pohl\u2019s work for asking a \u201ckey question\u201d about the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), and answering it in a very persuasive manner. His findings are presented with admirable control and academic objectivity, giving full weight to a range of theoretical approaches in order to test their validity.

Resilient Threat Management 2013 \u2013 a partnership between the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union and the EDA \u2013aimed at taking stock of all the efforts to date dedicated to Countering Improvised Explosive Devices (C-IED) while pointing the direction to the future. IEDs have existed for hundreds of years and there is a consensus that they will continue to exist for many more years to come. What complicates things is that they are employed by networks adversaries that range from terrorists to organised criminals affecting both the European homeland as well as crisis zones around the world. Each of these adversary networks have an agenda and employ IEDs along with other types of asymmetric methods to achieve their goals, with no consideration to civilian bi-standers. The consequences are heartbreaking tragedies. Resilient Threat Management 2013 saw experts come together for two days to share information, experiences and ideas on how to take C-IED to the next phase. At the end of current operations, the fight against IEDs will continue but in a different way. Experts delved into the overarching strategic aspects as well as discussing the future of specifics such as forensic exploitation \u2013 its dual-use nature and its role as the hub for intelligence building, evidence gathering and for technology development. Scientists provided further insights into novel approaches to defeating the network, detection technologies, neutralisation techniques and deployable forensics. The third and final day brought decision-makers to the table. With Professor Sven Biscop (Egmont Institute) addressing the EU\u2019s role in future crisis management, Dr Jamie SHEA (NATO) spoke about the complexities of asymmetric warfare. A panel with representatives from the IHS, EU Military Staff, Irish Defence Forces, Guardia Civil and RUSI then addressed what threat management needs to be like beyond 2020. A second panel with representatives FRIDE, EDA, FBI, An Garda Siochana, EUROPOL and OSCE explored how we can solidify inter-institutional cooperation platforms, within Europe and also outside. Ciaran Murphy (Irish Department of Defence) addressed the need for the EU to mirror President Barak Obama\u2019s recent C-IED policy statement. Peter Round and Graham Muir (EDA) spoke about EDA\u2019s role in developing a comprehensive strategy for Member States in partnership with other institutions in order to establish a vehicle for ensuring that we are prepared to tackle the evolving threats in a resilient manner. Many lives have been lost in combating the IEDs. Many more lives have been lost in relearning how to combat IEDs. We cannot afford to repeat this learning process costing more lives. Resilient Threat Management 2013 has shown that there is a will among experts, decision makers, Member States and institutions to work together and to build on the current momentum. The fight against the IED needs to continue. It must, however, do so as part of a comprehensive approach to managing the evolution of asymmetric threats and their networks. Preparedness and resilience are key to success.

The trial is part of EDA\u2019s efforts to address Europe\u2019s AAR capability shortfall. Mandated by Defence Ministers in March 2012, EDA is engaged in four work strands to increase the European AAR capability: short-term gap filling, optimisation of existing assets and organisation, optimisation of AAR capacity offered by the future A400M fleet as well as the long-term enhancement of Europe\u2019s strategic tanker capability. Aerial Refuelling Clearance As a mean to increase the number of AAR clearances for receivers and hereby more efficiently pool & share European aerial refueling capabilities, EDA together with the Movement Coordination Centre Europe and Italy organise a two weeks collective AAR clearance campaign on the recently fielded Italian KC767 aircraft. During the trial, interested Member States will be able to perform the necessary ground and in-flight tests to\u00a0 obtain missing AAR clearances. So far, 10 nations have expressed interest in participating in the trial. Urgency AAR clearances are a prerequisite to interoperability in multinational operations. Europe can today deploy 42 tanker aircraft of ten different types and more than 40% of required clearances are missing. While for critical requirements and war-time operations clearances limited to a specific operation can be issued on a case by case basis, EDA\u2019s initiative will allow for a coordinated approach for full and unlimited clearances. This will increase the flexibility of AAR operations and facilitate immediate deployment of assets in future. Background AAR is a critical enabler for air power projection and it is required to enable anything beyond short range air combat operations. A unique force multiplier, it is a fundamental capability embedded in modern aircraft design, not just in combat aircraft, but across the full spectrum of air platforms \u2013 including in the near future Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. European armed forces rely substantively on American assets. This was originally demonstrated in the Kosovo Campaign, and the increased reliance on the US was a lesson from operations over Libya.

The conference attracted an international panel of speakers, clearly illustrating one of the key messages - the need of international cooperation and sharing of information. Belgium\u2019s Minister of Defence, Pieter De Crem, then rightly took on this requirement in his speech \"Key International Challenges for Cooperation and Coordination against Cyber Attacks\". Representatives of the European Defence Agency, as a facilitator of cooperation among European member states, had been invited to speak. In the morning and afternoon sessions of the second day, EU institutions were able to deliver a taste of how much interrelation and coordination has developed since Cyber Security has been put on a joint agenda. European Framework Cooperation Marco Malacarne, Head of Security Research and Industry at DG Enterprise and Industry of the European Commission, started with introducing some Cyber research projects funded under the Security Programme of the EU Framework Programme 7, and giving an outlook on the next framework programme called Horizon 2020. He explained how the European Commission, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Defence Agency (EDA) coordinate their research efforts under the European Framework Cooperation (EFC). Michael Sieber, Assistant R&T Director at EDA, summarised the key messages from a joint EFC workshop organised in Brussels on 23 October 2012. There, a top-class panel of speakers, mainly from academia, shared their views on future research priorities. Cyber\u00a0 Security requires a multidisciplinary approach - it is not only technology. Service and product providers need incentives for more security and safety, to be integrated already by design, and they need to be more competitive. Among the users, higher level of security and safety awareness\u00a0 is required. Finally, specific profiles of Security and Defence will prompt more robust resilience, with specific technologies for detection, reaction, prevention/protection. In this respect, EDA will contribute to the EFC by its Cyber Defence Research Agenda, currently being established. EDA Progress Air Commodore Peter Round, EDA Capability Director, explained the exceptional progress the Agency has made, supported by a project team of 23 Member States' delegates, on a considerable portfolio of initiatives, such as stock-taking, training, conceptual work and intelligence. The EU circle of presentations was completed by Victoria Baines, Strategic Advisor on Cyber Crime from the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) in The Hague. The show room offered newest Cyber technology presented by a number of exhibitors, and occassions for interesting discussions. Parallel to this IQPC conference in London, Cyber Security/Defence conferences took place in Lille and Brussels around the same dates, with EDA invited to all of them. EDA R&T Director Christian Br\u00e9ant addressed strategic technological issues in a high level industrial policy panel of the 5\u00e8me Forum International de la cybers\u00e9curit\u00e9 (FIC 2013) co-organised by the French Gendarmerie Nationale, R\u00e9gion Nord-Pas-de-Calais and CEIS.

The realistic operational requirements for a soldier\u2019s Health Monitoring System (HMS) were identified with the involvement of participating Member States (pMS), European Union Military Staff (EUMS) and EDA experts in March 2012. The Demonstration Phase was performed in September 2012 at Sagem\u2019s Development Centre of Massy in France and included laboratory and operational tests. This study has allowed identifying the operational requirements for a HMS integrated in a Soldier\u2019s Combat system. The analysis also assessed data and information needed for both medical and command chains in operational situations. With limited improvements and integration efforts, current technologies and systems could be effectively used in training missions in the shorter term.

This brings the total number of airworthiness documents now published on the EDA website to seven. In November 2008, the EDA Steering Board entrusted the EDA with the establishment of a Military Airworthiness Authorities (MAWA) Forum and approved the associated military airworthiness roadmap for achieving common harmonisation and certification processes. The harmonisation of military airworthiness regulations is a strategic decision for improving European armaments co-operation, enhancing the competitiveness of the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base and improving cohesion between joint military-military and civil-military airworthiness regulations. Participating Member States all have their own national-specific systems to manage the airworthiness of their military aircraft. However, until the formation of the EDA MAWA Forum, there has been very little coordination between European States. The implementation of the harmonised European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) into national regulations will address this lack of cohesion.

Current operations have taught EDA Member States about modern warfare and forced them to adapt. Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) symbolise this change in mind set. In some ways primitive, but when put in the context of a network that ensures funding, manufacturing, distribution and emplacement, they have repeatedly proven their effectiveness against forces designed for the Cold War as well as their ruthlessness against bystanders. But what lies ahead at home and in theatre? A few trends can be observed that hint on in which direction operations are heading. Future deployed operations may no longer be large land based, airborne or naval units working together to achieve a desired end state. Instead focus is more likely to be on gathering intelligence to support specific low level operations with the aim of arresting suspects and securing evidence in order to bring them to justice, avoiding to the use of force.\u00a0 To achieve this, a number of different actors are likely to be involved, beyond the military. Operations are likely to continue to be exposed to public scrutiny via media, requiring full transparency and accountability to governance and legislation. However militaries will be required to retain their ability to act as a deterrent to other states and thus need to be able to manage both ends of the conflict spectrum. Being prepared requires having in place capabilities that can tackle a number of conventional and asymmetric threats, not only IEDs. Drawing on civil-military synergies to maximise the availability of effective and resilient capabilities could provide solutions. The Conference pinnacle is the High Level Day, during which senior decision makers from Governments, EU institutions, international organisations as well as academia to discuss how threats are likely to evolve and how we can ensure a sufficient level or preparedness for future operations. The High Level Day will be preceded by an Expert Conference where accepted papers will be presented on specific areas such as forensics, detection, training and search. A Government-only Seminar will focus on the story so far with regard to the role of exploitation past, present and future.

NATO Exploitation Level Two for C-IED requires intermediate processing of information in theatre for investigation of IED events. This implies a forward deployed asset with sufficient capacity to deal with a wide variety of data input and a team of specialists to analyse, interpret and disseminate the product derived from such investigation. That is exactly what the EDA laboratory, built by Indra in Spain, has provided for the Multinational TEL (MN TEL) deployed last year. The laboratory was deployed to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) theatre of operations under the management of France, which assumed Lead Nation responsibility for the project. Captain Jean-Charles Dhyser of the French corps of military engineers was tasked by the Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019Armement (DGA - France\u2019s defence procurement management authority) with overseeing the development of the laboratory in collaboration with the EDA. Once deployed, he acted in the capacity of technical advisor and EOD expert to the commander of the MN TEL. Long-term engagement \u201cIt is important to note that this is a long term project and what we have deployed so far is just a trial version. Nevertheless, we have managed a marriage of all the principles involved and can already identify at least five individuals who have been caught making IEDs as a result of the TEL\u2019s activity. Which is what this project is all about \u2013 the ultimate objective is the saving of lives,\u201d he said. The laboratory itself, consisting of a number of standard ISO containers jammed with equipment, provides a wide range of facilities for the gathering of IED event-related information and the processing of that information into actionable intelligence for use by local commanders. In addition to photographic facilities and what Dhyser calls a \u201ctriage and security\u201d functionality, the TEL consists of four main modules: biometric analysis (latent finger print recovery) electrical circuitry (primarily radio parts); media recovery (focused on the mobile phones often used as IED triggering devices); and chemical analysis. \u201cEvery explosive has a chemical signature, identification of which is extremely useful,\u201d said Dhyser. Level Two accreditation Level Two accreditation of the laboratory is a major step forward. \u201cThis gives us the capability for a more comprehensive and rapid analysis after an IED event and enables us to develop intelligence that allows us to get inside the enemy\u2019s decision chain \u2013 it\u2019s really about entering the mindset of the terrorist and interrupting his production process; being able to take action before the next event,\u201d he said. Very few nations have a Level Two capability at the moment \u2013 the United States and United Kingdom foremost among them \u2013 so the development of a European TEL is an extremely important asset. In a novel approach to pooling and sharing, the EDA\u2019s approach to the MN TEL was to manage the project through its own operational budget and to procure the asset for use by any participating Member State (pMS). Although France, as lead nation, was joined by Austria, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Romania and Poland in directly supporting the project, any pMS can request deployment of the TEL, conditional on its accepting responsibility as lead nation for the deployment period. Comprehensive and rapid analysis The major advantages of the MN TEL, according to Dhyser, are the features of \u201cportability and above all flexibility \u2013 the ability to develop and disseminate information in a very short period of time.\u201d The rapid nature of activity is not limited to the operational level, however: the speed with which the procurement and deployment process is quite impressive, even by comparison with other urgent operational requirements (UOR) coming from the Afghan theatre of operations. \u201cThis was true de facto collaboration and we were able to contribute significantly to the activities of Combined Joint Task Force Paladin in areas not covered by purely national assets,\u201d said Antoine Torres, spokesman for the DGA. He adds that some of the immediate results of the initial deployment point to the \u201ctrue benefits stemming from combining national technological capabilities with an international team of experts and a secure working environment.\u201d Having analysts on the spot, from a variety of nations, with different but complimentary experience and a depth of knowledge that can be applied to a situation as it evolves, rather than at the end of a long communication chain back to a laboratory in mainland Europe, has already proven to be an asset worth every cent of the funding that has gone into making the TEL demonstrator available for operations.\u00a0 More information For more information on the EDA's Counter-IED work, go to the project\u00a0page.\u00a0 ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2013/01/07/counter-ied-lab-saves-lives-in-afghanistan"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0860", "date": "2012-12-21", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "European Initiatives in the Maritime Environment", "text": " Under the auspices of the Cyprus EU Presidency, the European Defence Agency together with the Cypriot Ministry of Defence organised a seminar on European initiatives in the maritime environment on 18 and 19 October. The seminar aimed at highlighting the need to address the future capacity of Europe to act, taking into account the requirement for appropriate maritime assets within the current financial climate and the need for identification of civil-military synergies. Maritime security and defence is of high importance for Europe as highlighted by the Council conclusions on Maritime Security Strategy (26 April 2010) and the Commission\u2019s Green paper \u201cTowards a future Maritime Policy for the Union\u201d (7 June 2006). Maritime Security could be considered as three separate pillars of knowledge, regulations and capacity to act. In the opening speech of the seminar, Mr Demetris Eliades, Cyprus Minister of Defence, highlighted Cyprus\u2019 aim to contribute towards the maintenance of safe navigation, the protection of sea-lines and maritime transportation, in order to enhance security, which would allow maritime nations to make the best use of their maritime wealth and capacities. During the seminar, discussions focused on a strategic approach in the maritime security domain and several supportive actions were presented.

Italy, Poland and Spain contribute to this three-year, 4.17 M\u20ac project. The contract was awarded to an industry consortium led by Politecnico di Milano. The research project will focus on the development of a reliable methodology for the application of a Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system on an aerodyne (rotor and fixed-wing platforms) structure. ASTYANAX represents an important follow-on of the HECTOR project from the ICET programme (Innovative Concept and Emerging Technologies), which concluded at the end of 2011 with very interesting and useful results. HECTOR developed a preliminary SHM methodology for metallic helicopter structures.\u00a0 The current ASTYANAX project involves the following partners: From Italy: POLIMI (Politecnico di Milano, consortium leader), ALENIA Aermacchi, AgustaWestland. From Poland: AFIT (Air Force Institute of Technology), MAW1 (Military Aviation Works No. 1) , AGH (University of Science and Technology). From Spain: INTA (Instituto Nacional de T\u00e9cnica Aeroespacial).\u00a0 Next steps The first step proposed in ASTYANAX is to apply the developed methodology and the experience acquired in HECTOR to a large scale helicopter platform .. The results from HECTOR have so far only be tested and demonstrated on simple test beds. The main objective is to examine the possibility, and assess the requirements, to extend the HECTOR methodology to an air-vehicle fuselage, considering a rotary wing system (Mi-8/17 helicopter) as air-vehicle type. Given the input extension for SHM application on air-vehicle environments, the next step will be to directly apply a validated SHM device to a real platform: the helicopter Mi-8/17 Hip. This platform has been already identified by Poland (and shared by other partners) as suitable system for ASTYANAX\u2019s scope. Inside this platform the aim is to concentrate the attention on a real component, critical for maintenance procedures and, at the same time, available for device testing and development without interfering with safety parameters. After a preliminary analysis to identify the most suitable component/part, the attention will be focused on a particular structural section defined according to the criticalities identified through the end-user experience in damage occurrences. Moreover, the use of non-electrical sensors will be analysed in details representing an additional clear step further of HECTOR. The effective output of the research will be: an increase in knowledge needed to pass from a simple methodology (HECTOR) to solve the problems linked to a real application; a deep analysis of different types of sensor useful for the SHM application, with particular attention on Fiber Bragg optical sensors and non-electrical devices; a general development of a structural assessment of a helicopter fuselage through the use of Finite Elements models combined with damage characterization; a creation of a reliable database regarding the damage types and location occurred in the helicopter fleet during the past activities and registered during the maintenance operations. These outputs will permit to design a device, including both the hardware and the software, obtained through coupling the usage of Finite Elements Modelling for basic knowledge generation with advanced algorithms for structural diagnosis and prognosis. The purpose of ASTYANAX is to acquire an elevated Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for SHM systems (up to 5-6). \u00a0 \u00a0 ASTYANAX: from model to reality ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/12/13/eda-kicks-off-aircraft-structural-health-monitoring-project"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0862", "date": "2012-12-07", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ICAR Research Project: Inspection Robot Wins EUREKA Silver Medal", "text": " The inspection robot DROMADER was awarded a silver medal in the EUREKA competition, carried out in the margins of the 2012 INNOVA Brussels World Exhibition on inventions, research and new technologies.\u00a0 The robotic vehicle had been developed by the Polish Military University (MUT) in Warsaw under the EDA project \u201cIntelligent Control of Adversary Radio (ICAR).

Young researchers who have recently completed their PhD thesis are encouraged to participate in the competition. The award? A financial remuneration and especially the chance for the winner to present the results of his/her research during the EDA annual conference in March 2013 in front of the European defence community.\u00a0Dinesh Rempling, EDA Project Officer, in charge of the Prize explains the aims and background of the Prize. \u200b1. Dinesh, why another PhD prize? While PhD prizes exist across the world, they are often either linked to academic institutions or societies. Some of the prizes have an international flavour but none are specifically targeting a European audience. Filling this gap will strengthen European research in defence, security and strategy. Moreover the hope is that it will encourage a new generation of scholars to continue to push the boundaries, helping shape better and more effective European policies.\u00a0 2. Why do the Egmont Institute and the EDA cooperate? As it so happened EDA and Egmont Institute were thinking the same thing at the same time. It is the ideal complementary partnership in many ways. Being an agency under the Council framework, EDA is very close to the heart of EU decision-making. In fact EDA is run by a Steering Board consisting of Defence Ministers from twenty-six EU Member States and chaired by Baroness Catherine Ashton (Head of the Agency, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice President of the European Commission). Egmont Institute on the other hand is in the forefront of research in defence, security and strategy. As such it come with a pan-European network of academic excellence. The EDA-Egmont partnership is fortunate enough to be completed by a Prize Jury of brilliant minds. All Members come with a wealth of experience, each covering a different angle of defence, security and strategy \u2013 this is what boosts the essence of the Prize. Together the Jury Members will be able to objectively evaluate the quality and impact of the candidates\u2019 achievements. 3. Who should participate? Anybody can submit their candidacy for the Prize. The more applicants there are the merrier because the ambition is to award outstanding work and the more there is the to choose from the likelier it is that exceptional achievements surface. Some basic provisions need to be met: the need to be a national of an EDA Member State, the PhD must have been awarded by an academic institution in an EDA Member State and the thesis needs to be available in English. Other than that there are no restrictions so long the substance of the thesis addresses one or more aspects of defence, security and strategy. The Prize itself comes with a number of perks. Apart from the prestige, there is a generous financial contribution to look forward to. Furthermore the successful candidate will speak in front of an international audience of senior decision-makers at the EDA Annual Conference on 21 March 2013. In addition the winner will be offered the opportunity to publish the key findings of the thesis in the form of a book!

This act formally transitioned the HEP to a Category B programme, where twelve nations commit their crews and helicopters to a ten-year programme, a concrete indication that training together is an integral part of enhancing European capability and interoperability. \u00a0 Originally part of the Helicopter Training Programme (HTP) concept, \u00a0approved at the Ministerial Steering Board in November 2009, the HEP aims to provide a framework to Member States to allow them to develop, consolidate and share best practices to meet the challenges of flying helicopters in the modern operational environment, helping to mitigate the risks and successfully complete their mission. The HEP is built on three main pillars: 1. Exercises Five exercises have so far been delivered under the umbrella of the EDA. These exercises met the urgent training requirements for the participating Member States (pMS) and greatly enhanced the helicopter capability available. To date, 14 pMS have actively taken part with another three sending observers. \u00a0A total of 123 helicopters, 794 aircrew nearly 5000 support personnel \u00a0have deployed to the exercises which were held in France, Spain, Italy, Portugal and Belgium. \u00a0 2. Symposia Beside the exercises, an integral part of the HEP is the Helicopter Tactics Symposium which has now been held three times in Luxembourg. It is designed to allow our helicopter crews to share experiences, gain knowledge of the current threats they face and to discuss the tactics, techniques and procedures. 3. Core Planning Team (CPT) In order to ensure coherence and continuity of the programme, a CPT of two personnel has been appointed. Sharing \u00a0the office with the EDA Helicopter Programme Officers, together they form the EDA helicopter team within Capabilities Directorate. The CPT is managed through the EDA Helicopter Project Manager, ensuring that the knowledge and experience gained so far transitions into this programme. The CPT will be tasked by the Management Committee formed by the representatives of the contributing Member States (cMS). The main tasks are to assist host nations in the delivery of exercises and take any lessons identified and integrate them into future exercises.

Military and civil emergency management planners face a significant and constantly evolving threat with the potential terrorist use of chemical, biological and radiological weapons. Detection and identification of agents \u2013 quickly and efficiently, to allow incident commanders to take appropriate remedial action \u2013 is the basis of efficient defence in this domain. And the EDA has responded by generating a multinational research and technology programme aimed at making that easier. As a paradigm for pooling and sharing of knowledge, the current category A programme for CBRN technologies is a four-year, \u20ac12 million joint investment project aimed at examining and evaluating the next generation of technologies for detection and identification of chemical, biological and similar threats \u2013 in both military and civil environments. The project has been running since 2010 and is moving rapidly towards its second highly active phase. Alignment with European Commission \u201cWe are aiming far beyond the current status quo \u2013 for the next generation of technologies,\u201d said Gerlof De Wilde, EDA\u2019s Assistant Director for Research and Technology and the programme\u2019s project manager, adding that this means harnessing and deploying technologies beyond the 2015 timeframe. Although on the surface the programme differs little from other research and technology (R&T) projects in the Agency\u2019s remit, in fact there are some characteristics of the CBRN joint investment programme that set it apart. \u201cOne of the specific characteristics of this project is that we are aligning our work with that of the European Commission in this area,\u201d said De Wilde. Cooperation with the European Commission\u2019s framework research programme has focused on detection and identification of chemical and biological agents and should empower better use of resources which will inevitably lead to more far-reaching results, in De Wilde\u2019s view. \u201cWe have agreed the objectives and procedures \u2013 this is the first mature action in which we have done this \u2013 have been involved in joint workshops and are conducting joint evaluation at every stage,\u201d he said. Broad involvement of Member States The Agency\u2019s programme is thus being supported by 13 member states \u2013 Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, France, Spain, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Sweden and Norway. The first call for proposals resulted in 22 separate submissions being made from industry, academia and research institutes, which are now being evaluated with contracts to be let before the end of this year, according to De Wilde. The first call focused on technologies for detection and identification, modelling and simulation of CBRN architectures and methodologies for handling a broad spectrum of unknown samples, an area in which De Wilde says there is a significant capability gap. The second call for proposals, due to take place in the spring of 2013, will focus on next generation decontamination for personal and collective protection. Nations have serious concerns about the need for adequate detection and diagnostic capabilities for potential CBRN threats. Although over 150 nations subscribe to treaties governing the non-proliferation of such weapons, there are significant evolving threats involving non-state actors. \"After all, terrorists (for example) don't care about treaties,\" said De Wilde. Combined with the effects of budget constraints and pressure on limited resources, these concerns mean that an opportunity to pool and share in the development of a next generation response to these threats is attractive to many nations. Technical challenges The technical challenges are complex. Detection needs to be quick, accurate and tied to a fast-time simulation model which can assess the spread of the threat in a given environment. The result is that the next generation of detection technologies will feature a high degree of automation. The capability to evaluate mixed samples is something that simply does not exist in a robust format today, according to De Wilde. Improvements in modelling and simulation \u2013 in which the Agency has proposed use of software it developed under the BIOEDEP programme \u2013 will also provide CBRN professionals with vastly improved capability.\u00a0 In a challenging and politically sensitive area of research and technology, EDA\u2019s CBRN programme is resonating with a broad spectrum of community members. Perhaps the single most important outcome to date, however, has been the recognition of the benefits accruing to contributing members, especially from the collaboration with non-military research with the European Commission. \u201cWe have become part of a broader family with this project and it promises to become a true generator of useful and exploitable knowledge,\u201d said De Wilde.

The EATC is a multinational command, established on 1 September 2010 by the Netherlands, France, Belgium and Germany to pool and share national military assets. Luxembourg joined the EATC as fifth nation on 22nd November 2012. Earlier this year, Spain had also expressed its interest in joining the EATC. The Command plans, tasks and controls the missions of major parts of the air transport- and air-to-air refuelling fleets of the member states (almost 150 aircraft). Additionally, the EATC bears a nationally defined level of responsibility for aircrew training, coordination of training and exercise objectives as well as the harmonisation of appropriate air transport regulations of the nations. The overall objective is to manage the scarce resource air transport as effectively and efficiently as possible. During its visit, the Agency\u2019s delegation had useful discussions with the EATC\u2019s Commander, Major General Pascal Valentin as well as with Colonel Christian Schmidt, Director of the Movement Coordination Centre Europe. Claude-France Arnould noted that the EATC was a very successful model for pooling in the operational area with existing similar potential in the functional area. As the two organisations share important areas of interest such as diplomatic clearances for military transport aircraft, air-to-air refuelling, a future A400M multinational unit, enhanced cooperation especially in the area of maintenance and exchange of spare parts could be envisaged.

This roadmap was approved by defence ministers during their steering board meeting on 19 November as part of EDA\u2019s work on Pooling & Sharing enablers. The European ammunition sector is considered key in the consolidation of a globally competitive and capable European Defence Technological and Industrial Base. This sector has a high operational impact and is considered critical to the capabilities of the European armed forces. During recent multinational operations partner nations needed to exchange ammunition. However, the ammunition testing procedures vary between Member States preventing such sharing arrangements. Harmonisation of safety standards would enable pooling and sharing, procuring, stockpiling, exchanging or transporting of ammunition between Member States.\u00a0 At the European Network of National Safety Authorities (ENNSA \u2013 an EDA body) meeting this week, government and industry representatives agreed that harmonisation would benefit the demand as well as the supply side, improving interoperability and cooperation, facilitating cost reduction, and increasing the competitiveness of European industry. They prioritised the following short term actions (to be implemented by the end of 2013):\u00a0 Standardised reporting \u2013 to facilitate sharing and acceptance of qualification results. This will also enable cooperation, including promoting P&S activities among EU nations while avoiding duplication of tests. \u00a0This will inevitably reduce total ammunition procurement costs; and, Minimum Safety Data Package \u2013 to be established to ensure better understanding of Member States\u2019 national safety requirements thus enhancing harmonisation. Other actions from the meeting to be initiated in 2013 include: Endorsement of Test & Evaluation Houses: \u00a0The aim is to increase trust and provide better insight of the processes, expertise and methodologies used. Creation of European users group on specific standards: To enable nations using similar standards to share experience and views on standard implementation further enhancing harmonisation and common understanding.\u00a0 For more information: - A factsheet on ammunition qualification is available here. - Access the ammunition project page here.\u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/11/29/roadmap-to-harmonised-ammunition-qualification"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0873", "date": "2012-11-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Pooling & Sharing: More Effective, Not Cheaper Defence", "text": " Claude-France Arnould, Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency, participates in the 11th Congress on European Security and Defence, the Berlin Security Conference, starting today. Madam Arnould will introduce a panel on 28 November entitled \"The financial crisis and its impact on European Security and Defence\". Read here below her views on the role of the EDA in times of austerity. Pooling & Sharing: more effective, not cheaper defence Without doubt, the financial crisis has an adverse impact on the European defence sector. Defence spending is on a record low; national defence budgets have nearly halved since the Cold War. But the financial crisis \u00a0also triggers the necessary momentum to further cooperate, to pool and share capabilities. The European Defence Agency has initiated projects already following the eleven priority areas defined by its Steering Board in May 2011, covering the full capability line, from logistical support to acquisition. An essential project is air-to-air refuelling. During the campaign in Libya, the EU heavily relied on US tankers to keep their fighter jet fleet operational. As a consequence, EU defence ministers acknowledged that air-to-air refuelling was a critical capability shortfall which required an urgent solution. Another potential opportunity for cooperation is military satellite communication. It is assessed that EU Member States could save up to 2 bn Euro over the 15 coming years if they intensify their cooperation in this domain. A key enabler for Pooling and Sharing : certification and standardisation Certification and standardisation is very important to create better conditions for cooperation, efficiencies, and less bureaucracy. For instance, Member States are in the process of implementing in national law the European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) developed by EDA to facilitate the certification process of military aircrafts. Some Member States have already agreed to use EMARs for the in-service phase of the A400M. Harmonised rules will allow for mutual recognition between Member States\u2019 military airworthiness authorities which in turn will help to reduce costs considerably. Another example is certification in the field of ammunition. Up to 500 million euro could be optimised each year in Europe through more standardised certification processes. Not less but more efficient But Pooling & Sharing cannot be an alibi to further reduce efforts. It is a way to harness and maximise investment. Pooling & Sharing is not an excuse to invest less; rather, it offers a way to acquire together what is out of reach individually and get more efficiency in the deployment of these capabilities. We see that Europe risks losing significant industrial capability between now and 2020. One of the areas where Europe should intensity its efforts to run in the global competition is Unmanned Aerial Systems. Defence capability needs innovation. While the US spends 31% of its defence budget on investment, in Europe this accounts for only 22%. With the Member State\u2019s budgetary room for maneuver being more limited than ever, the Agency is actively looking for synergies with wider EU policies \u2013 research and technology, the Future Horizon 2020 programme, space policy, etc.. All these synergies will build on dual use technologies, for civil as well as military applications, but are not a substitute for national investment in future key technologies. Towards a more systematic approach of Pooling & Sharing Cooperative programmes are of course not a novelty in the military domain. But what the European Defence Agency offers to its participating Member States is unique. We work at the service of the Member States, applying an \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d approach by supporting groupings of two Member States upwards. We also pay particular attention to avoid duplication of efforts on the national level or with NATO. Recently, we have put a voluntary Pooling & Sharing code of conduct on the table of Ministers to allow for a more structured approach. It meant for example that Pooling & Sharing would be considered from the outset of an equipment or capability. As said before, the financial crisis created an urgency to closer work together. The political mandate of EDA is to propose ways, means and opportunities to cooperate efficiently. Obviously, this is in full respect of national sovereignty. Military capabilities are Member States\u2019 capabilities. But the EDA is there to support by building on maximum synergy. We have now to translate this political will into real commitment.

Air-to-air refuelling (AAR) is a critical enabler for air power projection and it is required to enable anything beyond short range air combat operations. A unique force multiplier, it is a fundamental capability embedded in modern aircraft design, not just in combat aircraft, but across the full spectrum of air platforms \u2013 including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. In the past, European armed forces have relied substantively on American assets. This was originally demonstrated in the Kosovo campaign, and the increased reliance on the US was a lesson from operations over Libya. Currently, Europe can field 42 aircraft of ten different types, which compares with US resources of over 650 of four types. \u00a0 EDA\u2019s approach Defence ministers tasked the Agency in March 2012 to work on air-to-air refuelling capabilities as a priority. Consequently, EDA has developed a global approach with three objectives: increasing overall capacity, reducing fragmentation of the fleet, and optimising the use of assets. This work has finally led to four complementary work-strands, on some of which EDA is cooperating closely with OCCAR: - Facilitating access to commercial AAR services; - Optimisation of use of existing capabilities which can include the sharing of surplus capacities for example; - Optimisation of the A400M fleet AAR capability including the option for acquiring additional AAR kits; - Increasing the strategic tanker capability in Europe by 2020. \u00a0 Letter of intent With the letter of intent signed by defence ministers on 19 November, defence ministers from Belgium, France, Greece, Spain, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Norway have now agreed to envisage buying or leasing new tanker aircraft together. The initiative is led by the Netherlands. The objective of the initiative is to contribute to reducing the existing shortfalls in the field of strategic air to air refuelling and transport whilst contributing to streamlining the European inventories. The aim is to reach an initial European strategic Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) capability by 2020. The aircraft will be available for multinational and national use. EDA expects that the pooled acquisition will result in important synergies in terms of initial overall investment, interoperability and life costs.

The arrangement describes common provisions and harmonised procedures for overflights and landings and enables Member States to operate without the need to submit diplomatic clearances requests for each flight, including support to on-going operations and transportation of IATA/ICAO compliant dangerous goods. This simplified mechanism can be seen as a significant step forward to more flexible and effective military airlift operations in Europe. Also included in this technical arrangement is a common clearances request and notification form which will further enhance harmonisation of the entire mechanism. \u00a0 Freedom of movement The agreement clearly improves the freedom of movement of EU military registered transport aircraft transiting national boundaries within the EU. The existing disparate requirements to obtain diplomatic clearances to land or overfly an EU member state cause delays and effectively hampers swift airlift operations. This legacy mechanism needs to be tailored to the 21st century\u2019s requirements, especially looking at the future implementation of the Single European Sky (SES) in the coming years, where a route driven system will evolve into a trajectory driven system. The technical arrangement is still open for signature until 1 June 2013. \u00a0 Background and way forward The European Air Transport Fleet partnership signed by 20 Member States in 2011under the auspices of the European Defence Agency is looking at augmenting the availability of military airlift in the EU and developing concrete solutions to increase its efficiency and effectiveness.

The exercises hosted by Portugal and Belgium allowed for the training of 56 helicopter crews and over 3,000 ground personnel. During the EDA Steering Board, Defence Ministers signed a Programme Arrangement for live exercises over ten years. Initially based on delivering live exercises aiming at disseminating tactical skills, the Helicopter Training Programme now includes a synthetic simulator based training project, a helicopter tactics instructor training course, and an operational English training course. The Maritime Surveillance (MARSUR) live network continues to extend its membership. The goals of the network are to facilitate exchange of information and to support safety and security. In October 2012, Bulgaria, Latvia and Norway joined the network which now includes 18 nations.\u00a0 The European Satellite Communications Procurement Cell (ESCPC) has moved forward as planned, with the signature of a framework contract in 2012. Five Member States participate on a pay-per-use basis of commercial satellite communications services. For the longer-term Future Military SATCOM project, decisions are required in the near future on the replacement of existing satellite networks in the 2018-25 timeframe. As the window of opportunity will close shortly, EDA stands ready to take action on P&S solutions, and is planning a high level workshop \u201cMILSATCOM 2020\u201d in the first half of 2013 in order to present proposals, foster common activities, and link with bi-lateral initiatives. The Multinational Modular Medical Units (Medical Field Hospitals) attracts growing participation. Fifteen Member States have so far signed the Letter of Intent. The Common Staff Target is expected to be finalised by mid-2013. The Memorandum of Understanding and Common Requirements will follow, with the objective of procurement of assets in 2014 and Initial Operational Capability in 2015. Air to Air Refuelling (AAR): EDA has developed a global approach with three objectives: increasing overall capacity, reducing fragmentation of the fleet, and optimising the use of assets. The Agency has started to work on short-term solutions including access to commercial AAR services and optimised use of existing assets. Longer-term actions include the acquisition of more AAR kits and increasing the strategic tanker capability in Europe by 2020. A Letter of Intent on a European Strategic Multirole Tanker Transport initiative, prepared under the lead of the Netherlands, was signed during the Steering Board. Pilot Training has attracted significant interest. France has offered to lead on transport crew training, and Italy on fast jet training.\u00a0 Work on European Multimodal Transport Hubs has been launched through a study (the results of which will be available in March 2013). The aim is to develop a European concept to increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of Europe\u2019s transport assets in support of military, civil and disaster relief operations.\u00a0 EDA has shaped substantive work on Smart Munitions. Possible P&S opportunities are outlined (i.e. in the areas of training and education) but no lead nation has yet been identified. Ireland, as lead nation, has initiated work on European Naval Training with a view to inter alia improving the sharing of existing facilities and the realisation of civil/military synergies.\u00a0 Additionally, the Agency presented the successful work delivered as regards to Pooling & Sharing enablers: Airworthiness: Member States are implementing EDA\u2019s European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) in national law.

The actions herein are aimed at mainstreaming Pooling & Sharing in Member States\u2019 planning and decision-making processes. They are to be implemented on a national and voluntary basis, in line with defence policies of Member States. The main pillars of the code are: To systematically consider cooperation from the outset in national defence planning of Member States for the whole life-cycle of a capability, including cooperation in R&T. Investment. To endeavour to accord Pooling & Sharing projects a higher degree of protection from potential cuts. To take advantage of synergies with wider European policies, including regulatory frameworks, standards and certification. Coherence. EDA functions as a platform for information exchange to avoid gaps or duplication, to share expertise and best practises and to increase transparency. Assessment. EDA will submit to Defence Ministers an annual state of play of Pooling & Sharing on the status of current initiatives, new opportunities and an analysis of the capability situation in Europe. \u00a0 More information - EDA Pooling & Sharing Code of Conduct \u00a0 Pictures credit: Council of the European Union", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/11/19/defence-minsters-adopt-pooling-sharing-code-of-conduct"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0881", "date": "2012-11-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Nanoelectronics\u2019 Importance for Defence", "text": " On 6 November 2012, MEP Lambert\u00a0van Nistelrooij (EPP, NL) hosted a roundtable on the strategic importance of Europe's nanoelectronic sector, co-organised by\u00a0The Parliament Magazine and ENIAC Joint Undertaking. Michael Sieber, EDA assistant director for research and technology, \u00a0had been invited to present the defence view on this key technology. Nanoelectronics are the backbone of many advanced technologies also used in the military context and hence part of the European Defence Agency's Strategic Research Agenda. While defence and security tasks can be supported quite efficiently in taking advantage from \u201cdual-use\u201d technologies, specific military requirements are driving some of them. In the case of nanoelectronics it is cutting edge performance, reliability and robustness in specific operational environments, multi-functionality, high integration density and low weight. Limited production volumes and access to critical technologies and materials which are subject to export restrictions draw attention to managing technological and industrial dependencies, keeping supply chains in Europe if necessary. Only a sustainable and globally competitive European industrial base can secure future supplies. For next generation \u00a0Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits (MMIC) based on the widebandgap semiconductor Gallium Nitride and the related \u00a0technologies, EDA projects supported the creation of a comprehensive European supply chain which will be critical for the development and production of the next generation radar, communication and electronic protection defence systems. Regarding the current \u201ctechnology drain\u201d and declining Research and Development efforts by European Member States, action may be required in additional areas such as Nano-Electro-Mechanical Systems (NEMS), System-on-Chip, Photonics, Advanced Multifunctional and Conformal Antennas. \"Without the nanoelectronics sector there would be no viable defence sector, and without defence, investment in nanoelectronics would not be feasible\", said Michael Sieber during the roundtable. EDA is leveraging its respective efforts with other European institutions (European Commission, European Space Agency), to create synergies and avoid duplication. Participating in the Critical Space Technologies for European Strategic Non-Dependence (CRISP) mapping process for example allows to continuously analyse, assess and determine \u00a0urgent actions for improving\u00a0 European Technology non-Dependence (ETnD) in this area. Recommendations and proposed actions of the parliamentary roundtable on nanoelectronics included continuous and sustainable investment in research, supply chains and innovative production. Strategic planning and commitment by policy makers will be as necessary as the development of business cases which combine highly specialised supply chains across EU institutions (defence, security, space, others).\u00a0 All pictures courtesy of\u00a0Fraunhofer IAF ", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/11/13/nanoelectronics-importance-for-defence"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0882", "date": "2012-10-25", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA Launches New Website", "text": " The European Defence Agency launched its new website on 25 October 2012.

Consequently, a certain degree of coordination between civil an defence research is needed. A joint workshop to shape the research and innovation agenda in the areas of cyber defence and the fight against cyber-crime and terrorism was therefore organised on 23 October in Brussels. Marco Malacarne, acting director in the European Commission\u2019s Directorate-General Enterprise and Industry, opened the workshop by giving an overview of his department\u2019s achievements in cyber research. Michael Sieber, responsible for cyber research in the European Defence Agency, listed typical defence characteristics for research in the domain, while G\u00e9raldine Naja of the European Space Agency explained that the EU\u2019s growing number of space assets needed to be protected. She continued that satellites had been subject to cyber-attacks in the past and that the protection of ground segments should be enhanced as well. A coordinated action at EU level would be most effective to that end. Europol\u2019s concern in the cyber domain lies more in the area of online criminal behaviour as companies \u00a0attempt to gain a competitive edge and enhance their market share by stealing information online. Academics pointed to a set of research issues for the cloud, ubiquitous computing and the future internet. Professor Van Eeten from Delft University explained how his research showed that internet service providers needed to be given incentives to improve online security. \u2018Effortless security\u2019 was the issue raised by Professor Paar, University of Bochum, who listed obfuscation and reverse engineering as a field where more research needed to be done. Federated military networks are the area of research of Dr Aurisch in his German Fraunhofer Institute; while Professor Nieto Taladriz from Madrid showed the results of research in the area of reputation and anomaly detection for securing distributed networks. Cryptography is another part of the overall online security puzzle. Crypto research in Europe is proven to be top-of-the-world, with EU research outfits winning awards in U.S competitions. However, the EU lacks a European cryptography policy . Such a policy, Professor Preneel from KU Leuven argued, could push crypto research to the next level. Managing threats and vulnerabilities, visualisation techniques and self-repair based on biology research were all issues covered. Feedback from the audience showed that cyber security and cyber defence research in Europe is in a good shape. There is a need for communication and exchange of results between the different research communities and across Europe. More exchange in the sort of workshop organised by EDA, ESA and the European Commission will \u00a0help to avoid duplication and to connect different bits of research.\u00a0 Topical workshops will follow on the issues raised; the ideas generated in the workshop will feed into the research agenda of each institution.

During this visit, Claude-France Arnould highlighted that European Member States could benefit from important savings through full harmonisation of ammunition qualification procedures. The European ammunition sector is considered key in the consolidation of a globally competitive and capable European Defence Technological and Industrial Base. This sector has a high operational impact and is critical to the capabilities of the Member States \u00a0armed forces. During recent multinational operations partner nations needed to exchange ammunition. However, the current ammunition testing procedures vary between Member States preventing such sharing arrangements. Harmonisation of safety standards would enable pooling and sharing, procuring, stockpiling, exchanging or transporting of ammunition between Member States. \u201cIn order to contribute to a more systematic and sustainable approach to the long-term development of Pooling & Sharing, harmonisation and rationalisation of European military regulations and procedures is a key area where EDA can add value in offering its services to the Member States\u201d, said Claude-France Arnould during her visit in Unterl\u00fc\u00df. EDA action plan to improve harmonisation The lack of harmonisation in ammunition qualification in Europe increases the procurement costs for Member States, puts the EU defence industry at a disadvantage in comparison to its global competitors and most importantly prevents European Armed Forces from conducting common operations and logistics. EDA\u2019s action plan aims to improve this situation without posing additional burden on national authorities or duplicating relevant activities such as in NATO. This action plan includes short to mid-term term objectives expected to drastically reduce duplication and total acquisition costs, while improving harmonisation and the potential for further cooperation, including Pooling & Sharing. Actions such as Standardised Qualification Reporting, development of a Minimum Safety Data Package and the Endorsement of Test and Evaluation Houses, are designed to enable comparison between individual Member States qualification results, reducing unnecessary duplication and enhancing trust among national authorities and test centres to promote commonly accepted qualification processes. Broad support During the opening session of this event Detlef Selhausen, the National Armaments Director of Germany , Ralf Prechtl, CEO of Rheinmetall\u2019s Waffe Munition GmbH, and Jan-Olov Blix representing the land sectorial group of ASD (ELDIG) as former Executive Vice-President, provided their views on the topic, all of them supporting EDA\u2019s initiative for enhanced harmonisation.

The 15 initial participating Member States are Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Spain, Finland, Greece, France, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Sweden and the UK. Maritime situational awareness is the effective understanding of activities, associated with and occurring in the maritime domain, that could im\u00acpact on the security, safety and environment of the European Union and its Member States. The project is coordinated by the European Defence Agency (EDA) since September 2006, following a mandate given by the EU Defence Ministers in late 2005. MARSUR aims at creating a network using existing naval and maritime information exchange systems. Overall goals are to avoid duplication of effort and the use of available technologies, data and information; to enhance cooperation in a simple, efficient and low-cost solution for civil-military cooperation; and to support safety and security. The MARSUR Networking Project has successfully highlighted the fundamental need to control the maritime domain information. This network enables the exchange of maritime surveillance information between participating maritime countries, connecting multiple national systems in real time, while there is no central EU component that collects, processes and distributes the information. Each country is responsible for correlating its own data with the data received from others. The total common costs of MARSUR project is \u20ac930.000. A large amount of this investment was spent on the definition and development of the key component of the network: the interface linking the existing national systems. On top of this, Member States have to plug in their national systems into the interface. Furthermore, 12 of those Member States plus Norway signed today a \u20ac1 million Project Arrangement, which is very promising in terms of future cooperation and operational efficiency.

The advantages of the European Satellite Communications Procurement Cell (ESCPC) are convincing: reduced costs and easy access. The initial investment (2.3 million Euro) will allow the ESCPC to deliver concrete satellite capacities in the upcoming months. In military operations satellite communications are fundamental for Communication, Command and Control. They also allow operational effectiveness of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance platforms, including Remotely Piloted Aircraft. Member States often resort to commercial SatCom either to complement similar military capabilities or as the sole means to effectively conduct military operations. The EDA ESCPC aims at pooling commercial SatCom demand from a number of EU national defence departments, reducing costs by around 10 per cent. \u201cThe overall aim of the ESCPC is to overcome fragmented procurement of commercial SatCom capacity in order to reduce costs, promote ease of access and improve efficiency to deliver a better connectivity to armed forces of the EU Member States.\u201d said Claude-France Arnould, EDA Chief Executive, after signing the framework contract with Astrium Services. Pooling and sharing of commercial satellite communications ESCPC is a good example of an EDA project delivering services to improve EU defence capabilities. As an implementation of the Effective Procurement Method promoted by the Agency, the ESCPC can for instance support outsourced logistic services backing any national, EU-led or coalition operation. The ESCPC is linked to the Third Party Logistics Support Platform, allowing for a more cost effective access to logistic support. \u00a0 Cooperation with Astrium Services With the signature of the three years framework contract, Astrium Services will act as a one-stop-shop. It will serve as contractual, commercial and operational interface towards SatCom operators, providing the participating Member States with commercial bands (C, Ku and Ka). MILSATCOM: Savings in the order of one billion Euro ESCPC is a first and short-term step to improve SatCom capability for European defence. But Europe now also has the opportunity to cooperate to replace the existing national-based military satellite communications (MILSATCOM) capacities. In this respect EDA proposes the concept of Secure Telecom by Satellite (SECTELSAT) \u2013 a cooperative approach inspired by the Pooling and Sharing initiative. The initiative foresees a scheme in which MILSATCOM operating Nations will: Pool MILSATCOM assets with other operating Nations for mutual benefits (increased coverage and operational flexibility); Share MILSATCOM capacities by giving access for non-MILSATCOM Nations under defined conditions; Contribute to a European MILSATCOM capability package for the CSDP. Through this scheme, European Member States could save around one billion Euro stemming from synergies in research and technology investments, acquisition of recurring assets and standardised operations. \u201cToday\u2019s defence budgets are under severe pressure.

Other aircraft used by Belgium are two C-130s, two B-Hunters and up to four F-16s. During the entire exercise, helicopters execute around 65 missions of steadily increasing complexity, from typical Special Operations-related missions, such as insertion/ extraction, Direct Action, Personnel Recovery, and Intelligence Surveillance & Reconnaissance, by day and by night, in single or multiship configurations. The exercise will also include more conventional types of missions, such as Airmobile Operations, Recce & Surveillance and Medical Evacuation, as well as non-tactical training missions, such as Night Vision Goggle-flying, Nap of Earth flight and Gun Firing. These missions will add up to around 650 crucial Flying Hours.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/10/03/green-blade-2012-high-political-support-during-visitors-day"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0895", "date": "2012-09-28", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Ministers of Defence welcome EDA\u2019s Pooling & Sharing", "text": " On 26 and 27 September, EU Ministers of Defence had a two-day informal meeting hosted by the Cypriot Presidency.

Ms. Claude France-Arnould, EDA\u2019s Chief Executive, also attended the meeting. Mr. Eliades described the meeting as a \u201cpositive step forward in our common efforts to enhance the Common Security and Defence Policy\u201d, which aims to enhance peace, security, stability and growth. In addition to the discussions on EU\u2019s southern neighborhood and on Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions, EU Defence Ministers also discussed the issue of pooling and sharing in support of developing military capabilities. Ministers welcomed the European Defence Agency\u2019s proposal to develop a voluntary code of conduct on pooling and sharing, and emphasized the need to make this process more systematic and sustainable in the long run. \u201cEDA will continue to drive Pooling & Sharing forward as a pragmatic, flexible and cost-effective model, and avoiding bureaucratisation. The Code of Conduct will facilitate cooperation, and make Pooling & Sharing sustainable now and in the future\", said Ms. Arnould, after the meeting. EDA\u2019s proposal and results were acknowledged by Ministers; the EEAS representative said: \u201creactions to EDA's proposal on pooling and sharing and on the specific proposal to establish a code of conduct were encouraging as ministers were positive,\u201d said Ambassador Popowski. The EEAS Deputy Secretary General also pointed out that the main challenge is to link pooling and sharing as a European initiative with the national defence planning processes.

Under discussion was an important tool in addressing the challenges of restricted defence budgets: combining purchases for reduced costs. The initiative has received support from across the defence spectrum, including defence and security industry. The Cyprus EU Council Presidency, in association with the European Defence Agency and the Egmont - Royal Institute for International Relations of Belgium, has organised a seminar entitled: \"Innovative European Defence Cooperation - Pooling and Consolidating Demand.\" Drawing together representatives from Ministries of Defence, the European Commission, industry and media, the event permitted an in-depth discussion of some pressing issues. It featured contributions from leading figures in EU defence: speakers included Demetris Eliades, Minister of Defence of the Republic of Cyprus, General H\u00e5kan Syr\u00e9n, Chairman of the EU Military Committee, Detlef Selhausen, German National Armaments Director, Antti Peltom\u00e4ki, Deputy Director-General of DG Enterprise and Frank Haun, Chief Executive Officer of Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, as well as Claude-France Arnould, the EDA's Chief Executive. Reductions in EU defence budgets have given extra importance to the need for co-operation in Pooling and Sharing at a European level. At the seminar, delegates further examined the benefits and impacts of consolidating demand on EU governments and industries; the opportunities and challenges this creates, both in the short and in the long term; and in general, further means, methods and ways of improving the effectiveness of military expenditure within the EU. Giving a keynote address, General H\u00e5kan Syr\u00e9n outlined many of the challenges, and called for deeper cooperation. He said \u201cThe recent budget cuts have further exacerbated the situation and made a difficult situation worse. A good thing is that they have increased the visibility and awareness of the problems, but let me underline that the fundamental problems are that defence is getting increasingly costly, that our efforts are spread too thinly to be really efficient and most important that our decisions are taken in 27 different national contexts. The potential for generating a greater capability output is substantial if we are able to coordinate our efforts better.\u201d Central to the progress in Pooling Demand has been the EDA\u2019s own project, Effective Procurement Methods. Having overcome the legal and bureaucratic obstacles to this initiative, the Agency has now successfully completed two pilot projects, one on training, covering instructors\u2019 services and expertise for the European Guardian, a Counter-IED exercise held in Austria this summer, and another one on Basic Logistics Services for the EU Battle Group for three Member States: Austria, Czech Republic and Germany. Frank Haun, the Chief Executive Officer of German firm Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, in an EDA interview before the event, offered this call in support of the project: \u201cIn times of declining budgets and the massive re-allocation of financial resources, all partners in the defence market need to rethink and discuss objectives, structures, and processes.\u201d He concluded that \u201cit finally comes down to economies of scale.\u201d The EDA\u2019s Chief Executive, Claude-France Arnould, said at the end of the seminar: \u201cI am very happy with today\u2019s outcome. One could feel that all stakeholders are ready to translate our political commitment to Pooling & Sharing into real and tangible action. Pooling and Consolidating Demand is a key tool to make this happen and the EDA with its integrated way of working is just the natural place for it.\u201d The Pooling Demand seminar forms part of the defence programme of Cyprus\u2019 presidency of the European Council.

Special Forces from Belgium (Special Forces Group in Heverlee), Italy (IX Battaglione \u201cCol Moschin\u201d in Livorno) and Spain (Escuadr\u00f3n de Zapadores Paracaidistas in Murcia and Fuerza de Guerra Naval Especial in Cartagena) continue improving their combat procedures and techniques through repeated training, evaluation and assessment. Interoperability of the different participants increases by mutually exchanging information on techniques, procedures and equipment. On Wednesday and Thursday 18 and 19 September, aircrews continued their familiarisation briefings and flights as well as night flying exercises. All these flights started and ended at Kleine-Brogel Air Base, which acts as Deployed Operating Base (DOB) in the scenario of Exercise Green Blade/Pegasus. A DOB provides air support to combat operations from an air base or airfield at a more or less safe location near or in the area of operations. All flights were conducted at a minimum altitude above ground level (AGL) as a noise abatement precaution. In dedicated Helicopter Training Areas (HTA), mostly sparsely populated areas, the helicopters, were allowed to fly below 250 ft AGL and to perform landings in predetermined landing zones. Crews who already performed local area orientation flights, started supporting the cross-training of the Special Forces from a small airfield near the Leopoldsburg Barracks: locally known as Sanicole Aero Club. During this cross-training, troopers of all three participating nations rehearsed fast-roping and the use of SPIERIG, by day as well as at night. Fast-roping is a technique for descending a thick rope and is most convenient for deploying personnel from a helicopter in places where the helicopter itself cannot land, like built-up areas and woodland. It was developed by the British and first used in combat during the Falklands War. The technique is quicker than rappelling, but also more challenging as the person is not attached to the rope with a descender. The person just holds onto the rope with his gloved hands and feet and slides down. The rope has to be thick to prevent it from being blown around in the helicopter\u2019s rotor blast. SPIERIG or Special Purpose Insertion/Extraction Rig is equipment developed by the US Marines to rapidly insert or extract personnel from terrain where a helicopter cannot land. To pick up personnel, a SPIE rope is lowered from a hovering helicopter into the pickup area. The troopers, wearing a harness with a carabiner, hook up to a D-ring inserted in the SPIE rope and secure themselves with a second safety line that is attached to a second D-ring in the rope. The helicopter then climbs vertically until rope and personnel are clear of obstacles and proceeds in forward flight to a secure insert zone. The extracted persons then board the helicopter or are picked up by other means of transport. In the past years, night flying became less hazardous by the use of Night Vision Goggles (NVG), but not less challenging. NVGs are optical instruments worn by pilots and other aircrew on their helmet and produce images in levels of light almost approaching total darkness. They were first used in World War II and came into wide use during the Vietnam War. Although NVGs make night flying less hazardous, the military always take a number of safety precautions into account. The helicopter\u2019s Identification Friend or Foe (IFF, a system allowing identifying an aircraft on a radar screen), navigation and landing lights, and radar altimeter (a kind of radar allowing determining an aircraft\u2019s altitude) have to be serviceable. Pilots have to respect the minima for visibility, ceiling and illuminance as specified in their national regulations, and for emergency procedures, a detailed fuel calculation has to be executed. The multinational \u201cBest Practice Helicopter Tactics Workshop\" that took place on Thursday delivered a valuable exchange of information on important items like the mission planning cycle, NVG flying experience using different system setups, MEDEVAC and SOF tactics, and sequence and contents of briefings.

Exercise Green Blade is focusing on helicopter-special forces cooperation, a vital area of modern operations. Exercise Green Blade runs from 17 September to 5 October 2012, hosted by the Belgian Air Component. Running together with Exercise Pegasus, a Special Operations training exercise, the two groups will work closely together on numerous missions. With helicopters from Belgium, Germany and Italy, the two exercises in total draw together some 800 personnel from seven countries: EDA Member States Belgium, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Austria, Ireland and Spain (as well as Canada for the Pegasus exercise). In total 18 helicopters will deploy to Kleine Brogel Airbase, varying from transport (CH47), to utility (A109, UH-1D) and attack helicopters (A129). They will work in concert with other air assets, to maximize the realism of these testing missions; supporting assets will include an AWACS; F16; C130; and UAVs. The Belgian UAV, the B-Hunter, will be integrated for reconnaissance and surveillance of targets in direct support of the Special Forces, as well as for area surveillance during Personnel Recovery scenarios. The exercise will principally take place in the North of Belgium, with some missions taking place over Southeast Belgium. This vast and challenging training area is characterized by a low population density, a varied geography and a favourable airspace classification. Helicopters will execute around 65 missions of steadily increasing complexity, from typical Special Operations-related missions, such as insertion/extraction, Direct Action, Personnel Recovery, and Intelligence Surveillance & Reconnaissance, by day and by night, in single or multiship configurations. The exercise will also include more conventional types of missions, such as Airmobile Operations, Recce & Surveillance and Medical Evacuation, as well as non-tactical training missions, such as Night Vision Goggle-flying, Nap of Earth flight and Gun Firing. These missions will add up to around 650 crucial Flying Hours. The exercise, planning for which began in June 2011, will demonstrate the benefits of cooperation in the context of Pooling & Sharing efforts, delivering an exercise that few EDA Member States could undertake alone, enhancing helicopter deployability and freeing up scarce resources for other investments in the defence sector. Peter Round, EDA Capabilities Director, explained: \u201cWe fight together, and so we have to work together, pooling our resources. An exercise like this is the best way to deliver high quality training in these challenging times.\u201d EDA Helicopter Activity The exercise is one part of wider ongoing EDA work to boost deployability, as requested by Member States. Green Blade is the latest in a series of increasingly effective helicopter exercises, held in France, Spain, Italy and Portugal since 2009 under the Helicopter Exercise Programme. The programme has so far involved 108 helicopters. Exercise Green Blade will be the first of these exercises run by the new Core Planning Team, which will steer the programme in the long-term, incorporating lessons learned and enhancing helicopter deployability for Member States. The EDA has also worked with its Member States to create the Helicopter Tactics Course in the UK, with 18 crews trained thus far. A new \u2018train-the-trainers\u2019 initiative is planned for this year; the European Qualified Helicopter Tactics Course, which is a joint effort by Sweden and the UK, aims to create a recognised tactics instructor cadre across Europe. Work has also started to harmonize helicopter flying training across participating Member States; trial courses have been delivered in Operational English Language learning and later this year, the EDA will conduct a capability concept demonstration into the use of distributed simulator training. EDA and Pooling & Sharing The Agency\u2019s helicopter work sits alongside a succession of EDA programmes to pool and share assets and resources, enhancing the overall military capabilities of the EDA\u2019s Member States in challenging times for defence. Similar programmes include the Tactical Air Transport strand, which recently held a major air exercise in Zaragoza, Spain, the EDA\u2019s work in training Counter-IED professionals, and the recently launched pilot programme to pool demand for efficient procurement. The Agency is currently working on 10 Pooling & Sharing priority areas: Countering Improvised Explosive Devices; Medical support; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; Helicopters; Cyber Defence; Multinational logistics support\u2019; Common Security and Development Policy Information Exchange; Strategic & Tactical Airlift Management; and Fuel & Energy. This exercise provides an ideal opportunity to demonstrate the advances made by the EDA\u2019s Pooling & Sharing initiative.

Green Blade is the fifth helicopter training exercise in a row organised since 2009 by the Helicopter Exercise Programme (HEP) of the European Defence Agency (EDA), while Pegasus is a biennial Belgian exercise for Special Forces. Combining both exercises into one not only offers excellent added training opportunities for both helicopter crews and Special Forces, but also has a cost-reducing effect. By training together and exchanging ideas, the different Belgian, German and Italian helicopter crews and their support personnel develop common best practices and mutually improve their interoperability. The same goes for the participating Special Forces from Belgium, Italy and Spain. Additionally, the joint training of aircrews and Special Forces means that both groups of specialists are better prepared to work together in future operations. On arrivals day, all personnel received a place to work and a bed to sleep, and went through a series of mandatory safety and security briefings. Safety in general and flight safety in particular are among the major concerns of the exercise direction as well as of the host nation, as was stressed once more by their representatives in their welcoming speech on the first evening. The first week of the exercise is fully dedicated to what is called Combat Enhancement Training/Force Integration Training (CET/FIT) in military terminology. In short, it is a phase preceding the actual exercise during which the participants familiarise themselves with the exercise area and the equipment and procedures of their colleagues. Tuesday 18 September was mainly spent on familiarisation briefings and flights. Members of the participating Special Forces became acquainted with the general characteristics and performances of the different types of helicopters present as well as with the procedures for safe boarding and disembarking. Belgian helicopter crews showed their German and Italian colleagues around in the area of operations for Exercise Green Blade/Pegasus during a pinpoint navigation over the provinces of Antwerp, Li\u00e8ge, Limburg and Namur. During these flights, Belgian pilots made their guests familiar not only with the local landscape and its landmarks, but also with particularities of the Belgian airspace, local flight rules and exercise specific operating procedures.

The Agency is already supporting a wide range of projects in the air domain fostering cooperation among Member States. However, new results from a recent EDA study suggest that while the air defense industry is still healthy, important industrial capabilities are eroding. Without additional concerted action, the situation will soon become critical, for example for the development of future combat aircraft (manned and unmanned) and attack helicopters. Military aviation is paramount in enabling EU Member States to meet their national security and defence requirements. Additionally, the industry has long been a driver for innovation, producing cutting edge technology that contributes to wider economic growth in Europe. Around 200,000 people in high-tech jobs are currently directly employed in the sector. It comprises important system integrators and a dynamic and innovative supply chain rich in SMEs. The industry generates an annual turnover of approximately 45 billion euro[1]. This technically advanced sector is a key supporting component of strong European military capabilities. Recent EDA-sponsored work has shown that Europe risks losing significant industrial know-how between now and 2020. This includes the ability to produce advanced combat aircraft. Moreover, Europe risks falling significantly behind the global competition in UAS capabilities. \u201cEurope has successfully managed to join forces in two fields closely related to military aviation: space and civil aviation. If we want a similarly strong and independent aeronautics defence sector, we have to set the course now\u201d, said Claude-France Arnould during the EDA Future Air Systems Conference at ILA Berlin. EDA: Fostering aerial cooperation With budgets under pressure and joint operations more and more common, the EDA is playing a key role in pooling and sharing vital defence capabilities in Europe. Notably in the area of air operations, a number of successful projects are being conducted: EDA\u2019s air-to-air refuelling initiative is supporting Member States in developing interoperable European solutions to overcome current shortfalls, and propose options for future requirements in this respect. Bringing together air crews from across Europe to train and qualify together in airlift disciplines is the aim of the European air transport training. The first training event was held successfully in Zaragoza, Spain in June this year. More exercises will follow in 2013. To date, military airworthiness activities have been conducted and regulated on a national basis. This generates many problems in multinational programmes and is a primary cause for delay and additional cost. The EDA is a key actor in working towards an EU-wide harmonisation and unification strategy on military airworthiness which will make the process more efficient and will help to reduce costs. The EDA\u2019s Helicopter Training Programme provides a framework to Member States to allow them to develop, consolidate and share best practices to meet the challenges of flying helicopters in the modern operational environment. EDA has to date delivered four exercises: one in Gap, France, one in Logrono, Spain, one in Viterbo, Italy and one near Porto, Portugal. A fifth one, Green Blade 2012, will be held in Belgium at the end of September. These exercises have met an urgent training requirement for the participating Member States, greatly enhancing the helicopter capacity available. They are complemented by the EDA\u2019s three-week Helicopter Tactics Course, ten being held in 2012. The Agency has worked on Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) issues since its inception, and in 2007 it received an explicit directive from European defence ministers to examine the challenges to UAS air traffic insertion. Apart from facilitating concrete projects (e.g. Midair Collision Avoidance project (MIDCAS)) and funding studies (e.g. Study on military spectrum requirements for the insertion of UAS into general air traffic (SIGAT)), the EDA cooperates with European and international organisations to move forward technical, regulatory and standardisation issues. \u201cFAS4Europe\u201d study: how to safeguard the future of the military aviation industry Almost 30 industrial entities, representing a significant proportion of Europe\u2019s military aviation industry, were involved in the twelve month FAS4Europe study under the leadership of Saab AB. Its aim was to analyse the current state of the European air defence industry, to identify the sector\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and to provide a roadmap and implementation plan. The main result of the study is that the European military aeronautical industry is now losing capabilities. The situation for future air systems is severe, with some important industrial capabilities and technologies already at risk. The study highlights that an opportunity exists to break the current trend of erosion. However, it requires the launch of actions based on a common and coordinated plan. The EDA study thus sets out a roadmap of projects and demonstrator programmes. This roadmap includes proposals to work on: Technologies for advanced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance UAS; Increasing air system survivability against future threats (rotary and fixed wing); and, Improving the lifecycle affordability of military aircraft (rotary and fixed wing). Additionally, the study highlights the potential to link civil-military research and development to exploit synergies within the civil aerospace market. Finally, it strongly suggests co-operative European aerospace development programmes to avoid further fragmentation. Agency position The EDA will address the issue of a common European approach with stakeholders and will raise it at Board level. \u201cWhat is in question today is Europe\u2019s future ability to design and develop advanced new military aircraft. The Agency aims to make a strong case for strategic European cooperation for future air systems\u201d, concluded Claude-France Arnould in Berlin.

ICAR started under the Joint Investment Programme on Force Protection (JIP-FP), one of the flagships in the EDA portfolio. The work is\u00a0driven by European forces\u00b4 most recent lessons from Crisis Management Operations, and is a true testimony that European collaboration in defence research works. The project value is around \u20ac4m, and it involves a consortium from 8 nations (France, Germany, Netherlands, Poland, Austria, Greece, Slovakia and Belgium), the logos of whom are at the foot of this article. In his opening address, Michael Sieber, Assistant R&T Director at EDA, underlined that IEDs are among the most important threats in asymmetric warfare, with not only a physical, but also a high psychological impact on our forces. ICAR has explored new technologies to mitigate this threat \u2013 smarter sensing, powerful information fusion and intelligent counter-measures. Quite a number of EDA member states\u00b4 representatives took up the invitation to take part in the project demonstration, which offered 3 scenarios: protection of patrols, of convoys and of infrastructure. The most spectacular scenario was certainly convoy protection, where the sensor platform was integrated into an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. But the robotic ground vehicle carrying the counter-measure unit also generated high interest among the audience. Organisers of the event were able to benefit from the kind support by the Austrian Ministry of Defence (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Landesverteidigung und Sport \u2013 BMLVS) and the Austrian Armed Forces already during its preparation. The Director for Research and Technology of the BMLVS, Brigadier Klemens Hofmeister, summarised his impressions of the day in his concluding remarks, rating the project a full success.

Many of the conclusions in the Opinion are in line with work being carried out by EDA. Entitled \u2018The need for a European defence industry: industrial, innovative and social aspects\u2019, the paper calls for a stronger and more integrated European defence sector, suggesting that \u201cObsolete approaches visibly lead to increasing fragmentation, gaps, overcapacity and a lack of interoperability in European defence capabilities. The arguments for improvement are overwhelming; it is a matter of political will.\u201d The report notes that security is the first duty of governments, and a key part of their compact with their citizens \u2013 and suggests that current spending levels mean that the credibility of this guarantee is being undermined. It makes the point that foreign affairs and security, defence, and industrial capability are all deeply interrelated, and must be integrated into a coherent strategy. The report calls for a \u201cradical\u201d change of mindset in the way governments deal with defence. One area that the report particularly highlights is Research and Development, which has seen many cuts in recent years, but which remains absolutely crucial to an effective defence in the long term. The report concludes that European research spending should seek opportunities for \u201cdual use\u201d investments and reduce technological dependency on sources outside Europe. The report welcomes the creation of the Task Force on Defence \u2013 with EDA as an associated member \u2013 as well as the European Parliament\u2019s December 2011 Resolution on European Defence, and the personal commitment of many senior EU officials to the cause of an effective national defence. In that regard, the paper calls for still closer cooperation between the key parties in defence. The authors argue that the European Defence Agency in particular has a key role to play, and that it must act as a full partner to the European Commission on defence issues \u2013 with the full involvement also of the defence industry and other stakeholders. In doing so, the fragmentation and duplication of public expenditure may be reduced, enhancing quality and interoperability. Many of the issues raised in this paper fall within the purview of the EDA. The recent launch of the Effective Procurement Methods initiative and the progress made on the joint procurement of satellite communications are but two examples of EDA\u2019s successes in European defence cooperation. Today\u2019s signature of an Administrative Arrangement with OCCAR demonstrates the commitment to maximizing effectiveness through links with other defence stakeholders.

What is your motivation to devote your scarce time to this topic? In times of declining budgets and the massive re-allocation of financial resources, all partners in the defence market need to rethink and discuss objectives, structures, and processes. We all act within a system of interdependencies. Creating win-win situations should be our common denominator. Thus \u2013 representing the supply side \u2013 I feel personally responsible to contribute and listen on this occasion. When the EDA started to prepare the Effective Procurement Methods work strand as one of the main vehicles to implement Pooling and Consolidating Demand, our research revealed that the potential savings for governments, depending on the degree of demand consolidation, can lead up to more than 30 per cent \u2013 so the advantages seem to be rather on the demand side. Yet, European defence industries are constantly calling for it. Can you explain the benefits of Pooling and Consolidating Demand for the supply side? Well, it finally comes down to economies of scale. Assuming that EU\u2019s nations by and large will have to face the same challenges in land warfare for the time being: Is there really a necessity for six types of 8x8 vehicles developed and produced within the European Union? Or put it the other way round: Do different operators of one and the same vehicle really need different specifications, levels of protection, and so forth? Being an engineering-driven company, KMW loves to supply leading-edge technologies. We are really good at that; but we would do even better if the breadth of demand would be reduced in favour of consolidated high-tech depth. The benefits of Pooling and Consolidating Demand seem so obvious, and yet it is still an exception rather than a rule. From your point of view, what are the main obstacles to Pooling and Consolidating Demand? In defence as in many other respects, Europe still is a patchwork. Aiming at pooling and consolidating demand, none of us may start from a blank sheet of paper. Today, military equipment varies from nation to nation. To a certain extent and for some time ahead, this constitutes part of the reference frame for new procurements. Another major obstacle, of course, is national thinking. As Europeans, we share the same values, most of us share the same currency, and we co-ordinate our foreign policy \u2013 but in defence issues and in defence industries, things remain pretty domestic. The European Union's package of directives in the field of defence and security is a significant step in the right direction. However, competition on this platform can only be fair and cost-efficient, if governments step back from various ways of supporting or owning their national defence industries. Please allow us to become a bit more concrete now. We have learned that Krauss-Maffei Wegmann has already long-lasting experience with Pooling and Consolidating Demand, for example through your cooperation with so called weapon systems user clubs like the one for Leopard Main Battle Tanks. At the same time your company is not offering the equipment only but also related training and logistic services. Can you tell us a bit more about your actual experiences and elaborate a bit on where you see further potential for Pooling and Consolidating demand? We constantly listen to customers, we facilitate communication among our customers. Thus, all involved may benefit from each other\u2019s experiences. With the Leopard user club, we have a platform to define and devise common supply concepts, further development and plans for adaptions. At KMW, this is an integral part of customer relationship management. If we talk about pooling and consolidating demand in the European Union, we are talking about something as efficient, but on a much bigger scale and backed-up decisively by national politics. If you were given the possibility to deliver one key message related to Pooling and Consolidating Demand to European governmental decision makers, what would it be? Define your needs, discuss them open-minded with your fellow-nations \u2013 and have faith in the market. Mr Haun, thank you very much for this interview.

Jean-Yves Le Drian and a delegation from the French Ministry of Defence received presentations from EDA experts on some of the Agency\u2019s current priority projects: air-to-air refueling, countering improvised explosive devices and Research & Technology. The presentations highlighted the concrete progress made in these Pooling & Sharing workstrands: to combat the most significant threat in current conflicts, IEDs; to maintain Europe\u2019s technological edge in the defence arena; and to ensure European aircraft can operate flexibly and effectively beyond their bases. The Minister then met with Agency Chief Executive Claude-France Arnould and the EDA\u2019s Directors; they discussed the current state of European defence, and the imperative to take action. In particular, Ms Arnould emphasized the Agency\u2019s flexibility, and openness to supporting bilateral and regional, as well as pan-European defence cooperation \u2013 something the Agency achieves through its \u2018opt-in\u2019 project structure and constant emphasis on the needs of Member States. The French Minister of Defence expressed his political support for European defence cooperation, and he emphasized the importance of the Agency\u2019s work in that cause. Claude-France Arnould commented: \u201cWe\u2019re very pleased to have the opportunity to showcase our work to Monsieur Le Drian. I think we both agree that projects like our work on air-to-air refueling will be vital to Europe\u2019s defence in the future.\u201d Indeed, thanks to the Agency\u2019s recent agreement with OCCAR, projects like air-to-air refueling can now be carried through more effectively, with the smoothest possible handover from concept to procurement.

Pooling Demand with a view to common procurements, particularly in the field of off-the-shelf purchases, offers considerable opportunities to increase the effectiveness of defence spending, while boosting interoperability. Equally, Pooling Demand helps counter fragmentation and small orders, helping the European defence industry plan better and seek economies of scale \u2013 thereby enhancing the global competiveness of the European defence technological and industrial base, which is a crucial element for long term security of supply. It is for these reasons that Pooling Demand was named a key enabler for multinational cooperation by the EU Council of 22 March 2012. The European Defence Agency has been at the forefront of pooling demand: its Effective Procurement Methods project is already delivering results, with the launch of two pilot cases in recent months. In association with the European Defence Agency and the Egmont - Royal Institute for International Relations of Belgium, the Cyprus EU Presidency is organizing a high level seminar entitled: \"Innovative European Defence Cooperation - Pooling and Consolidating Demand.\" The seminar will bring together policy makers and senior level experts from governments, industry and institutions to discuss on-going efforts, and to identify those areas where future work would be needed to further implement and complement these initiatives. Pooling Demand: Designed for Member States Pooling of Demand is driven by the Member States. Member States have to identify the areas they are willing to cooperate on, find the appropriate partners and decide on how to structure such a cooperation. The EDA through its Effective Procurement Methods workstrand is on hand to offer its expertise and assistance throughout this process. This flexible, Member State-driven approach ensures that Pooling Demand delivers clear benefits. Some Member States have already gained concrete experience in pooling demand, either in the role of a lead nation managing common demand on behalf of others or as country benefitting from the purchasing services of another country or international body, like the EDA. It is now about sharing these experiences and identifying improvements to existing processes, for the benefit of Member States. From Common Demand to Common Action Finding the right subjects for Pooling Demand is one of the biggest challenges in the process. It is not only about selecting which goods and services to procure, but also about finding an appropriate composition of beneficiaries for a procurement. Cooperative programmes of the past have not automatically led to more effectiveness or efficiency. Therefore, we will have to openly assess the different possibilities and challenges. Comparing governmental and industrial perspectives will help identify promising areas for Pooling Demand and \u2013 just as importantly \u2013 detect areas which are not ready to be included in such efforts. Once, based on consolidated requirements, common demand has been detected, such demand has to be translated into actual cooperation. Working together in the EDA framework is certainly one of the options. But there are a number of other possibilities that may be equally appropriate and worth exploring. At the end of the day, Member States have to identify their preferred collaborative vehicle for a given case. Learning from past experience and building best practices in this regard will help avoiding some of the challenges encountered by past cooperative initiatives. Eventually, through optimising cooperation \u2013 in procurement and beyond \u2013 we will be able to make common efforts more and more attractive. By this, we would contribute to bridge the gap between the common political will for more Pooling of Demand and its practical and concrete implementation.

Some 2700 personnel from all three services and seven countries will take part in Exercise Hot Blade from 4-19 July. The exercise forms part of the European Defence Agency\u2019s Helicopter Training Programme. Exercise Hot Blade draws on forces from Portugal (the hosts), and Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, Austria and Finland - as well as observers from Sweden and the UK. The exercise area covers almost half of Portugal, and will be based at Ovar Air Base near Porto. Portugal are being supported by Luxembourg. Forces have been arriving over the last few days, by sea, land and air in a tricky logistical operation. Today they will receive briefings and prepare; after this evening\u2019s opening ceremony, flying operations proper will begin tomorrow. Hot Blade: Mission Under the overall theme of hot, high and dusty conditions, a broad range of skills will be practiced, including Air Assault, Special Operations Aviation and Casualty Evacuation. In an important innovation, helicopters will work together with F-16 fighters, and crews will train with an embedded civil protection cell. Crews will fly in joint and combined formations, learning to communicate and trust one another in operational scenarios. The mission incorporates lessons learned from recent operations in Afghanistan and Libya. This takes place under an umbrella scenario designed to test planners and crews in realistic conditions. The scenario is based in the fictional Idrasse Peninsula, where an EU Force is tasked with maintaining security conditions for humanitarian activities, surveilling and suppressing illegal armed groups, and deterring territorial incursions by a neighbouring state. Hot Blade: Assets The exercise employs a variety of assets. From Portugal, EH-101 Merlins will fly alongside F-16 fighters and C-160 transport aircraft. These are supported by an Air Force Control and Reporting Centre, a Tactical Air Control Party and a Force Protection Unit. The Portuguese Army have meanwhile contributed a Quick Response Brigade, a Special Operations Troops Centre, and a Commando Troops Centre, while the Portuguese Navy have contributed further Special Operations Forces. From Belgium, A109 helicopters will participate, while Finland is providing NH90 helicopters. Germany is represented by CH53 Sea Stallions, while The Netherlands is contributing Cougar AS-532U2 and Chinook CH47D helicopters. From Austria come Agusta Bell 212 rotary wing assets. Each country will also contribute crews and support staff, and many are also making contributions-in-kind to the running of the exercise. The breadth and variety of air assets, from many European states, presents a great opportunity to test and stretch crews and planners, who will learn to work together under operational pressure. EDA & Helicopter Training Programme The exercise is part of EDA\u2019s Helicopter Training Programme. Hot Blade is the latest in a series of increasingly effective helicopter exercises, held in France, Spain and Italy since 2009. The exercise programme has delivered training to: 72 helicopters, 152 crews and over 1800 personnel. Over 50% crews that have participated have subsequently deployed to Afghanistan. The programme has also involved the creation of the Helicopter Tactics Course in the UK, with 18 crews trained thus far, a new \u2018train-the-trainers\u2019 initiative to be held this year, work to harmonize helicopter flying training across participating Member States, trial courses in Operational English Language learning and experimentation with distributed simulator training.

The European Defence Agency (EDA) and the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR) fulfil complementary roles. In recognition of the close working relations established between EDA and OCCAR and the potential benefits and synergies stemming from still closer cooperation, an Administrative Arrangement (AA) was signed today by Ms Claude-France Arnould, the EDA Chief Executive and Mr. Patrick Bellouard, the OCCAR-EA Director. Claude-France Arnould commented: \u201cThanks to this partnership, a project can be brought from concept to battlefields with fewer delays, delivering at greater speed and greater efficiency for our Member States.\u201d The AA constitutes the foundation and establishes the framework for further cooperation between EDA and OCCAR. EDA and OCCAR will seek to ensure that their activities are coherent, complementary and effective. In pursuing cooperative projects and programmes, EDA and OCCAR will direct their efforts towards enhancing European defence capabilities, improving European Armaments cooperation, and strengthening the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB). Patrick Bellouard expressed his conviction that: \u201cFrom now on, integration into OCCAR of programmes originating from EDA\u2019s work on capabilities and harmonisation of requirements, will run smoother, delivering maximum efficiency for our customers.\u201d Principles of cooperation With the signing of this arrangement, OCCAR and EDA become privileged partners in the field of defence capabilities development. Under the arrangement, EDA and OCCAR will share information on projects and programmes throughout their lifecycle, helping to guarantee a seamless handover in each case, with both parties remaining involved and informed at every stage. EDA and OCCAR can now deepen their cooperation through the administrative arrangement and a security agreement on the exchange of classified information. EDA & OCCAR will subsequently identify cooperative projects initiated and prepared by EDA that may be managed by OCCAR. This Administrative Arrangement forms part of both organisations\u2019 ongoing efforts to engage with all defence stakeholders in Europe, delivering maximum efficiency for Member States. EDA-OCCAR cooperation in practice EDA and OCCAR have cooperated effectively on an ad hoc basis on several major projects. This arrangement incorporates the lessons learned from these projects. For instance, on Maritime Mine Counter-Measures (MMCM), 13 states collaborated within an EDA programme harmonising requirements for the replacement of their capability. France and the UK have drawn from these results to launch a bi-lateral collaborative programme and have mandated OCCAR to manage the programme for two MMCM Mission Packages by 2018. Also for MUSIS, seven Nations are cooperating in the framework of a Letter of Intent in the EDA context, while France and Italy launched the early phases of a bilateral OCCAR managed programme. MUSIS will federate future space systems for surveillance, reconnaissance and observation. Another example is the European Secured Software Radio (ESSOR). An EDA project from 2007, the development of ESSOR has been entrusted to OCCAR with a programme division established in Bonn. This project will improve European military interoperability and help make European industry competitive in this crucial segment of the military communication market. One more example is the Biological Equipment Development and Enhancement Programme (BIO-EDEP). The EDA is currently developing a demonstrator of various subsystems to detect, identify and monitor biological agents, and it is intended to transfer BIO-EDEP to OCCAR within a year. There it will lead to equipment that will enable European forces to operate in a biological threat environment, through increased protection and survivability of individual soldiers and units. Looking ahead, EDA and OCCAR will intensify their cooperation to develop and enhance Europe\u2019s air-to-air refuelling capability \u2013 a vital capacity in modern operations. As a first step they will investigate a multinational solution to fit air-to-air refuelling kits to A400M aircraft with a view to increase the European tactical air-to-air refuelling capability. As a second step they will investigate Multi Role Tanker Transport acquisition options to increase the European strategic air-to-air refuelling capability on the longer term. EDA and OCCAR\u2019s joint efforts are contributing to elaborate a European solution to a European shortfall.

At a conference scheduled to coincide with the EU\u2019s Sustainable Energy Week, high level speakers made a powerful call for the military to shoulder its responsibilities in this domain \u2013 and technical experts plotted ways to do so. Day 1 of the conference focused on the politics of military sustainability. In a series of panel discussions, speakers reflected on the military\u2019s role in green action, from reducing emissions to improving recyclability. Big questions were asked: where is energy and environmental policy going? What will be the impact of those policies on defence and crisis management? What has been achieved so far? And how can the military and defence world comply with current policy, while enhancing its capabilities? The overall message that emerged was one of tempered hope. There was a clear consensus that the military has a role to play in this field, a role which goes beyond merely complying with legal obligations \u2013 though that in itself is a challenge to be tackled. Mr Jose Maria Figueres, the former President of Costa Rica, and now President of the Carbon War Room, addressed the conference on a videolink from Rio de Janeiro. Speaking with passion and detail, he reminded attendees of the big picture; the imperative incumbent on all of us to move to a low-carbon economy. Building on that message, the UK MoD\u2019s Alexis Hammer led the way in proposing solutions, explaining the importance of framing action as producing concrete benefits in lives and money saved, rather than abstract common goods. Numerous speakers concurred, proffering statistics that included that every penny increase in the cost of fuel impoverishes the UK MoD by \u00a313 million a year, while US convoys took one casualty for every 24 convoys they operated in Iraq. This consensus opened the way for a focused debate on the solutions available. David Muchow of Power Anywhere said of the technology for reducing fuel consumption: \u201cIt\u2019s real, it\u2019s here now\u201d, and that was on display in the exhibitions by representatives from industry. Though all showed off innovative products, Belgian company ContenO, which produces mobile water purification & packaging systems, was singled out for a special award for their novel and promising offering. On Day 2, then, technical experts debated how to fulfill the military\u2019s sustainability obligations. Drawing on a number of technical papers, they considered three major areas: systems and architecture; responsible management of munitions and hazardous substances; and improving efficiency and reducing consumption. Paul Johnson recounted his experience in constructing the experimental Power Forward Operating Base to test power-generation technologies, while the EDA\u2019s Tarja Jaakkola offered a European perspective on complying with the Commission\u2019s REACH directive in defence. Jean Perrot, representing EADS France, offered three principles that might summarize the conference. With long timescales, costly equipment and lives on the line, any military sustainability initiative must march to the beat of three words: anticipation, transparency and communication. In the coming months, the European Defence Agency will move forward with its Military Green initiative, helping build consensus and standards among European militaries in support of sustainability. As it does so, it will bear these precepts in mind. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/12-06-21/Military_Green_2012_Examining_sustainability_in_defence"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0918", "date": "2012-06-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Condolences on the death of Lt Gen Juan Luis Abad Cellini", "text": " The European Defence Agency was saddened to hear of the death of Lieutenant General Juan Luis Abad Cellini.

This innovative flying event has brought numerous aircrews up to speed on the latest tactical airlift tactics, and cleared the way for still closer cooperation in this field. Despite the sad death of the Officer Commanding the Exercise, Lt Gen Juan Luis Abad Cellini, the exercise has been a great success. As it draws to a close, we spoke to Laurent Donnet. Laurent has been one the key movers at the European Defence Agency in creating this training course, and he offered some context on the future of European air transport cooperation. Hi Laurent. Tell us about your background. What do you do at the EDA, and what did you do before that? I am a Belgian Air Force lieutenant-colonel. For 16 years I flew F-16\u2019s from wingman to squadron commander. In 2000 I was assigned for three years in the Deployable CAOC in Ramstein to work as ATO coordinator. In 2006 I went for Staff College in Paris. I have now been working at the EDA since April 2009 in the Manoeuver area, looking mainly at airlift issues. Since November 2010 I have also been the Manoeuver Assistant Manager. So tell us a little about EATT \u201912. What was it, and who was involved? EATT is the first multinational air transport live flying training event to take place in Europe. This event focused on airlift-specific tactics, techniques and procedures and allowed their harmonisation leading to more interoperability between EU aircrews. The participants to EATT 2012 were the following: Spain as host nation with a C-130 and a CASA-295, Belgium with a C-130, Czech Republic with a CASA-295, France with a C-130, Germany with two C-160 and finally The Netherlands with a C-130. Austria, Bulgaria, Italy and Norway were all there as observer nation and the chances are high they will participate to EATT 2013. Why was this exercise conducted? What is the importance of this exercise, and why is it exciting? In 2011 19 pMS plus Norway signed up for the European Air Transport Fleet partnership that looks at improving airlift provision in the EU. In this framework an Ad Hoc Working Group Tactical Air Transport (AHWG TAT) was created to identify common issues, problems encountered and lessons learned in order to achieve a far-reaching level of interoperability between tactical airlift users in the area of training and operations. After only two years of work this AHWG can already conduct a first flying event, EATT, which is a pretty good achievement. This first flying event is extremely important to better work together in the future. In Europe airlift training is today a very much national issue and as operating together becomes more the rule than the exception, the need to train together becomes bigger every day. Moreover, this EATT will help develop a European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course (EAATTC) to be organised from 2014. The main value of such a training is to effectively fly the techniques, tactics and procedures that were developed and to get used to fly together. There is no substitute for being airborne. Nothing will beat that, even if you have the best and most advanced flight simulator in the world. How have the preparations been going? The entire preparation was done under the auspices of the AHWG. To be underlined is that this preparation, which was heavy, went well thanks to the huge involvement of the AHWG TAT chairman, LTC Pascal July from the Belgian air force but also thanks to the massive support of the European Air Transport Command (EATC). The Initial Planning Conference took place in Madrid in March 2011, the Main Planning Conference in September and the Final Planning Conference in March. These conferences were absolutely necessary to safeguard a good training event. Nevertheless, separate AHWG meetings were still needed between those main conferences. As you can see, the IPC took place more than one year before EATT. This is a minimum since so many things need to be discussed and arranged, especially for the first one. What are your hopes for the future of air transport training? My hope is that the EU nations will clearly see the benefit they can take out of this type of event and invest manpower and financial resources not only to improve EATT but also in future projects proposed by EATF. This being said, EATF is a Category A programme and thus \u2018owned\u2019 by the pMS. EATF provides a unique framework to tackle airlift issues and the AHWG Tactical Air Transport is the working group created by the pMS to make EU progress towards more airlift interoperability. This opportunity needs to be taken with both hands. What other cooperative initiatives are there in this field? For European air transport this is the only training initiative. A multinational advanced airlift tactics course exists in the US (and some pMS send crews to that course) but besides that, no other known initiative exists in the field of tactical air transport. That\u2019s why it is so important for the European airlift community. EATT seems to be a great example of European defence cooperation. Do you agree? What is your general view of European defence cooperation? I fully agree with the statement that EATT, and I would even say EATF, is an example of European defence cooperation. However, to stay alive, pMS and all concerned organisations and agencies should continue to involve themselves even more in this airlift initiative. It is a very young project and lots of issues still need to be solved. A lot of work has still to be done and it is only with the involvement of all that we will make this an even bigger success. Concerning European defence cooperation I have mixed feelings. Even though pooling resources will save manpower, money and equipment on the medium term, on the short term, to launch those cooperations, most of the times more manpower and money is needed, and that is a challenge in these times. I think we have to invest more to pay less. \u00a0 This Q&A is part of a series.

The flying event is part of the EDA\u2019s ongoing Pooling and Sharing initiative, through which Member States cooperate to increase defence capabilities and save money. It signals important progress on the EDA\u2019s European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) initiative and its work on Pilot Training, as required by the Agency Steering Board in November 2011. EATT2012 As part of the EDA\u2019s work to build a culture of increased cooperation among participating Member States and aiming at increasing interoperability in air transport area, the flying event will allow crews to train and qualify together in specific airlift disciplines. In particular, EATT will consolidate skills in: advanced mission planning; cargo and personnel airdrops; tactical navigation with training of trainers and threat reactions; tactical Air-Land Operations including tactical recoveries, substandard field operations (assault landings), engines running on and offloads and combat offloads; short field landings; formation flying; and night operations. Six of the EDA\u2019s Member States are participating in this flying event: Belgium (1 C-130 with 2 crews); Czech Republic (1 CASA-295 with 2 crews); France (1 C-130 with 2 crews); Germany (2 C-160 with 2 crews); The Netherlands (1 C-130 with 2 crews); Spain (1 C-130 and 1 CASA-295 with 4 crews).

It was for this reason that the EDA Steering Board mandated the Agency to take on pilot training as an area of Pooling & Sharing. A major step towards more combined training as well as harmonization of airlift procedures and processes in Europe was the creation of the Ad Hoc Working Group Tactical Air Transport (AHWG TAT) within the framework of the European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) partnership, an initiative that became a EDA Category A Programme signed so far by 19 participating Member States plus Norway. The AHWG TAT deals with operations and training issues, as well as conducting a yearly European Air Transport Symposium. and conducts a yearly European Air Transport Symposium. In addition, the AHWG TAT, is organizing a second EATT in 2013. With observers from many Member States attending, EATT 2013 is expected to be an even more significant event. All this work will lead to the establishment of a permanent European Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Course (EAATTC) in 2014, modelled on the US course that has operated with great success since 1984. EDA Assistant Manager Laurent Donnet explained that EATT 2012 is part of a larger effort: \u201cpMS and all concerned organisations and agencies should continue to involve themselves even more in this airlift initiative. A lot of work has still to be done and it is only with the involvement of all that we will make this an even bigger success.\u201d Context: Aerial Pooling & Sharing Indeed, defence cooperation initiatives are continuing across the aerial arena. Under the heading of the Agency\u2019s work on Pilot Training, in addition to the air transport initiatives, the Agency is working with pMS to develop an Air Crew Military Licencing system across Europe, using the already delivered EDA analysis of basic helicopter flying training as the start point. This forms part of an extensive and highly successful programme of rotary wing training activity. This year 9 pMS will send crews to tactics simulator courses in the UK and there will be 2 multinational helicopter live-flying exercises in Portugal in July and Belgium in September, involving 10 pMS and over 60 helicopters. All of these signal the excellent progress made by the EDA in the field of European defence cooperation.

The conclusion of the Framework for Cooperation follows a negotiation mandate provided to the Head of the Agency, Baroness Catherine Ashton, by the EDA Steering Board. The EU Council approved the Framework for Cooperation in November 2011. The Framework for Cooperation formalizes the relationship between EDA and Switzerland, thereby enabling Swiss participation in EDA\u2019s projects and programmes. The Framework for Cooperation will allow for pragmatic joint activities in R&T and armaments projects and programmes. Cooperative areas remain to be further defined, but areas such as unmanned aerial systems, information acquisition and processing, cyber security, protection against improvised explosive devices and vehicle protection are examples of potential cooperative areas. At the signature ceremony, Ambassador de Watteville said \u201cSwitzerland is a close partner of the European Union. The signing of the cooperation framework today is proof of this. The closer cooperation in the field of armament will be of benefit for both the EU and Switzerland.\u201d \u201cThis signature is an extremely welcome development for the Agency and European cooperation. Switzerland\u2019s high technological know-how and long-standing cooperation with EU Member States provide an excellent foundation for our common efforts.

Background The European Defence Agency was established under a Joint Action of the Council of Ministers of 12 July, 2004, \u201cto support the Member States and the Council in their effort to improve European defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the European Security and Defence Policy as it stands now and develops in the future\u201d. For the purpose of fulfilling its mission \u2013 to improve EU\u2019s defence capabilities for the Common Security and Defence Policy - the Agency may enter into administrative arrangements with third States, organizations and entities. Such arrangements are a means to support the Agency\u2019s work by establishing mutually beneficial and practical cooperation, including participation in EDA\u2019s projects and programmes. All administrative arrangements are approved by the EU Council. The Head of the Agency is responsible for negotiating these arrangements in accordance with directives given by the EDA Steering Board. EDA has signed an administrative arrangement with Norway (in 2006) and with the European Space Agency (in 2011).", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/03/16/Press_release_-_Signing_of_EDA-Switzerland_Framework_for_Cooperation"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0924", "date": "2012-04-18", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Political resolution drives pooling & sharing", "text": " On 22nd March 2012, European defence ministers met in Brussels, and offered renewed political momentum on defence cooperation. They endorsed the European Defence Agency\u2019s work so far, and mandated it to continue work in new areas. Air-to-Air Refueling has been identified as a vital capability gap for European forces, a fact that was brought home by the Libya campaign. In this field, ministers took action, signing a Political Declaration indicating that Pooling & Sharing efforts in Air-to-Air Refueling should get underway, facilitated by the European Defence Agency. The EDA is consequently working on potential solutions, including a Strategic Air Command-model. The aim is to increase tanker capacity by 2020 in a manner that delivers flexibility, cost-effectiveness, greater interoperability and operational effect. It is hoped that further economies may be found through rationalization and efficient basing arrangements. Ultimately, these capabilities would be available for EU, NATO or other operations by Member States. Progress was also made on the development of a cooperative project to provide field hospitals. Thirteen ministers signed a Declaration of Intent to establish Multinational Modular Medical Units. Based on an vision initiated by Italy, this project is already ahead of schedule. This year, work gets under way on standardization, and by 2014 a deployable capability should be ready for use. Another key decision was the approval of two new projects. The first, Go Green, looks for innovative ways to reduce the use of fossil fuels, potentially by employing solar panels. This will save money, as well as helping the environment and reducing dependence on finite energy resources. The second is the launch of the EU Battle Group Logistic Services Pilot Case. These cooperative pilot projects will help Member States save money and increase capabilities. \u00a0 In the longer term, there was also a ministerial-level consensus that further progress is required on harmonizing regulation, and the Steering Board called for further discussion of the role of financial incentives and opportunities to reinvest all or part of the savings realized through Pooling & Sharing initiatives. Concrete results were agreed in the research field, with the approval of the Second Joint Investment Programme on Innovative Concepts and Emerging Technologies, a two year project with an expected budget of \u20ac10m. Similarly, ministers formally approved the Programme Arrangement of the Research & Technology Joint Investment Programme on CBRN Protection, which develops CBRN protective measures in close coordination with the European Commission and European Space Agency, governed by the European Framework Cooperation. Meanwhile, ministers recognized and complimented the EDA\u2019s recent work in Pooling & Sharing, with especial reference to the European SATCOM Procurement Cell, helicopter training and maritime surveillance. Perhaps the greatest endorsement, though, lies in their calls for the EDA to explore still further areas of defence cooperation. The EDA will build on these concrete results in the coming months, and continue to work with Member States for closer defence cooperation in Europe.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2012/04/18/Political_resolution_drives_pooling_sharing"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0925", "date": "2012-04-04", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "D-FUSE workshop", "text": " The consortium in charge of D-FUSE (Data Fusion in Urban Sensor Networks) organised a dissemination workshop on 6-7 March 2012, at Delft, in the Netherlands.

Pooling and thus consolidating demand does not only respond to a constant call from European Defence Industries but, in times of austerity and declining defence budgets, has also become almost a necessity to further sustain our Armed Forces. As regards economies of scale and shared administrative costs, previous cooperative procurement cases show savings of 20% to up to 50%. From the very beginning, the EPM work strand has followed a twin track approach to develop a generic, slim and flexible concept and to prove it in parallel through actual pilot cases. Our research has revealed the identifying existing common demand is more likely in specific areas of defence procurement which stretch from third party logistics and basic military equipment to ammunition and training services. So it does not come as a surprise that the first pilot cases have been established in exactly these fields.

At a time of increasingly constrained defence budgets in Europe and the US, European (and US) defence companies have a choice of shrinking in line with their domestic defence budgets or seeking greater access to global markets to survive and perhaps thrive in a time of austerity. Consequently, if Europe is to retain a robust Defence Technological Industrial Base we have to work towards maximising the global competitiveness of its industry. This and associated issue of reciprocal market access are key topics in the debate on defence at a time of financial challenge. The EDA Annual Conference 2012 will bring together some of Europe\u2019s leading defence experts to examine these very issues. Among its many advantages defence export success can help provide resources for continued investment in the critical defence research and development that determines future competitiveness and industry\u2019s ability to produce the leading edge defence equipment necessary to capture military sales. An unfortunate consequence of defence budget cuts in Member States has been reductions in government defence R&D. The R&D situation looks bleak and this is at a time when Europe\u2019s significant R&D gap with the US is expanding and R&D investment among competitors is growing. While exports often can only be achieved at the cost of technology transfer and licensed production \u2013 with the associated risk of losing industrial capabilities, skills and technologies, to the detriment of the long term heath of Europe\u2019s Defence Industrial Base (EDTIB) - they can also foster important partnerships and facilitate cooperation that can stimulate technological advancement and innovation. They also help spread some the high overhead costs often associated with defence procurement and provide economies of scale reducing the procurement cost for the domestic European customer. Last year marked the fifth anniversary of the launch of the Intergovernmental Regime on Defence Procurement, a landmark agreement by EU governments towards opening up to competition some of the most sensitive areas of Europe\u2019s defence market. The regime has pioneered a gradual transition from closed and fragmented national markets to a more open, transparent and competitive marketplace where value for money is the key procurement priority. Together with the European Commission\u2019s new defence directives on procurement and intra-Community Transfers real progress has been made towards the creation of an internationally competitive European defence equipment market. These are laudable developments but not enough \u2013 by themselves \u2013 to ensure the future of Europe\u2019s defence industry. If the foreseeable growth in defence markets is, as it seems, to be found outside Europe then industry has to tap into these markets to stay competitive, innovative, and healthy. Better access to the global marketplace therefore has become crucial. At present, it is often hampered by various restrictions and obstacles embedded in national laws, rules, policies and practices as well as export control systems. Some of the challenges are just too great for industry to handle on their own. No serious attention has yet been paid to this issue. Important questions must be addressed on how governments and institutions can play a constructive role in enhancing European defence industries competitiveness and innovative advantage in the global defence market and facilitating market access through concrete measures to limit barriers and inherent obstacles to defence trade. Collectively governments, institutions and industry must develop adequate policies and strategies that would address such issues as technology transfer requirements, local content and work share rules, offsets and juste retour and foreign investment policies. One thing is certain fortress Europe policies and protectionism will not save Europe\u2019s defence industrial base, this is simply a dead end. Europe\u2019s defence industries future depends on looking outward and embracing the challenge of globalisation. The EDA Annual conference will be a first step towards providing solutions on the way forward.

Opinions vary on the damage likely to be inflicted by the latest round of defence cuts but it is clear it that they will make life even more difficult for European industry. EDA\u2019s annual conference hopes to show that there are ways Europe\u2019s industry can survive and prosper in austerity. The first thing to say is that the European Defence Technology and Industrial Base (EDTIB) is not a statistical fact \u2013 it is almost impossible to comprehensively track developments, once you go beyond the prime contractors, as there is no clear data on the industry; a gap that the Agency is working to correct. So it is difficult to make categorical judgements. The suspicion is that the bigger prime contractors, with their wide portfolios will manage better than the smaller supply chain specialists but challenging times are ahead for all. There are also likely to be differences by sector reflecting the different market conditions in the Air, Land, Sea and Space domains. It used to be said that unlike most other industries, the defence business was different, because it depended critically on national governments in their role as regulators, customers and investors. Yet, in Europe at least, this position is changing with the European Commission increasing its regulatory role following its \u201cdefence procurement directive\u201d and national governments\u2019 position as dominant customers and investors often under challenge as budget cuts bite, export markets become increasingly important and national policies on the ownership and control of defence assets allow significant third party investment. The defence industry in many ways is not that different from other markets. It responds to investment. Europe\u2019s defence industry is increasingly service oriented as design, development and production work declines. The question is how far this trend should go; for example what design capabilities should Europe retain and which can it allow to disappear? And how do you ensure the key skills required for future programmes are maintained? Should Europe care about the future of Defence Technology and Industrial Base? Liberal market economists might say no. However, the EDTIB possesses specialist skills, processes, know-how and facilities which are not replicated in the wider commercial economy and not easily reconstituted if lost. If you allow such unique industrial capabilities to wither away you are either consciously disarming (some commentators have already warned of a trend towards demilitarisation in Europe) or committing yourself to long term dependency on specialist skills and facilities outside Europe with the inevitable consequences for autonomy of action. So a robust and competent EDTIB underpins the credibility of Europe\u2019s Common Security and Defence Policy. Allowing the indigenous industrial capability to produce sophisticated defence equipment to erode makes no sense if your ambition is for Europe to play a greater role in world affairs. In fact the contrary is necessary: you must protect what is important by investing in the key industrial capabilities needed for the future. The EDTIB is also a valuable economic asset providing hundreds of thousands of high quality jobs across Europe. With many EU economies on the brink of recession it is worth recalling the full economic value of defence expenditure. There are considerable spill-over benefits to the wider commercial economy from high tech defence investment. This has been demonstrated across all the sectors but most clearly on aerospace. Europe\u2019s problem is that demand, supply and investment are all fragmented. Recognition that a fully adequate DTIB is no longer sustainable on a strictly national basis is widespread but translating this understanding into changed practice is not that straightforward. Europeans need to achieve consolidation on both sides of the market aligning and combining various needs in shared equipment requirements and meeting them from an increasingly integrated EDTIB supported by a rational rather than a fragment approach to R&D investment. Yet such a break from the past requires courage and strong political will if all the obstacles are to be overcome. There is clearly a significant cost associated with Europeans not co-operating on defence and the Agency has launched work to better define this \u201ccost\u201d, part of which relates to industry, and such empirical data will be important in making the case for a more integrated European approach. The EDA Conference will help frame the debate on the prospects for Europe\u2019s defence industries. Where defence equipment is manufactured, where the skills and know-how to maintain and support defence systems is retained matters. It is an important issue with ramifications for Europe\u2019s future role in the world and one we need to get right.

The US spent the equivalent of \u20ac520 billion (or $689 billion). Between 2006 and 2008 the aggregated defence expenditure of the 26 EDA pMS has been about half that of the US. In the years 2009 and 2010 this difference increased. While the EU aggregated defence expenditure decreased from \u20ac201 billion in 2008 to \u20ac194 billion in 2010, US expenditure increased from \u20ac416 billion ($612 billion) to \u20ac520 billion in the same period. \u00a0Photoxpress.com Comparing defence spending with other macroeconomic data, in 2010 US defence expenditure represented 4.8% of GDP and 11.2% of overall government expenditure. In the EU these ratios were, respectively, 1.6% and 3.2%. As for defence expenditure in relation to the total population, the US spent \u20ac1 676 ($2 222) per capita in 2010, while the EU spent on average \u20ac390. In terms of allocation of the defence budget there remain significant differences between the EU and the US. Between 2006 and 2010, EU pMS spent half of their aggregated defence budget on personnel (civilian and military staff). In the US, personnel costs represented slightly less than one third of total defence spending during the same period. Operation and Maintenance costs of EDA pMS were between 22% and 23% of total defence expenditure for the period 2006 to 2010. In the US this percentage was closer to 30%. Another important component of the defence budget is defence Investment (Equipment procurement and R&D/R&T). In the EU the proportion of the budget dedicated to investment has always been lower than in the US (respectively 20% and 30%). However, it increased from 19% in 2006 to 22% in 2010: from \u20ac39 billion in 2006 to \u20ac43 billion in 2010. As for R&D expenditure the US spends more both in absolute terms and as a proportion of defence expenditure. In 2010 EU governments spent in total \u20ac9 billion on defence R&D (4.4% of defence expenditure). For the US these values were, respectively, \u20ac58 billion ($77 billion) and 11.2% (this percentage has however decreased from the 13.2% spent in 2006). Turning to defence personnel, in 2006 total defence staff was higher in the EU than in the US (2.4 million against 2.1 million). Between 2006 and 2010, the number of staff working in defence decreased by 17% in the EU and in the US it increased by 6%. As a result in the past two years (2009 and 2010) the relative position changed and total personnel in the US exceeded the number of personnel in the EU (2.2 million and 2.0 million respectively in 2010). Military personnel represents 80% of total personnel in the EU while in the US the proportion is 66% (these proportions have remained constant for the period 2006 to 2010). In terms of absolute figures, the US has twice as many civilian defence staff as the EU (778 thousand and 390 thousand), whereas the EU has more military staff than the US (1.6 million in the EU against 1.4 million in the US). In terms of deployed personnel, the US deployed on average almost 200 000 troops. This represents 14% of military personnel. The EU deployed 66 000 troops, 4% of the total military personnel.

Precision Guided Ammunition (PGA) is tailored to achieve precision effects. For this reason it is identified as an area of strategic importance both from the military capabilities perspective as well as from technological and industrial point of view. The current situation shows that the European Capability to provide Precision Guided Ammunition (PGA) needs to be preserved and further developed to fulfill future needs and to avoid dependencies on non-European sources for critical skills and technologies. To assure future military operations, the supply of European PGA must be secured. In December 2010, EDA signed a contract for a one year study, to provide a step by step plan to develop a more robust competitive ammunition industry, able to provide the member states with the PGA capability required in the time frame of 2020. Main objective of the study was to provide a Roadmap and Implementation Plan on Precision Guided Ammunition, capturing military requirements and analyzing the capability of the European industry to develop and produce PGAs able to meet Member States\u2019 requirements. Methodology The study-contractor (an industry team lead by BAE Systems and including Diehl BGT Defence, EXPAL Systems, MBDA, Nexter Munitions, OTO Melara, Rheinmetall Defence, SAGEM and TDA Armements SAS) conducted the study and reported to EDA and its Member States\u2019 representatives coming from various fields of expertise (capability development, Research & Technology, procurement, etc.) Input was collected from companies all around Europe, including primes and major as well as small subcontractors in the ammunition area, but also institutes and academia\u2019s Sub Matter Experts. The starting points of the study were some studies analyzing capability needs, (including EDA\u2019s Capability Development Plan), EU/EDA\u2019s Capability \u2018Lessons learned\u2019 documents, and also relevant LoI and NATO/NIAG studies. This was complemented with Member States expert\u2019s views, collected through questionnaires and workshops. The complete Precision Fire Support Engagement process has been evaluated by use of 12 scenarios, derived from previous land studies and pMS\u2019 requirements. Areas such as engagement cycles, fire support organizations and key requirements have been studied. The results were presented to the Member States and other stakeholders for review, feedback and further comments either during workshops or by sending out completed documents. The State of Play of the European industry was evaluated in a similar way. A significant amount of data about existing and planned products, capabilities and resources for development and testing and crucial technologies for precision guided munitions in Europe was collected from experts in main suppliers and subcontractors, academia, institutes and Ministries of Defence. Preliminary results were discussed with focused expert groups, such as the European Network of National Safety Authorities on Ammunition (ENNSA) and EDA\u2019s group on the Defence Test & Evaluation Base. After collecting data on Future Capability needs in Europe and about the industrial State of Play in PGAs, a deep gap analysis was performed. The objective was to make an assessment of the European industry concerning its ability to develop and produce Precision Guided Ammunition, using European and ITAR-free components and to identify potential gaps to perform against future national and EU scenarios. The analysis assessed existing or potential obstacles and other factors, such as Technology Gaps, Economic Shortfalls or Non-EU Dependencies. Conclusions from this analysis fed the next phase of the project that consisted in the design of the Roadmap and Implementation Plan of Actions - which was the final delivery of the Study. Key Conclusions At the end of the Study some clear key conclusions can be derived: Capabilities Analysis Member States have a clear need for Precision Guided Ammunition. The study identified similarities but also differences amongst Member States requirements concerning for example the expected precision, dispersion, etc. The requirements do not differ in essential parameters between artillery, mortar or naval support areas, except for range capability of the projectile. Different kinds of communication tools to permit additional functionality, such as mission abort, or to change the terminal effect, are considered important. Certain levels of conformity in requirements among Member States have been identified. A harmonization of these requirements (fully or in part) would be preferred to achieve both improved interoperability and increased Security of Supply. The latter requirement in particular may support the creation of a new business model across Europe. State of Play Analysis The data collection also gave a good view of the Ammunition industrial base in Europe. Few delivered PGA products and on-going development programs were identified within the EU. However, sufficient capabilities exist (dispersed around various countries) for development, qualification and manufacturing of Precision Guided Ammunition and would create a solid base for a secured chain of supply for future PGA military requirements. The bigger part of the main technology or capability base is ITAR-Free, but on critical areas dependencies is an existing (or potential) threat for Europe\u2019s capacity on PGAs in the future. GPS receivers were the most frequently mentioned ITAR component; it was noted that several Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers are available in Europe. However, in other critical areas like rare earth materials or production of electronics, dependencies and cost issues were identified. Some of these areas are shared with other parts of civilian and defence industry and a joint solution would be preferred. Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products might be introduced to PGA military solutions on component level. Standards for qualification and testing and the need of appropriate test facilities for PGAs were especially evaluated and discussed with both pMS and specialised EDA\u2019s groups of Member States experts. This area is considered to be very demanding both in terms of costs as well as provision of sufficient safety areas during tests. Gap Analysis The gaps that have been identified in the areas of technologies, funding and other resources can be sorted in three main groups. The first group which is considered to become critical is the one of components, materials and technologies not existing in Europe. This group would need an early investment and additional sources in Europe need to be established to secure the European sovereign supply of military components. The second group is technology gaps where there are few resources or little knowledge available in Europe. Products may be world-class but with only one source, or others may not be purchased for development programs very often, with the additional risk that those resources (or that knowledge) may disappear if not exercised or supported. A number of components and products were identified in this group. The last group includes the capabilities that are currently available in Europe but about which there is a perceived real risk of total loss of that capability if the resource is not exercised in any development programmes. Mapped safety and qualification standards have been analysed. Existing standards are not considered to be sufficient for new versions of PGA. Given the expected time consuming process to achieve a set of European standardized test requirements, it is recommended that activities should commence very soon to get agreements in place in the next five years by leveraging on the ENNSA group. The culture of the low-quantity missile testing regime may need to influence the traditional thinking about ammunition thinking, based on high numbers of live firing. European facilities and proving grounds have been assessed and analysed. For military systems, a lot of testing and qualification procedures are normally required, which is time-consuming and very expensive - especially in the Precision Guided Ammunition area - and activities to preserve existing resources are needed. Some proposals regarding test facilities are included in the study-results for future considerations. In addition, it is clear that development and qualification costs can only be reduced by collaboration and sharing of international test facilities. Economic gap analysis was done according to the ability to deliver a PGA capability in within the upcoming decade. The impact of the upcoming economic crisis cannot be clearly seen. Other rationales such as political priorities, ongoing military contracts and personal expenditures will have influence on Defence spending. Improvement of coordination between countries will support cost reduction efforts, both on short and long-terms. Meanwhile, the funding of relevant technologies by non-European countries, is increasing. The need for economic cooperation between European Ministries of Defence is seen to be the most important factor in achieving a European PGA capability and the only real possibility. Roadmap and Implementation plan The study has identified and described five generic PGA concepts which cover the full potential of precision enhancement. These concepts are evaluated both against general requirements, associated technologies knowledge base and the need for facilities. Priority measures to close identified gaps in the supply chain have been identified and prioritised. Some identified areas, such as material dependencies, are shared with a wider community and joint solutions are preferred. The major result of the study is the Roadmap and Implementation Plan that covers a ten years cycle of proposed activities. It includes the foundation of a European PGA forum, discussions about European production of identified critical components and, the definition of a joint European PGA program. A full list of actions is proposed, with an assessment based on priority, risk and cost. Way ahead Member States are currently assessing the study-results to evaluate and undertake necessary actions on the implementation of the Roadmap. A timely start of the implementation process is an imperative for maintaining the European option for a capability at the required moment. The European Precision Guided Ammunition Forum is an effective instrument to ignite the process. EDA will present the study results to the proper Member States\u2019 experts working groups and to relevant fora, to better assess the results and to better assist Member States\u2019 decision making process. In that frame, specialised workshops are also planned with the participation of industry and academia/technology institutes. *By Pieter Taal, EDA\u2019s Industry & Market Assistant Director, and Vassilis Tsiamis, Senior Officer Defence Industry, Industry and Market Directorate", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/12-03-07/Roadmap_and_Implementation_Plan_on_Precision_Guided_Ammunition"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0931", "date": "2011-11-24", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Refocusing defence: European perspective on defence cooperation in a time of financial challenge", "text": " EU Member States have acknowledged that in today\u2019s climate of austerity, enhanced defence cooperation, particularly through the pooling & sharing of assets and capabilities, is more than ever necessary to retain effective military capabilities.

This is one of the important topics which will be addressed at EDA\u2019s annual conference on 31 January 2012. As\u00a0EDA data shows, Europe\u2019s defence expenditure has been declining steadily since 2005. The current crisis has made matters worse. Yet Europe collectively still spends around 200bn Euros per year. The challenge is for Member States to invest in a more efficient way so that Europe can retain and sustain the effective military capabilities it needs to play its role in the world. Given the budgetary pressures it would be all too easy to conclude that individually Member States have no option but to cut military capabilities. But difficult times call for imaginative policies and new approaches. The Pooling and Sharing concept provides Defence Ministries with an opportunity to \u201cprosper\u201d collectively rather than \u201cdecline\u201d individually. It needs to be exploited to the full. Defence Ministers have recognised that it is better to have excellent collective capabilities than unsustainable or unattainable national ones. Since the informal EU Defence Ministerial at Ghent in 2010 there has been a strong political will to pool and share capabilities more systematically. This powerful political dynamic for progress was evident in\u00a0last month\u2019s EDA Ministerial Board which saw overwhelming support for EDA's activities in support of Member States. But the actual practice of pooling and sharing does not occur overnight. It needs hard work to get projects started. The move from a national approach to a collaborative one \u2013 such as pooling and sharing - is to a large extent about a change of culture. Member States need to consider whether they can live with giving up national control and accept a degree of interdependence. These are challenging notions, particularly in the area of defence, where sovereignty often plays an important part in national decision-making. And there are also important practical aspects related to sharing military capabilities: a likeminded partner (or partners) needs to be identified; and that \u201clike-mindedness\u201d must have a very good chance of being sustained in the long term and at moments of crisis and perhaps in extremis war. That is why much of pooling and sharing in the past has been regional - linking countries with the same geopolitical outlook. Member States with strong pre-existing patterns of co-operation and a largely common outlook: Nordic Defence cooperation being an excellent example. There is a need to prioritise the work and to focus on those projects that will have the biggest impact - which will retain or deliver key military capabilities that are otherwise at risk, or which save significant sums of money. The first targets should be those activities which will deliver the most added value. Delivering major Pooling and Sharing projects will be important but of equal if not greater long term value is the need for a more sustainable, structured approach to multinational cooperation. There is a requirement to develop new, more efficient ways of doing collaborative business if Europe wants to sustain and develop its defence capabilities in this period of financial austerity given that these financial difficulties could well last for some time. It is for Member States to decide whether and, if so, with whom they pool and share. But EDA can help them work more effectively: amongst other things by acting as a support hub, identifying best practice and the key lessons learnt from previous programmes, including important factors such as getting the business case right and understanding the industrial perspective. Pooling and sharing is not always straightforward. Nor is it risk-free. Ministers have seen the enormous potential to unlock significant financial and military benefits - EDA's task is to help Member States deliver them. That will require imagination, innovation, risk-taking and hard work. Yet given the budget situation, is there an alternative? Without transformation Europe risks having hollow forces: undermining the future effectiveness of national capabilities and Member States\u2019 ability to contribute to crisis management. The bottom line is that Europe\u2019s role in the world can only be sustained through better cooperation.

It is a well-established and recognized exercise. Data are always from the previous year, because they are the most reliable. Analysis has been conducted over period 2006-2010. The data given now to the media are only collective figures. It should be noted that there are big differences between individual Member States. National breakdown data will be provided by mid-January after the standard consultation process has taken place asking for authorisation (the data are owned by the pMS; EDA is only the custodian of the data). KEY FINDINGS In 2010, total defence spending by EDA 26 pMS remained constant at EUR 194 billion. This represents 1.6% of total GDP or 3.2% of Total Government Expenditure. However, if inflation is taken into account, we can see that defence spending in real terms decreased not only in 2010 but it has been decreasing since 2006. Personnel-related expenditure represents 50% of total defence expenditure. The second biggest component of defence spend is Operation and Maintenance with a share of 23% amounting to EUR 44 billion, followed by Investment which takes up almost EUR 43 billion or a share of 22%, the highest since 2006 both in absolute value and share of total defence budget. Analysing now the different Investment components, in 2010 equipment procurement (which represents 80% of total Investment) increased by 5.5% reaching EUR 34 billion. Research and Technology (R&T, including basic research, applied research and technology demonstration, leaving out expenditure for demonstration) it continues in a decreasing trend, amounting in 2010 to about EUR 2 billion. Looking at European Collaboration, in 2010 collaborative equipment procurement increased for the fourth consecutive year and is now more than EUR 7.5 billion. This represents 22% of the total defence equipment procurement, the same as in 2009 but still the highest share since 2006. As for European Collaboration in R&T, it decreased for the second year being now at its lowest value since 2006, EUR 246 million and the lowest share of total R&T expenditure since 2007, 11.8%. As for personnel, in 2010 there was a reduction, continuing an already 4 year trend. Military staff, which represents 80% of total defence staff decreased by almost 3% to 1.62 million. Civilian staff decreased by more than 8% and went below 390 thousand. Despite this decrease in personnel numbers, after a drop of EUR 9 billion in 2009, the total personnel expenditure increased marginally in 2010 from EUR 98.4 billion to EUR 98.7 billion. Turning now to deployed operations outside the EU territory, similar to what happened in 2009, in 2010 the average number of troops deployed throughout the year decreased (from 68 to 66 thousand) and was now at its lowest value since 2006. However, the costs with the deployment of troops increased in 2010 for the fourth consecutive year reaching EUR 10 billion (or 5% of total defence expenditure). If we look at the operation costs per military deployed we see that they have been steadily increasing and the 157 thousand euros of 2010 represent almost the double as the value in 2006.

At the recent Steering Board of the European Defence Agency (EDA) on 30 November 2011, European Ministers of Defence had an intense discussion on Pooling & Sharing, an EU flagship initiative aiming at increasing further multinational cooperation among European Union Member States. Pooling & Sharing can take various forms, like common training, common logistic support solutions or combining transport capacities, but all have one thing in common: the aim to use decreasing resources in a more efficient and effective way through collaboration and prevention of redundancies. It goes without saying that procurement is an area very well-suited to the increase in the effectiveness of military spending. This is also reflected in the EDA\u2019s mandate as laid down in Art 45 of the Treaty on European Union which tasks the Agency, among other things, to promote the adoption of effective procurement methods as well as to contribute to identifying and, if necessary, implementing any useful measure for strengthening the technological and industrial base of the defence sector and for improving the effectiveness of military expenditure. Accordingly, the Ministers of Defence, during the previous Steering Board in May this year, called upon the EDA to explore new opportunities for more effective procurement methods through developing practical and innovative ways for more cooperative action, including common military and commercial off-the-shelf procurement and to develop guidelines and best practices facilitating bi- and multilateral collaborative procurement. In the current economic climate, implementing these tasks becomes even more pressing to ensure the continuous support of our Armed Forces by getting best value for money at the same time. In some instances and for some EU Member States pooling demand could actually be the only way to grant access to a specific capability. Pooling demand should automatically lead to more consolidation and more standardisation on the buyers\u2019 side of the European Defence Equipment Market, which in turn should contribute to an improvement of interoperability and permit industries to attain bigger production lots with better planning, again reducing unit cost and therefore prices. By the same token, pooled and consolidated demand could be an incentive for the defence industries of EU countries to intensify their cross-border cooperation and consolidation. Identifying existing common demand. Now it is up to the EDA to translate this strategic mandate into concrete action, and we are doing it through a newly introduced work strand called Effective Procurement Methods (EPM). In principle, EPM can cover all areas of procurement, including procurement of R&T services, development programmes and off-the-shelf procurement of the entire range of defence equipment, materiel and services. However, given the fact that there are already processes in place to cover specifically co-operative R&T and development programmes, for the time being, we focus with this new initiative on common off-the-shelf procurement. This will also help us to circumvent the \u201ctrouble zones\u201d of defence cooperation \u2013 which is often the common development phase \u2013 and to make the benefits for Member States more evident. As this initiative at this time is not about developing or generating common demand, the most crucial, but also most challenging, element of EPM is the identification of existing common demand. Trying to do this for a group of 26 EDA participating Member States is impossible of course, so we focus on identifying common requirements of smaller groups of Member States. We have already identified that this requires a very active role of the Agency. We must not put any additional burden on Member States who, in many cases, do already have to cope with personnel reduction while their tasks do not shrink but often expand. This is why it is of utmost importance that we rely on existing data sources for the identification of common demand. The EDA has a number of such sources already, like the Collaborative Data Base (CoDaBa) or the various Integrated Development Teams (IDTs). Now we have to search actively for potential matches in these data sources and liaise with the Member States concerned on a bi- and multilateral basis to understand their readiness for common action. The feed-back from Member States so far is very encouraging. Not only smaller Member States but also bigger nations seem more and more to accept that sustaining their national Armed Forces entirely through national solutions is not always a viable approach in the long run. This change of attitude has only recently been manifested in a data collecting exercise on Pooling & Sharing conducted by the European Union Military Committee the outcome of which was presented to the Council of the European Union in November this year. \u00a0 In this exercise Member States named procurement as their preferred option for Pooling & Sharing for a number of areas including Transport and Logistic Support (Medevac, deployable medical structures, medical support, helicopter availability, basic logistics \u2013 food, water, fuel \u2013 and camp construction), Education and Training (CBRN training, logistics staff training, pilot training, helicopter training and flight simulator training), Vehicles (multi-lift, soft-skin vehicles, wheeled armoured personal carriers as well as heavy and light wheeled vehicles), Ammunition, Weapons and Individual Equipment (rocket launcher, auxiliary equipment field artillery, non-guided ammunition, light weapons, mines and explosive devices) and Communications. This comprehensive list does not only reflect the increasing preparedness of Member States for common procurement but also represents a good starting point for us in the EDA to identify the products and services eligible for pooling off-the-shelf demand and so to decide where we should focus our efforts on. If we, on top of that, concentrate at first on highly standardised products, this will reduce the desire for national solutions and so overcome one of the chief obstacles to cooperation. Translating Common Demand into Common Action. In essence, EPM is not about developing something new, it is about using existing tools in a better way. Therefore we are developing this initiative along with Member States and relevant inter-governmental organisations as well as industry with the aim to learn from best practices and expand them to a greater group of users. The EDA, with its unique structure linking Capability Development, Defence Research & Technology, Armaments and Industry & Market elements, is a natural place for such an exercise and will facilitate the identification of pilot cases to prove and refine the concept over time. Additionally, the EDA\u2019s legal framework, reinforced through its Council Decision 2011/411/CFSP, provides for a sound basis for multinational ad hoc cooperation which is exactly what is needed to launch real common procurement cases. EPM will bring together smaller groups of Member States which makes it an \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d concept. Such intergovernmental cooperation within the EDA is typically based on the provisions of so-called ad hoc Category B projects. This procedure is widely acknowledged and used in the areas of R&T and Development programmes. It basically offers the possibility to Member States to propose to the EDA Steering Board an ad hoc cooperation combined with an opt-in phase for other Member States to join. If not rejected by the Steering Board this ad hoc cooperation becomes an EDA Category B project enabling the contributing Member States to use the services of the Agency. For EPM cases, such Category B projects could be used to develop common technical requirements on the basis of pre-identified common demand. It would establish some general rules on how to organise the intergovernmental cooperation and it would identify who would act as the common contracting body. In this regard, we have a number of different options. A Lead Nation option is perhaps the most prominent one. In such case, a lead nation would procure on behalf of a group of Member States or simply include in its national contract an option for other interested countries. Another possible option is that a group of Member States identifies and shapes their common demand within an EDA Category B project but then decides to have the actual procurement done by another international body. In any of these cases we have to make sure that the procurement processes and models are as flexible as possible when meeting the different requirements of the Member States and at the same time ensuring transparency and competition. To avoid upfront commitment of Member States and to cope with different budgetary cycles, Framework Agreements stretching over a certain period of time seem to be a worthwhile option. This would not only be beneficial to the Member States contributing to a specific common procurement case but would also allow industry to better utilise their production lines. We are still at the starting point but the interest and feedback from Member States is encouraging and are proof that we are on the right track. One by one, pilot cases will show the benefits and more and more Member States will acknowledge the advantages of European cooperation. This will further reduce fragmentation to the point where we create a real European Defence Equipment Market and a genuine European Defence Technological and Industrial Base. by Reinhard Marak, EDA\u2019s Senior Officer for Defence Market.

The military have been studying SDR for a long time and has adopted the Software Communication Architecture (SCA) as the \u201cde-facto\u201d standard upon which different solutions can be developed. SCA is published by the Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO, under the umbrella of the US Department of Defence - DoD) of the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS). This architecture has been developed to assist in the development of SDR communication systems and captures the benefits of most recent technology advances to greatly enhance the interoperability of communication systems and reduce development and deployment costs. Together with the SCA architecture (v 2.2.2 now evolving to the so-called \u201cSCA Next\u201d), the JPEO has also published a number of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), to allow software components to communicate with each other, but some have a restricted access (basically security and crypto APIs). On this side of the ocean two programmes are currently working on the same topic. ESSOR\u00a0(European Secure Software Radio Program) is a programme realised as a joint effort between six nations: Finland, France, Italy, Poland, Spain and Sweden and managed by OCCAR (Organization for Joint Armament Cooperation). ESSOR is based on the (public) SCA architecture (SCA 2.2.2 and JTRS 1.0.3 APIs) and aims at developing an architecture of Software Defined Radio (SDR) for military purposes and a military High Data Rate Waveform (HDR WF) compliant with such an architecture. SVFuA is the German national programme aiming at developing an architecture of SDR to be used by the Bundeswehr, the German Federal Armed Forces. Also, in this case the starting point is the public SCA architecture (SCA 2.2.2 and JTRS 1.0.3 APIs). With respect to the ESSOR programme, Germany doesn\u2019t currently have any national military High Data Rate Waveform (HDR WF) initiatives, but rely on another programme, COALWNW (Coalition Wideband Networking Waveform), to satisfy their operational requirements. The COALWNW objective is to realise a wideband, networking High Data Rate Waveform (similar to the one under development in ESSOR) to pass secure voice, video, and data among Coalition Partners. Partners of this programme are: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, Australia, Sweden, Finland and Spain. The coexistence of a US programme (JTRS) and two European programmes (ESSOR and SVFuA) for the SCA-based SDR architecture plus one transatlantic programme for an HDR waveform translates into two risks that need to be managed: - duplication of effort; and the - loss of interoperability both at European level and transatlantic level. This paper describes a model which has been proposed to overcome these issues and reach in a reasonable timeframe a converged SDR standard to be used in joint operations. EDA and SDR Software Defined Radio is a key issue in the European Defence Agency\u2019s agenda as it is seen as a means to maximise interoperability amongst coalition forces. The approach favoured by EDA is to push for an \u201cinternational SDR standard\u201d. In November 2009, with the help of the Finnish armed forces, the EDA organised a Conference in Helsinki to address this topic. The Conference brought together international key stake-holders and speakers from EDA, ESSOR, US JPEO, NATO, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the Wireless Innovations Forum (WINNF). The main achievements of the conference was the initial consensus on the principle to approach standardisation with what was then known as the \u201cthree basket model\u201d and that ETSI, together with the Wireless Innovation Forum, were possible candidates for the custodianship of some international SDR standards. All this then depended on final agreements with the involved governmental stakeholders. The model sees SDR architecture standardisation falling into three different baskets. The first basket is related to market driven technologies that are available to everyone, where the Governmental Stakeholder Group, i.e. contributing nations, would control the content and release of defence related product specifications in order to guarantee compatibility with non-public API specifications as well as backward compatibility. The second basket includes more sensitive issues, like security and crypto APIs, where the governments, as trusted partners, would remain in charge of custodianship. There may be also need for a third basket which deals specifically with Nation sensitive information. Since the very first time the three basket model was presented, lots of discussions on how to make it happen started. One point of common agreement is that it would be beneficial for the military SDR community to transfer control of the standardisation activities to a Standard Developing Organisation (SDO), at least for that part of the standard not containing sensitive information (and so not restricted). Some advantages of such an approach would be the following: avoiding duplication of work and divergences, which could hamper interoperability; the reduction of costs; and the fostering of harmonisation and help with speeding up the convergence process. During the workshop on SDR and Cognitive Radio (CR) standardisation that took place on the 17/18 November 2011 in Ispra (organised by the Joint Research Centre \u2013 JRC - and co-hosted by the Directorate General Enterprise and Industry - DG ENTR \u2013 and EDA), ETSI, in cooperation with the EDA and the JRC, presented a model aiming at reaching a European standard in the short/medium term and a converged standard allowing transatlantic interoperability in the mid/long term (i.e. between Europe and the US), which is of paramount importance for joint operations. It is important to remark that this model: has not been endorsed yet by EU stakeholders, but all are showing great interest; is perfectly aligned with the objectives of the EU government standardisation strategies (mainly ESSOR); foresees since the beginning, the presence of both WINNF and the US government and industries (if available to participate). is also aligned with the three basket model as it involves an officially recognised European Standard Organization (ETSI) for all those standardisation activities not requiring any restriction, which corresponds to basket one of the three basket model. The ETSI-EDA Model The model is based on the assumption that, while a \u201ctransatlantic\u201d SDR standard for a military application is certainly the ultimate aim, in the short term at least a US programme and a European programme will continue to exist separately. This is also due to the fact the US programme is more advanced than the European ones (ESSOR and SFVuA) and therefore a convergence and harmonisation can best take place in the medium/long term. The model takes into account these considerations and allows for a seamless transition within the same standardisation body from \u201cregional standards\u201d to an \u201cinternational standard\u201d without hampering, in the short term, the developments of existing programmes. It is here assumed that the European standardisation activities will take place in a dedicated Working Group (WG5) of the Technical Committee Reconfigurable Radio System (TC RRS). TC RRS is responsible within ETSI for SDR and CR standardisation and therefore is the natural host for SDR standardisation for military applications. Two options are possible: in the first case TC RRS will host the standardisation activities related to a European standard while in the second case an ideal model is drawn where the two short-term regional standards are developed in the same committee, i.e. ETSI TC RRS. In both cases interoperability, i.e. a converged standard for joint operations, is considered essential for the mid/long term achievement. The model for the EC standard The starting point is the ongoing regional European programmes, i.e. ESSOR and SVFuA. A set of interoperability specifications (to be developed in cooperation with the US) would speed up the \u201cmigration\u201d towards a converged standard, which is supposed to take place in the medium/long term. \u00a0Figure 1: SCA-based SDR European Standard The WINNF, with its technical expertise in SCA, could provide support to the standard development and help coordinating the technical and market requirements with respect to the US programme. This will assure a gradual convergence towards the \u201cinternational standard\u201d, which remains the final target for the mid/long term. The Interoperability Specifications produced are therefore expected to provide the baselines for such a convergence. The Model for the Converged Standard The following section describes the model for achieving an international standard in the mid/long term. Although ETSI has had preliminary discussions with the US on this topic and a positive feedback has been received, the final model to be applied has not yet been agreed. As shown in Figure 2 below, in the short term it is envisaged to have two different regional standards as well as a set of interoperability specifications (for instance under the form of ETSI Technical Specifications and/or feasibility studies (ETSI Technical Reports) that would \u201ccomplement\u201d the regional standard themselves. It is assumed that the starting points are the ongoing regional programmes, i.e.: ESSOR/SVFuA for the \u201cregional standard 1\u201d, i.e. for the European Standard; and JTRS specification for the \u201cregional standard 2\u201d, i.e. for the US Standard. The set of interoperability specifications complementing the regional standards would speed up the \u201cmigration\u201d towards a converged standard, which is supposed to take place in the medium/long term. \u00a0Figure 2: Model for a converged standard \u2013 one dedicated WG \u00a0 The two regional standards would be developed independently of each other in the same committee without forgetting the interoperability element which is essential for the development of a single standard in the mid/long term. In this regard it is clearly an advantage to have all these activities within the same committee as it will optimise resources (some stakeholders might be interested in participating actively in the development of both regional standards). At the same time the WINNF, with its technical expertise in SCA, would provide support to the standard development and would help in the coordination of technical and market requirements. In Figure 2 it is assumed that these activities will take place in a single Working Group (WG5) but it would be also possible to create two separate Working Groups for the two regional standards (WG5 and WG6). In this case the two working groups are supposed to coordinate their activities in order to minimise the duplication of work and maximise interoperability in the short term. The model is shown in Figure 3. \u00a0Figure 3: Model for a converged standard \u2013 two dedicated WGs Conclusions This paper has presented the EDA-ETSI model for starting military SDR standardisation in the most efficient way. ETSI is an officially recognised European Standard Organization (ESO) and a Global Standard Producer (GSP) and can thus offer a single \u201cforum\u201d where standardisation activities can start and evolve in the medium/long term towards a true transatlantic and globally recognised standard. * By Carlo ZAMMARIELLO, EDA Software Defined Radio Principal Officer, and Andrea LORELLI,\u00a0ETSI TC RRS Technical Officer.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/12-01-11/Towards_SDR_standardisation_for_military_applications"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0936", "date": "2011-10-14", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Industry Day Route Clearance", "text": " The European Defence Agency, in close cooperation with Italy (Lead Nation on the Route Clearance workstream of the Project Team C-IED), recently organized a Route Clearance Industry Day on 27-28 September at the Italian C-IED Centre for Excellence in Cecchignola, Rome. \u00a0 Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) continue to cause significant casualties on operations and are amongst the most significant operational challenges. It is important to address all aspects of countering IEDs and part of this is ensuring mobility in an IED environment. For this reason a Route Clearance Capability is required. Many of the Member States who have identified a need for this requirement have acquired the capability as part of an Urgent Operational Requirement (UOR) process. Nations are now examining the longer term next generation solutions. The aim of the Industry Day was to provide industries and pMS with an overview on the state of play of this work strand and the conceptual base summarised by pMS experts in a framework document on Future Route Clearance Capability Development. This overview of Common Military Requirements for Future Route Clearance will allow industries to prepare themselves for eventually supporting the development of the envisaged capability. This initial brief to industry should be the first step along the road to closer cooperation in the development of new capabilities and give industry a better understanding of defence requirements in this area. Industries with relevant expertise were invited to give a presentation on their current capabilities and ideas to pMS Route Clearance experts and to EDA. A number of CIED related capabilities were briefed which left the Member States with a better appreciation for the current state of the art technologies and it was therefore possible to reconsider the capabilities that could be demanded in this essential area. The event was well attended by 26 industries from European Member States with more than 100 delegates. Representatives from nine EDA Participating Member States were also present at the event.

Delivering credible defence capabilities is also about getting the underlying economics right; about having sufficient, sustainable resources available. and about retaining independence of action or \u201coperational sovereignty\u201d. Recalibrating Defence in the new financial environment At the moment European governments are going through a financial crisis which has further accelerated cuts in defence budgets. Europe\u2019s ability to deliver effective military capabilities risks being eroded as Defence Ministries respond to their share of budget reductions. To keep the same military capabilities and to satisfactorily prepare for emerging threats with smaller budgets, a new approach is required. A more systematic \u201cPooling and Sharing\u201d of military capabilities \u2013 doing more together \u2013 is a response to these financial pressures. Member States are increasingly recognising that, in certain areas, it is better to have excellent shared capabilities rather than unsustainable national ones. They are responding to the challenge and searching for innovative ways to deliver more military capabilities together. EDA is playing a key role in supporting their efforts, acting as a hub to facilitate Member States\u2019 initiatives on a European collaborative basis. More off-the-shelf procurement, with greater openness to competition, is also seen by governments as a means of living within constrained budgets. This is consistent with the European defence package which entered into force this summer with the objective of strengthening an open and competitive European Defence Equipment Market and a long-term and genuine European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB). These developments have the potential to have far-reaching implications for Europe\u2019s Defence including for its defence industry. EDA\u2019s role in strengthening the EDTIB EDA is supporting Member States in identifying and analysing the implications of the changing business environment to Europe\u2019s Defence Technological and Industrial Base. Only with a realistic appreciation of industry\u2019s broad capabilities, including a good understanding of its limitations, can Member States ensure that their strategies will be supported by a strong and viable industrial base. In this context the Agency is assessing progress on and considering an update of the 2007 Ministerial EDTIB Strategy. That document was a call for Member States to adopt a more collective, European approach to the industrial base matters rather than a range of purely national ones \u2013 \u201cto recognise that a fully adequate DTIB is no longer sustainable on a strictly national basis\u201d and to \u201cdevelop a truly European DTIB\u201d. Inter alia the Strategy noted the importance of identifying Europe\u2019s key industrial capabilities and need for less dependence on non-European sources of supply, both of which are important parts of EDA\u2019s on-going work. Industrial Capabilities at risk European governments\u2019 investment decisions underpin the future of the EDTIB. Their funding of military R&T is crucial to the sector\u2019s future competitiveness and their decisions as customers shape its future size and structure. However, defence planners can take industrial capacity as a given, and perhaps be unaware of issues such as non-European dependence and long term security of supply. The risk is that for short and medium term financial expediency decisions could be taken which have a negative effect on the industrial capabilities required for the future. The situation is further complicated by a mismatch between the evolution of governmental defence policy and decision making in privately owned defence companies. Ensuring that the value of Industrial capabilities is understood In market economies it is only reasonable that industry makes money; defence companies are no different. Driven by the need to demonstrate shareholder value, companies can quickly shed industrial capabilities where there is no sign of sustaining government contracts. Companies can (and do) change business. Industrial capabilities \u2013 specialist competences - that can take many years to establish can be shed very quickly. Sometimes this happens through strategic decisions at corporate level; other times through middle managers \u201cgood housekeeping\u201d measures: either way the outcome can be damaging. Reconstituting such capabilities is time-consuming and often prohibitively expensive. Obviously if you are dependent on non-European suppliers the case is the same but the decision is out of your hands. That the key specialised facilities, skills, competences and know-how to develop, produce and support complex defence systems is retained in Europe can be clearly demonstrated. These competences do not exist in the civil world. If you take defence seriously, you recognise the value of a strong indigenous industrial base. You want suppliers on whom you can depend and who meet your security of supply requirements; having sufficient industrial capabilities to react flexibly and positively to evolving needs and priorities, particularly during times of conflict. One only has to look at US defence industrial policy and at the efforts of emerging powers like China and India to develop indigenous defence industries, to recognise that the retention and development of such capabilities is of strategic importance. The EDTIB underpins the credibility of the European Union\u2019s Common Security and Defence Policy. It is a prerequisite that Europe identifies the key industrial capabilities it requires to meet future operational requirements and takes positive, collective, action to ensure that, in these key areas, the technology and the manufacturing capabilities are retained in Europe. A strong EDTIB that exploits competition is required. However there must be acknowledgement of the need to sustain strategic industrial capabilities where necessary and agreement on a common means to achieve this with specific delivery methods. There currently exists no systematic process at European level to ensure that the EDTIB will be able to meet EU Member States\u2019 future military capability needs. No practical means where by Europe can complement and add coherence to national investments. These weaknesses clearly need to be corrected and this is an issue that EDA is addressing in the context of the EDTIB strategy update. What is the role for industry and what can industry offer? Industry can help shape the evolution of government demand. It cannot afford to sit on the fence as defence policies evolve in the new financial climate. This is not going to be \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d and there are opportunities for industry to help focus the debate. There is a need for a better industry-government dialogue on a European level; only when industry fully understands what will be needed in the years ahead can it realistically assess what issues it will face. And government decision makers need to fully understand the industrial base consequences of defence choices. At EDA we see industry as a real partner. We recognise the need to better utilise the expertise and knowledge imbedded in the defence industry and the need for engagement. For example on Pooling and Sharing we have sought to proactively inform and consult. We will continue to develop this mutually constructive dialogue. For industry\u2019s voice to be heard in the new cash constrained environment there has to be a new message; a new bargain between industry and government. Industries need to take the initiative and make proposals on how they can assist through reciprocal action with governments. There are many areas that could be considered. From an EDA perspective the following \u201cillustrative list\u201d merits further consideration. Industry could consider making proposals on: New business models; that would reduce the development risk and increase the speed of complex defence programmes. Risk sharing incentives which would reduce the cost of ownership of defence equipment. How governments might benefit from adopting commercial best practice solutions particularly in the context of pooling and sharing. How governments and industry might maximise the benefits of the R&T investment crucial to future competitiveness through avoiding duplicative defence research. An offer to increase industry R&T investment if governments can restructure their budgets to release more money for defence research. How prime contractors can take greater responsibility for the long term health of the supply chain. How industrial duplication could be addressed through companies reaching agreement on better sharing of industrial competences. Difficult decisions lie ahead as Europe adapts to the new financial realities. If Europe is to retain the robust and competitive EDTIB it needs to underpin its future political freedom of action there needs to be change including a new business model for government and industry relations. By embracing new and innovative ways of working together we can retain effective military capabilities and a world class defence industry. And that\u2019s something we at EDA believe is worth striving for. *Article published on \u201cFocus\u201d, the magazine of the Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD).", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/11-10-28/Enhancing_the_role_and_engagement_of_Europe_s_Defence_Industries"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0938", "date": "2011-11-10", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Launch of the Security of Supply Portal \u2013 Interview with Peter Scaruppe", "text": " Security of Supply is a critical topic regarding both the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) and the functioning of the European Defence Equipment Market (EDEM). EDA is taking a major step today, launching a new\u00a0Portal on the Security of Supply (SoS). Peter Scaruppe, EDA\u2019s Industry and Market Director, explains this new tool. \u00a0 What is the importance of Security of Supply for the realisation of the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) and the functioning of the European Defence Equipment Market (EDEM)? Security of Supply is very important both for strengthening the EDTIB (the industrial side) and for the functioning of the EDEM (the market side). That\u2019s why SoS remains at the core of our work. One definition of SoS, developed by the Letter of Intent (LoI) community and widely used, is \u201ca Nation\u2019s ability to guarantee and to be guaranteed a supply of Defence Articles and Defence Services sufficient to discharge its commitments in accordance with its foreign and security policy requirements\u201d. This of course means that SoS has an impact on many defence related issues and on many of EDA\u2019s work strands. It is definitely not becoming less important in the current financial and economic situation as the need for \u201cpooling and sharing\u201d and the need for Member States to rely on each other increase. Regarding the importance for the EDTIB, the EDTIB Strategy agreed by Defence Ministers in 2007 states that the concept of a truly European DTIB will not be realised in practice unless Member States are confident that increased mutual dependence for supply of defence goods and services is matched by increased mutual assurance of that supply. In speaking terms, Security of Supply is all about \u201ctrust\u201d. Defence procurement is often sensitive in one way or the other, and in order for Member States to rely on non-national sources of supply and to procure from the open EDEM, they need to be assured of the Security of Supply on that market. In the end, Security of Supply is really a pre-requisite for effective and efficient industrial restructuring and for the confidence in open competition. It is a key, cross-cutting EDA work strand and it supports successful collaboration! What are EDA\u2019s achievements so far? The first milestone was the \u201cFramework Arrangement for Security of Supply between subscribing Member States in Circumstances of Operational Urgency\u201d, which was endorsed by the EDA Steering Board in 2006. The Framework Arrangement is an integral part of the voluntary Intergovernmental Regime to encourage competition in the defence market. Subscribing Member States to the Regime have agreed to assist and expedite each other\u2019s contracted defence requirements, particularly in circumstances of pressing operational urgency. They will also work to increase the level of mutual confidence. The Framework Arrangement is based on consultation processes and the principles of cooperation and solidarity. Right now, one of our major tasks together with Member States is the further implementation of this Arrangement and we believe that the SoS Portal will contribute to this process, for example by simply making the necessary contact information more accessible. What is the aim of this new Portal? Well, the ultimate aim of the EDA work on Security of Supply is the achievement of equal confidence in Security of Supply from any part of Europe. This of course sounds very ambitious, but we base our work on a pragmatic step by step approach, reaching a common understanding on and taking into account the different aspects of Security of Supply. The Portal will contribute to this work by increasing the transparency of Member States policies, procedures and priorities connected to the Security of Supply. And as already mentioned: by providing contact information it simplifies access to our Member States\u2019 SoS systems and/or to further information. What sort of information is available on this Portal? The Portal contains information provided by our Member States on their legal basis for SoS, their SoS objectives, the national bodies involved and their areas of responsibilities, the role of SoS in their procurement processes, possible contractual terms on SoS that they use, existing bi- and multilateral agreements on SoS that they might have and contact information to relevant PoCs in their respective administrations. We will also have information on the related EDA documents and links to other relevant sources of information on SoS. But of course, the Portal is a living tool! Who is your target audience? The Portal will be publically available on the Internet for everybody. It will probably be most useful to stakeholders such as Governments and Industry, but also for other institutions and academia. And what sort of benefits will users get from this new platform? We hope that finding this sort of information collected in one place will be of real benefit for our stakeholders. The Portal will be a place to collect information about Member States\u2019 SoS policies, but also to identify Points of Contact to communicate with. For example a company planning to place a bid in one of our Member State\u00b4s procurements could use the Portal to get an overview of the SoS policies, practices and requirements of that Member State. A Member State on the other hand could use the Portal to get an idea of the SoS policies in its fellow Member States, which could be useful when considering one\u2019s own policies, when procuring on the open EDEM or when engaging in a collaborative project. How did your team collect this information? Which lessons have you learned from this exercise? Last year we conducted a stocktaking exercise with Member States, basically collecting the information that is now available on the Portal. One of the practical outcomes of the stocktaking was the decision by Member States to set up this Portal. We have worked closely together with our SoS Experts community throughout the setting up of this Portal. This has proven to work very well and we would like to thank all our Member States for their support! It has been very helpful to have the experiences of the LoI and Nordic communities, who have been cooperating on SoS for a long time. What are your expectations? That the SoS Portal will be a hub for finding information on SoS and that it will be of real use for our stakeholders, others and also for ourselves. We also hope that it will contribute to the practical implementation of our Framework Arrangement, so that this Arrangement can be used for solving SoS issues in cases of operational urgency. What is the way ahead for SoS? We are working together with our SoS Experts community on various issues. As mentioned, we hope that the Portal will contribute to the practical implementation and use of our Framework Arrangement. In addition to that we are also following the practical implementation of the Defence and Security Procurement and Intra Community Transfer Directives in Member States and the impact these will have on SoS. Recently we also started discussions on how to involve industry in our work on SoS. The current Polish Presidency of the EU held a high-level seminar on this topic in September, which we consider a good kick-off for our work on this. The way ahead looks challenging and interesting!", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2011/11/10/Launch_of_the_Security_of_Supply_Portal_%E2%80%93_Interview_with_Peter_Scaruppe"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0939", "date": "2011-10-10", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Towards a European solution on Precision Guided Ammunition", "text": " Defence Ministers have acknowledged the importance of maintaining a strong EDTIB in Europe. The EDTIB Strategy describes the vision for the future size and shape of the EDTIB. One element of this Strategy is the need to determine which key industrial capabilities must be preserved or developed in Europe. Member States decided to use the ammunition sector as a pilot area to be addressed from both the demand and the supply side. Ammunition is a cross-cutting sector for European armed forces: it affects the performance of platforms, and interoperability in the field. Procurement decisions influence security of supply and thus affect the operational sovereignty of Member States. The ammunition sector is sensitive; testing and procedures for the qualification of ammunition are main cost drivers. Currently, ammunition is also a promising candidate for pooling & sharing activities including possibilities for the use of modern, effective procurement methods such as collaborative procurement. \u00a0 Precision and Guidance on ammunition is an identified area of strategic importance, both from the military capabilities perspective and from the technological and industrial perspective, playing a key role for a sustainable ammunition related EDTIB. In December 2010, the European Defence Agency (EDA) signed a 12 month study contract. The objective of this study is to provide an achievable step-by-step plan to develop a more robust, sustainable and competitive European defence ammunition industry, able to provide the military capabilities that Member States require. This contract sets out work on the: identification of capabilities requirements on Precision Engagement, focusing on Precision Guided Ammunition; mapping of the current Global and European technological and industrial situation, assessing Europe\u2019s strengths and weaknesses; identification of existing gaps; provision of a roadmap and an implementation plan identifying priority measures to be taken with special focus on key technologies and key industrial capabilities to be preserved or developed; and the identification of pilot cooperative programmes and areas of priority for investment. Results of the study are expected to be a significant factor in developing harmonised capabilities requirements, achieving strong stakeholder consensus, improving European collaboration, and achieving economies of scale. Nine months after contract signature, the study has already identified common areas for the future operational use of Precision Guided Ammunition shared by Member States. It has also identified critical technologies and industrial capabilities that need to be preserved, non-EU dependencies and regulatory/qualification issues. In the forthcoming months the study, under the close monitoring of EDA, and in consultation with Member States, will enter its final phase: the development of a detailed roadmap and implementation plan. This plan will include concrete and prioritised collaborative actions for a European solution on Precision Guided Ammunition, while safeguarding in parallel critical industrial capabilities to meet the future operational requirements of the European armed forces.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2011/10/10/Towards_a_European_solution_on_Precision_Guided_Ammunition"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0940", "date": "2011-10-17", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Interview with Austria\u2019s Senior Commander, Colonel Hannes Mittermair", "text": " \u00a0Credits: Austrian Air Force Colonel Hannes Mittermair was Austria\u2019s Senior Commander at the Helicopter Exercise ITALIAN CALL 11, the third European Helicopter Training Programme Exercise, hosted in Italy, on May-June 2011. As Austria\u2019s Senior Commander in place, Mittermair was responsible for the 26 Austrian soldiers, operating three AB-212 Army helicopters. Mittermair and his crews are already planning HOT BLADE 2012, the next EDA\u2019s Helicopter Exercise. EDA recovers an interview with Mittermair, a Commander who strongly and enthusiastically believes that \"helicopter practice works very well in the international arena\u201d. Q : From your point of view, what is the importance of attending this Exercise - for you, for your crews, and for Austria\u2019s helicopter capability development? A : ITALIAN CALL 2011 was the second Exercise we attended with our helicopters, and we found that the Exercises\u2019 concept had developed greatly. Our aim is to validate our procedures and techniques for the crews. We have learned in operations, like Kosovo and Bosnia, that we do apply good flight techniques, but also have certain difficulties in understanding how the procedures work, how they are applied. So, this is an ideal opportunity for us where we can demonstrate our improved procedures, which we will also present in a NATO evaluation programme. I think that the success of this European Helicopter Training Programme Exercise is now established. Q : What about the European Helicopter Training Programme? How do you see it? A : Our experience until now\u2026 in 2003 we cooperated with both Germany and Switzerland in Kosovo, and that was our first step on the international scene. Being neutral emphasises certain sensitive areas in terms of interaction with other nations, but I do see a development here, because the Exercise language was English \u2013 and not German, to which we were used. So, crews were \u201cforced\u201d to apply their techniques and skills, in English \u2013 which is challenging. They did a very good job and, as we have seen, the cockpit swap was successfully executed. Since AZOR 2010, the exchange of ideas has also been well done. Q : To which developments are you referring to? A : Exercise AZOR 2010 (July 2010, Spain) was a kind of national exercise in an international playground. Now we have a truly international exercise model, hosted by a given Nation, which is Italy. Q : So, it means a small step forward towards a new concept of Exercise\u2026 A : I wouldn\u2019t say it is a small step forward\u2026 it\u2019s a big step forward! Once you manage it, Nations open up and give the pilots the trust they need to swap cockpits\u2026 this is really a big, big sign of mutual confidence and trust. This means they feel completely confident that there are professional and very well prepared troops on both sides. So, a big step forward, I would say! Q : Would you emphasise a specific mission that the Austrian crews carried out with other nations during IT CALL 2011? A : No, I have no specific reference to make... we had a great experience here with all crews. From what I have seen here from all contributing nations, and being a truly convinced European citizen, I would like nations to cooperate in a more united and multinational European environment. This engagement is a political decision \u2013 and I am just a soldier. Soldiers operate and make basic lines to sustain political decisions. But my \u201csoldier experience\u201d is great.

IEDs account for approximately 80% of military casualties in Afghanistan and kill approximately three times that number of civilians. Taking actions to counter the threat of IEDs involves gathering as much information as possible about who is making them, where the components have come from and who is supporting the supply and building network. This allows the IED network to be interdicted, thus saving the lives of soldiers and civilians alike. It is essential in modern conflict to ensure that the prosecution of the campaign is conducted within boundaries of the law and therefore the collection of information about bombers must be carried out in an evidentially pure fashion such that it could later be used as evidence in a judicial process. \u00a0 The\u00a0Ministers of Defence from the EDA Member states directed the Agency to spend Operational Budget money to purchase the equipment for such a forward deployable forensic laboratory to deploy into operations under a lead nation. The aim is to demonstrate to all Member States the utility of such a laboratory and the contributions that it can make. Furthermore it aims to prove the requirements, specifications and procedures, which can then be passed back in an intellectual package to all pMS to enable a template for the development of similar capabilities in the future. Following the initial direction, the EDA set up a small team of experts from across the Member States to define the requirements for the demonstrator, establish the legal framework under which it could exist and deploy, set up the contracting, organise the personnel from across the Union to man the laboratory, and train the team. The contract was let on 17 December 2010 with the Spanish company Indra and delivered at the end of July after training personnel. The laboratory and the personnel flew into Afghanistan by the end of July 2011 and was set up and running with Initial Operating Capability by mid September 2011. The whole project was completed in a very short time which considering the multinational dimension of the staffing was remarkable. \u00a0 The EDA Project, known as the Theatre Exploitation Laboratory (Demonstrator) or TEL(D), has been deployed by France as the lead nation and is manned by a multi-national team from France, Spain, Poland and the Netherlands. Early next year Italy, Romania and Sweden are expected to send manning contributions. Austria has bought some additional hardware for the laboratory to enhance its capabilities and has also made a significant contribution to training the personnel. Sweden and the Netherlands provided experts to help with training. Luxembourg covered the expenses for and organised the transport of the laboratory to Afghanistan. The Republic of Ireland, despite not officially participating in the project, hosted the team to excellent training to give them a better awareness of IEDs and the tactics used by insurgents. The whole effort was truly multinational and although exceptionally challenging, it proves that it is possible to work collaboratively and quickly if the will exists. The laboratory is now getting good reports from Afghanistan where it is making a significant contribution to the effort to counter Improvised Explosive Devices and where it directly supports the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and the Afghan National forces by providing real tangible input. The laboratory is envisaged to remain in Afghanistan this year and next year, but its future beyond then is yet to be decided.

The meeting focused on two main topics: the identification of existing common demand by groups of Member States and its translation into common action; and the modalities of using the EDA as a central purchasing body. To this end, the EDA\u2019s recent common procurement of synthetic helicopter training was presented to Member States as an example of potential benefits and savings. One of the main findings of the presentation was that aggregating demand could be the only way for some countries to afford certain purchases. Member States, who welcomed this new EDA work strand as a way to support Pooling & Sharing efforts, stated that the main focus should be on the identification of common demand. They supported the EDA taking an active role, while recalling that the need for flexibility in meeting Member States\u2019 specific requirements and preferences. On EDA\u2019s possible role as a central purchasing body, Member States exchanged views on issues such as the legal framework or how cooperation among participating Member States could be structured.

Based on a tasking from the new EU Treaty, Effective Procurement Methods focuses on the development of innovative ways to consolidate the demand side of the European Defence Equipment Market. As a first target area, the Member States identified off-the-shelf procurement. Though further investments into development programmes are still of utmost importance for the maintenance of a high-end\u00a0European Defence Technological and Industrial Base and a priority in the EDA\u2019s work, the number of military purchases of off-the-shelf products is increasing. This applies, in particular, to urgent operational requirements and logistical support of EU operations where Armed Forces often rely on third party contractors. Off-the-shelf purchases is an area where the benefits of common ways of procurement are self-evident. Since demand is met from existing sources, the need for national variants is much lower than for other types of procurement. Likewise the potential savings for Member States are higher as fewer variants result in more streamlined production for industry and higher economies of scales. Moreover, collaborative procurement conducted in a transparent and competitive way increases cross-border competition which again is a key factor in market terms. Finally, a more frequent use of common procurement methods will lead to more nations employing the same equipment and thus increased interoperability. The main focus for the EDA in this initiative is the consolidation of demand for European defence equipment, and indeed the identification of current common demand. The EDA, with its integrated way of working is ideally placed. Given the new legal framework after the Defence Procurement Directive which explicitly names the EDA as a central purchasing body for common defence procurement, the Agency could, in time, conduct contracting for a group of Member States and thus become a one-stop-shop for defence cooperation. The EDA\u2019s Industry & Market Director, Peter Scaruppe, stated after the meeting: \u201cToday\u2019s feedback from Member States has been very encouraging and showed us that we are on the right track. With their interest and help we will be able clearly to demonstrate the benefits of this new approach.

Science and Military Education Department. PL MoD. The European Defence Agency Unmanned Maritime Systems Cat. A programme (UMS) is an opportunity for developing technologies for the XXI century mine counter measures (MCM) and other naval applications. Moreover, it represents a unique opportunity to provide the Polish Navy with modern military equipment increasing its operational capabilities in 2020 perspective. The UMS related technologies should enable the Polish Navy to conduct more efficient MCM operations in the future. Bearing this in mind, the Polish Minister of National Defence signed the relevant Programme Arrangement during the EDA Steering Board meeting held in Brussels on 9 December 2010. His signature, along with the signatures of 10 other defence ministers will allow specific UMS projects to be initiated in 2011. Poland\u2019s decision to join the UMS was a consequence of a detailed analysis among different institutions in the Ministry of National Defence (MoND). Furthermore, the Polish participation required the approval of the Navy Command, which supported the decision since the scope of the UMS programme is fully in line with the Polish Armed Forces Development Plan for the years 2009-2018, as far as MCM issues are concerned. This document reflects all operational needs of the Polish Armed Forces and is treated as one of the main guidelines in terms of R&T investment. It is also worth mentioning that the Polish Navy Command pays a special attention to the UMS results. By delegating representatives to manage three UMS projects, the Command hopes to fully harmonize their outputs with the Polish Navy\u2019s operational needs. \u00a0 According to Polish R&T Director Col. J\u00f3zef Wrona the above mentioned aspect of harmonization is a key element as far as R&T is concerned. This opinion was presented during an opening ceremony of the UMS programme that took place in Gdynia on 19 April 2011. During this meeting, the Navy representatives had for the first time an opportunity to talk to the scientists and deeply discuss the UMS-led issues. Col Wrona also reminded that there still exists a necessity for developing an efficient mechanism that will enable the identification of technologies for which development is required from the capabilities\u2019 perspective. He also stressed the importance of the end-user\u2019s participation in the whole MCM capability development process. This involvement should start from an identification of the capability gaps, followed by research and development to address them, and ending with a capability delivery. Polish involvement in the UMS programme therefore, fully reflects this approach. Poland decided to join five UMS projects with a total investment of 2,83\u00a0M\u20ac. The Naval Academy will perform some tasks within the \u201cSignature Response Analysis of Multi-influence Mines\u201d project that should improve knowledge on the ships signature response. Another Polish contractor - Maritime Technology Centre - will be involved in the projects of \u201cBuried Mines\u201d and \u201cModular Light-weight minesweeping\u201d. The first one is expected to fill up technological gaps in buried mines detection and neutralization. The second will develop technologies for lightweight sweep sources that could be used in future unmanned surface vehicle platforms. Moreover, bearing in mind standardization and integration of different UMS projects it was fully recommended to engage in the \u201cSystems Integration\u201d and the \u201cStandards and Interfaces\u201d projects. Both Polish sub-contractors are participating in these projects. The results of the UMS will represent an added value to national R&T efforts that will be conducted within National Research and Development Centre (NRDC) - the main national entity responsible for applied research and development programmes. In a couple of months a national strategic programme will be established focusing on development of different technologies and components. Its aim will be to enable the building of the XXI century MCM system based on national unmanned surface vehicles and unmanned underwater vehicles. Polish participation in the UMS programme is an important element providing the national programme with common European standards and necessary interfaces among different UMS-led technologies. Moreover, the UMS programme is also treated as an integrated element of a national armaments programme that is expected to provide the Polish Navy with a next-generation mine-countermeasures vessel (MCMV). The UMS technologies are therefore, the ones that potentially could be used by the MCMV to increase its operational capabilities. \u00a0 From the Polish point of view, the development of MCM capability requires a comprehensive approach. While, national efforts are the core element of MCM technology development, the involvement in the international cooperation under the EDA framework is also essential. This cooperation will provide with the common standards so important as long as building a European MCM capability is concerned.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2011/06/29/Polish_view_on_EDA_s_Unmanned_Maritime_Systems_programme"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0954", "date": "2011-07-04", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "European defence equipment market reaches significant milestone", "text": " 5thanniversary of the launch of the Intergovernmental Regime on Defence Procurement \u00a0 1 July 2011 marked the fifth anniversary of the launch of the Intergovernmental Regime on Defence Procurement, a landmark agreement of EU governments to open up to cross border competition the most sensitive share of the defence market covered by Article 346 TFEU. Since then, the Regime has been pioneering a gradual transition from closed and fragmented national defence markets to a more open, transparent and competitive marketplace where better value for money is the key procurement priority and a critical determinant. Rob de Jong, Chairman of the EDA National Armaments Directors Steering Board The launch of the Regime has been a remarkable achievement and brought fundamental changes in defence procurement/defence business. In its 5 years of operation it has been creating new opportunities for companies across Europe, strengthening our defence technological and industrial base, beneficial both for our Armed Forces and taxpayers. Results: Over 650 contract opportunities published on the Electronic Bulletin Board operated by the Agency Over 400 contracts awarded under competition with a total value of 5,4 bn euros 1/3 cross\u2013border awards Over 500 000 views In this process, both Member States, as shareholders, and Defence Industries, as stakeholders, are critical. Domingo Ure\u00f1a Raso, President of The AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe and CEO Airbus Military I would like to congratulate the Agency on its essential role in the process of opening up the defence market in Europe through the Regime. ASD has been actively supporting it from the beginning and we are pleased with the results. But this has to be accompanied by efforts to consolidate demand through the harmonisation of requirements across the continent. We need more consolidated defence procurement across Europe, with the EDA being used as a prime vehicle to co-ordinate this process, increased effort on research and technology and more collaborative programmes between EU Member States. Together with the European Commission\u2019s new directive on defence procurement, it provides a solid foundation in our joint endeavours towards enhancing and strengthening the development of a genuine European Defence Market. Michel Barnier, EU Commissioner in charge of the Internal Market and Services The Intergovernmental Regime has been an important step towards the creation of a European Defence Equipment Market. It has fostered trans-border competition in a market segment which was traditionally closed for non-national suppliers. Moreover, it has helped - by its very existence -\u00a0to build consensus on the necessity of market openness between Member States. This consensus made it possible to adopt Directive 2009/81/EC which will apply from August 21 on to the bulk of defence procurement in the EU. I am convinced that the EDA will continue to play an important role for European defence markets and industries, in particular in areas related to the demand side such as security of supply and pooling and sharing.\u00a0The Commission will cooperate as closely as possible with the EDA to develop a fully integrated EDEM and to strengthen the EDTIB. This twin - track approach combines community measures and intergovernmental initiatives and ensures that Member State's Armed Forces get the best possible, robust, flexible and interoperable equipment in the most cost \u2013 effective and efficient way. Dr. Csaba Hende, Minister of Defence of Hungary A strong Europe needs a globally competitive European defence industry. At the same time the current financial crisis and the budgetary problems faced by most nations only make the development of a European defence market an even more pressing necessity. We need to use the economic constraints as an incentive to eliminate duplication and rationalise our defence procurement. The final goal is to save money for our taxpayers and deliver high-technology, European made defence equipment for our armed forces. The work of EDA and the Commission is vital in this process. Next steps: Less fragmented markets mean more efficient use of resources \u2013 this is simply an imperative given constraints on European defence spending. To this end, we have to also increase our efforts to consolidate demand in order to achieve the economies of scale to maintain and develop defence capabilities in Europe. Last month, the EDA Defence Ministers, building on the 5 \u2013 year success of the Regime, decided to take forward the development the European defence market and tasked the Agency to bring about 5 critical objectives in close consultation with the participating Member States and in cooperation with the European Commission: 1.\u00a0 Ensuring security of supply on a European level 2.\u00a0 New opportunities for more effective procurement and improved effectiveness of military expenditures through more cooperative action 3.\u00a0 Increased global competitiveness of the European defence industry and reciprocal market access 4.\u00a0 Addressing security aspects in view of the development of a wider European Defence and Security Market 5.\u00a0 Constructive dialogue with defence industry; incentives for more defence industrial efficiencies and innovation Claude \u2013 France Arnould, the EDA Chief Executive The success of the Regime would not have been possible without the strong commitment of Member States and Industry\u2019s support. But we cannot stop there. The actions we are launching now will not only contribute to further development of a more open and globally competitive European defence market but will considerably support pooling efforts together to meet future military needs, ensure interoperability and standardization, and share the ever-increasing costs of developing and procuring high-technology defence equipment.

These are official statistics on the main defence expenditure components for each of the EDA participating Member States (all EU Member States except Denmark): Macro-economic data to show how defence budgets relate to GDP, overall government spending and population. Major categories of defence budget spending \u2013 personnel; investment, including research & technology; operations & maintenance; and others \u2013 to show how defence budgets are spent. European collaboration for equipment procurement and R&T to show to the extent to which the Agency\u2019s participating Member States are investing together. Deployability: military deployed in crisis management operations to show the ratio between deployments and the total number of military. The figures provided are official figures based on data provided direct by the main spending authorities, the Ministries of Defence. EDA has been gathering data on its Member States\u2019 defence expenditure since 2005. The exercise of periodically assembling accurate data in the four areas described above aims at providing an annual overview of Member States\u2019 defence expenditure, overall and in specific categories, to show their defence expenditure trends and to measure progress against benchmarks for investment. Accurate data is needed to provide a baseline for setting targets to improve defence output. Defence Data collection and analysis is also supporting EDA activities, in particular relating to R&T (collaboration), Armaments (collaboration) and to capability development, in order to help measure progress in their respective areas of responsibility. Benchmarks allow for specific measuring of progress at the aggregate EU level on spending more (together) for R&T and Equipment Procurement. The method for the annual data-gathering and analysis is well-established and prepared through a fixed annual cycle. The definitions were agreed by the 26 participating Member States in order to have comparable data across them all. After some adjustments that occurred in the first years of data collection, the definitions are now stable thus allowing not only for a comparison between countries but also for an analysis of the evolution over time. The Agency is also launching a new Defence Data Portal, with improved graphics as well as more detailed information on the indicators used, on the targets that have been set for investment and on the method used for gathering the data. We invite you to visit the Defence Data Portal, where you can access the statistics on defence expenditure for each of the 26 EDA participating Member States.

Since 2004, EDA has been supporting its participating Member States in their capability development. This has always meant \u201cdoing more with less\u201d, through identifying innovative and timely pooling & sharing opportunities. The current budgetary crisis has brought this requirement into sharper relief. It also means ensuring complementarity for participating Member States\u2019 common priorities and investments. We strive to avoid duplication by maintaining a constant dialogue with our stakeholders. Ministers are committed to the Agency. Recent ministerial-level discussions on pooling & sharing revealed that participating Member States were increasingly willing to work together. EDA is aware that it must deliver concrete and affordable results. I would add that EDA enjoys a privileged role: on the one hand, Member States are both shareholder and client; on the other, EDA is well-positioned in the European landscape (the High Representative and Head of the Agency is also Vice-President of the European Commission). EDA has also proved to be an important interlocutor when it comes to liaising with other institutions, including the European Space Agency and NATO. Working with Member States and, at the same time, with such a diverse range of intergovernmental and industrial, European and non-European, military and non-military, bilateral and multilateral institutions, EDA needs to get its message across. EDA is a lean, non-bureaucratic, responsive and result-oriented organisation, designed to support Member States. It should be the first choice for where European Defence cooperation takes place. For this, mutual-confidence, knowledge and communication are crucial. I believe we have to be more pro-active and to improve how we communicate with our key interlocutors. This is why EDA has reassessed its communication tools and invested considerable time and effort in rebuilding its main gateway: the website. The website is neither a repository nor a library, but rather a living platform, where EDA describes, on different levels, its major ongoing projects and its achievements.

The European Helicopter Training Programme was approved by Ministers of Defence in November 2009 to increase in the short-term the availability of helicopters for crisis management operations. The Programme started in 2010 and consists of two live exercises per year - one focusing on individual training and one on interoperability and operational tactics. An annual symposium takes stock of lessons learned from operations and further shapes the development of additional exercises. This Helicopter Training Programme is one of EDA\u2019s most successful stories. Together with Member States, the Agency realised that the lack of transport helicopters deployed into operational scenarios is not so much related to a lack of helicopters in itself. The training factor seems to be the major determinant, as crews are insufficiently trained to fly in the kind of environments that reflect current operational circumstances (high-altitude, low-visibility, dusty or snowy environments). Taking into account Member States' requirements, EDA organises the training for \"hot & dusty\" or for \"snow & mountains\" conditions, exactly the scenarios Member States are facing.

It brings together, for the first time, senior defence experts and policy makers from across Europe to discuss this subject. Some 150 participants are expected with representatives from the Member States, the European Commission, the European Space Agency, Industry and the Research Community. The Conference addresses the challenges for improving access to the key enabling technologies that will underpin future defence capabilities and makes recommendations on future actions. Non-Dependence on key technologies - the possibility for Europe to have unrestricted access to any required technology - is a pre-condition for a robust, sustainable, globally competitive European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB). EDA is proposing that its Member States develop a comprehensive European approach. Technological dependency limits the capabilities of the European Industry and their supporting research providers to respond to the evolving needs of the defence, space and security market. It can also seriously restrict EU Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) capabilities. Although excellent sectorial examples of ETnD exist, an overall European framework is lacking. Besides the identification and prioritisation of the critical technologies and supply chains, an ambitious roadmap linked to sustained investments is necessary to achieve adequate technology non-dependence on a European level. ETnD is a major topic for Defence but it also has a wider strategic dimension for Europe. The topic fits well in the EDA R&T objectives and is consistent with the European Defence Research & Technology Strategy, approved by Ministers of Defence. Some critical technology areas which meet the criteria of Technology non-Dependence have already been identified and are subject to on-going EDA action. The goal of the Conference is to convince all stakeholders of the strategic importance of European Technology non-Dependence for Defence and the need for a proactive policy.

Video\u00a0of P\u00e9ter Sikl\u00f3si, Hungarian Deputy State Secretary Video of Christian Br\u00e9ant, EDA R&T Director *** Background It is now widely accepted that investment in critical non dependence technologies can no longer be done nationally and that Europe collectively needs to have autonomous access to a range of critical Defence technologies and to maintain a capable Defence Technology and Industrial Base (EDTIB) to support its military capabilities. Technological dependency limits the capabilities of European Industry and their supporting research providers to respond to the evolving needs of the defence, space and security market. It can also seriously restrict EU Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) capabilities. Non-Dependence on key technologies - the possibility for Europe to have unrestricted access to any required technology - is a pre-condition for a robust, sustainable, globally EDTIB. A comprehensive, high- level, European response to defence non-dependence is required. European nations are suffering financial constraints and many have come under additional pressure due to the recent financial crisis. Smarter co-operation, guided by a strategy which generates and secures critical key enabling technologies could help to make Europe reasonably technologically non-dependent, now and in the future. Such a strategy would focus strongly on leveraging synergies between the civil and Defence communities. ETnD requires a common European strategy which is guided by a common perception and policy. To achieve an adequate technology non-dependence on a European level, in addition to the identification and prioritization of the critical technologies and supply chains, a comprehensive roadmap, linked to sustained measures, milestones and investments, will be necessary. The study contract and the Budapest Conference are important steps towards these objectives. However, adequate commitment and actions by the European stakeholders, supported by the nations, are mandatory if the issue is to be developed further. Understanding and dealing with the issue of technology and industrial dependencies is part of EDA\u2019s day to day business. Work is already on going in a range of key enabling technologies (including FPGA, Carbon Fibres, Printed Circuit Boards and Gan Technology). Additional work is underway in the following sections: in the domain of Military Aerospace, identifying highly added value competences future Air Systems and supply chain dependencies on non-EU suppliers; in the ammunition sector looking at a reduction of technical non-EU dependencies: a contract has been let examining the position on Precision Guided Ammunition to a consortia led by BAE Systems Bofors (including Diehl BGT Defence, EXPAL, MBDA, Nexter Munitions, OTO Melara, Rheinmetall Waffe Munition, SAGEM and Thales TDA.) The study is part of a step-by-step plan to develop a more competitive European Defence ammunition industry. Contract addressing key European Defence Technology and Industrial Dependencies EDA has recently signed a contract to establish a better understanding of the scope of EU dependence on non-EU sources of supply in the Defence sector. A consortia led by FOI, including RAND Europe and the French aerospace lab ONERA, will undertake this work. The aim of the contract is to: Map the current level of dependency across the EDTIB, identifying the consequences for key technologies, industrial processes and skills and a sustainable EDTIB able to satisfy future Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) requirements. Develop criteria to objectively decide the critical technologies and industrial capabilities that are required to deliver defence capabilities and make proposals on which critical areas should be monitored. Benchmark international best practices in dealing with dependency issues (from both the commercial and defence fiends) and propose best practice solutions.

In addition to successful existing projects \u2013 such as improving helicopters availability, air transport, third party logistics support and airworthiness \u2013 more pooling and sharing opportunities exist in areas like satellite communications, medical support and naval logistics. In many cases pooling and sharing also offers opportunities for civil-military dual-use. \u201cThe Agency has quickly reacted to the needs of European Defence Ministers, who are looking for opportunities to work closely together in order to improve capabilities while budgets are under pressure. Pooling and sharing offers potential for savings, while increasing interoperable capacities\u201d, said Catherine Ashton, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Vice-President of the European Commission and Head of the European Defence Agency. Defence Ministers also discussed the impact of the Single European Sky initiative of the European Commission for military aviation. The Single European Sky\u2019s objective is to replace the currently fragmented airspace over Europe by one air traffic management system, thereby increasing capacity, reducing pollution and improving safety and security. The SES Air Traffic Management Research (SESAR) Joint Undertaking is addressing the technological challenges. Ministers have tasked the Agency to engage with the SESAR Joint Undertaking in order to identify important financial and operational risks as wells as emerging opportunities for the defence community. Following new opportunities under the Lisbon Treaty regarding Defence Research at Union level, Ministers called for a constructive dialogue in the coming months between the European Commission, the European Parliament, the Agency and the participating Member States on the preparation of the 8th Framework Programme for investment in technology areas of common interest at the European Union level. Ministers were informed on the progress made with the project to deploy a field laboratory for forensic research of road-side bombs explosions. With France as lead-nation, supported by several other Member States, the mobile laboratory will be deployed to Afghanistan by mid-2011. Technical preparations, procurement and planning of the laboratory\u2019s manning are all on track. \u201cThis is a concrete contribution to urgent operational needs, as road-side bombs are endangering the lives of soldiers and civilians day-after-day. It is a direct European contribution to the Alliance\u2019s operation in Afghanistan\u201d, Acting Chief Executive, Adam Sowa, said. The Steering Board approved the Agency\u2019s Work Programme 2011. The Agency\u2019s budget will be \u20ac 30.5 million, as decided by the Foreign Affairs Council in Defence Ministers formation. Ministers were informed on the results of the Agency\u2019s collection of 2009 defence data and on the assessment of the collective benchmarks for defence R&T and equipment procurement. A dedicated booklet has been released. The Steering Board approved that the Agency can start the book-building process for the new Joint Investment Programme (JIP) on protection against Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) threats, with the nations willing to participate indicating their financial contributions. The JIP-CBRN is the first EDA programme in the context of the European Framework Cooperation, which aims at systematic synchronisation of research investment by the Agency, the European Commission and the European Space Agency. Defence Ministers took stock of the progress made in the Agency\u2019s work on the Level Playing Field. They reaffirmed that the LPF initiative is a strategic and long-term exercise, which in full respect of the specificities of defence aims at contributing to the creation of a truly European Defence Equipment Market, whilst focusing on strengthening the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base. The Agency will continue its work to develop a common understanding of those issues which may hamper the establishment of a Level Playing Field, based on an agreed categorisation of issues as a first step towards prioritisation. Furthermore, the Ministerial Steering Board tasked the Agency to analyse defence-related aspects of the EU Radio Spectrum Policy Programme (RSPP), recognising that this programme will have medium to long term operational and cost implications on the use of spectrum by the military. Radio frequencies are of crucial importance for EU crisis management operations. The Agency will develop recommendations regarding defence issues in order to support the participating Member States\u2019 interests. During the Steering Board meeting Defence Ministers of Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden signed the programme arrangement for Unmanned Maritime Systems, a new major EDA R&T programme of more than \u20ac 50 million for mine counter measures and other naval applications.

Over 450 senior government officials and industry representatives gathered to discuss the potential of UAS for European users, their economic, technological and industrial impact, as well as a common European way forward. Presentations by senior representatives of European stakeholders\u2019 groups outlined the dual use nature of UAS, both for defence and civilian security purposes. Financial savings and environmental benefits through reduced fuel consumption as well as CO2 emissions were highlighted, in addition to the multiple possibilities UAS already offer in reducing the risk to human life in high risk missions. This sector opens a promising chapter for the aerospace domain and for the aviation industry in Europe, where EDA and EC already have joined forces to promote innovation and new opportunities for a wide range of businesses and SMEs. Military and civil UAS markets are highly interdependent, with technology developments inevitably driving both. The Commission and the European Defence Agency are committed at the European level, to closely observe, support and contribute to the evolution of UAS technologies for dual-use purposes. To underline this commitment, EDA\u2019s Chief Executive, Alexander Weis, announced ongoing work under the so called \u201cEuropean Framework Cooperation\u201d, a pragmatic approach by the European Commission, the European Defence Agency and the European Space Agency to synchronise systematically Research and Technology investment in their respective frameworks. \u201cThe tasking given by the EDA\u2019s Steering Board in Ministers of Defence formation, in April this year, is to prepare and propose a Joint Investment programme on Unmanned Aircraft Systems for political launch in autumn this year. The target is clear; we want to address the remaining technological challenges for UAS Air Traffic Insertion as well as exploitation of their capabilities to support seamless flying of UAS in Europe by 2015\u201d, said Alexander Weis, EDA Chief Executive. Several senior officials called for a joint European approach to develop common Unmanned Aircraft System capabilities in order to maximise efficiency in public spending and to ensure that alternative European platforms are available within the coming years. The Conference recommended the establishment of a High Level Group on UAS, providing a discussion platform to European Stakeholder communities in order to ensure coherence whilst improving sustainability and competiveness, notably building on input and ongoing initiatives from research areas such as the \u201cEuropean Framework Cooperation\u201d. Underlining that \u201cEurope\u2019s progress will be judged not on the basis of policy statements but by concrete measures and investment\u201d, Alexander Weis called for an \u201copen discussion among all stakeholder communities to prevent duplication of effort, ineffectiveness and a fragmented market\u201d. \u201cThis dialogue will be invigorated today but will need to be continued on a day by day basis to allow concrete measures on European level. We believe that this process would be facilitated by the creation of a High Level Group on Unmanned Aircraft Systems, bringing together all relevant actors in Europe\u201d, he added.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2010/06/30/EDA-EC_Conference_on_Unmanned_Aircraft_Systems_UAS_recommends_a_High_Level_Group"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_0997", "date": "2010-07-20", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Contract signature on Future of the European Military Aerospace Defence Technological & Industrial Base", "text": " At the occasion of the Farnborough International Air Show 2010, the European Defence Agency (EDA) and SAAB, representing a large part of the EU\u2019s military aerospace industry, signed a contract launching strategic work to help safeguard Europe\u2019s ability to independently provide competitive aerospace solutions to meet CSDP capability requirements in the 2035 timeframe. The contract, valued at \u20ac 400 k, aims to provide an achievable step by step plan to develop a more robust, sustainable and competitive European military aerospace industry, one better able to provide the military capabilities Member States require. It includes work to: capture a commonly shared view of the state of the industry and the challenges ahead, identify the strengths and weaknesses, provide a roadmap and implementation plan identifying priority measures to be taken to strengthen the industry, identify pilot programmes in the UAS and helicopter areas. It is an important step in fulfilling the Agency\u2019s task, given by Defence Ministers, of identifying those key industrial capabilities to preserve or to develop in Europe and on which work has commenced with a focus on the military aerospace industry. EDA\u2019s Chief Executive, Alexander Weis, highlighted that Europe\u2019s military aerospace industry, which represents over 55% of Europe\u2019s Defence Technological and Industrial Base (DTIB), employing directly over 200,000 people, is critical to meeting Member States' future military requirements, but is unlikely to be sustained in the long term without transformational action and new ways of business.

EDA's Chief Executive, Mr. Alexander Weis, signed one contract with EADS Astrium Services / EADS Defence & Security - Military Air Systems (France) and in parallel ESA\u2019s Director of Telecommunications and Integrated Applications, Ms Magali Vaissiere, signed a second contract with INDRA Espacio (Spain). The two studies, worth \u20ac 400 k each, will explore the feasibility of a demonstration mission in the timeframe 2010/2011. Close coordination between the two Agencies ensures that both European civilian and defence actors will benefit from the use of multiple integrated space systems as enablers for cost-effective, sustainable and competitive UAS services in the future. In particular, the studies will look at: The feasibility and the overall planning for a UAS mission, demonstrating that UAS can be integrated into non-segregated airspace using satellite communications and satellite navigation for Command and Control, Sense and Avoid, and Air Traffic Control, and the added value of satellite communications for high data rate payload links. The viability of such a solution for future services based on UAS supported by space systems. The investments necessary in the future and the next steps required in technical and regulatory terms to effectively establish such a service. The roadmap for civilian, security and military services development. Building on their respective work in the areas of UAS Air Traffic Insertion and Satellite-UAS cooperative missions, EDA and ESA have joined forces since the start of 2009 to demonstrate that technological challenges in Command and Control / Air Traffic Control can be overcome through the use of satellite services.

This broad participation allowed for much-appreciated open discussions between Governments, Industries and Standardization organisations. The main achievement was the consensus on standardization work share. It was agreed that SDR standardization should be divided at least into two different \u201cbaskets\u201d. The first basket being the public one, containing unclassified information with unlimited distribution, where Governments act mainly as observers, maybe controllers, and meanwhile the work itself is market-driven.

The Programme will start in 2010. It will consist of two life exercises per year, one focussing on individual training and one on interoperability and operational tactics. An annual symposium will take stock of lessons learned from operations and further shape the development of further exercises. \u201cThis is another concrete result of the Agency\u2019s work. The Helicopter Training Programme will deliver immediately more helicopter capabilities, which we all know in a continuous shortfall in deployed operations\u201d, said Head of the Agency Javier Solana, who chaired the meeting. European Ministers met in the Steering Board of the European Defence Agency on 17 November. A Letter of Intent on the European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) was signed by fourteen Ministers.[1] The EATF aims to address the critical European shortfalls in air transport by developing a wide range of innovative solutions, from pooling training, logistics or procurement to exchanging flight hours and making aircraft available. \u201cA new milestone for the EATF has been reached. I am in particular happy that 14 Ministers have signed the Letter of Intent. Now, we have to work hard on elaborating the details of the different forms of pooling and cooperation\u201d, said Alexander Weis, EDA\u2019s Chief Executive.The Ministerial Steering Board approved two Political Declarations: On European Military Airworthiness Requirements \u2013 Ministers underlined the political importance of developing and implementing common European Military Airworthiness Requirements which will significantly reduce costs of air systems and speed up European aircraft programmes. On Level Playing Field for the European Defence Equipment Market \u2013 Ministers stressed that the creation of a Level Playing Field is a prerequisite for fair competition in an open and transparent European Defence Equipment Market. They tasked the Agency to develop with the participating Member States a common understanding of the scope of the factors hampering the Level Playing Field, to consider what mitigating actions are achievable and in what timeframe, and to develop a roadmap based on prioritisation of the issues to be addressed. Furthermore, the Ministerial Steering Board approved the launch of a new Category A programme on Unmanned Maritime Systems - UMS. This programme will serve as an umbrella for several Category B R&T projects, with different groups of Member States contributing. It will connect R&T priority work on uninhabited naval systems, especially underwater systems, with the Maritime Mine Counter-Measures project, which is one of the twelve priorities under the EDA Capability Development Plan.

The project logic will to a large extent be based on the development of a safety case which in turn will be supported by a large amount of simulations. Data from performed demonstrations and flight tests will be used to correlate the simulations for confidence. The goal is to reach a maturity level of the safety case enough to enable a final demonstration with a UAS in non-segregated airspace at the end of the project. Performing the development and standardisation for future Sense & Avoid technology in parallel with utilising gained knowledge from EDA and national projects as a basis is considered a key contribution for integration of manned and unmanned aviation flying routinely in non-segregated airspace.

Decisions on the European Framework Cooperation, including on the content of a coordinated Programme, will be taken by Defence Ministers in November. The likely candidate of this Programme is \u2018situational awareness\u2019, from sensing to command and control of networked assets. \u201cCoordination on investment in research between the Agency and the Commission will save the European taxpayer money, as our actions will be concerted\u201d, said Head of the Agency Javier Solana, who chaired the meeting. EDA and the European Commission are already synergising their research in specific projects, such as Software Defined Radio and for the insertion of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles into regulated airspace. The European Framework Cooperation for Security and Defence has the purpose to systematically ensure complementarity and synergy of Defence R&T investment by the Agency with research investment of the European Commission under the Seventh Framework Programme for civilian security. \u201cOur existing cooperation with the Commission will be brought to a more intensive level. There will be no joint funding and the management responsibilities in both frameworks will remain unchanged. The aim is to synchronise research and allow for mutual use of results, as technologies are increasingly of a dual-use nature for military and civilian operators\u201d, said Alexander Weis, EDA\u2019s Chief Executive. \u00a0 The Ministerial Steering Board also discussed the ongoing activities on the European Air Transport Fleet (EATF), based on the Declaration of Intent signed by twelve Ministers in November last year. The concept has been widened from an initially envisaged fleet into a framework for military air transport related aspects with modular participation. Signature of a Letter on Intent is foreseen for November 2009. Ministers took stock of the progress made with Increasing Helicopters\u2019 Availability: Training: the Agency\u2019s work is on track. Lessons learned have been drawn from a multinational helicopter training exercise in the French Alps in March and from an EDA study on high end tactical synthetic training \u2013 during which 20 Czech helicopter crews have been trained in preparation for their deployment to Afghanistan later this year. The Helicopter Tactics Training Programme will be launched in 2010.\u00a0 Upgrades: the Agency has presented upgrade packages for the Mi-17 helicopters. Under EDA coordination Member States concerned will now address cooperation models, with the aim of launching upgrade projects before the end of the year. Future Transport Helicopter: the German-French initiative for this helicopter has now become an EDA project, open to participation by other Member States. The aim of the FTH-project is to provide a solution for intra-theatre heavy lift capability in the years 2020+. \u201cThe Agency\u2019s helicopters activities have already started to produce results through training. Upgrading proposals will offer additional opportunities and the Future Transport Helicopter is a very important project to find a common European solution in the longer term, perhaps even together with the United States\u201d, said Javier Solana. The Multinational Space-based Imaging System for Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Observation (MUSIS) programme has been accepted as an EDA project in early March. Defence Ministers noted the progress made. The Agency\u2019s involvement will focus on three elements, namely to support: (i) the extension of the programme to other Member States, in addition to the existing six MUSIS countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy and Spain); (ii) the definition of an EU requirement for space imagery, working together with the Council General Secretariat (including the EUMS); and (iii) creating synergies between MUSIS and related projects, such as the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES). The Steering Board approved a project on force protection against biological agents. This Biological Detection Identification Monitoring Equipment Development and Enhancement Programme (BIO-EDEP) is addressing an important shortfall in the CBRN Defence area, one of the 12 priorities stemming from the Capability Development Plan. Five Member States (Czech Republic, France, Germany, Netherlands and Spain) have launched the BIO-EDEP project and other Member States have expressed their intention to join. The aim of the project is to conduct a Preparation Phase, leading to a demonstrator programme and procurement of identified equipment.

Taking into account various stakeholder requirements, the workshop has demonstrated that the emerging area of UAS could definitely benefit from the use of multiple integrated space systems as enablers for cost-effective, sustainable and competitive UAS services. Focusing on UAS applications and satellite communications, as presented by Dr. Barnard from Barnard Microsystems Ltd, additional presentations were given related to the required C2/ATC over satellite capability by the European Space Agency (ESA), the European Defence Agency (EDA) as well as representatives of the space industry including Thales, Indra and Alenia Aeronautica on behalf of Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD). Participants were able to gain valuable insights regarding: the outcome of ESA-initiated studies in the area of Satellite-UAS cooperative missions; the outcome of the EDA-initiated Air4All initiative, and associated activities supporting the Air4All roadmap such as the EDA-led SIGAT study on spectrum issues; state-of-the art satellite communications in support of UAS; the benefits of satellite infrastructure to operators of UAS requiring BLOS (Beyond Line of Sight) operations, safety and air traffic authorities with respect to safety, security, performance and cost; the upcoming launch of coordinated feasibility studies by ESA and EDA in the area of UAS C2/ATC with a view to a demonstration mission in 2010/2011.

This event was organised jointly by the Czech Ministry of Defence and by the European Defence Agency aimed at focusing on the way forward to harmonize the military air safety issues between the different European Union countries. \u201cEDA\u2019s Steering Board in Minister of Defence Formation has given to the EDA MAWA Airworthiness Forum a strong mandate to develop European Harmonised Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs). By developing and setting up common regulations and thus improving the air safety we will reduce the cost and decrease the time required for developing future air systems and as result strengthen the competitiveness of the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base\u201d, said Jukka Juusti, EDA\u2019s Armaments Director. Why Military Airworthiness Harmonisation? Today, each European Union Member State operates an aviation safety system independently from each other; in addition, each country is responsible for the regulation of own aircraft. As a result, all military airworthiness activities are conducted and regulated on a national basis, and any harmonisation is only achieved at individual project level. \u00a0 This national approach generates many shortcomings and is the primary cause for delay and additional costs in multinational programmes. There is a unique opportunity to agree on an EU wide harmonisation and unification strategy on military airworthiness to be the benefit of governments and industry, and the overall strength of the European Defence Technology and Industrial Base (EDTIB). Stakeholder\u2019s requirements expressed during the Workshop demonstrated that the EU wide Harmonisation of Military Airworthiness is the main interest of national Airworthiness Authorities. It is expected that a common approach will improve European military aviation safety and reduce the necessary investments and lead time for future multinational air system programmes; being thus the key enabler for cost-effective maintenance services. Focusing further on the development of a common set of European Airworthiness Requirements, the participants were able to gain valuable insights regarding the civil safety approach: EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency) policy towards civil Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and its relations to military developments in this field - presented by David Haddon; EUROCAE WG 73 (European Organization for Civil Aviation Equipment) and their airworthiness approach to civil UAS presented by Michael Allouche; EUROCONTROL (European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation) Air Traffic Management (ATM) and SESAR (Single European Sky ATM Research) activities \u00a0presented by Jorge Pereira; NATOs views on Airworthiness presented by Timothy E. Gowen; EDA\u2019s Harmonised European Military approach to Airworthiness as tasked by the Defence Ministers in November 2008, presented by Jan Plevka, Chairman of the MAWA Forum. The workshop concluded with a final panel session compiling all participants, presenting the collected findings derived in the different work streams. The attendees received valuable feedback and views particularly from the aircraft industry, authorities and international organisations outside the MAWA Forum on the MAWA proposed approach. Some of the summarized key findings are: To determine how best to promote European Military Airworthiness Requirements (EMARs) concept; To seek quick wins based on lessons learned for promotion & collaboration; To determine when and how to engage with industry & other 3rd parties; To determine what level of trust for mutual recognition taking safety into account; Industry organisational approvals to account for civil organisational approvals where appropriate; Initiating a feasibility study associated with the formation of a European Military Joint Airworthiness Authority; Developing an equivalent MIL-HDB-516b document that points to the existing military/civil standards; Evaluate the feasibility to link MAWA procedures with the US military; Wider Engagement by EASA & EDA with NATO is seen as necessary regarding civil and Military Airworthiness harmonisation; Sense and Avoid - may become a critical issue with respect to certification and airworthiness; exchange of accident databases: Exchange of accident databases between civil and military users.

Coordinating and combining EU Member States\u2019 orders for satellite communications services will ensure better access to such services at competitive prices. The European Satellite Communications Procurement Cell will be a three-year pilot project (2010- 2012) in order to gain practical experience with centralising commercial SATCOM procurement at the EU level.

At their bilateral Summit in March 2008, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and French President Nicolas Sarkozy underlined the need to improve the availability of helicopters for crisis management operations. Following this high-level meeting, the Steering Board of the European Defence Agency (EDA) selected \u201cIncreasing Availability for ESDP Operations\u201d as one of the twelve priorities, when endorsing the Agency\u2019s Capability Development Plan. The Agency\u2019s work strand for near-term results is \u201ctraining\u201d to quickly improve helicopter availability. Helicopter crews in some European countries are not trained to fly in more austere conditions, such as mountainous terrain. The Agency is developing a \u201cHelicopter Tactics Programme\u201d (HTP) for such training at the European level. This HTP will become operational in 2010. In the context of preparing the HTP the Agency is conducting two practical exercises, with help from the two nations who started the initiative.

Chemical or biological agents have been used in attacks against military personnel and civilians in recent years and the threat of these weapons is likely to increase in the future. The European Defence Agency is meeting this challenge head on by running an exercise at the operational and tactical level to examine all of the issues involved with CBRN agents. Having worked for two years to develop procedures and practices, they are now being put into practice at a high level headquarters based exercise. Military experts from across the European Union are gathered to refine these procedures and to exchange ideas on the best way to address an attack of this nature. Although primarily focused on deployed operations, the exercise takes the opportunity to share ideas on homeland defence from different European institutions and other agencies. Representatives from NATO are also sharing their experiences and ensuring that their work goes hand in hand with that the European Defence Agency. The exercise runs from 11 to 13 November and three scenarios are examined in order to test simulating different combinations of chemical, biological and radiological substances to enhance agents\u2019 capabilities. Each scenario runs through several mock headquarters set up to test reactions and procedure to incidents. The exercise has tactical level demonstrations of mock incidents dealt with by the Royal Belgian Army, who has significant experience in dealing with chemical weapons left over from World War 1. This is a unique platform for experts from both the CBRN arena and the Explosives Ordnance Disposal (EOD) or bomb disposal communities to share their ideas and experiences. The result should produce a robust template for the management of incidents which will allow procedures to be developed for operational level headquarters for multi-national EU led operations. Recent EDA work includes a concept for the EOD containing CBRN materials. A concept for the Detection Identification and Monitoring of Biological agents and work on a dual protection of Individual Protective Equipment (IPE) against both explosives and CBRN agents for bomb disposal operators. More recently work has started on a programme for the development of a biological agent detection equipment programme.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2008/11/11/EDA_Hosts_a_Chemical_Biological_and_Radiological_Agents_Exercise"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_1044", "date": "2008-11-10", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "European Air Transport Fleet Launched", "text": " European Defence Ministers, meeting in the Steering Board of the European Defence Agency, launched today concrete initiatives and projects for improving European military capabilities. Decisions were taken on programmes related to air transport, maritime surveillance and helicopters, amongst others. \"This is the concrete follow-up to the discussions which took place at the Informal EU Defence Ministers meeting in Deauville early October. We are seeing today that the Agency can very quickly translate political intentions into concrete proposals. These programmes will create tangible European capabilities and improve the capacity for crisis management operations\u201d, said Head of the Agency Javier Solana, who chaired the meeting. European Air Transport Fleet European Defence Ministers launched today EDA work on establishing a European Air Transport Fleet (EATF). A Declaration of Intent on participation in the initiative was signed by Defence Ministers of Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Spain. The EATF aims at reducing European air transport shortfalls by pooling aircraft such as the A400M and C130. Participation can take different forms: making aircraft available; purchasing, providing or exchanging flying hours; or to provide and benefit from shared and/or pooled support functions (training, maintenance, etc.). Milestones have been set with the aim of reaching EATF initial operational capability by the next decade. \u201cThe EATF Declaration is most welcome, as pooling European aircraft and services will improve the lift capabilities and alleviate a significant European shortfall\u201d, said Alexander Weis, the Agency\u2019s Chief Executive. Maritime Mine Counter-Measures The Steering Board also launched two other projects. Ten Member States (Belgium, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Sweden) plus Norway will work closely together in an EDA project for the future replacement of their maritime mine counter-measures capabilities in an EDA project. Activities will commence with an assessment phase, leading to recommendations for the selection of systems solutions and addressing all relevant aspects. Mine counter-measures in littoral sea areas has been identified as one of the initial 12 prioritised actions in the context of the Agency\u2019s Capability Development Plan (CDP). Future Unmanned Aerial System Another project, related to Maritime Surveillance, is the launch of work for a Future Unmanned Aerial System. Based on common requirements, seven Member States (Finland, France, Germany, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden) will begin the preparations for the development of an unmanned aerial system, which will be able to take off and land on a ship\u2019s deck. This future system will increase the capability for wide area surveillance in support of ESDP operations, a need which has been identified in the Capability Development Plan. Space-based Earth Surveillance System Five Member States (Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Spain) signed a Letter of Intent on the second generation of space-based imaging capacity. This Multinational Space-based Imaging System for surveillance, reconnaissance and observation (MUSIS) project aims at continuity of service from 2015 onwards. The MUSIS partners intend to launch an EDA Category B project on the basis on their initiative, which will be open for other Member States' participation. Helicopters The Steering Board endorsed a roadmap for the Helicopter Tactics Training Programme, part of the Agency\u2019s work to improve availability of helicopters for ESDP operations. The contents of this programme will be defined in the course of 2009, based on the results of two studies \u2013 focussing on the requirements \u2013 and the lessons learned from an exercise, to take place in France in spring 2009. The Programme itself will start in 2010. \u201cThe Agency is quickly progressing with its helicopter work. The Helicopter Tactics Programme is proving that in some cases training can provide additional capabilities in the short-term. Improving ESDP capabilities does not always require new equipment\u201d, said Alexander Weis, EDA\u2019s Chief Executive. Ministers also took stock of the progress made on the Agency\u2019s work on upgrading helicopters, with the aim to offer a detailed menu with upgrade options by spring 2009. Germany and France informed the Steering Board of their intent to bring their bilateral initiative for a Future Transport Helicopter into the Agency in the near future, opening up the project to other interested Member States. The project aims at developing intra-theatre transport helicopter for the 2020+ timeframe. European Defence Research and Technology Strategy Ministers endorsed the European Defence Research and Technology (EDRT) Strategy to enhance and develop more effective research collaboration to deliver timely the right technologies in support of military capabilities. The Strategy defines \u201cends\u201d (key technologies to invest in), \u201cmeans\u201d (how to invest better, such as through improved R&T collaborations) and \u201cways\u201d (roadmaps and action plans). Four of the 12 priority actions of the Capability Development Plan have been chosen for identifying potential R&T projects: Counter-Man Portable Air-Defence Systems (C-MANPADS), Mine Counter- Measures, Counter-Improvised Explosive Devices (C-IED) and Chemical, Biological and Radiological or Nuclear (CBRN) - specifically detection of biological weapons. The EDRT Strategy completes the EDA work on its strategic framework. With the CDP as the overall strategic tool this framework consists of the EDRT Strategy, the Armaments Cooperation Strategy (endorsed in October 2008) and the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base Strategy (endorsed in May 2007). Innovative Concepts and Emerging Technologies Ten Member States (Cyprus, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain) plus Norway signed the Programme Arrangement for the Joint Investment Programme on Innovative Concepts and Emerging Technologies (JIP-ICET). The Programme aims at promoting basic research cooperation, for example on an integrated navigation architecture and on nanotechnologies for soldier protection. Forum for Military Airworthiness Authorities Ministers decided to create a European Union-wide Forum for Military Airworthiness Authorities. This Forum will be used to harmonise the different national military airworthiness regulations within the European Union in order to stop duplication of work, to reduce costs and to shorten timelines for multinational procurement. Work Programme The Steering Board approved the Agency\u2019s Work Programme for 2009. The focus of the Work Programme is on concrete projects, in particular related to the 12 prioritised actions stemming from the Capability Development Plan. The Agency will have a 2009 budget of \u20ac 30m, including \u20ac 8m operational budget for studies, and will recruit ten new staff. The budget was adopted by the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Defence Ministers formation. Defence Data 2007 Ministers were informed on the results of the Agency\u2019s defence data-collecting for 2007 and on the assessment of the collective benchmarks for Defence R&T and equipment procurement.

The Strategy has three aims: firstly, it will help to generate, promote and facilitate co-operation through a dedicated programme preparation phase. This phase is crucial, as early decisions are needed in order to reduce overall programme costs, to realise shortest possible timescales and have maximum performance. The second aim is related to the European Defence Industrial and Technological Base. A solid EDTIB is a prerequisite for effective European armaments co-operation. This includes greater transparency and mutual understanding between governments and industries. And a third strategic aim builds on the previous work of the Agency in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the armaments co-operation more generally. \"The Agency has worked together with its shareholders in preparing an Armaments Strategy that provides a solid foundation for improving the way we conduct armaments cooperation in Europe. Applying the \u2018Guide to the Conduct of a Programme Preparation Phase\u2019 is a major step in translating the many facets of the Strategy into tangible action,\" said Eero Lavonen, who chaired the meeting. An intrinsic part of the Strategy is the Europe Defence Test and Evaluation Base (DTEB). The Steering Board approved a Conceptual Guide for DTEB to target priority areas, coordinate investments, encourage reciprocal use of facilities and create a network of Test and Evaluation capabilities, with the aim of having a consolidated and coherent European DTEB by 2030. The National Armaments Directors further underlined that Small and Medium-sized Enterprises are vital for an innovative and competitive European Defence Technological and Industrial Base. The EDA Steering Board therefore agreed on developing a number of measures aimed at supporting increased involvement of SMEs and non-traditional suppliers in the EDTIB. Contracting policies that will enhance SMEs opportunities to win contracts will be further analysed, and an experts\u2019 working group will develop Common Guidelines for simplification and harmonisation of tendering and contracting processes related to lower value contracts. In addition the Agency will develop an armaments cooperation driven IT platform to enable industry to propose solutions to pMS priorities. One key enabler is the Code of Best Practice in the Supply Chain which will be promoted more vigorously by Governments. They will also decide on a new publication threshold for the EBB in support of SMEs at their next meeting in the spring 2009. \u201dI think it is of great value that the NADs fully recognise the importance of SMEs for a competitive EDTIB. It is necessary to create conditions allowing SMEs and non-traditional suppliers to fully exploit market possibilities. EDA, supported by industry experts, has identified the right kind of measures.\u201d said Chief Executive Alexander Weis. The EDA Steering Board also reviewed today the report in the implementation of the Code of Conduct Regime on Defence Procurement which, together with its IT tool the Electronic Bulletin Board (EBB) came into effect on 1 July 2006. The assessment of the overall implementation of the Regime is positive and, in general, subscribing Member States (sMS) have adapted their procurement practices to the CoC\u2019s provisions. The volume of Government contract opportunities posted on the EBB has steadily grown. By 1 September 2008, 18 of the 26 sMS had published more than 340 contract opportunities. As of the same date, 127 out of the 340 Contract Notices published by the sMS for competition had already been awarded for a total value of \u20ac2.3bn (excl. VAT), 28 being cross-border awarded contracts. There is still limited cross-border bidding by industry \u2013 only in one-third of the opportunities which is a main explanation to the relatively low number of cross-border awards. Nevertheless, in 70% of the cases when there are cross-border bidders, the contract is cross-border awarded. EDA has been also informed by 1 September 2008 of 222 government contracts falling under the exceptions to the CoC for a total value of \u20ac2.5bn (excl. VAT), mostly for \u201csupplementary goods and services\u201d and \u201cfollow-on work\u201d, which seems to be a reasonable and relatively restrictive use of the follow-on exceptions. The Code of Best Practice in the Supply Chain (CoBPSC) and its EBB associated part (Industry-to-Industry contract opportunities) is still experiencing a slow growth in terms of publications, although it enjoys support by industry as a beneficial tool. The Agency continues its activities to increase awareness on the EBB2, including through the recently launched Call Centre which has already contacted about 2,000 defence-related companies. The Steering Board reviewed ongoing EDA work on improving the availability of helicopters for ESDP operations. The NATO Assistant Secretary General for Defence Investment, Peter Flory, briefed the Steering Board on NATO\u2019s ongoing activities on helicopters.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2008/10/15/EU_Governments_Agree_on_an_Armaments_Cooperation_Strategy"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_1046", "date": "2008-07-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EU Governments Endorse Capability Plan for Future Military Needs, Pledge Joint Efforts", "text": " \u00a0 European Union governments today endorsed a Capability Development Plan (CDP) defining the future military needs and priorities of European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) and agreed to use it to guide future national defence investment decisions and to seek opportunities to collaborate so as to address their short-to-longer-term military requirements coherently. The CDP, developed over the past 18 months by the European Defence Agency, its 26 participating Member States (pMS), the EU Military Committee and the EU Council General Secretariat, contains a significant body of analysis from which conclusions and an initial tranche of practical proposals for action have been derived. It was presented to a meeting of the EDA\u2019s Steering Board, made up of directors of capability planning from the 26 pMS. \u201cThe CDP provides the picture all Member States need to take into account when planning future capability development agendas and finding the right balance between ambition and resources. Linking theory to practice is a job for everyone,\u201d said Javier Solana, Head of the Agency. \u201cIt is quite clear, however, that the CDP is not a supranational military equipment or capability plan which aims to replace national defence plans and programmes. It should support, not replace national decision-making,\u201d he added. The CDP is an attempt to address the well-documented fragmentation in demand for European military capabilities, caused in part by a lack of coordinated military requirements and comprehensive priorities. It builds on the EDA\u2019s Long-Term Vision report, published in 2006. Among its principal conclusions are the importance of intelligence and information-sharing during operations in complex environments; the need for flexible and agile responses to unpredictable threats; the requirement to coordinate military and civilian activities in crisis management operations; and the challenge of recruiting talented and well-qualified personnel for the armed forces. As part of the effort, Member States contributed to a database of the national programmes and priorities, which has initially revealed a large number of different areas where more than one country was working on similar ideas. The meeting agreed with the Agency\u2019s proposals for how the appropriate collaboration could be encouraged in each of these areas. The Steering Board agreed on 12 topics for specific action, such as countermeasures against improvised explosive devices, computer network defence and medical support, and asked the Agency to prepare a detailed way forward for each set of priorities. \u201cA capability-driven Agency means: investing in and delivering those capabilities which the CDP has listed as the needs for tomorrow, both in the short and the longer term,\u201d said EDA Chief Executive Alexander Weis. Separately, the Steering Board also reviewed progress on existing initiatives designed to address capability needs whose importance was underlined by the CDP. To improve the availability of helicopters for EU operations, the meeting agreed to a series of measures on helicopter training, which would allow cooperation between Member States and increase the operational availability of aircrew, and on upgrading existing aircraft. The Steering Board considered a report on Network-Enabled Capabilities \u2013 the use of information technology to link all actors in an operation together so that information can be reliably shared \u2013 and agreed that the Agency should fund a study on how the NEC concept could be implemented. The NEC concept described in the report lays particular stress on the potential such technologies to support a unified effort of civilian and military entities involved in operations. Protection against sea mines, maritime surveillance, biological agent detection and combating terrorist bombs were among the force protection issues discussed as areas where the Agency is developing significant capabilities to enhance the operational effectiveness of European military forces. Following an EDA conference this year on the role of third-party commercial support for logistics, the Steering Board agreed to set up a trial of a European Support Platform for connecting industry with planners and commanders to provide help to meet the logistics requirements of EU operations.

The decision was taken at a ministerial Steering Board meeting of the European Defence Agency (EDA), to which all EU members except Denmark belong. The EDA administers the Regime and operates the Electronic Bulletin Board (EBB) portal on which contracting opportunities are advertised. \u201cWe are delighted that Norway will be participating in the Regime, which will help our efforts to open the European Defence Equipment Market and further strengthen our Defence Technological and Industrial Base,\u201d said Head of the Agency Javier Solana, who chaired the meeting. Norway has an Administrative Arrangement for cooperation with the EDA. Although not a member of the EU, it participates in its European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) in many ways, contributing troops to ESDP operations and forming part of the EU Nordic Battle Group. \u201cIt is a privilege for Norway, as the first country outside the European Union, to be able to participate in the Regime on Defence Procurement and its Code of Conduct, fostering transparent and integrated defence markets,\u201d said Norwegian Defence Minister Anne-Grete Strom-Erichsen. \u201cBy committing ourselves to the level playing field of the Regime, and on the basis of our relatively high defence expenditure and competitive defence industry, I am sure that the development of the European Defence Equipment Market will benefit from our participation,\u201d she added. The non-legally binding Regime has been in effect since 1 July 2006 and has two main parts: a Code of Conduct for government procurement contracts, which requires equal treatment for companies from all countries subscribing to the regime according to clear and transparent criteria; and a Code of Best Practice in the Supply Chain, under which the defence industry applies the same principles to sub-contracting opportunities. That part of the EBB portal was implemented in March 2007. The Norwegian Defence and Security Industries Association (FSi), representing the country\u2019s defence industry, has endorsed the Code of Best Practice in the Supply Chain and will work with companies to ensure that it is implemented. The Steering Board also welcomed a report on the operation of the Regime and noted that the overall assessment was positive. Governments have so far published more than 260 contract opportunities based on open competition, worth more than \u20ac10 billion. Although only in its early stages, the supply chain code had seen 12 different companies posting 30 formal sub-contracting notices on EBB2, and 13 more companies had advertised a further 123 potential opportunities. The Steering Board asked the Agency to continue monitoring the implementation of the Regime, particularly to see whether high value contracts would be awarded across borders by governments and suggested possible improvements in a number of areas which might lead to an increase in cross-border bidding. \u201cThe decision by Norway to participate in the Regime, following a similar decision by Bulgaria last month, shows the strength of commitment to the concept,\u201d said EDA Chief Executive Alexander Weis. \u201cA cultural change towards transparency and publication for cross-border competition is being achieved.\u201d", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2008/05/25/EDA_Agrees_on_Norway_s_Participation_in_Regime_on_Defence_Procurement"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_1050", "date": "2008-05-26", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA Establishes New Joint R&T Programme on Disruptive Defence Technologies", "text": " European governments agreed today to establish a new Joint Investment Programme (JIP) for research into emerging technologies which might have a disruptive effect on the battlefield, using an innovative structure devised by the European Defence Agency to boost collaborative European efforts on defence Research & Technology.

The demonstration of the initial functionalities of the Tactical Imagery Exploitation System (TIES) system took place at the EU Satellite Centre (SatCen) in Torrejon, Spain, which is expected to be one of the main potential EU users of any such system in the future. \u201cGeospatial intelligence is a key enabler for effective ESDP operations. The TIES workstation is a major step forward in bringing that capability to operational decision-makers,\u201d said Frank Asbeck, Director of SATCEN. \u201cWe are delighted to be working with EU Satellite Centre on this initiative, which demonstrates how this kind of European collaboration can produce real practical benefits both for our Member States and the institutions responsible for supporting EU operations,\u201d EDA Chief Executive Alexander Weis said in Torrejon. The project is the result of a decision by the EDA Steering Board in May 2006, which recognised the need for a workstation for Imagery Analysis, capable of receiving imagery data in different formats and fusing it into one usable and workable Intelligence product. It aims to compensate the for lack of interoperability between imagery-producing I SR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) systems and ground terminals. Currently many systems can link only to a single, dedicated ground terminal that is not able to receive and process any data coming from other sources. The demonstrator will remain available at SatCen so that individual participating Member States will be able to evaluate the product. They have offered to provide trained imagery analysts or have made available tactical imagery data to be used to test the system. The trials will end in September 2008. A separate Ad Hoc Project Management Group on TIES has been established to discuss the results, and to propose any modifications if necessary.

Officials from the European Defence Agency, the EU Satellite Centre and European governments attending a Demonstration Day of the Tactical Imagery Exploitation System (TIES) at SatCen in Torrejon, Spain, on 20 Februrary 2008. TIES Project Background The aim of the contract is to deliver a TIES demonstration/experiment based at EU SatCen in order to spur wider adoption of such capability within the EU ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition And Reconnaissance) community, with the following specific sub-objectives: To reduce technical risk and identify organisational and operational consequences associated with the introduction of TIES to Deployed Force structures, so as to encourage procurement of a capability which improves operational efficiency, effectiveness and interoperability. To prove the basic functionality of an EU Imagery Architecture. Trial Objectives The trial is a Concept Capability Demonstrator (CCD). The objectives of the trial are to demonstrate: The utilities of TIES for tasks in all phases of a developing crisis, simulating the use of TIES at the EU SatCen, at an Operational HQ, at a Field HQ preparing for deployment, and then in the field close to an FHQ or to tactical ground receiving stations. That a bespoke, tailored Imagery Product Library (IPL), based on EU SatCen library product, can be uploaded into an imagery management system within TIES. That an imagery analyst working on the TIES can manipulate and analyse imagery, using both the IPL and imagery from tactical sensors, to produce tailored imagery products (e.g. annotated imagery) and intelligence text reports, in response to specific Requests for Information (RFIs) from a commander or other customer. That the TIES can import and process a representative range of current tactical imagery data formats. This importation should be direct, via a network, or via various electro-optical/electro-magnetic media (e.g. DVD, CD and floppy discs) and legacy wet-film products digitised internally within the TIES system. That IPL updates and other imagery data can be transmitted from the EU SatCen to the TIES, and that the tactical imagery data imported onto the TIES can be transmitted to the EU SatCen for further exploitation and manipulation. That intelligence reports (including annotated imagery) and RFIs can be both received and sent from and to the TIES workstation via for demonstration purposes the EU OPSWAN. EU Satellite Center Background The European Union Satellite Centre (SatCen) is an Agency of the European Union which works in the frame of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, especially in support of the European Security and Defence Policy. It provides geospatial intelligence products and services to the Council of the EU, the Member States, the Commission, Third States1 and international organisations.

I feel at home in Helsinki, because Finland has been a staunch supporter of the European Defence Agency from the beginning. It actively contributes to many EDA activities and projects, and we have several excellent Finnish nationals working at EDA, including since January this year Jukka Juusti as new Armaments Director. And, of course, I have to mention your National Armaments Director, Eero Lavonen, who continues to serve the Agency as the Chairman of our Steering Board in NADs formation. So, I am very happy to explain to you what EDA is about and what we are doing. In the simplest terms, EDA is the \u201cback office\u201d for the European Security and Defence Policy \u2013 ESDP. Its task is to improve the military capabilities needed to carry out ESDP operations. So, let me say a few words on EDA in general \u2013 its functions, how it operates and how it fits in the family of European institutions. I will then point to our achievements so far and our 2008 agendas. EDA General The European Defence Agency is an intergovernmental Agency. It can only function and succeed in close cooperation with its participating Member States. They are the key shareholders. This implies that EDA has a limited role, but an important one. It coordinates, it stimulates and promotes cooperation between the Member States, and it provides the common tent under which European collaborations can take place. Logically, the Agency is controlled by the Member States. In our case it is not the Council but the Agency\u2019s Steering Board. That is the place where decisions are taken and guidance is given. The Steering Board is composed of 26 Ministers of Defence and meets at least twice per year, normally back-to-back with the half-yearly meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Defence Ministers composition. Javier Solana is the Head of the Agency and chairs the Ministerial Steering Board meetings. Furthermore, the Steering Board meets at sub-ministerial levels: Capability Directors, National Armaments Directors and Research & Technology Directors. The EDA is small in size and budget. We have just under 100 staff and our functional budget is around \u20ac 20 million. In addition we have a few million to spend on studies, mainly to investigate potential for future collaborations between the Member States (what we call pre-feasibility studies). Nevertheless, EDA has a wide set of functional responsibilities. Our four functional areas are: Harmonisation of military requirements, Promoting Joint Defence Research and Technology, Promoting Armaments Cooperation, and Creating a European Defence Equipment Market and strengthening the European Defence Industrial Base. The founding fathers of the Agency have given us these four functional areas because we need to make progress on all four of them together to improve military capabilities. For you it may sound simple and logical. But I can tell you that in many European countries, military planners, research establishments, Industry & Markets experts and those responsible for acquisition (the Armaments Directorates) still live in separate worlds. So, what we call the Integrated Way of Working, with representatives of these four disciplines working closely together at the European level, is in fact breaking with the past. It is crucial to our success. But let me underline that EDA will remain a capability-driven Agency. The Agency works closely with defence industries, but will not become a tool they can steer as they want. Rather, it will work in the opposite direction. Any projects or programmes we launch must be viewed through the lens of the capabilities needed by the military. EDA \u2013 Achievements and 2008 Agendas I would now like to focus on our achievements which are quite notable considering that we have been operating for barely three years. Taking up the last remark on a capability-driven Agency with a particular focus beyond the near term, one of the first notable outputs of the EDA was the Long Term Vision, a report which was endorsed by European Defence Ministers in October 2006. It describes in general terms what sort of challenges Europe will face in 10 to 20 years from now and what these challenges mean for the capabilities we need. You can find the complete Long Term Vision on our website. The LTV is now being elaborated into a more detailed Capability Development Plan (the CDP), to be approved in early July this year. It is not a plan in the traditional sense. It will not subscribe the numbers of tanks, aircraft and ships the Member States should have. That is Cold War defence planning. Rather, the CDP will provide a global picture of capability needs, capability trends and capability shortfalls. At the same time it will provide \u201cactionable conclusions\u201d, setting the agendas for real programmes and early opportunities for collaborations between the Member States. And, naturally, we expect the Member States to take the CDP into account when developing or adjusting their national defence plans. On Defence Research & Technology, we have actually made more progress with concrete results than with the theoretical basis. We hope that in November this year Ministers will approve a European Defence Research & Technology Strategy, describing both the ends \u2013 the technologies European countries should invest in -- and the means -- how they should invest more effectively and do more together. And, in a few weeks from now, we hope to get approval from Defence Ministers on a list of key technologies Europe needs to preserve or develop so that we are not dependent on non-European suppliers for these critical elements. But, as I said, we have made a great breakthrough in the practical field, namely by launching the Defence R&T Joint Investment Programme on Force Protection (the \u2018JIP\u2019). It was approved in November 2006, with 19 of the Member States plus Norway joining the Programme. We are very pleased that Finland is among the participants. Together they have made some \u20ac 55 million available, to be invested in technology research in support of specific Force Protection capability aims. The programme is an excellent example of close cooperation between the military and researchers. It also is a breakthrough in another sense. In traditional collaborative research efforts, contributors sometimes seemed as concerned with ensuring that their share of the funds was spent on activities in their countries as on the final results of the efforts. Under the JIP, projects are allocated to bidders by a management board of all contributors, based on competition. And the R&T institutions or laboratories have to create consortia with others to be able to bid, including at least one SME-type institution or industry. In that way the JIP also helps to generate more R&T networking in Europe. In short: the JIP is a great success and, in 2008, we hope to launch a second Joint Investment Programme, demonstrating that we are making progress in spending better and spending more together on Defence R&T. On the Industry and Market side, the biggest achievement is the Regime on Defence Procurement and its Code of Conduct. The Code has created a step-change in opening up the European Defence Equipment Market, which until recently was exempt from the normal single market competition rules under Article. 296 of the European Communities Treaty and was therefore effectively a series of national markets, not a European one. The Code has now been up and running for more than a year-and-a-half. Governments have advertised about 260 contract opportunities on our online portal, the Electronic Bulletin Board, with a value over \u20ac10 billion. Finland[A1]\u00a0 is an active contributor to the EBB. We have seen so far 16 cross-border awards of contracts and, naturally, we would like to see that number increasing in support of our aim to make the EDEM more transparent and more competitive \u00a0[A1]Check how much advertised by Finland and whether any cross-border awards. Also in this area, last May Ministers approved the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base or the EDTIB Strategy, which gives direction towards realising a stronger, more competent and more competitive EDTIB. There is now consensus on the need for more interdependence in the European DTIB as well as less dependence on non-European key industrial capabilities. Of course, the question is \u201chow to get there?\u201d We are working on the basis of a set of roadmaps to take the work forward in a practical sense. A crucial activity is to define the key industrial capabilities in Europe, which will also contribute to improving long-term Security of Supply, and, therefore, to increasing European autonomy. The first sector we will focus on is \u201cFuture Air Systems\u201d, simply because discussions with our Member States have shown that most views converge on the future importance of this key industrial capability in Europe. A major specific item this year is EDA work on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or UAVs. We hope to realise a breakthrough in a topic that nobody so far has tackled in an all-inclusive way, namely the insertion of UAVs into normal air space. This is an issue with many dimensions: legal and regulatory elements \u2013 not for the Agency to arrange but the Agency might bring them to the fore; certification procedures \u2013 a standard for certification could be developed by EDA; and, of course, new technologies needed to ensure that UAVs can fly in regulated air space with the same safety guarantees as manned aircraft \u2013 such as \u2018Sense and Avoid\u2019 technologies, an area where the Agency has early results from a study conducted in the recent past. This coming spring, another study will deliver the full picture of what is needed for insertion of UAVs into regulated air space. Based on the study results EDA will define a business case. This business case will be used to spend \u20ac 6 million, which have been earmarked in the Agency\u2019s 2008 budget. And UAVs form a good example how we work closely together with the European Commission. Why? Because the Commission is investing money under the European Security Research Programme for future needs of UAVs for civil use (for example for border control, disaster relief, and so on). It would be foolish to miss the opportunity to harmonise civil and military requirements. And it would be even worse to spend money twice on developing comparable technologies. And there are other areas where we are coordinating closely with the Commission to seek civil-military synergies (for example on Software Defined Radio and Maritime Surveillance). An output-oriented Agency A final remark. Ultimately, the success of the Agency will be measured by more and better European capabilities becoming available to the EU. But such success will not come naturally. The Agency will do whatever it can, but we depend absolutely on our participating Member States. First of all, we need them to bring forward suggestions for real projects which are important to them and which can bring real results and deliver real capabilities. Even more important, it is national governments who have to decide how to spend their money and what to spend it on, so they invest in the right capabilities and increase cooperation with others. As I said at the beginning of my talk, here, in Finland, I feel at home and I am preaching to the converted. But I call on all of you to assist the Agency and in your contacts, both inside and outside Finland, to convince others of the need to work more closely together in Europe for the benefit of all. Thank you very much for your attention. Now I would be happy to address any questions you might have.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2008/05/05/EDA_Chief_Executive_Alexander_Weis_Outlines_EDA_Agenda_at_a_Colloquium_in_Helsinki"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_1055", "date": "2008-04-09", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EU Governments ask EDA for Armaments Strategy, agree Steps for More Defence Collaboration", "text": " EU governments today asked the European Defence Agency to produce an Armaments Strategy to help meet future military needs, ensure interoperability and standardization, and share the ever-increasing costs of developing and procuring high-technology defence equipment. A two-day meeting of the EDA Steering Board also agreed a number of specific measures to intensify defence collaboration, including work on key technologies and industrial capabilities to be retained or developed in Europe, rules to help greater sharing of testing facilities, actions to encourage more cross-border bids for defence equipment contracts, and further investments in the Agency\u2019s work on Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs). \u201cThe Agency and its shareholders have done a great job so far in developing strategies and policies, and significant progress is visible in R&T and the defence market,\u201d said Eero Lavonen, who chaired the meeting\u2019s second day with National Armaments Directors. \u201cIt is high time to boost armaments cooperation under EDA\u2019s auspices. We have a tool at our disposal and we must use it fully.\u201d Jan-Olof Lind, who chaired meeting of R&T Directors on the first day, was satisfied that good progress has been made in implementing the Framework for a Joint European Strategy in Defence R&T, adopted by the Steering Board last November.\u00a0 He also stressed the need for the Agency\u2019s 26 participating Member States (all EU members except Denmark) to share information on specific initiatives they were planning or developing. \u201cThis can only enhance transparency and increase potential for cooperation \u2013 which is part of the Agency\u2019s overall objective. It is time to see new and more significant cooperative projects and programmes under the Agency,\u201d he said. The Armaments Strategy, which will focus in particular on how to convert agreed defence capability needs into collaborative programmes, will be presented in November to a ministerial meeting of the Steering Board, the Agency\u2019s highest decision-making body on which governments and the European Commission are represented. Among the other steps agreed during the meeting were rules and procedures for governments to share test and evaluation facilities for military equipment, which have traditionally been developed and operated on a purely national basis.\u00a0 Lavonen welcomed the fact that France had last week announced plans for a test programme for integrated equipment on aircraft and encouraged other governments to share information about future testing projects. The meeting heard a report on the first full year of operation of the Code of Conduct to encourage cross-border defence procurement and the associated online portals (see Appendix 1 for highlights). The Steering Board said the overall implementation had been positive, with subscribing Member States adapting their practices to conform with the Code. The Code had brought real change to the way procurement happens. The volume of government contract opportunities posted on the EDA\u2019s Electronic Bulletin Board (EBB) had steadily grown, with 18 of the 24 subscribing governments publishing more than 260 contract opportunities. In 2007, 60 contracts worth \u20ac616 million were already awarded as a result of competition and 16 of them were cross-border, although there was still only limited cross-border bidding by industry. The largest opportunity published had an estimated value of \u20ac1 billion. The report said the parallel Code of Best Practice to encourage greater competition in the supply chain and the online portal were now recognized by a number of the most active companies as beneficial tools allowing them to easily reach out to potential new suppliers in Europe. Together with the Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD), whose President \u00c5ke Svensson addressed the Steering Board meeting, the Agency plans a series of initiatives and marketing actions to increase awareness of the EBB to more defence-related companies in Europe to develop a critical mass of users. Svensson told the Steering Board that industry fully supported the defence procurement regime, but to make the initiative reach its full potential required continued effective leadership starting at the highest levels in governments and industry. \u201cFrom an industry perspective we also need more common requirements that lead to more common development and procurement, especially of complex and advanced systems,\u201d he said. On the subject of UAVs, the Steering Board noted with satisfaction the work already done by the Agency for a Road Map to integrate the unmanned craft into conventional airspace and asked it to come up with further proposals in four areas: integration and coordination; standardisation and harmonisation; R&T projects into high-priority technology areas where immediate investment is needed; and initial areas for demonstration and validation. In response to a proposal by the United Kingdom about the general issues raised by the need for every country to certify the airworthiness of new military UAVs, the Agency was tasked to start investigating the idea of an EU-wide forum on military Airworthiness to save time and money. The meeting also heard a presentation on the MIDCAS project involving Sweden and France on collision-avoidance systems for UAVs and encouraged other Member States to share relevant R&T initiatives in this way. \u201cI am delighted to see Member States bringing suggestions for collaboration to the Steering Board,\u201d said EDA Chief Executive Alexander Weis. \u201cThe Agency wants to see many more joint projects but we need inputs and support from governments so we can make a difference,\u201d he added. Main Points of EDA report into workings of Regime on Defence Procurement The assessment of the overall implementation of the Code of Conduct is positive and, in general, subscribing Member States (sMS) have adapted their procurement practices to the CoC\u2019s provisions; The volume of Government contract opportunities posted on the European Bulletin Board 1 (EBB1) has steadily grown. By 1 April 2008, 18 of the 24 sMS had published more than 260 contract opportunities; During 2007, sMS published on EBB1 60 Contract Award Notices (CAN) with competition for a total value of \u20ac616M (excl. VAT), 16 being cross-border contracts and 32 awarded to SMEs. It should be taken into consideration that there is still limited cross-border bidding by industry; The EDA has been informed for 2007 of 112 government contracts falling under the exceptions to the CoC, mostly for \u201csupplementary goods and services\u201d and \u201cfollow-on work\u201d, which seems to be a reasonable and relatively restrictive use of the follow-on exceptions; The EDA continue to work on a number of aspects which still affect fair competition across borders (e.g. Security of Supply); The EBB2 (for sub-contracting opportunities) enjoys support by industry, where it is considered as being an important step in the right direction from both buyers and suppliers towards changing behaviours in the supply chain; During EBB2\u2019s first year of operation, it has started to be recognized by a number of the most active companies as a beneficial tool that was missing until now,\u00a0allowing them to easily reach out to potential new suppliers in Europe and increase the efficiency of their supply chains; and The Agency has launched a number of initiatives and marketing actions across the 24 sMS aimed at increasing awareness of EBB to the broader European defence-related industrial base (E-newsletter, Local Partners network, Call Centre). The objective is to increase usage, which is still limited, and reach the critical mass needed to deliver added value to both buyers and suppliers.

So, first of all let me wish you all a very happy 2008. My predecessor, Nick Witney, used to visit the Subcommittee regularly to discuss with you the ongoing and future activities of the European Defence Agency. I am glad to continue this tradition and I thank you, Chairman, for the early invitation. I say \u201cearly\u201d because it is barely three months since I started my job as the second Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency, on 1 October last year. This has two implications: One \u2013 I don\u2019t start from scratch, as I build on the results which have been realised in the first three years of the Agency\u2019s existence. So, you will see a lot of continuity \u2013 and I will come back to some of the major agendas running from 2007 into 2008; and Two \u2013 as a newcomer I will also try to make a few changes. The theme here is: to make the Agency even more operational, in particular by launching big collaborative programmes and projects. I will mention a few potential new projects later on.\u00a0 Continuity Let me start with continuity. First, it is important to recall that the Agency\u2019s activities will remain capability-driven. Some commentators might have expected that with me at the steering wheel \u2013 in my former job I was the Deputy National Armaments Director in Germany \u2013 the EDA would now become \u201can Armaments Agency\u201d. Let me be very clear: EDA remains a Defence Agency, capability-driven and it will continue to work on the basis of the integrated approach, connecting capability requirements, Research & Technology, armaments cooperation and the Industry and Market agendas. We have seen positive early results of this approach already, with the example of the Joint Investment Programme on Force Protection (the \u2018JIP\u2019 as we call it). In that programme future capability requirements have been the drivers for joint R&T investment in a crucial capability area \u2013 the protection of our soldiers in dangerous environments, as we can see on TV daily. Late last year the first contracts were signed for spending the first tranche of about \u20ac15 million, out of the total of just over \u20ac55 million. The JIP is a great success and in 2008 we hope to launch a second Joint Investment Programme, also proving that we are progressing with spending better and more together on Defence R&T. Four \u2018Strategies\u2019 In 2008, work on the \u2018strategic issues\u2019 will continue. A few words on each of them: First, the Capability Development Plan. We are nearly half way between launching the elaboration of the CDP in June 2007 and the delivery of the initial version by mid- 2008. Work is progressing well. The Capabilities Steering Board will meet mid- February to take stock and to provide guidance for the remaining activities. What will the CDP look like? Certainly not a telephone book, describing the numbers of tanks, aircraft and ships the Member States should have. That is Cold War defence planning. Rather, the CDP will provide a global picture of capability needs, capability trends and potential capability shortfalls. It will connect what we call short-term needs 3 (Headline Goal 2010) with the longer-term capability needs, based on the Long-Term Vision, endorsed by European Defence Ministers in 2006. But the CDP will provide \u201cactionable conclusions\u201d by summer this year. These will set the agendas for real programmes and early opportunities for collaboration, which the Member States will have to launch and implement. The CDP will also form a sound basis for future work of the Agency in driving R&T, Armaments Cooperation and Industry activities. This brings me to the second strategic item, the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base or the EDTIB Strategy. Ministers approved the Strategy in May last year, giving direction towards realising a stronger, more competent and more competitive EDTIB. There is now consensus on the need for more interdependence in the European DTIB as well as less dependence on non-European key technologies. The question, of course, is how to get there? The Steering Board in National Armaments Directors formation agreed on a set of roadmaps last September to take the work forward in a practical sense. A crucial activity is to define the key industrial capabilities in Europe, which will also contribute to improving long-term Security of Supply, and, therefore, to increasing European autonomy. The third item, directly connected to EDTIB work, is the European Defence Research & Technology or EDRT Strategy. In the Ministerial Steering Board of 19 November last year the Framework for such a Strategy was approved. It defines broadly what should be elaborated in the EDRT Strategy, both in terms of \u2018ends\u2019 (in which R&T to invest) and \u2018means\u2019 (how to invest). A central element is the definition key defence technologies, to be preserved or developed in Europe. The list of these key technologies is expected this spring. The full Strategy will be approved by Ministers in the May Steering Board. Fourthly, we need the last piece of the strategies puzzle, an Armaments Strategy. We need this Strategy to develop a clear process how we move from agreed capability needs to cooperative armament programmes. And we also have to look at other aspects, such as to define how a concept for through-life management can be best integrated into such cooperation. Work has started, building on the results of the Cooperative Lessons Learned study, which was financed by the Agency\u2019s operational 4 budget. In 2008, a series of studies and workshops will be organised to elaborate the Strategy, which hopefully can be approved by the autumn Ministerial Steering Board. Concrete Projects Strategies are needed \u2013 they provide direction and define aims \u2013 but, naturally, they themselves do not deliver capabilities. We need concrete programmes and projects to turn theory into practice. This is where I want to see change. Yes, there are examples of early projects. Let me just mention three of them: Software-Defined Radio or SDR, where the Agency is making a significant contribution by connecting the military and civilian efforts to ensure that in the medium-to-longer term this future communication tool is fully interoperable, not only between the military but also between civilian and military users. For that purpose, EDA provides the link between the six European countries working together on military SDR in the so-called ESSOR project and the Commission, which is investing funds under the European Security and Research Programme for civil SDR use; Unmanned Air Vehicles or UAVs have been in the Agency\u2019s Work Programme since the start in 2005. But 2008 will be a milestone year. Why? Because we hope to realise a breakthrough in a topic that nobody so far has tackled in an allinclusive way, namely the insertion of UAVs into regulated air space. This is an issue with many dimensions: legal and regulatory elements \u2013 not for the Agency to arrange but which the Agency might bring it to the fore; certification procedures \u2013 a standard for certification could be developed by EDA; and, of course, new technologies needed to ensure that UAVs can fly in regulated air space with the same safety guarantees as manned aircraft \u2013 such as \u2018Sense and Avoid\u2019 technologies, an area where the Agency has early results from a study conducted in the recent past. This coming spring another study will deliver the full picture of what is needed for insertion of UAVs into regulated air space. Based on the study results, EDA will define a business case. This business case 5 will be used to spend \u20ac6 million, earmarked in the Agency\u2019s 2008 budget (for the first time ever); and Maritime Surveillance: again a work strand where military and civil needs have to be brought together. The Agency is working both on connecting national networks at the European level but also on defining military requirements for new future assets, such as Maritime Unmanned Air Vehicles. But, as I said at the beginning, we need more projects to underline that the Agency has started to deliver. I have engaged myself directly to bring two of them under the wing of EDA: Firstly: heavy helicopters. An excellent example where we see a need, both arising from current short-term needs (the continuing shortages in real-life operations) and longer-term requirements to replace the existing fleet beyond 2015. In my former national capacity, I was involved in the German-French cooperation for a future transport helicopter programme. But Germany and France alone cannot afford such a huge programme anymore. So, logically, the bilateral programme \u2013 which is an excellent start \u2013 has to be brought to the European level to look for more partners. This will help, both to increase standardisation and interoperability but also to share the burden for a much-needed and expensive capability. I am glad to say that both countries have responded positively to my request to bring the programme to EDA; and Secondly: space, in particular observation. A limited number of European countries have observation satellites for military users. The current generation of military observation satellites will come to its end of life in the 2015-2020 timeframe. So, now is the time to look at the next generation and to make an attempt to harmonise requirements. Six European countries are cooperating in the so-called MUSIS group for that purpose. Again, I have suggested bringing the effort under the umbrella of 6 EDA, with the potential to broaden the club. First reactions of the MUSIS countries are positive and I am looking forward to the next steps. Final Remarks I haven\u2019t addressed many other works strands of the Agency, such as the implementation of the Code of Conduct on Defence Procurement or Logistics, the theme of the annual EDA Conference this year. If you wish I can go into more detail during the discussion period. A final remark on deliverables. I have mentioned two projects, for which I have taken the initiative. But, naturally, I am telling the Member States that they should propose other projects for which they see a need to start collaborations with other European partners. Clearly, when bringing such initiatives to the Agency we need to check if they fit in the capability-driven approach. But we don\u2019t have a shortage of capability shortfalls in Europe. What we lack most is solutions at the European level, instead of continuing along the path of finding purely national answers. That is the Agency\u2019s mission and I will engage myself fully in the next few years to increase European cooperation on capabilities, R&T, armaments and industry.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2008/01/09/EDA_Chief_Executive_Alexander_Weis_Outlines_EDA_Agenda_to_European_Parliament_Security_and_Defence_Subcommittee"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_1058", "date": "2007-12-05", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA welcomes Commission Communication on EU Defence Industry and Market", "text": " The European Defence Agency welcomes the efforts of the European Commission to further support the development of a true European Defence Equipment Market (EDEM).

The EDA is pleased that the Commission is taking into account the specific features of defence and security, since this cannot be treated as a fully commercial market. \u201cEveryone is aware that sensitive issues of national sovereignty are involved in defence procurement and that has driven much of our work in this area,\u201d said EDA Chief Executive Alexander Weis. \u201cThe European market for tanks does not operate in the same way as the market for washing machines.\u201d With regard to procurement, the Commission\u2019s initiative is complementary to the EDA Code of Conduct on Defence Procurement launched in July 2006, which covers contracts placed outside EU internal market directives on the basis of Article 296 of the EC Treaty. This area accounts in practice for the bulk of core European defence procurement. The Agency believes that competition is one key tool in a larger set that includes other important initiatives such as agreements on Security of Supply and Security of Information, issues on which the EDA is currently working.

A meeting of the Steering Board of the European Defence Agency agreed to create an EDA Project Team to investigate how to develop the concept of a European Air Transport Fleet through some form of pooled ownership of A400M transport aircraft, which several governments have ordered or plan to acquire. The meeting of Capabilities Directors of the 26 EDA participating Member States also agreed to pursue a U.K. initiative to share information about helicopters available for missions under European Security and Defence Policy, which could lead to cooperation among countries operating the same type of helicopters and improve their availability. \u201cThese issues are at the heart of the challenges Europe faces if it is to match its ambitions with the capabilities required,\u201d said Lo Casteleijn, who chaired the meeting on behalf of the Head of the Agency, Javier Solana. \u201cThe EDA has a crucial role to play by helping Member States to identify where they can collectively be more effective through collaboration.\u201d The European Air Transport Fleet Project Team will gather information from countries interested in the initiative and develop a Common Staff Target, the first step towards pooling resources. The team will look into the commercial and legal issues as well as how such a pool could be managed and its missions prioritised. \u201cFor governments with smaller budgets, this could offer a way for them to meet their strategic requirements within their resources, while for those with larger budgets, it could offer a way to maximise the efficiency of their investments,\u201d said EDA Chief Executive Alexander Weis. EU operations, such as in Chad and the Central African Republic, and NATO missions such as Afghanistan, have suffered from a lack of helicopter availability. This is primarily due to the assets of European countries having limited deployability and sustainability on expeditionary missions. The EU and NATO have a common interest in addressing the problem so governments will provide to the EDA data on helicopters already submitted for a NATO study. The Agency then will investigate the potential for cooperation of Member States who operate the same types of helicopters, to create upgrade and/or support programmes to enhance deployability. It will also investigate the opportunities for Member States to share training and maintenance facilities for existing and new helicopters. An EDA conference (\u201cCommercialising Logistics\u201d) scheduled for 27 February on the role of the private sector in providing logistical support to EU operations will provide a further forum to examine the problem. In addition to any short or medium-term remedial action by NATO and the EU to improve the situation, the Agency is looking into longer-term solutions, including a possible broadening of the emerging Franco-German Future Transport Helicopter project to include other countries. On other issues, the Steering Board heard a progress report on work on the Capabilities Development Plan (CDP), a comprehensive study of the capabilities required in the future and practical measures to improve cooperation to help deliver them. The CDP is due to be published in the middle of this year. The Capabilities Directors welcomed the results being achieved by the Tactical Imagery Exploitation Station project, conducted by the EDA in cooperation with the EU Satcen in Torrejon, Spain, with the aim of developing a technological demonstrator for the analysis of images from multiple sources, another important capability gap. \u201cThere are no quick answers to the problems of capability shortfalls,\u201d Weis said. \u201cBut today\u2019s meeting demonstrates again that there is widespread agreement that while each government will decide how and how much to spend on defence, many of these problems may be better addressed by working together.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2008/02/14/EU_Governments_Seek_to_Improve_Air_Transport_Capacity_for_Military_Operations"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_1060", "date": "2007-12-14", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA Signs First Contracts Under R&T Joint Investment Programme on Force Protection", "text": " The European Defence Agency today signed the first three contracts under its R&T Joint Investment Programme on Force Protection (JIP-FP).

A meeting of the Steering Board of the European Defence Agency, held at the level of National Armaments Directors, reviewed a series of roadmaps for delivering the ground-breaking strategy agreed by defence ministers last May. \u201cMinisters have recognised that individual Member States can no longer sustain their separate DTIBs on a purely national basis, and that we need to specialise and become more dependent on each other at a European level,\u201d said Eero Lavonen, who chaired the meeting on behalf of Javier Solana, Head of the Agency. \u201cThe roadmaps agreed today provide the key milestones to implement successfully the policies and approaches set out in the strategy,\u201d he added. In keeping with the EDA\u2019s mandate to try to integrate different aspects of the defence agenda, the roadmaps cover a broad range of activities, including identification of key industrial capabilities, security of supply between countries, increased competition in the defence equipment market, deepening and diversifying the supplier base, and improved armaments cooperation. The Steering Board agreed that rapid progress was needed before the new EDA Chief Executive presents the first annual report on the progress of the strategy to ministers next spring. A key element of the implementation is pressing ahead with the successful market initiatives already undertaken, such as the Code of Conduct for Defence Procurement. In that context, the Steering Board agreed that, despite the substantial volume of business (an estimated \u20ac10 billion) now advertised on the Agency\u2019s Electronic Bulletin Board (www.eda.europa.eu/ebbweb), more needed to be done to increase cross-border bids and contract awards. \u201cCreating a European market is a joint endeavour by industry and governments and it is understandable that the supply side should take some time to adapt to a world in which, for the first time, defence procurement is being done on a pan-European basis,\u201d Lavonen said. The Steering Board also approved a Code of Conduct for coordinating investment in the Defence Test and Evaluation Base (DTEB), designed to avoid duplication and encourage the sharing of these expensive facilities. The code, modelled on the framework for the defence equipment market, aims at promoting transparency and encouraging coordination of new investments in the field of defence Test & Evaluation facilities. The basic principle of the code, which will be operational on 1 January 2008, is mutual disclosure among the subscribing Member States of any planned DTEB investment worth more than \u20ac1 million - to enable a coordinated investment, or reciprocal use of such facilities. On other matters, the National Armaments Directors: reviewed the plans for taking forward the initiative for inserting Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) into regulated air space and noted with pleasure the emergence of promising collaborative technology demonstrator projects; (including work on Sense Avoid technologies by Sweden and France, and Germany); took stock of the work being done by the Agency for certification and standardisation in Software Defined Radio, agreeing the need for such capabilities in Europe; approved the setting-up of an ad hoc EDA Materiel Standardization Group and Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Defence Materiel Standards. The Directors also noted with satisfaction the Agency\u2019s cooperation with the Commission on many of its agendas. Finally, the Steering Board expressed its thanks and deep appreciation for the outstanding contribution made by the outgoing EDA Chief Executive, Nick Witney, who was attending his last meeting of the Agency\u2019s governing body before handing over to Alexander Weis on 1 October. \u201cIt is impossible to overstate Nick\u2019s part in the success of this enterprise, as head of the Agency Establishment Team which mapped out the new institution and as its first leader,\u201d Lavonen said. \u201cHe has consistently set out the facts about European defence, reminded us of what we have said we want to achieve, presented specific and practical proposals, and cajoled and encouraged us to reach agreements. He can be very proud of what the Agency has accomplished.\u201d \u201cIt has been a privilege to lead the Agency during its first years and to work with such a dedicated and talented team inside the EDA, and such a diverse set of stakeholders within Brussels, and across Europe. In the participating Member States, in other institutions and in the defence industry, the EDA is lucky to have so many supportive friends.\u201d Witney said. \u201cI know that, with their help, Alexander Weis will be able to take the work of the Agency forward with confidence and great success,\u201d he added.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2007/09/24/EDA_Steering_Board_Agrees_Path_to_Implementing_Defence_Industrial_Strategy"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_1064", "date": "2007-11-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EU Ministers Adopt Framework for Joint European Strategy in Defence R&T", "text": " European Union governments today adopted the framework for a joint Strategy on Defence Research & Technology describing why and how they intend to invest collectively on technologies that are crucial for future military capabilities and industrial capacities in Europe.

In a further effort to improve overall EU performance on defence, ministers approved four benchmarks to increase investment for future needs and to encourage collaborative spending: Equipment procurement (incl. R&D/R&T): 20% of defence spending (currently 19.4%) European collaborative equipment procurement: 35% of equipment procurement expenditure (currently 21%) Defence R&T: 2% of defence spending (currently 1.2%) European collaborative defence R&T: 20% of defence R&T expenditure (currently 10%) \u201cThese are collective benchmarks \u2013 applying to the combined spending of all of the Agency\u2019s 26 participating Member States \u2013 and they are voluntary,\u201d Solana said. \u201cBut annual monitoring by the Agency will support the Member States\u2019 efforts to transform Europe\u2019s armed forces together.\u201d On other matters, the Steering Board approved the Agency\u2019s work programme and budget for 2008. The budget of \u20ac32 million, compared with \u20ac22 in 2007, includes \u20ac6 million earmarked for work on Unmanned Air Vehicles which can be spent only after a further decision by the Steering Board. The work programme adds a long-term strategy to boost the number of cooperative programmes on Armaments to the existing strategies for Capabilities Development, the EDTIB and R&T. Major initiatives include looking for new Joint Investment Programmes in defence R&T, using the model pioneered this year for Force Protection, and further work on a more open and competitive European Defence Equipment Market. \u201cToday\u2019s decisions have put in place further building blocks for our common work of making Europe\u2019s armed forces and military budgets fit for the challenges of the 21st century which we must face together,\u201d said Alexander Weis, attending his first ministerial Steering Board since taking over as EDA Chief Executive. \u201cApproval of the R&T strategy, benchmarks, work programme and budget show the confidence of Member States in our agenda and we look forward to working with them to deliver on it,\u201d he added.

The meeting of senior defence planners from the 26 EU governments participating in the European Defence Agency asked for an initial element of the CDP to be delivered early next year and a full draft of the plan to be ready for the Steering Board to review next July. \u201cWe have now clearly set out what we want and when we want it by,\u201d said Lo Casteleijn, who chaired the meeting on behalf of Javier Solana, the Head of the Agency. \u201cThe CDP must deliver \u2018actionable conclusions\u2019: agreed capability development priorities, initial action plans and identified cooperative opportunities, which participating Member States may choose to pursue individually or in combinations inside or outside the EDA environment,\u201d he added. The work on the CDP builds on the EDA\u2019s Long-Term Vision report of last year, which set out possible contexts for EU crisis-management operations under the European Security and Defence Policy in 2020 and beyond - and described the sort of military and other capabilities which would be required to carry them out effectively. The CDP will make that analysis more specific and thus more useable, identify priorities and areas for collaboration and give guidance to industry. The four work strands of the CDP, led by the EDA and the EU Military Committee, involve identifying shortfalls from existing goals, doing capability studies on key issues to develop the LTV guidance, building a database of current national defence plans and programmes, and drawing lessons from current experience for future capability needs. The Steering Board said the CDP would not be a supranational military equipment or capability plan replacing national defence plans and programmes, but would support national decision-making. It should ensure that emerging technology opportunities influence capability development and provide a focus for R&T activity and investment, thus helping to strengthen the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base by making clear to industry what will be needed in the future. On other issues, the Steering Board welcomed the launch of a new 5 nation\u00a0- Spain, Italy, Germany, France, and Sweden - collaboration effort on personal equipment for infantrymen, aiming at increasing interoperability and commonality of this increasingly high-tech equipment in the next decade.\u00a0Three further nations - Poland, Finland and Austria - expressed their interest in joining the programme. The Steering Board also agreed to commission a report \u2013 to be written by an expert known as a \u201cWise Pen\u201d \u2013 on a European approach to Network Enabled Capabilities. Defence Ministers have already agreed that \u201cNetwork-enabled capability must be fundamental development priority for ESDP operations\u201d. The concept paper will outline the aims, the required capabilities and how these capabilities could be delivered, address the civil and the military dimension ESDP operations, and propose high level guidance. It will focus in particular on how to create greater capacities in bringing all necessary civilian resources to bear in crises and on enabling the best possible situational awareness and deployment of assets and capabilities in-theatre. The meeting also considered a series of reports on strategic lift, focusing on how to address the known shortfalls in the capacity to rapidly transport military equipment and forces to EU operations. The EDA reported that the situation would have to be addressed by using a combination of military transport, assured civilian contracted capability and a more efficient approach to the spot market. It also recommended setting up a project team with government representatives to look into possible combinations of air and sea transport, including new \u201cfast ship\u201d capabilities.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2007/06/27/EU_Governments_Set_Timetable_for_Initial_Plan_to_Strengthen_Defence_Capabilities"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_1067", "date": "2007-06-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Spain to Join Code of Conduct for European Defence Equipment Market", "text": " The European Defence Agency today welcomed the announcement that Spain will join the inter-governmental regime for defence procurement on 1 July, taking the number of subscribers to 24 out of the EDA\u2019s 26 Member States.

First, because it gives me a chance to acknowledge, and in a small way reciprocate, the strong support that The Netherlands has given to the EDA enterprise during its short life. You have understood and assisted our various agendas, and in many ways offered an example to others \u2013 in, for example, the strong capability focus you bring to your defence planning, and indeed in your readiness to step forward when words must be followed by deeds, and operational deployments have to be undertaken. The Netherlands is amongst the leading European nations in terms of the proportion of your military manpower that is actually out there in the field, bearing the risks and burdens of crisis management operations. The second reason I am glad to be here is to express particular appreciation for the seriousness with which you treat defence research and technology. This is obvious not only in the amount of money you devote to it \u2013 5th in the European league table, I believe \u2013 but also in the excellence of your research institutions, with TNO pre-eminent. I am not a scientist. But I have in recent years, and indeed in a previous life, spent a lot of time talking to people who understand research and technology better than I \u2013 so I feel I can offer you today some thoughts with a certain amount of confidence. For example, I do not think you need an advanced degree in quantum mechanics to conclude that, today, Europe as a whole is massively under-invested in defence R&T. Our main competitors are the Americans (though tomorrow they will be the Chinese and Indians as well) \u2013 and I do not think we should hesitate to describe the United States, our indispensable ally, as our competitors in defence industrial matters. And they are currently outspending us at the rate of 6:1 in both research and technology, and research and development. It was a shock to do the sums, and realise that the combined total of everything European ministries of defence spend on research and technology \u2013 something under \u20ac2.5bn a year \u2013 is less than the annual DARPA budget. If we mean what we say about sustaining a healthy and globally competitive defence technological and industrial base in Europe (DTIB in the jargon), then we simply have to do better than that. Fortunately, it is no longer just me saying this, but 26 European Defence Ministers. Last month, when they met as the EDA Steering Board in Brussels on 14 May, they agreed an important document \u2013 a Strategy for a European DTIB. You can read it on our website \u2013 . It offers a fairly comprehensive analysis of the challenges we face, and what we must do if we are to stay in business in Europe. It says in terms that, whatever excellences we may retain today, we are living on past investment. The message is clear \u2013 we must spend more on defence R&T in Europe, and we must spend more together. That second point is worth a moment\u2019s pause. The potential benefits of working together are obvious, in terms of getting more for our money. But the Strategy document to which I referred also makes the point that working together on R&T can make a critical contribution to a wider theme of the Strategy \u2013 the need to converge our military requirements, and make decisive progress towards the long-recognised goal of fielding more common equipments and systems amongst European armed forces. Partly this is necessary to achieve the economies of scale that we all know our industries need, but it is also because interoperability is key to safety and success in multinational operations, and there is no form of interoperability in the domain of equipment better than actually using the same kit. Now the lesson has been painfully learned in Europe over many years that the best collaborations start \u201cup-stream\u201d \u2013 at the point where thought is being given to what a desired new capability will be for, and how it will be used. So, if I may quote the Strategy \u201cthis emphasis on the early conceptual stage underlines the importance of a step-change in defence R&T collaboration in Europe as a key to \u2018up-stream\u2019 convergence of requirements thinking, and the point where the possible applications of new technologies are explored\u201d. More broadly, the message of the Strategy is stark \u2013 that we can no longer afford to do the business of defence in 20-something separate national boxes, but must, like it or not, encourage the evolution of a truly European DTIB, as something more than the sum of national parts. This implies a European DTIB which is less duplicative, more specialised, and more interdependent \u2013 and one in which centres of excellence evolve which others rely upon rather than try to replicate. Greater competition in defence procurement, and the progressive move towards a genuine defence equipment market, will add a powerful dynamic to that process. I do not think there is anything in this which this audience will be afraid of \u2013 indeed, your representatives have been amongst the new Strategy\u2019s foremost supporters. Strategies are fine \u2013 but implementation is better. So it was a pleasure to see, at the same Ministerial meeting, 19 Defence Ministers signing the Programme Arrangement for an innovative new Joint Investment Programme (JIP) for research into technologies relevant to the protection of deployed forces. The Netherlands is a substantial shareholder in this enterprise. The virtue of this scheme is not just that it has resulted in a sizeable joint fund \u2013 some \u20ac55m \u2013 being got together, and got together much more rapidly than the traditional pace with which defence R&T collaborations have come together in Europe. It is also that it has brought into the business a wide range of European Member States who have not previously had a vehicle through which they could invest relatively modest sums to good purpose. Second, it promises a significant broadening of the supply base. The first call for proposals under the JIP has been issued to almost 300 entities across Europe: about a third of them familiar defence companies; another third SMEs and non-traditional suppliers; and the last third universities, research institutions and laboratories. I am glad to see that a dozen Dutch concerns, mainly SMEs, are on this list. The ground rules of the fund specify that no-one can bid unless they are in a consortium, meaning a minimum of two entities from two different Member States. So we have set up a ferment of networking and mutual discovery, which we have every confidence will flush out new sources of innovation across our continent. Europe is not so rich in human capital, especially scientific human capital, that it can afford to waste any contribution of this kind. Also good about this scheme is that it introduces some genuine competition into the process. Not as much as I would like \u2013 across the entire programme we have to achieve some sort of global balance, which means that towards the end of the series of calls for proposals we may have to be more directive about the national origin of potential suppliers. But at least it is a start. And when I say start that is what I mean. The old arrangements, dating from the early 1990s, also spoke of competition as being the normal means of procurement in R&T collaborations \u2013 but it seems that these words were first agreed and then quietly ignored. I think I can state categorically that there has never been an R&T collaboration in Europe so far where the work has not been divided on an exact \u201cfair shares\u201d basis between the chosen national contractors of each of the participating governments. Money, in short, has never crossed a national frontier. Whilst this is understandable, it is also a great way to fossilise the supply base. So there is the basic recipe \u2013 to spend more, and spend more together and, one must add, to spend better. Partly, this means ensuring a strong focus on capability need \u2013 there is, after all, ultimately no future for defence industries or research institutions in Europe which do not produce what the armed forces of tomorrow will actually want to buy. I know that in the world of Dutch defence this is well-understood consideration. And, again, I am grateful for Dutch support on the work our Capabilities Steering Board is over-seeing \u2013 under the Chairmanship of course of Lo Casteleijn, your MOD Policy Director \u2013 to work up a Capabilities Development Plan for ESDP. But \u201cbetter\u201d, I suggest, also implies quicker. Too often, we continue to manage the business of defence R&T as though we were still living in the Cold War. But the adversary, as we see everyday in Iraq and Afghanistan, exhibits no such ponderousness in adapting and adopting technologies and using them against us. We must become similarly agile, and match the pace of the ever-shortening cycle time of technological advance in the civil world. You do not need me to tell you that the line between defence and civilian technologies is growing every day more blurred and that nowadays much more is spun into defence than is spun out. This is why a particular focus for our Agency\u2019s work in Brussels is to look for synergies between the defence R&T that our Member States fund and the substantial sum now being spent by the European Union under the banner of security research. We have already established a good marriage between military and civilian investment in Software Defined Radio technologies \u2013 and we hope soon to achieve the same in responding to the challenge \u2013 again, recognised by our Ministers in our Steering Board last month \u2013 to get UAVs inserted into regulated aerospace. I have spoken for long enough. But I hope I have given you at least a flavour of the consensus that is developing amongst our participating Member States on how to tackle the required step\u2011change in our collective R&T efforts. As the Strategy document notes, only this way can we hope to preserve and indeed develop our defence technological and industrial base, as a major source of jobs, exports and technological advance \u2013 something which in turn helps to maintain public support for defence. Even more important, however, is the key goal - to ensure that the men and women whom we deploy on operations have the best which world-leading technology can provide for them, and come home successful and safe. So I finish by congratulating you on the leading role the Netherland already plays in this vital area, and look forward to today\u2019s discussion of how you and we can do even better.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2007/06/05/EDA_s_Witney_says_defence_R_T_must_match_pace_of_civil_technological_change"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_1070", "date": "2007-06-12", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA's Witney says European defence collaboration is economic necessity, not just political goal", "text": " On the Way to Reality EDA - EDTIB Conference Berlin Panel 1: Interests and Objectives of the European Defence Policy I will begin, if I may, with an anecdote. In a previous life, I was a diplomat; and in the late 1970s served as Chef de Cabinet to the British ambassador in Washington, with all the most fascinating cable traffic of the British Foreign Office flowing across my desk. It was the time of the 4-power summit which Jimmy Carter hosted in Guadeloupe; and one particular piece of the diplomatic record impressed itself on my memory. The main business of the summit was theatre nuclear weapons. But the three European leaders \u2013 Chancellor Schmidt, President Giscard, and Prime Minister Callaghan \u2013 took time out for some European discussions. I forget now who it was who raised the state of the European defence industry \u2013 but all readily agreed that the duplication of different national armaments programmes was wasteful and absurd. There should be a division of labour: one nation leading on land systems, another on ships, the third on combat aircraft. And then, with almost equal readiness, the agreed conclusion \u2013 \u201cnice idea, but all too difficult\u201d. And we live with the consequences today. Rival combat aircraft committing fratricide in export markets. A pot-pourri of armoured vehicles deployed on multinational operations, unable to exchange air-filters and all requiring their separate logistic chains back to Europe. And industry struggling for orders and production runs of a viable scale. This is bad economics. But, as the title of this first panel implies, there are now other interests at stake as well. Because we have today, what did not exist in 1979, a European Security and Defence Policy. A policy which, over the last four years, has increasingly manifested itself in action \u2013 with crisis management operations completed or in train from the Balkans, to the Congo, to Indonesia, to the Middle East. The EU has agreed a European Security Strategy which commits the Union to be an increasingly active, coherent and capable contributor to global security. Our armed forces, it turns out, are not just for deterrence \u2013 they are also for use. And, across Europe, we find they are not configured or equipped as well as they need to be for the real-world operations they are now called upon to undertake. This, of course, is a key reason why the European Defence Agency was created \u2013 to work with the Member States on capability development or, as I sometimes paraphrase it, on making sure we spend our defence budgets on the right things and not the wrong things. Following up last year\u2019s Long-Term Vision analysis, we are now working with our Member States on a Capability Development Plan. But, today, I must focus on the other half of the EDA mission \u2013 the effort to ensure that our armed forces are supported, and indeed that the strategic aims of European defence policy are underpinned, by a strong and globally competitive defence technological and industrial base. And the root of the problem of course is fragmentation. Over 50 years, the rest of European industry has been transformed by the internal market. But defence is \u201cspecial\u201d \u2013 in the Brussels jargon, it has certain \u201cspecificities\u201d, which demand special treatment. And, of course, at one level, this is true: tanks are not washing machines, and governments do stand in a very special relationship to the defence industry, as customers, regulators, investors and sometimes owners. At another level, the \u201cspecialness\u201d of defence has been used to justify often indiscriminate use of the famous Article 296 \u2013 or, to say things as they are, for fundamentally protectionist purposes. Ultimately, of course, such a policy is self-defeating. Like any other industry, the defence industry will only thrive if it produces what its customers want to buy. And if defence procurement is operated with the focus on national industrial policies rather than on anticipating and meeting the user\u2019s future needs, then the user will not want the product and the industry will eventually lose its market. The solution is as simple to state as it is too difficult to achieve. We can no longer afford the fragmentation \u2013 so we must encourage the development of a proper defence equipment market in Europe, as a key means of encouraging the consolidation of both the demand and the supply sides, and thus creating a truly integrated European defence technological and industrial base. The money is no longer there to operate on any smaller scale. This audience will I know be familiar with some of the steps the EDA has so far been able to take towards this objective \u2013 notably the agreement of now 23 of our Member States on a Code of Conduct on defence procurement, to open national markets to suppliers from each others\u2019 countries on a voluntary and reciprocal basis. The Electronic Bulletin Board on the EDA\u2019s website, through which this agreement is operationalised, now carries nearly 200 contracting opportunities for suppliers across Europe, with a total value now pushing \u20ac10bn. Industry support for this initiative has been manifested in the recently-opened second section of this Bulletin Board, carrying industry-to-industry offers \u2013 thus driving the benefits of cross-European competition down the supply chain. At this point, I would like to pay tribute to the support we have enjoyed in these efforts from the Commission. We share, I believe, the same analysis, and are travelling the same road together. Of course, as different institutions, our responsibilities are different \u2013 they look for community solutions, we for essentially inter-governmental arrangements. But we have already I believe demonstrated that these approaches can be entirely mutually reinforcing. And, in a city where cooperation between institutions is not necessarily the norm, it has been a real pleasure for me in the last few years to find how easily and constructively we have been able to work in partnership with the Commission. But, as I just remarked, the nature of the EDA enterprise is fundamentally intergovernmental \u2013 so the development to which I attach the most importance, the EDA achievement in this area which I regard with the greatest satisfaction, was the agreement last month by 26 European Defence Ministers in our Steering Board to a joint Strategy for the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base. It is an unusually trenchant document. Europe today has widely capable, and in many sectors world-leading, defence industries and technologies. \u201cBut\u201d \u2013 and here I am quoting the Ministers\u2019 words - \u201cwe recognise that is largely the result of past investment.... The point has now been reached where we need fundamental change in how we manage the \u2018business aspects\u2019 of defence in Europe \u2013 and time is not on our side.... The essence of the change is to recognise . . . that we must therefore press on with developing a truly European DTIB, as something more than a sum of its national parts\u201d. The Ministers state that to continue with a predominantly national approach to the business of defence in Europe \u201cis no longer economically sustainable \u2013 and in a world of multi-national operations it is operationally unacceptable, too\u201d. The strategy then lays out the characteristics of this \u201ctruly European\u201d DTIB. It must be more integrated, more specialised, less duplicative, and more interdependent. It must draw on skills, technology and innovation from beyond the traditional defence sector \u2013 and from all across the enlarged Union. It must be driven by consolidation on the demand side \u2013 more pooling of efforts and resources amongst European ministries of defence \u2013 and encourage greater consolidation on the supply side too. More competition must be introduced into the European defence equipment market \u2013 and where that is not appropriate cooperative approaches must be more effectively conducted. All this is accompanied by a full and frank account of the challenges, of policy and practice, to be overcome in achieving this vision \u2013 and a clear expression of determination to meet and overcome them. Well \u2013 will it work? Or should it just be filed under \u201cempty rhetoric?\u201d Here, in short summary, are my three main reasons for optimism: First, the Ministers have directed us to work with national armaments directors (and indeed the industry) on a specific action-plan \u2013 and will themselves review progress in one year\u2019s time, on the basis of an Agency report. Second, important actions have preceded the Strategy. I have referred already to the first practical manifestation of the proper defence equipment market we seek, i.e. the Code of Conduct and its Bulletin Boards of concrete cross-border competitive opportunities. Member States have, for the first time, pledged mutual help on materiel supply in operational emergencies. 19 of our Member States have put together over \u20ac50m for the first cross-Europe exercise in jointly commissioning research and technology work. In different combinations, other groups of Member States have embraced new projects in areas as various as software-defined radio, unmanned air vehicles, and soldiers\u2019 personal equipment. Practical pooling of efforts and resources on a European scale is really starting to happen. Third, the Strategy is a statement not just of political will, but also of economic necessity.

Since the new regime was introduced last July, we have seen more than 6.5 billion Euros of contract opportunities advertised on the EBB across the full range of defence equipment \u2013 the first time such contracts have been systematically opened up to cross-border bidding. But only the major defence equipment suppliers can serve as prime contractors for big orders. The Code of Best Practice in the Supply Chain, which drives the principles of competition enshrined in the Code of Conduct, is a vital element of the regime on defence procurement.\u00a0 It encourages prime contractors to advertise sub-contracting opportunities openly and to consider bids from companies in all 22 subscribing Member States equally and according to objective criteria. Small- and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, will now be able to look at business opportunities with major contractors in one place \u2013 on the EDA\u2019s Electronic Bulletin Board. This will be a real benefit for them, addressing one of the main issues faced by smaller companies, and it will bring benefits for the prime contractors too by broadening their supplier base. We are very grateful to the AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe for its cooperation in launching this initiative and for the support of industry, without which it cannot succeed. I was very pleased to welcome the ASD President, Mr Charles Edelstenne, to talk to the Steering Board about the project and to attend the launch and this press conference. I would also like to thank Nick Witney and his staff at the Agency for bringing this project to fruition. Because of the long lead times in defence contracting, we have not yet seen a big increase in cross-border contracts as a result of the EBB and the Code of Conduct. But the initial progress report for the first eight months is very encouraging. The launch of phase two, and the refinements to the regime agreed by Member States, make us even more confident that we will achieve our goal of strengthening the European defence industry by creating a transparent, open and competitive defence equipment market with increased opportunities for all.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2007/03/28/Introductory_comments_by_EDA_Steering_Board_chairman_Eero_Lavonen"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_1073", "date": "2007-05-03", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "European Defence Industry Must Break Out of \"National Boxes\", EDA Chief Executive Nick Witney says", "text": " 9th International Exhibition of Defence & Security Technologies, IDET 2007 The European Defence Market Intervention by Nick Witney, Chief Executive, EDA It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to be back in the Czech Republic, and to visit this important international exhibition of Defence and Security Technologies. I shall spare you my standard lecture on the European Defence Agency \u2013 our formal roles and responsibilities. I would just invite you to think of us as the \u201cback office\u201d of the European Security and Defence Policy \u2013 the guys tasked to work with the Member States so that Europe has stronger defence capabilities to call on, and a stronger European defence technological and industrial base. To achieve this, our consistent message is that Europeans must pool their efforts and resources. We cannot continue to conduct the business of defence in separate national boxes.\u00a0The money is just no longer there, even in the biggest national defence budgets. Picking up that phrase of the business of defence, as in all businesses there is a demand side and a supply side.\u00a0On the demand side, pooling of efforts and resources means more joint procurements, and more cooperative programmes.\u00a0This will provide not just economies of scale, but also interoperability benefits in a world in which all our military operations are now multinational.\u00a0 But this sorts of harmonisation of military requirements depends on our military planners sharing the same conception of what future operations will be like, and what capabilities will be required \u2013 in short, wanting the same things. To assist this process we have already reached agreement with all the Agency\u2019s Member States on an important conceptual document \u2013 the Long Term Vision for European Defence Capability and Capacity needs. We are now taking that forward, again working with all the Member States, on a more detailed Capability Development Plan. This work on the demand side is vital, because of the obvious truth that there is ultimately no future for a defence industry in Europe which does not produce the equipments and systems that our future armed forces will want to buy.\u00a0 But governments are heavily involved on the supply side too \u2013 as main customer, as regulator, as investor, sometimes as owner.\u00a0And here too we need to follow through the imperative of pooling and sharing, and recall that the days of effective production inside a national box are over. European industry will not remain globally competitive if we continue to operate as 20-something separate national technological and industrial bases. We need \u2013 and the Member States have accepted \u2013 to integrate our efforts into a truly European DTIB \u2013 a DTIB which is less duplicative, more specialised, and more interdependent. This is what in another context is being called an inconvenient truth \u2013 but it is true nonetheless.\u00a0 The concerns of Member States are understandable. But I am here today to tell you that the EDA has been very strong on this point \u2013 we have clearly said, and constantly repeat, that the vision of an integrated European DTIB and a true European Defence Equipment Market will not be realised if it turns out simply to be a bonanza for the big Western European prime contractors.\u00a0 Everyone must have the opportunity to find their own place in such a European DTIB.\u00a0 Excellent second- and third-tier companies must have full and fair opportunities in the new European-sized market.\u00a0 Non traditional suppliers, and especially SMEs, must be actively promoted. Old Europe, if I can use that phrase, must not ignore the tremendous human capital to be found in \u201cNew Europe\u201d \u2013 in the recently-enlarged European Union.\u00a0We would like to see more sub-contracts and more investment, coming from the big Western European prime contractors into Member States such as the Czech Republic. This concern with opportunity for all is more than just words \u2013 we have taken several important steps.\u00a0 As you may be aware, 22 of our Member States began last year to advertise their defence contracting opportunities to suppliers across the European Union on a special section of the EDA website \u2013 the so-called Electronic Bulletin Board.\u00a0 If you have not done so - please check it out at\u00a0. You will find advertised there some 160 contracting opportunities, with a value conservatively estimated at \u20ac 7 billion, provided by Ministries of Defence across Europe and open to all European suppliers in the 22 Member States. Perhaps even more relevant to smaller industries, you will also find a newly opened second section, in which industry-to-industry offers are advertised.\u00a0There are about 80 of those posted at the moment, from 14 different major European defence companies.\u00a0 This represents a wonderful opportunity to win sub-contracts, and to establish profitable new relationships up the supply chain. A second practical point - come back and visit the website in the third week of May.\u00a0 All being well, we shall by then have launched the first call for proposals under our new Research and Technology Joint Investment Programme. 19 Member States have between them contributed \u20ac55 million to jointly fund research in technology relevant for protecting deployed forces.\u00a0Again, we have taken specific steps to ensure that this is not a bonanza just for the big, traditional suppliers.\u00a0Indeed, we have insisted that bids against these proposals should always be made by a consortium consisting of at least two different entities from two different Member States.\u00a0This should provide a great opportunity for excellent but not well-recognised small companies, or research institutes, to team up with larger defence companies elsewhere in Europe in order to respond to this request for proposals. So please do visit our website, and check out the opportunities in the two sections of the Electronic Bulletin Board and, as from second half of May, from the Research and Technology Joint Investment Fund. The successful integration of all Member States into a flourishing European DTIB is an imperative.\u00a0This is a mission which we, at the EDA, deeply believe in. We know that we have only started \u2013 so if you see ways for us to do better, to help further with the difficult transitions ahead, please do not hesitate to contact us and give us the benefit of your advice.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2007/05/02/European_Defence_Industry_Must_Break_Out_of_National_Boxes_EDA_Chief_Executive_Nick_Witney_says"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_1074", "date": "2007-06-05", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA's Witney says no viable alternative to more common spending on defence", "text": " Defence Partnerships Conference London, 5 June 2007 Examining the EDA\u2019s Long-Term Vision report: What are the implications for European Defence Planners? Keynote Address by Nick Witney, Chief Executive, EDA I would like, if you allow me, to begin with a few general remarks about the EDA. It is, after all, a rather unusual organisation, still relatively new, and not always well understood. It is basically a child of the European and Security and Defence Policy, or ESDP in the jargon. You will recall the basics: ESDP was conceived at the Anglo-French Summit at St Malo in 1998; has nothing to do with the territorial defence of Europe \u2013 that was and remains NATO\u2019s business; is rather directed towards encouraging Europe to be a more effective contributor to global security, by undertaking crisis management operations; and has shown its utility in such ways as taking over from NATO responsibility for keeping the peace in Bosnia, and last year\u2019s deployment to the Congo to back up the UN peacekeepers over the critical period of the first Congolese general election for 40 years. Indeed, ESDP now has some 17 operations to its credit, though the majority have been civilian in character \u2013 police training, supporting the administration of justice, or overseeing disarmament processes. Indeed, it is a particular value-added of ESDP that it can deploy judges, policemen and administrators as well as soldiers. The next two operations on the horizon are a police training effort in Afghanistan, and a substantial operation to take over from the UN their responsibilities for civil administration in Kosovo. So, without setting the Thames or even the Seine on fire, the policy has proved its utility \u2013 and, after a bumpy few years at the start of the decade, now seems to have bedded down comfortably alongside NATO. Though institutional frictions remain, earlier worries about this European effort undermining NATO seem generally to have receded. I tend to think of the EDA as the \u201cback office\u201d of the ESDP. The front office is staffed by the diplomats and the policy-makers who set up the institutions, negotiated the arrangements with NATO, agreed the 2003 European Security Strategy \u2013 a rather good and sensible document, by the way. It is also staffed by the generals and administrators who run the operations. The purpose of the back office is to support the front office \u2013 by working with the Member States to try to ensure that the tools are available to do the job, and that the necessary infrastructure (a robust industrial and technological base) is in place. Working with the Member States is the key concept. It is not only Brits who are allergic to the notion of being bossed around by some Brussels institution in matters of defence. 26 out of 27 Europe\u2019s Member States belong to the EDA (the Danes have an opt-out) - and they are, without exception, determined to retain their sovereign control over how they spend their national defence budgets, and over if and when their men and women are deployed into harm\u2019s way. To make the point, they fund the Agency directly by annual subscription from the 26 national Defence Ministries, not out the general EU budget. They are my shareholders, and I do what they tell me. They tell me to do quite a lot. The Agency is tasked to work across a broad waterfront: military capabilities development; armaments; research and technology; and industrial and market issues. They look to the Agency to provide analyses and proposals; to act as an incubator of ideas and as a think-tank; to perform the role of conscience and of catalyst. For that, we have a hundred staff and an overall annual budget of \u20ac22 million. So how, you may ask, can such a small Agency, with little money and no decision-taking authority, hope to affect such a wide agenda? The answer lies in our governance arrangements. The shareholders meet very regularly in the Agency Steering Board \u2013 and when the 26 Defence Ministers occupy the seats, as they did 4 times last year, then my boss, Javier Solana, is in the chair. But between-whiles the Board meets in the composition of national Armaments Directors, national military Capability Directors, and so on. Beneath that we have an ever-growing network of working groups, extranet forums, and so forth. In short, we are engaged in a constant and persistent dialogue with the key decision-makers in 26 national ministries of defence. So we have the access: and if our ideas and proposals are good enough, and the national ministries of defence are ready for them, then we can make progress. Worth noting, by the way, that a basic operating principle is variable geometry: if everyone wants to do something, that is fine; if only 6 want to do something, or 15 want to do something else, then that is fine too. We will help and support as best we can. So what does this mean in practice? Perhaps I can start by translating our formal mission statement into something more down-to-earth. The basic problems that drove the Agency\u2019s creation are recognition that Europe\u2019s armed forces are generally ill\u2011adapted to the new post-Cold War, post-9/11, international security environment; and that the hard facts of economics and indeed operational necessity - recalling that our operations are now multinational - require us to collaborate more closely. So you might say our real mission is to work with the Member States to help them to spend their defence budgets on the right things and not the wrong things; and to do better at pooling our efforts and resources. At this stage, just over two years into the enterprise, I discover that we are really proceeding by trying to build a bridge from both ends. Over on the far bank, we try to help the Member States achieve consensus on the longer term view: what sort of military capability should we all be trying to prioritise a decade, or two decades, hence? What sort of strategy is going to help us maintain globally competitive defence industries in Europe? How can we raise our game \u2013 a particularly urgent concern \u2013 on defence research and technology? And, on the near bank, we aim to put in place specific practical cooperations \u2013 to deliver near-term results which move us out in the direction of the longer term goals. The major pier we have so far established over on the far bank of our bridge is the Long Term Vision of my title. You can find , agreed by 24 Defence Ministers in Finland last October, on our website. Its starting point is that the lead-times in defence are such that the capabilities and capacities we will or will not have in 20 years time are in practice being determined by decisions being made now, on a daily basis. So if we hope to have what we need for the EDSP operations of the future, then we need, despite all the difficulties, to formulate some vision of the future context and nature of those operations. Even if we cannot hope to penetrate the fog of the future, we must at least establish an initial direction of March. The document begins with a look at the reasonably predictable economic and demographic trends which mean that we must reckon with a Europe in 20 years time which is older, relatively poorer and living in a difficult neighbourhood \u2013 that is to say, surrounded by regions which may not be coping at all well with globalisation. It draws attention to the problems an aging population will pose for defence recruitment, and defence budgets. It looks at social attitudes towards the use of the military, and suggests that defence planners face two great challenges: first, to adapt to the changing role of force in operations as we now find they have to be conducted \u2013 and since I hope a number of you have already read Rupert Smith\u2019s recent book entitled \u201cThe Utility of Force\u201d, I shall leave that unelaborated for now; and Second, to adapt to the ever-quickening technological revolution, with its attendant opportunities and threats. The vision then focuses on what this may mean for ESDP operations \u2013 less clear-cut, more politically constrained, conducted under 24/7 media scrutiny, and challenged by opponents who are asymmetric not only in structure and methods, but probably in aims and values as well. Against this background, the vision suggests the characteristics that we must embody in our future capabilities - synergy, agility, selectivity, and sustainability \u2013 and translates these characteristics into a \u201cfuture capability profile\u201d across each of the main accepted domains of defence capability. It notes that military activity always requires a mix of kinetic energy and intelligence, and suggests that in the future we will need much less of the former and much more of the latter. It rounds off with some key issues upon which defence planners working towards this capability profile must concentrate: knowledge exploitation; interoperability; the manpower balance (how to ensure enough \u201cboots on the ground\u201d whilst at the same time devoting more of our defence budgets to investment); rapid acquisition; industrial policy; and flexibility for the unforeseen. I do not claim that anything in this vision is especially revolutionary \u2013 indeed, the Comprehensive Political Guidance issued a month later at NATO\u2019s Riga Summit points in just the same direction. But I suppose the main point about this document is that it established a baseline \u2013 from Valletta to Helsinki and from Lisbon to Bratislava, European Defence Ministries are now all on the same page. We are now working to construct on this baseline a set of more detailed strategies. First amongst them is the strategy for the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base \u2013 or DTIB \u2013 which the Defence Ministers agreed in our Steering Board last month. That, too, is available on our website. Its message is a clear one \u2013 that today\u2019s defence industrial and technological excellence in Europe is the product of past investment; that we are falling badly off the pace; and that \u2013 I am quoting here \u2013 \u201cwe recognise that the point has now been reached when we need fundamental change in how we manage the \u2018business aspects\u2019 of defence in Europe \u2013 and that time is not on our side. The essence of this change is to recognise that a fully adequate DTIB is no longer sustainable on a strictly national basis \u2013 and that we must therefore press on with developing a truly European DTIB as something more that the sum of its national parts\u201d. Continuing to do the business of defence in 20-something separate national boxes is \u2013 again I quote \u2013 \u201cno longer economically sustainable \u2013 and in a world of multinational operations it is operationally unacceptable, too. We need therefore to achieve consolidation on both sides of the market in Europe: aligning and combining our various needs and shared equipment requirements; and meeting them from an increasingly integrated European DTIB\u201d. The strategy has a good deal more of interest to say \u2013 especially on the importance of getting more competition into cross-border defence procurement in Europe, and doing something radical about defence R&T \u2013 but I must move on. For the Capability Planners of my title, the next step is work on a shared Capability Development Plan. Put simply, we are aiming to develop together the Long Term Vision\u2019s analysis of the required capabilities of the future, so as to produce something which is more detailed and therefore more useful; and at the same time we are seeking to increase mutual transparency between defence ministries in Europe about what their current plans and programmes contain, to flush out the opportunities for doing more things cooperatively. By this we do not just mean the traditional collaborative armaments projects, but options such as shared basing or support, or shared upgrades, or pooled purchases or forces, or indeed mutually complementary role specialisation. As with everything else we do in the Agency, no obligation is involved \u2013 the final product, available we hope in about a year\u2019s time, will be in no sense a directive. It will simply be the best analysis that the combined wisdoms of our Defence Ministries can come up with, and a menu of next steps which those who so wish can choose to take. In concluding, let me turn to the near end of the bridge, and quickly run through a short checklist of some of the more tangible results we have delivered \u2013 or, to be more exact, we have been instrumental in helping the Member States to deliver: First, in pursuit of the opening of the European Defence Equipment Market, we have secured agreement from 23 of our Member States to open their tendering processes to suppliers from each others\u2019 countries, on a voluntary and reciprocal basis. This arrangement is operationalised through an Electronic Bulletin Board, to be found on our website. You will find there about 180 contracting opportunities for industry, with a total business value pushing \u20ac10 billion. There is also a more recently opened, but already thriving, section devoted to industry-to-industry offers \u2013 the larger companies have so far posted about a hundred notices for potential subcontractors and suppliers across Europe. Second, we have launched a new joint investment vehicle for defence R&T. Nineteen of our Member States, plus Norway as an EDA associate, have put together over \u20ac50 million for jointly commissioning research into technologies relevant to the protection of deployed forces. Nearly 300 entities across Europe have received the first call for proposals \u2013 familiar defence companies, SMEs and non-traditional suppliers, universities, research institutes and laboratories. The deal is that they can only apply in consortia involving at least two entities from different Member States \u2013 so a ferment of networking and mutual discovery is now in progress. Third, we assisted six of our Member States to put together a joint effort, worth over \u20ac100 million, to develop technologies for Software Defined Radio. This revolutionary marriage of computing and communication technologies has huge civilian commercial potential too \u2013 which is why the European Commission is also investing substantially in it. We have worked to ensure that these separate civilian and military efforts are mutually reinforcing. Fourth, we have engaged our shareholders on the challenge of getting UAVs flying in regulated airspace. This is an interesting test case for Europe\u2019s ability truly to get its act together. Here is an important new area of military capability which, typically, the Americans have pioneered \u2013 and to which Europe has responded so far in a typically fragmented fashion. But if the obstacles \u2013 and they are formidable \u2013 to operating UAVs alongside manned aircraft can be overcome, than a scale of demand will appear which will not only be hugely important for the aerospace sector in Europe, but will also lead to better and cheaper systems for the military. There is a great deal else I could describe. We now have, for example, around 40 small-scale R&T collaborations, with a combined value of nearly \u20ac 200 million, under management on behalf of the different groups of collaborators. We should shortly be able to announce an important step forward towards finally getting some uniformity into the increasingly high-tech personal equipment of the individual infantryman. We have started up an online system for work on new standards. We think we now have a good way forward for our efforts to rationalise the defence equipment testing infrastructure in Europe (just how many wind tunnels do Europeans really need?). Work is underway on SatCom, on maritime surveillance, on non-lethal weapons, and others too numerous to mention. Quite a lot of this is still at the stage of promise rather than realisation. In the final analysis, success on any of the EDA\u2019s agendas will depend on practical and sometimes difficult decisions, taken in 26 different capitals, to follow the logic of agreed analysis and start spending at least a proportion of defence budgets a bit differently. I am entirely confident that this will happen, to the benefit both of Europe\u2019s ability to act as a force for good in the world, and to the benefit of its industries. My confidence is based on the reflection that there is no really viable alternative. But, of course, time will be the judge.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2007/06/04/EDA_s_Witney_says_no_viable_alternative_to_more_common_spending_on_defence"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_1075", "date": "2007-05-14", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Background on New EDA Initiative on UAVs", "text": " Unmanned Air Vehicle systems are an important \u2018breakthrough technology\u2019 which can contribute significantly to meeting the objectives of ESDP operations. A range of aviation companies and research institutes are now investing in the development of UAVs and their related technologies. However, these efforts have been fragmented, with many projects spread across many European countries. The initiative launched today -- the result of extensive consultation between the Agency, the European Commission and the Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD) -- aims to establish a joint and complementary co-operation agenda. The main target of the joint agenda is to address the challenge of enabling UAVs to operate alongside conventional air traffic. This is the key to expanding the use of UAVs beyond the purely military into the security and ultimately commercial domains and to creating the scale of demand around which European industry can unite. Starting with an EDA-funded roadmap study, the proposed approach aims at progression from the current state of affairs, in which military UAVs can fly in segregated airspace, to a situation in which civilian and government-operated UAVs could operate alongside other manned aircraft in integrated airspace by 2012. This will require innovative technology development and system demonstrations for UAVs to be considered fully airworthy and for the right regulatory framework to be in place for this integration. The initial study for a more detailed road-map has a budget of some \u20ac500,000. The Agency will work with participating Member States, the Commission and industry on ideas for joint financing and an organisational model for future phases of this initiative. Working together on these issues at a European level can help to generate coherent projects for both security-oriented and commercial UAVs, as well as addressing their military use. This approach will also encourage the development of multi-purpose technologies, supported by budgets of the Commission as well as investment by industry. It will reduce fragmentation and duplication of UAV components which civil and military applications have in common. It has the potential, if properly exploited by all stakeholders, to move Europe quickly to a leadership position in a field which is of prime importance for European armed forces and the European aerospace industry alike.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2007/05/13/Background_on_New_EDA_Initiative_on_UAVs"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_1076", "date": "2006-11-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Background on Defence R&T Joint Investment Programme on Force Protection", "text": " Participants: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Norway.

The Steering Board stressed that the CDP was not intended to be an over-arching, supranational plan and that national defence planning and investment decision-taking would remain subject to the sovereign processes of each Member State. The work on the CDP will cover four main areas: Establishing the baseline of shortfalls and their relative priority, from the Headline Goal 2010 exercise, a set of goals agreed by governments in mid-2004 to enable the European Union by 2010 to be able to carry out humanitarian and rescue and peace-keeping tasks in crisis-management operations; Developing the LTV capability guidance , by testing the main hypotheses against \u201calternative futures\u201d and by a series of capability studies on key issues; Collating a database of Member States\u2019 current defence plans and programmes; Harvesting lessons for future capability from current experience. The process will involve the Agency, Member States, the EU Military Committee, the EU Military Staff and the Council of Ministers. The EDA will establish a team of experts to lead some of the elements and to maintain an overview of all four work strands. The Steering Board emphasised its determination to maintain close involvement with the work, meeting again on this subject in the first half of next year. \u201cOne of the reasons the EDA was created was to help provide a systematic and end-to-end approach which would identify ESDP\u2019s capability and capacity priorities, from current urgent operational requirements to longer-term challenges and opportunities. The CDP will provide a framework of agreed capability priorities well beyond the Headline Goal 2010 horizon,\u201d said EDA Chief Executive Nick Witney. \u201cBut it should also be a vehicle to promote dialogue and transparency among Member States on defence planning and investment and what their medium- to long-term defence planning looks like, so that opportunities can be identified and pursued for joint investment and collaborative projects, for pooled acquisition of capabilities or for anything else where working together promises better value for money for constrained defence budgets,\u201d he added. The Steering Board also reviewed the range of capability development efforts already underway within the Agency\u2019s structure of Integrated Development Teams, and agreed that a small increment to the Agency\u2019s staff was needed to fully exploit the emerging opportunities and handle the extra work. The Steering Board also directed the Agency to take forward work on Network Enabled Capabilities (NEC) for ESDP, working closely with all relevant Council actors, and stakeholders. It finally took note of the analysis of Member States\u2019 responses on the UK\u2019s Strategic Airlift Initiative and directed the Agency to further explore with the willing Member States possibilities to pool acquisitions of additional aircrafts, to partner in contracting transport services, and to pool maintenance and training in case of additional A400M procurement, \u2013 noting that, for some Member States, battlegroup airlift needs in particular are unlikely to be fully met unless on a pooled basis.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2006/12/13/EU_Governments_Launch_New_Plan_to_Build_Defence_Capabilities_for_Future_ESDP_Operations"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_1078", "date": "2007-02-01", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Solana, Verheugen, Svensson at EDA Conference - Radical Change and True European Market Needed to Secure Future of European Defence Industry", "text": " Senior government and industry representatives warned that the survival of an autonomous European defence industry was at risk without radical change - to create a genuine market on a continental scale, focused on mastering key technologies and delivering what Europe\u2019s armed forces will need in the future. At a conference in Brussels organised by the European Defence Agency on strengthening the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB), more than 300 participants from government, industry and academia heard both a bleak assessment of current trends and specific proposals to encourage investment and overcome fragmentation. \u201cNone of us can any longer afford to sustain a healthy and comprehensive DTIB on a national basis,\u201d said Javier Solana, Head of the EDA, in his keynote speech. \u201cThe future health, maybe even survival, of Europe\u2019s defence industry requires a European approach, and a European strategy.\u201d He said action was required soon to bring to fruition the vision of a future European DTIB, endorsed by EU Member States last autumn, which would be integrated and inter-dependent. \u201cWe must develop greater mutual reliance on diverse centres of excellence, and less dependence on non-European sources for key defence technologies.\u201d Solana urged a shift in defence spending towards research and development and equipment procurement, as well as alignment of national requirements into consolidated orders to create economies of scale. He also called for measures to take advantage of the human capital of newer EU Member States, and a focus on producing equipment needed for the very different security challenges of the future. The conference also heard that the European Commission is planning a number of initiatives to improve competitiveness, starting with a project to map the EDTIB and provide decision makers with accurate data on the economic situation of defence industries at EU level. Commission Vice-President G\u00fcnter Verheugen also outlined a proposal for a Defence Procurement Directive, which could complement the EDA\u2019s own voluntary Code of Conduct on Defence Procurement. Both initiatives aim at opening up markets by introducing more transparency and competition. The Commission also advocated a Regulation on intra-EU transfers of defence equipment. He said the visible and invisible costs of current obstacles amounted to over \u20ac3 billion a year. \u201cBuilding a European DTIB has many facets. Much of the practical, daily work is undertaken by the EDA. Commission initiatives can also act as a catalyst in the process. But a lot will depend on the political will of the Member States,\u201d Verheugen said. \u201cThe question is: for how long can the DTIB survive if Europe continues to postpone reforms which are generally accepted as unavoidable?\u201d \u00c5ke Svensson, President-designate of the Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD), agreed that the creation of an efficiently functioning European Defence Equipment Market was the essential foundation for shaping the EDTIB. Market forces would be complemented by increased investment in key technologies and competencies. But more effort was required because Europe still lacked a coherent Defence Strategic Research Agenda comparable to the common Strategic Research Agenda in civil aeronautics. \u201cWe see the need for a \u201cGroup of Wise Men\u201d to propose the agenda and conceptualize the framework in which Europe will be able to define and provide funding for important Key Technologies and Competencies,\u201d Svensson said. EDA Chief Executive Nick Witney said the Agency would build on the strong consensus at the conference to further refine the \u201cvision\u201d of the future EDTIB, and to work with the EU Member States, the European Commission and the defence industry on the specific actions required to make it a reality. \u201cNo one thinks this will be easy. But the consensus on the need for action, and on the direction in which we must move, is increasingly strong.

Since July, our voluntary Code of Conduct, to which 22 European Union Member States subscribe, has covered such contracts and has for the first time brought competition into this \u201cArticle 346 of the TFEU area\u201d, which in practice accounts for the bulk of European defence procurement.

Next month we mark the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome \u2013 the moment when the original six set up the Common Market. So it is a time for recollection \u2013 and few recollections of those early post-war years are as intriguing as how close Europe came, back in the early 1950s, to establishing a European Defence Community. Forget the sort of carefully nuanced initiatives which proceed under the banner of European defence today \u2013 this would have been real, full-blooded common defence, with a standing European army under central command, sustained by a common budget. Even more intriguing, President Truman was all for it \u2013 and so was Eisenhower, after the change of administration. But eventually it came to nothing, NATO got going, and defence rather disappeared from the specifically European agenda for the next half century. It reappeared as the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), as recently as 1999. And I think it fair to say that the welcome it got on this side of the Atlantic was less than wholehearted. Okay, so the Brits were in there from the beginning, determined to ensure that this new policy developed only in ways compatible with NATO. But would there not be others pursuing different agendas, dreaming of using the policy to separate Europe from America? And was there not more than a dash of pretentiousness about this new European enthusiasm \u2013 particularly in light of the then-recent Balkan campaigns? True, the Europeans had adopted the so-called Helsinki Headline Goal for improving their military capabilities \u2013 but there was a long history in NATO of trying, without conspicuous success, to get Europe to share more of the military burden. And I guess it is at this last point \u2013 the bit where people point to the gap between the ambition and rhetoric on the one hand, and actual capability on the other \u2013 that the European Defence Agency comes in. I like to think of the EDA as European defence\u2019s \u201cback office\u201d. The \u201cfront office\u201d came first, at the beginning of the new policy. It is staffed by diplomats and generals. The diplomats worked their way through the creation of new institutions, and the negotiation of the Berlin+ arrangements with NATO. Then, in 2003, they agreed the European Security Strategy \u2013 a remarkably clear, and blessedly short, document which tells you in effect what the ESDP is for. It analyses the post-Cold War (and post-9/11) world in terms with which I think Americans should be comfortable \u2013 pointing out that the new threats and challenges are not the conventional adversaries of the past, but such less tractable yet equally menacing dangers as terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, state failure, regional conflict and organised crime. It acknowledges that Europe has a responsibility to take a greater share of the burden of sustaining global security. And it asserts without equivocation that \u201cThe transatlantic relationship is irreplaceable. Acting together the European Union and the United States can be a formidable force for good in the world. Our aim should be an effective and balanced partnership with the USA\u201d. The \u201cfront office\u201d, as I have noted, is staffed by generals as well as diplomats. They have run Europe\u2019s crisis management operations \u2013 a surprising 16 of them to date, from the Balkans, to the Congo, to the Middle East, to Aceh in Indonesia. True, many of these operations have been very small, and the majority have been civilian in character, involving not soldiers, but judges, policemen, observers, experts in civil administration. Indeed, Europe senses that it has a rather specific brand of crisis management capacity to offer, which fuses hard and soft power and focuses as much on preventing conflicts, and sorting out their aftermath, as it does on dousing the blaze. Relative peanuts you may think, but it all adds up, and it may surprise you to know that in recent years there has been a fairly consistent level of about 70 thousand European troops deployed outside the continent, whether under UN, EU, NATO, or national flags. This, I suggest, is not nothing. On the other hand, it is also less than 5% of the nearly two million men and women that we keep in uniform in Europe \u2013 and the fact that some 80% of this total are simply not deployable outside their national territories tells you that the modernisation of Europe\u2019s defence capabilities still has a very long way to go. It also tells you that Europeans collectively are not getting proper value from what they spend on defence \u2013 about $ 250 billion a year, less than half US expenditure but in absolute terms a pretty substantial input, particularly in relation to the achieved output of usable military capability. There is nothing like operations to bring you face to face with your deficiencies and limitations \u2013 so it is no surprise that it was just as the ESDP was beginning to become operational that the European presidents and prime ministers decided, in 2003, that they had better complement the \u201cfront office\u201d with a \u201cback office\u201d \u2013 an agency focused on the tools needed for the job. Tools and infrastructure \u2013 because the European leaders were becoming equally concerned about the condition of Europe\u2019s underpinning defence technological and industrial base. The evidence was accumulating (and I shall come back to this) of steady erosion of Europe\u2019s competitiveness and capacity on the industrial side. So, just over two years ago, the EDA opened its doors for business \u2013 with the mission of supporting the Members States in their efforts to improve their defence capabilities for crisis management operations. Our terms of reference range over military capabilities, defence research and technology, armaments, and industry and market issues \u2013 in other words, pretty much everything except the policy issues and the operations which the front office handles. To address this wide-ranging agenda, we have one hundred staff (drawn from 20 different nationalities) and an annual budget of less than $30m. National Defence Ministers hold on to their money, and their decision-making authority: in matters of defence, no-one is prepared to be bossed around by some powerful supranational body in Brussels. So to change things we have to get the Member States to agree and \u2013 the bottom line \u2013 to spend their defence budgets in rather different ways than they might otherwise have done. Fortunately, we have wonderful access \u2013 our Steering Board, chaired by my boss Javier Solana, comprises the Defence Ministers in person, and met 4 times last year. And we are ultimately working with the grain \u2013 the Member States want to do the right thing, even if, like Saint Augustine, they may not always want to do it right now. They do want to stop spending their money on the wrong things and spend it on the right things instead; and they do recognise the necessity of increasingly pooling their efforts and resources. Because everybody knows that if Europeans want to preserve effective military clout, and a globally competitive industry, they have no choice but to cooperate. The era in which the business of defence could effectively be managed in 24 separate national boxes in Europe is now over; none of us can any longer afford it. The only way forward is, to express it in business terms, to consolidate demand, encourage the consolidation of the supply side, and create a continental scale of market in which demand and supply can meet. So how are we doing? We have a wide range of specific projects in hand, from Software-Defined Radio (which is going rather well) to an effort to rationalise equipment test facilities across Europe. We have under management a portfolio of over 40 individual research & technology collaborations. But we think it is at the strategic level that we can ultimately add most value \u2013 which is why arguably our most important output to date is a document called the Long Term Vision, published last October, which attempts to look forward over the next two decades and draw some conclusions about the environment in which ESDP operations will take place, and what that means for the sort of military capabilities and industrial capacity we will need. This Long-Term Vision majors on the changing role of force in today\u2019s world, and the accelerating advance of science and technology. It concludes that we must decisively break with the old concepts of warfare which obtained in the last century, which were all about unloading as much ordnance as possible on conventional opponents. It underlines that application of force will have to be increasingly modulated with what is happening in the political arena; that operations will likely take place in constrained and ambiguous circumstances, under tight rules of engagement and 24/7 media scrutiny. It emphasises that the decisive capabilities of the future will be less heavy metal and high explosive, and more the capabilities that provide situational awareness, and allow rapid communication and decision-taking. Operations will be expeditionary, and multinational, placing a premium on interoperability, deployability and sustainability. Perhaps not a wholly original analysis \u2013 but 24 Ministers of Defence are now on this same page. In passing, I think more surprise was created by some of the demographic and economic analysis the document contains \u2013 when you realise that in 2025 European will comprise only 6% of the world\u2019s population and that the average European will be 45 years old, it makes you think. This year, we will be taking the analysis down one level, and working towards more detailed guidance on where we should all be concentrating our investment \u2013 on network-enabled capabilities, on strategic lift, and so on. Analysis never fixed anything in and of itself \u2013 but we can at least make Ministries of Defence feel increasingly uncomfortable if they persist in prioritising the purchase of main battle tanks and combat aircraft. On the industrial side, I think we have made more conspicuous progress. I referred earlier to the traditional way of doing defence procurement largely on a national basis. A security get-out clause in the European treaties has allowed more than half of European defence procurement to be sheltered from the competition rules of the Common Market. Without abandoning that clause, almost all Member States have now agreed, on a voluntary and reciprocal basis, to offer the bulk of their new procurement opportunities to suppliers in each other\u2019s countries. The Electronic Bulletin Board on the EDA\u2019s website on which these offers are posted went live last July \u2013 and now advertises around $9 billion of business. In passing, I should emphasise that this has nothing at all to do with \u201cFortress Europe\u201d. It is purely about how Europeans deal with one another. It leaves the position of US exporters unaffected. More competition will make defence budgets go further. But we are just as interested in how greater play for market forces can help the European defence technological and industrial base (DTIB). At a major EDA conference earlier this month bringing together top government officials and industrialists from across Europe, there was striking consensus on this.\u00a0As Commissioner Verheugen expressed it: \u201cThe question is: for how long can the DTIB survive if Europe continues to postpone reforms that are generally accepted as unavoidable?\u201d We need more competition in Europe, and we need more cooperation; if governments can consolidate demand \u2013 offer to the market more joint programmes \u2013 the supply side will respond. Anything else is economically unsustainable. And it makes operational sense too \u2013 there is no form of interoperability better than different national contingents on multinational operations using the same kit. And I should note that this logic of European cooperation gets a helpful assist from the difficulties European industries find in accessing the US defence market and in technology exchange across the Atlantic. We hope to crystallise all this into a top level European DTIB strategy for the Defence Ministers to consider this summer. In closing, a quick word on Research and Technology. For the first time we have put together the data \u2013 and it is not so much data as writing on the wall. Since the year 2000, the US has increased its spending on defence R&D by over 9% a year; collectively, Europeans have increased by less than 1.5%. So you now out-spend us by 6 to 1, and the DARPA budget exceeds the entire sum of European MoDs\u2019 R&T expenditure. We are eating the seed corn. Part of the problem is that only 6 or 7 European nations have ever gone in for defence R&T. So last year we devised and launched a new vehicle for joint investment, providing a way into the business for nations who had not previously been able to spend money effectively on defence R&T on a national basis. The fund totals $70 million, with 19 of our 24 Member States contributing; as a sign of the times, one of the major contributors is Poland. So is our glass half empty or half full? If I were you, I would reserve judgement; Europe has promised so much in these areas in the past, to so little effect. But I would wish the enterprise well. On the capabilities side, this is absolutely not a zero-sum game with NATO: our activities are complementary, and if Europeans do manage to raise their game on defence, it seems to me to matter not a jot whether this is done on a NATO or an EU ticket. On the industrial side, we need to succeed if there is to be any sort of European defence industry to give the US primes a run for their money \u2013 ultimately, I suggest, in your interest as much as ours. Personally, I have no doubt that the enterprise will succeed, since there is simply no alternative. The key question is how long will it take and what will be lost if the results do not come through sooner rather than later. But, from a US perspective, I suggest that NATO\u2019s recent Riga Summit declaration had it right: \u201cA stronger EU will further contribute to our common security\u201d. So, fingers crossed.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2007/02/13/EDA_success_in_interests_of_U_S_as_well_as_Europe_EDA_Chief_Executive_Nick_Witney_says"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_1081", "date": "2006-11-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EU Defence Ministers Club Together to Research Better Protection for Armed Forces", "text": " European Union Defence Ministers agreed today to launch a new joint research programme into technologies for protecting their armed forces against threats such as snipers, booby traps and improvised bombs, establishing a ground-breaking mechanism for collaborative action to help boost Europe\u2019s efforts in Defence Research and Technology. A ministerial meeting of the Steering Board of the European Defence Agency, which will coordinate the new scheme, formally approved a three-year Joint Investment Programme (JIP) worth \u20ac 54.23 million and involving 19 European governments1. \u201cIf Europe is to maintain an effective defence technological and industrial base and develop the military capabilities we will need in the future, we simply have to spend more on R&T and do much more together,\u201d said Javier Solana, the Head of the Agency, who chaired the meeting. \u201cToday\u2019s decision represents a major step in that direction and demonstrates the creativity and the political will of EU governments. As I reported to the Council of Ministers, the Agency has now begun to deliver substantial results \u2013 and this is prominent among them,\u201d he added. Unlike previous collaborations on defence R&T, which involved governments negotiating financial and industrial shares for each individual project, the JIP sets up a common budget to fund the whole programme with a management committee representing the contributors to oversee the selection and financing of individual projects. The votes of the contributors are weighted according to the size of their contributions, though decisions will be taken by consensus wherever possible. The programme will focus on a limited number of specific R&T priorities driven by agreed capability requirements for future operations: collective survivability, individual protection, data analysis, secure wireless communication and mission planning and training. In a further boost to collaborative action, the Steering Board also welcomed new initiatives for joint work on Software Defined Radio (SDR), a technology for secure communications with important potential applications for civilian and military use. Five countries \u2013 Finland, France, Italy, Spain and Sweden \u2013 announced an ad-hoc joint research project (ESSOR) under the EDA umbrella worth an estimated 100 million Euros aimed at enhancing interoperability (in Europe and with the U.S. and NATO) of medium-term national SDR projects and at promoting a European technological and industrial capacity of strategic importance. A related EDA study focuses on specific military SDR requirements for the longer-term. Both of these initiatives complement the WINTSEC project announced in October by European Commission Vice President G\u00fcnter Verheugen, who is also a member of the Steering Board. The project will study wireless interoperability for civil security purposes. The role of the Agency will be to coordinate its study on longer-term military specifications and the medium-term ESSOR ad hoc project and ensure that these efforts are complementary to the civil technology work strand of the Commission Security Research Programme. \u201cThis is an excellent example of how we can maximise the return from our investments thanks to governments, the EDA and the Commission working closely together,\u201d Solana said. The Steering Board, the decision-making body for the EDA, also approved the Agency\u2019s Work Programme for 2007. Its major directions are related to the Long-Term Vision report which was presented to the Steering Board in October. Major initiatives for 2007 include establishing an ESDP Capability Development Plan; developing a European Defence R&T Strategy to identify at the European level key defence technologies to be developed and preserved in Europe; elaborating the characteristics of the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base of the future and the way to achieve it; and identifying practical opportunities for collaboration by exploiting a \u201ccooperative armaments process\u201d, starting with the Armoured Fighting Vehicles and 21st Century Soldier areas. \u201cToday\u2019s meeting is probably the most productive we have yet had.

The aim of the workshop was to support the new Member States whose defence industries have to undergo a significant transformation so that they can better integrate into the new European Defence Equipment Market. Specifically, it aimed to help contractors and small and medium-sized enterprises from those countries to find future business opportunities, particularly with the established major European prime contractors and first tier suppliers, and to become more competitive. There was also a discussion about how to ensure that specialist competencies from across Europe are included in the future Defence Technological and Industrial Base. The meeting was part of the EDA\u2019s work to share widely the benefits of the new European defence equipment market, operated on the basis of the Code of Conduct on Defence Procurement and Code of Best Practice in the Supply Chain, which came into effect on 1 July. The Code of Conduct commits subscribing Member States (sMS) to maximising fair and equal opportunities for all suppliers based in other sMS by setting transparent and objective criteria for selecting bidders and awarding contracts. The Code of Best Practice in the Supply Chain is about driving the same principles down the supply chain and influencing the appropriate behaviour. The meeting, which was organised in conjunction with the Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD), allowed the new Member States to talk about their experiences of working with contractors and dealing with different technologies. The contractors explained how they identify and assess potential competitive advantages and how countries could attract inward investment in these areas. \u201cIt is clear that the EDA participating Member States who joined the EU most recently and those who will join next year have a special transformation process to go through in their defence industries,\u201d said Ulf Hammarstr\u00f6m, the EDA\u2019s Director for Industry and Market. \u201cToday\u2019s workshop has helped to show the importance of the ongoing creation of the true European Defence Equipment Market where there are significant opportunities for innovative companies, whatever their size.

It is vital to have this kind of 20-year perspective, given the lead times typically involved in developing defence capability. Decisions we take, or fail to take, today will affect whether we have the right military capabilities, and the right capacities in Europe\u2019s defence technological and industrial base, in the third decade of this century. Of course, the document does not provide, and does not pretend to provide, a comprehensive route map into the future. It needs to be thought of more as a compass bearing to help us advance into the fog of the future \u2013 a line of march that we will need to check at regular intervals. The document will be released to you shortly. It is the condensation of a very great deal of wisdom and advice harvested from, amongst others, the Institute of Security Studies in Paris, the EU\u2019s own Military Committee, and eminent scientists and technologists across Europe. The output is concise and \u2013 I hope you will agree \u2013 both stimulating and readable. It is not a \u201cconsensus document\u201d \u2013 so not every Defence Minister in our Steering Board has necessarily subscribed to each and every thought and expression in it. What the Steering Board have done, however, is welcome it as a solid foundation on which to build the next stage of the EDA\u2019s agendas. To go back to my image of a compass, the Ministers agreed that this document is pointing in the right direction, as far as any of us can discern. We also took stock in the Steering Board of progress towards establishing a new joint investment programme for defence research and technology efforts in the force protection area. Those of you who have followed the EDA\u2019s affairs will know that we have been working on this for nearly a year, from the point when the Hampton Court summit identified the need to increase defence research and technology spend in Europe, and to do more of it collaboratively. We are very close to achieving the first such joint programme \u2013 with a substantial majority of our Member States taking part, and a joint fund to apply to the research objectives amounting to some tens of millions of euros. We noted that one last push is necessary, to get the last details nailed down in a way which suits the maximum number of potential contributors. But we directed the Agency to conclude its efforts with the participating Member States and to produce its \u201cbest and final\u201d proposal for us to decide on in the Steering Board when next we meet, in Brussels in mid-November. Finally, we looked at the medium-term perspective for the Agency \u2013 what should its priorities be, and what financial framework should it have, over the next three years. That is formally a decision for the Council to make at the end of the year. Today we agreed on the priorities. Some further work on the Financial Framework is still needed for a Council Decision in November. Altogether, then, an interesting and productive meeting, underlining how the Agency is increasingly fulfilling our hopes that it should \u201cmake a difference\u201d in the development of the capabilities we need to support our agreed policies.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2006/10/02/EDA_Steering_Board_News_Conference_Opening_Remarks_by_Head_of_Agency_Javier_Solana"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_1085", "date": "2006-10-20", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA Chief Executive Witney Addresses Chairmen of Parliamentary Defence Committee", "text": " Perhaps I may begin by affirming how pleased I am to be here with you today. I never come to Helsinki without reflecting that it was here that, at the Helsinki European Council of 1999, that the European Security and Defence Policy, ESDP, was born. Today, you have only to look at where the Union is undertaking its now characteristic brand of crisis management operation to realise that, during the intervening seven years, ESDP has come of age. As we speak, the Union is running no fewer than 12 such operations, in locations as far afield as South-East Asia, the Balkans, and Africa. Most of them, of course, are civilian in nature. But the current peace support operations in Bosnia and the Congo are significant military undertakings. And to this list may shortly be added responsibility for Kosovo, following the expected transfer of responsibility from NATO \u2013 and one thinks also of the major European deployments taking place in South Lebanon which, though not formally an ESDP operation, bear the hallmark of collective European action. Indeed, whether under the Union or some other flag, an average of more than 70,000 European service personnel were deployed outside Europe in the course of 2005. On that basis, we may fairly claim to be beginning to live up to the promise of the European Security Strategy \u2013 that the Union would make a more effective and proportionate contribution to the task of maintaining global security. But a start is only a start. 70,000, after all, is less than 4% of the men and women we maintain in uniform in Europe. And, sadly, it is all too obvious that the present demand for European crisis management assistance far outstrips what we are able to provide. There remains, in short, a big gap between what we say we would like to do, and what we actually can do. Which, of course, is where the European Defence Agency comes in. This Agency, the EDA if you will allow me the acronym, is a child of the ESDP. Its mission is broad, to work with the Member States on developing defence capabilities, understood to mean not just more relevant and effective militaries, but also a strong industrial and technological infrastructure. We have, if you like, been charged with working to ensure that the tools are available to do the job \u2013 the job being the one described in the European Security Strategy. This makes us a thoroughly unusual kind of Agency. Agencies are normally created to discharge some rather specialist function: they tend to be set up with clearly delineated powers and responsibilities, and probably a significant budget, in order to deliver some specific product or service. The EDA could not be more different. Its functions are wide-ranging, embracing working with defence planners on armed forces modernisation; trying to encourage more collaboration in armaments and research and technology in Europe; and working to strengthen the defence technological and industrial base. On the other hand, the Agency has only a tiny budget, and virtually no delegated powers. And defence being what it is \u2013 a subject that lies close to the heart of concepts of national sovereignty \u2013 decision-taking on the various subjects I have mentioned is reserved for national defence ministries. So it is through 24 national defence ministries that the EDA must achieve its results. The Agency must act as a conscience, and a catalyst. And it will accomplish its mission only to the extent that national ministries engage with it, and ultimately act in accordance with our guiding principles \u2013 which I sometimes summarise as spending defence budgets on the right things and not the wrong things, and increasingly pooling our European efforts and resources. The saving grace in all this is our governance arrangements \u2013 the fact that I answer directly to Javier Solana as the Head of the Agency, and that he chairs a Steering Board on which all the Defence Ministers sit in person. This Ministerial Board has met three times already this year, and will meet for a fourth time in Brussels next month. In between-whiles, it meets in other compositions \u2013 as National Armaments Directors, or senior capability planners. Through the Steering Board, we have a persistent and continuous dialogue with the top levels of decision-making in the national Ministries of Defence. This is our chance to influence. So, how are we doing? We are now approaching our second anniversary as a going concern \u2013 and I am at last beginning to breathe a little easier. The early days of this kind of enterprise are a bit like a ballistic missile launch. There is a countdown, a button is pressed, and vast amounts of energy are visibly released in the form of flame and smoke \u2013 but there is a disconcerting pause before lift-off actually occurs. Happily, decisive movement is now apparent. First, we have taken a long stride towards the creation of a genuine market for defence equipment in Europe. Since, I suppose, the dawn of time, the armaments business has been conducted on a strictly national basis \u2013 the King\u2019s troops have been equipped from the King\u2019s arsenals. For some decades now, it has been increasingly apparent that this approach, as is usual when industries are protected, leads to an inefficient supply side, bad value for the customer, and a situation which, given increasing pressures on defence budgets, is ultimately unsustainable. Of course, in deference to national security the European treaties exempt the business of defence from the normal rules of the internal market, under the famous Article 296. So our approach has been to seek an accord amongst our Member States that, not withstanding this exemption, they will agree on a voluntary and reciprocal basis to offer defence contracting opportunities to suppliers in each others\u2019 countries. This is the essence of the Code of Conduct on Defence Procurement which 22 of the 24 Member States participating in the Agency agreed a little under a year ago \u2013 and which has its practical embodiment in the new Electronic Bulletin Board, a part of the Agency\u2019s website, on which contract opportunities are now advertised which previously have been protected under Article 296. The Bulletin Board has been going for about three months, and now comprises 50 such opportunities with an aggregate value that we estimate at over \u20ac3 bn. We all recognise that offering contracting opportunities across borders is one thing, and actually awarding contracts to a non-national supplier is another. We nonetheless feel heartened by the early progress made. It may not be too optimistic to believe that a crucial psychological watershed has been crossed. For decades past, the automatic assumption about procurement of defence equipment was that it should be done on a national basis. That assumption is now replaced by one of Europe-wide competition. And the benefit will be felt not only by the customer \u2013 the taxpayer, and the armed forces \u2013 but by Europe\u2019s defence technological and industrial base as a whole. Because, as much as anything, this market initiative is about adding the impulse of market forces to the restructuring that Europe\u2019s defence and technological industrial base must undergo if it is to remain globally competitive. There is, quite simply, no longer enough money in defence budgets in Europe for us to continue to attempt the business of defence in 24 separate national boxes. The future success of the sector depends critically on consolidation, on both the demand and the supply sides. Consolidation will mean an increased readiness for Europeans to abandon the notion that each can do everything, and therefore to accept increased interdependence \u2013 and this underlines the particular importance of the further agreement reached by our Steering Board in September, on Security of Supply. For the first time, 22 European Member States have explicitly promised to come to each other\u2019s assistance in matters of defence materiel supply in times of operational urgency. The same Steering Board meeting also agreed that Europeans need to work to become less dependent for key technologies on non-European sources. These two developments suggest to me a real growing sense of mutual solidarity in the European defence business. The second evidence of progress to which I would like to refer is the endorsement earlier this month, at the first Agency Steering Board meeting to be held inside the Arctic circle, in Lapland, of our \u201cLong-Term Vision\u201d. This has been a year-long exercise to develop a picture of what ESDP will need in 20 years time. The outcome is a 25 page document, accessible on our website. With the help, I should emphasise, of authorities and experts from across Europe, we have attempted to pick out some of the key trends which will determine the security environment we face in the middle of the third decade; to deduce some implications for the nature of ESDP operations; and from that to take lessons about the sort of capabilities we must already, now, start to develop, if they are to be ready at the time that we need them. Additionally, this Long-Term Vision document highlights some of the key challenges that defence planners will have to face, getting from here to there. The document aspires to provide a compass-bearing, or line of march or sense of direction, for all those who, day by day, take decisions which will in practice determine what military capabilities we have, and what we do not have, twenty years hence. And, for the Agency, it provides an essential foundation for the next phase of work we must initiate with our participating Member States \u2013 that is, to work together on an ESDP Capability Development Plan. As you will know, the horizon of our collective planning of capabilities is currently bounded by the Headline Goal for 2010. Also as you will appreciate, 2010 is, in relation to the lead times for developing new defence capabilities, effectively tomorrow. So the idea of an ESDP Capability Development Plan is that we should work together to define the capability priorities we must develop over the next two decades. The process will inevitably require a degree of mutual transparency amongst European Ministries of Defence \u2013 disclosure, in at least broad terms, of what national forward defence plans look like. This will have the additional advantage, we hope, of highlighting opportunities for cooperation \u2013 whether joint procurement of new systems, or the pooling or sharing of some desired new capability which may be unaffordable on an individual national basis. Finally, beyond the defence equipment market and the Long-Term Vision initiatives, I should briefly mention defence research and technology. This was rightly thrust into prominence at the summit meeting at Hampton Court during the UK Presidency, a year ago. In consequence, research and technology has been a particular focus in the Agency\u2019s second year of activity. It has been sobering to collect the data, and realise that the combined spend on defence R&T of all the Ministries of Defence in Europe is less than the annual budget of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA. Propelled by the EDA\u2019s first major conference in February, defence research and technology rose sharply up the political agenda \u2013 so that Defence Ministers in our Steering Board embraced the conclusion that we must \u201cspend more, spend better and spend more together\u201d on R&T. What does this mean in practice? We have worked with the Member States on the design of a new form of joint investment programme, with the pilot scheme focussed on the force protection area \u2013 all those technologies with potential to reduce the risks to our young men and women when we send them into harm\u2019s way. We still have two or three more weeks\u2019 work to do on this before we can be sure that all the details \u2013 and all the contributors! - are nailed down. But I am increasingly confident that, by the time of our next Steering Board meeting in November, we will be in the position to announce the launch of a programme with a substantial common budget, to which most of our Member States will have chosen to subscribe. If this works, we envisage it as being only the first in a series of joint investment programmes which will provide the primary vehicle for defence ministries in Europe to pool their efforts and resources in defence R&T. And, I cannot stand here in Helsinki without paying tribute to how strongly supportive Finland has been of this initiative, as indeed of other Agency agendas, both during its current Presidency but also before. So, what with the equipment market, the Long-Term Vision and shortly I hope our first major R&T initiative leaving the launch pad, I feel increasingly satisfied that the Agency is beginning to demonstrate that it can indeed make a difference. Looking ahead, I am excited at the prospect of addressing the Capability agenda more systematically than we have so far been able to, on the basis of the Capability Development Plan to which I have referred. I think we shall also need to address the issue of the defence technological and industrial base more directly in the coming year \u2013 reflecting with our Member States on just what sort of base we collectively want to achieve in coming years, and how we can get from here to there. So there is plenty to tackle in the year ahead; and the impact we can have is really only limited by the amount of energy and attention that defence ministries are prepared to give to the sort of cooperative opportunities which EDA offers. Sometimes, engagement with the Agency\u2019s work can seem unfamiliar, and therefore uncomfortable, to national staffs. Sometimes \u2013 and I do actually sympathise with this! \u2013 it can seem like just one more burden in an already overburdened working life. But I do believe we are already demonstrating that investment of a little more effort and attention in the affairs of the Agency is likely to produce a substantial dividend. And, of course, I very much hope that you, in your key roles, will be prepared to give your national ministries appropriate encouragement in this regard!", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2006/10/19/EDA_Chief_Executive_Witney_Addresses_Chairmen_of_Parliamentary_Defence_Committee"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_1086", "date": "2006-05-22", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "22 EU Member States to Take Part in New European Defence Equipment Market", "text": " The new European defence equipment market will be launched on 1 July, with the participation of all but three of the 25 EU Member States.

This set of principles has been developed in close consultation with industry.

The Steering Board of the European Defence Agency, meeting at the level of National Armaments Directors, heard that pressure on European defence budgets and the continuing fragmentation of both demand and supply sides of the European market meant that defence industries faced a challenging future. They agreed in outline the sort of across national borders.

The report \u2013 the product of 11 months of study involving officials and experts from governments, defence bodies, academia and industry across Europe \u2013 was debated by the EDA Steering Board, the decision-making body on which the Defence Ministers of the Agency\u2019s 24 participating Member States, and the European Commission, sit. \u201cThis fascinating document offers planners, working their way through the fog of the future, a shared and stimulating analysis of some of the major trends that will shape that future,\u201d said Javier Solana, the Head of the Agency, who chaired the ministerial meeting. \u201cIt provides shared views on the state of the world in which European Security and Defence Policy operations will take place and on what kind of capabilities will be needed to conduct those operations successfully,\u201d he added. \u201cGiven the lead times typically involved in developing defence capability, decisions we take, or fail to take, today will affect whether we have the right military capabilities, and the right capacities in Europe\u2019s defence technological and industrial base, in the third decade of this century,\u201d Solana said. The report paints a sobering picture of an older and relatively less prosperous Europe in 20 years\u2019 time which will be living in a less stable world. Defence will need to adapt to accelerating technological challenges and to changing attitudes towards the use of force, placing greater emphasis on the careful and precise use of military power. It says ESDP operations are likely to be expeditionary, multinational and multi-instrument. Information will be critical against opponents whose tactics, aims and values will often be radically different. In such circumstances, the military will be only one of a range of instruments applied to achieve campaign goals. Complementarity of civil and military effort will determine success. While the Steering Board endorsement does not include agreement of all particulars, the Ministers agreed that the Long-Term Vision (LTV) should be the basis for the Agency to present new proposals on an ESDP Capability Development Plan. \u201cThe best way to prepare for this future is through greater mutual transparency about medium- to long-term defence planning, so we can identify all those areas where the pooling of efforts and resources promises better value for money from tight defence budgets,\u201d Solana said. The LTV should also be the basis to pursue work on a European Defence R&T Strategy and related priorities, and to set an appropriate agenda for strengthening the European defence technological and industrial base. Ministers also took stock of plans for a Joint Investment Programme (JIP) on Force Protection, an innovative approach to meeting one of the key objectives outlined by EU leaders of spending more, and more together in the critical area of Defence R&T. They urged the Agency to finalise the plan for decision at the next Steering Board meeting on 13 November and expressed their hopes for a programme with wide participation and a substantial budget. The ministers also discussed the Agency\u2019s priorities under a financial framework for the next three years which will be fixed by the Council of Ministers in November. The framework envisages the possibility of a modest increase in the size and budget of the Agency, with significant joint investments by Member States in the future taking place through mechanisms such as the JIP. \u201cIt is clear that the future context for European defence is very challenging. It will be more expensive to recruit and equip our armed forces. And they will have to be flexible enough to handle complex and sensitive operations,\u201d EDA Chief Executive Nick Witney said. \u201cBut the shared analysis of the future set out in the Long-Term Vision provides a solid foundation on which to build the work of the Agency.

The Ministers were able to review the results of an EDA Conference on defence R&T in February, at which representatives of governments, industry and research bodies discussed how to achieve a breakthrough in European multinational and national efforts in this area. The Ministers reviewed three possible approaches to increasing spending and collaboration on defence R&T: more ad-hoc projects between groups of EU countries; increasing the EDA\u2019s own budget for R&T spend on behalf of Member States; and establishing a special EDA programme of joint R&T investment, with an associated budget provided by a coalition of contributors.

At their informal meeting at Hampton Court on 1 November, the EU leaders had asked Javier Solana \u2013 High Representative for European Security and Defence Policy and Head of the EDA \u2013 to report to the summit on how to improve defence capabilities by increasing levels of research spending, finding opportunities for research collaboration and tackling capability gaps. \u201cThe Steering Board is fully behind this agenda and intends to take it forward with vigour,\u201d said Dirk Ellinger, Research & Technology Director in the German Defence Ministry, who chaired the meeting on behalf of Solana. The Steering Board, the principal decision-making body of the EDA which was meeting in the formation of R&T Directors of its 24 participating Member States, discussed how to achieve a comprehensive strategy for defence R&T in Europe. Historically, European defence R&T cooperation has worked by looking for common ground between approaches and priorities which are set nationally. The Steering Board agreed that, as a further dimension, such cooperation required a top-down, jointly-developed view of where Member States collectively should be going, and which technologies had to be preserved or developed in Europe. The Steering Board also highlighted a number of technology areas which will be critical for helping the European Union to develop the capabilities it needs for future peace-keeping and crisis management operations under the European Security and Defence Policy. These cover areas such as robotics, information fusion, fuel cells and unmanned land, sea and air vehicles. The Steering Board agreed that these areas should be prioritised for new joint R&T projects. \u201cThe United States is out-spending Europe by a ratio of five to one in defence R&D, and less than five per cent of what we do spend in Europe is spent collaboratively,\u201d said EDA Chief Executive Nick Witney. \u201cThe engagement of the European Heads of State and Government on this issue represents an unprecedented opportunity,\u201d he added.

The success of the surveillance and intelligence missions conducted using LE-UAVs is extremely dependent on the availability of robust and reliable communication data links connecting the LE-UAV with the ground infrastructure. Those links are used to control the flight of the LE-UAV during the mission, to configure its on-board equipment and, most important of all, to transmit the collected intelligence data to the ground in near-real time. As the operating scenarios of the LE-UAV include long-distance missions, the communication links must assure this connectivity independent of radio conditions that may vary from one geographical location to another.

The Commission today outlined its proposals for future initiatives in the sector, including plans for an Interpretative Communication on the scope of Article 296 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community, which restricts cross-border competition by allowing Member States to claim an exemption on national security grounds from normal EU public procurement rules. The Commission also said it would propose a specific Directive covering defence procurement where Article 296 does not apply. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement by the Commission is a welcome complement to the ,\u201d said EDA Chief Executive Nick Witney. \u201cBoth the Agency and the Commission are concerned to see more competition in defence procurement to give better value for money and strengthen the competitiveness of the European defence industry.\u201d EU Defence Ministers, meeting as the Steering Board of the EDA, agreed in November to introduce a voluntary Code of Conduct next year which would for the first time introduce competition into defence procurement contracts for which Member States claim exemption under Article 296. The Code of Conduct is an EDA initiative and will be implemented and monitored by the Agency.\u00a0 \u201cThe Commission is focusing on injecting more competition in areas of defence procurement not covered by Article 296 and on defining the application of the derogation. But where exemptions are invoked, which is the case today for more than 50% of the defence equipment purchases by EU governments, the EDA Code of Conduct will help to ensure that there is transparent and fair competition,\u201d he added. The EDA believes that an Interpretative Communication might help clarify in what circumstances the Commission would consider Article 296 to be legitimately invoked, and thereby assist MS in their judgements in this regard, without prejudice to their prerogatives under the Treaty, in particular in relation to the protection of the essential interests of their security. A Directive, as a legal instrument, requires thorough knowledge about the nature of the market, including the segment where article 296 applies. The historic lack of transparency in this sector means that this knowledge is currently limited, so a Directive should be seen as a longer term solution to establish a level playing field for fair competition in areas where Article 296 does not apply.\u00a0 The EDA has been working closely with the Commission and stands ready to continue working in partnership on common efforts to support the creation of an internationally competitive EDEM, including the strengthening of the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base.

It gives me a chance to share with you some reflections on the importance of European defence research and technology. I would like to begin by putting defence research and technology, and the work of the European Defence Agency, in a broader context. It is worth stressing that our work in these areas serves a larger purpose, which is to enhance Europe's ability to deal with a complex and uncertain security environment. Or to promote \u201ca secure Europe in a better world\u201d, as the European Security Strategy put it. There is a clear need and an opportunity to work for that goal. It is what our citizens demand. And it is what the rest of the world increasingly expects. So I am pleased that every day our ability to contribute to global security is increasing: from the Balkans, to the Middle East, from Indonesia to Africa and elsewhere. But, every day, I also feel the frustration of knowing how much more we could do. If only we had a bit more political will and greater means at our disposal. The biggest change - and improvement - in recent years has been that we have become much more operational. We have more than ten operations underway as I speak. Some civilian, some military. All are proof of our comprehensive approach to tackling insecurity. But the more we do, the more we are asked to do. And for that we need the right tools to do the job. This is where the European Defence Agency comes in. The creation of the Agency has been an enormous step forward. Its main task is to support the member states in developing the capabilities they need for modern crisis management operations. Clearly, research and technology must be at the heart of its work programme. We all know that acquiring the right defence capability means many things. We need the right forces, the right doctrine, and the right equipment. But we also need to develop our technological base. That is why today's conference is so important. There are two impulses behind this conference. In the first place, it launches what should become an annual series of such meetings between the Agency and the European defence R&T community. But there is also a particular reason for today\u2019s event. As you know, at the Hampton Court Summit, European leaders asked me to come forward with ideas and proposals on how we can boost European defence research and technology. The short answer, it seems to me, is that we should spend more, spend better and spend more together. I will come back to this with more details in a minute. European Defence Ministers will focus on this challenge when they meet as the EDA\u2019s Steering Board in Innsbruck in early March. I am sure that today\u2019s debate will provide many ideas and proposals that will help us to prepare for that meeting. Why are we focusing so much on Research and Technology? The answer is simple: because it is the key to the transformation of our armed forces. As we move into the 21st century, we face a radically changed strategic environment. New threats and challenges, requiring new roles and new missions of our armed forces. Today's and tomorrow's operations are vastly different from what we planned for during the Cold War. Previously the aim was to unleash the maximum possible destructive power on opposing conventional forces. Now our operations must be characterised by restraint, precision, and the need to minimise the resultant damage. We are working under tight rules of engagement and 24-hour global scrutiny. In ambiguous circumstances, where the opponent will often be hard to identify and isolate. In everything we do, we must bring together civil and military instruments, and protect our own people as never before. This is a huge challenge. And of course technology is not all we need to transform our armed forces and the way they operate. But it will play a central role. Technology is also fundamental for the health of our European defence industry. We can debate just how much of that technology we should generate in Europe, for reasons of autonomy, and how far we can rely on the global market. But we clearly need much of it under our own hands. And for that we need a globally competitive European defence industry. Not only as a key part of our economies. But also as a fundamental contributor to the political consensus that supports the role of defence. But we will not sustain strong technological capabilities unless we invest in them. And there is now real concern that we are beginning to eat the seed-corn. It was natural that after the end of the Cold War, people expected a \u201cpeace dividend\u201d. But cutting back on Research and Technology has too often been seen as an easy option. Comparisons with the US are not always relevant. Still, we should all be concerned that the US now outspends Europe in defence Research and Development by a ratio of five to one. The budget of a single US agency, DARPA, stands at over $3 billion. This is more than the combined total of European expenditure on defence Research and Technology. Europeans do not lack the skills or the talent for innovation. A European invented the World Wide Web; Airbus stands as an exemplar of what we can do in aerospace when we work together. And Europe is strongly placed in many areas of civil technology. Increasingly these must be \u201cspun-in\u201d to defence. Mobile communications is an obvious example. But \u201cspin-in\u201d is no panacea. Especially not when Europe\u2019s wider research, development and innovation efforts are also stumbling. There is widespread recognition that current levels of European investment in research and development are insufficient. In the defence sphere, we can only meet the challenges we face if governments discuss and address them together with industry. For governments it may be a matter of strategy to remaining internationally competitive. For industry, it is a matter of survival. Ultimately, of course, the defence industry is there to meet the future needs of our armed forces, and not vice-versa. But in a world of ever-accelerating technological change, our military establishments cannot decide what they may want unless industry tells them what they could provide. So it is good to see so many companies represented here today \u2013 and to have Tom Enders, the current President of ASD, up here on the platform. So how can we bring about a step-change in our defence R&T efforts? I am convinced we must do three things: First, spend more. I know this is difficult in a world of tight national finances. But it is an imperative nonetheless. Where defence budgets as such cannot be increased, we must work on redeploying funds within those budgets. Manpower costs currently account for more than 50% of European defence spending. But do we really need more than two million men and women in uniform in Europe? Much of our defence infrastructure is duplicative - between countries and between governments and industry. So let us find savings from rationalisation, to increase the proportion of money spent on investment. Second, we must spend better, so that we get more output per euro spent. Above all, this requires a focus on key technologies of the future. Concretely, this means finding more flexible ways of doing business, particularly at the intergovernmental level. It also means looking at how we can embed new technologies quickly in existing platforms. And it involves matching the ever-shortening cycle times of the civilian world. We should also look at ways how we can harness the ingenuity of companies and universities that are not traditionally seen as part of the defence industry. The same goes for small and medium-sized firms which are often the source of innovation. Third, and perhaps most important, we must spend more together. This is a fundamental issue and the main raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the Agency. Last year, there was an excellent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. It reminded us that integrating Europe\u2019s defence efforts should no longer be seen as an interesting idea. It is an absolute necessity. Industry has urged that the proportion of R&T expenditure in Europe which is spent collaboratively should increase from the current level of less than 5% to 20%. I am convinced that they are right \u2013 and we must now, urgently, decide how best to achieve this aim. Some argue that it can be done by increasing the pace and scale of ad-hoc collaborations \u2013 the traditional approach, but done better. Others argue that this leaves cooperation at the mercy of different national budget cycles, and diverging national priorities. They stress that the necessary step-change will only come about if some funding is pooled, readily available for joint R&T endeavours. Following this logic, there are arguments for a substantial R&T budget for the Agency. This would certainly be one way. But there could be others. A joint European Defence R&T Fund, for example, managed within the Agency but controlled directly by its contributors. Personally, I think the principle of a joint fund matters more than the mechanism. And what matters even more is that we address the issue with urgency, and decide our way ahead. Let me make one final point. It is clear that the traditional boundaries between defence and the wider world of research and technology are disappearing. Technologies that the Commission will be promoting under its new programme for European Security Research may be indistinguishable from those we need for more conventional \u201cdefence\u201d purposes. We are already working with the Commission on software-defined radio, the next revolution in communications technology. As the respective agendas of EDA and the Commission\u2019s Security Research Programme take shape, we must work hand-in-hand to maximise synergies. I know G\u00fcnter Verheugen shares that ambition. Ladies and Gentlemen, let me close. In European defence we have made enormous progress in a short period of time. But to respond to growing demands and expectations we need more usable defence capability. And for that we need a step change in defence R & T. I wish you a productive and successful conference. And I look forward to hearing your views and suggestions on how we can, collectively, continue the success story of European defence and improve the contribution that defence R & T can make. Thank you very much. G\u00fcnter Verheugen - Vice President, European Commission Mr Chairman, Dear Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen, For the first time the European Commission, the European Defence Agency, industry and representatives from the Member States are meeting to discuss together a joint approach to security research. Some years ago this would not have been possible. I am happy to be invited to give an opening statement today, and I would like to thank the European Defence Agency for having taken this initiative. Why does security rank so high on the European political agenda today? And why, at Hampton Court, did heads of State and Government underline the importance of research and express the need for increased spending and more co-operation in this area? Europe is mostly known for its economic and social policies and identity, but Europe is also increasingly developing a security identity. The roots of this development can be found in the shocking security incidents that have occurred over the last few years notably in New York, Madrid, and London. The citizens of the European Union have a growing awareness of threats to their lives, their wealth, and their common values. Threats are global, so the solutions cannot only come from the Member States. Security solutions are expected on the national, European, and global levels. Our American friends have a very clear-cut political approach to security. For them, the notion of \u201chomeland security\u201d covers a wide range of areas and activities. The boundaries between \u201cInternal\u201d and \u201cexternal\u201d security are blurred under this single notion. For the European Union, the situation is more complex. It is the historical development of the European Union that established three different pillars of political decision making for different strands of \u201csecurity\u201d. We also find disperse responsibilities both on the European level as well as the Member States level. Thus the framework of security policies is very delicate. Nevertheless one has to realise that in real life, operations of the civil security sector and the military sector resemble each other \u2013 and increasingly so. Thus the current split of research domains appears sometimes artificial, especially when viewed at the technology level. However, the policy missions are different. There are several examples which make clear the dual or multiple use character of security technologies both in the civil and defence domain (like vehicles used for border control or the protection of infrastructures; or interoperability of secure communication systems). We have to join our forces. Both the Commission and EDA are currently working on long-term strategic research agendas for \u201ctheir\u201d security research domains. They bring together the end-users who define the strategic requirements, and the industrial community, who will be required to meet those requirements. The agendas need to define clear research and investment priorities. In research, we need innovative approaches, we need to avoid harmful research gaps and unnecessary duplication. What we need is co-ordination between the security research agendas. We also need a permanent dialogue between the demand and the supply side to shape this strategy and to make it operational. We need a dynamic balance between \u201cpull\u201d and \u201cpush\u201d. For the Commission, advice on this, and other issues, is the task of the European Security Research Advisory Board, which was established in order to guide the structure, content and priorities the future security research programme. I am pleased to say that on the European level interaction between the Commission and the European Defence Agency works in an excellent way by involving EDA staff in Commission working parties as well as vice versa. We will have two long-term security research agendas, but they will be related to each other. This will give more research value for the money. Apart from European level security research, a lot of research work of high relevance for the security domain is performed on the national level \u2013 with resulting overlaps and fragmentation. The Commission will make every effort to overcome this fragmentation. We need to co-ordinate not only between the civil and the defence-related security research domains but also between the national and the European level. No appropriate mechanism exists to undertake such co-ordination and this must be jointly developed over the coming months. Why? Because we need more co-ordination and more money for research. Civil Community security research in the future 7th Framework Programme will receive a significant budget allocation. Nevertheless, the Commission will by no means be in a position to cover all research needs with that budget. European security research will have to focus on issues of clear European added value compared to security research carried out in the Member States. The Community is not the \u201c26th Member State\u201d. An example for a security research mission area of clear European added value is the external border of the Union. After abolishing our internal borders, securing one particular part of the external borders of the Union is no longer the concern of one Member State alone, it is the concern and responsibility of all European citizens together. Hence it is the responsibility of the Community to invest into its protection. Promoting the required research into a border security mission area is the logical consequence. Another example may be the Trans European Networks (TEN), a joint European infrastructure which needs to be protected. Here again the Community has a responsibility. A new European security and defence policy is taking shape. It needs instruments. It needs an industrial network. And it needs a strong and competitive technology basis. Technology and research are not targets per se. They are instruments which serve political objectives. Technology itself cannot guarantee security but security without the support of technology is impossible. Europe is at the dawn of establishing its own security identity and security culture. No Member State will have to abandon part of its sovereign rights, but all Member States will have to contribute to building this European security culture together. While working on it, we must respect human rights and ethical values, which are part of our European heritage, identity and common values. We in the Commission are confident that our efforts will encourage others in pursuit of a more secure Europe in a more secure world. Being myself a member of the Steering Board of EDA, I intend to work hand in hand with the Agency on this great endeavour. Tom Enders President of ASD and CEO, EADS \u00a0 1. Introduction Good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen: It is good to be here with you this morning to discuss what we can do together for Europe, its security and its technological capabilities. Surely today\u2019s conference is a milestone for everybody working for the success of the European Defence Transformation. An effort that has started with the creation of the European Defence Agency. During 2005, the agency has successfully established itself. The approval for the \u201cVoluntary Regime for Defence Procurement\u201d is a first success. A good, though not in and by itself sufficient reform initiative. EDA now is trying to make 2006 the year of the \u201cparadigm shift\u201d in Defence R&T. An initiative I think we all should fully support. It is high time we get something done in this field. Because unfortunately, and if we are straightforward about it, the objectives that were spelled out in the Agency Charta are so far largely dead letters. Let us remind ourselves what the Agency\u2019s shareholders desire to achieve through EDA: Namely the enhancement of the effectiveness of European Defence Research and Technology (R&T), in particular by: Promoting research aimed at fulfilling future defence and security capability requirements, strengthening Europe's industrial and technological potential in this domain; promoting more effectively targeted joint defence R&T coordinating and planning joint research activities; catalysing defence R&T through studies and projects; managing defence R&T contracts; working in liaison with the Commission to maximise synergy between defence and civil or security related research programmes. I emphasize: these are dead letters still today, by-and-large. However, we all know very well: Europe must change the way it invests in future military capabilities. We must achieve significant gains in \u201cinvestment productivity\u201d. And the timing for this initiative could not be more appropriate, just as the European Union is preparing its civil research programme for the next 7 years. At the same time and not surprisingly, there are strong, entrenched ways of \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d. Entrenched ways of protecting perceived \u201cnational interests\u201d. You all know them \u2013 so I just briefly spell out a few examples: Almost intuitive 296-type behaviour: if an issue concerns defence it is by definition not a community subject. 17 years after the Berlin wall was dismantled another one has to come down in the European interest. Of course this will not happen, unless and until all Member States recognize the benefits that can be harvested by implementing a well-measured degree of mutual dependence. Little helpful also is the wide disparity of means attributed to defence investments across all Member States. It stands to reason that a disparity of effort does not foster the willingness to find cooperative arrangements. Furthermore, the EU today takes a much too cautious approach in harvesting the benefits of \u201cdual technologies\u201d And last but not least a lack of recognition that setting defence policies (be they R&T, industrial or commercial) has to be done in a holistic manner throughout Europe. Doing a little bit on the European level and the rest 25 times in an isolated national environment is a fig leaf (for change) that is too small to hide our deficiencies. Those are ways of thinking and acting that have to be overcome for the sake of achieving a common purpose. All in all as you can see, we are still confronting a major challenge. Yet we must be well aware: Failure will be fatal for Europe\u2019s political ambitions and our industrial competitiveness. Therefore failure is not an option. 2. Vision Which then are the pillars of the much-needed paradigm shift regarding defence R&T in Europe? I consider three issues to be of overriding importance: Establishing the necessary Policy Foundations Creating the Instruments for Implementation Setting Targets and monitoring their achievement As for the policy tools, despite ESDP, we are still lacking the policy foundations to provide the yardstick by which the efforts undertaken can be measured. What is it that I am aiming for? First, the worthy top-level goals of the European Defence & Security Policy have to be translated into more concrete requirements. Only such concrete requirements can serve as drivers for action in the different fields. The role of technology as a provider of superior security & defence related capabilities, i.e. as a means to fulfil the political requirements, has to be clearly expressed. Then R&T becomes a relevant ingredient of ESDP. Second, we need to generate a \u201cholistic\u201d space for R&T in Europe. This means we need to map our expenditures and capabilities at EU-level and at national level in a transparent and comprehensive fashion. Third, once the analytical part is done, a comprehensive Strategic Research Agenda has to be developed. This agenda should be based on a sound principle of European subsidiarity and spell out in a transparent way who takes responsibility for which part of the recommended R&T activities. Such an Agenda needs to be linked to clearly defined and expressed operational needs. Fourth, a coherent funding plan drawing from all relevant sources has to underpin the Strategic Research Agenda; it has to be embedded in legislation at EU and national level and it has to be enforceable! Fifth, a thorough determination of the required key technologies, through which Europe will ensure its strategic autonomy of action, must be achieved rapidly. Identification of existing means and capacities will then determine short to medium term needs as well as long term capability requirements. Sixth, Defence and Security Research have to be clearly identified and recognized as drivers of the \u201cLisbon objectives\u201dat the same level as other technological domains. While applications may be specific, technology is by-and-large generic. We should, I think, be as mature as our competitors on the world stage and stop \u201csegregating\u201d \u201cdual-use\u201d research (and we may have to find a better expression) as if it were a different domain. So much for the policies. Now, policies have to be accompanied by the right instruments for implementation. Let me offer you a few observations on four instruments I consider as especially important if we want to realize our vision. We need an EU-level Defence Science & Technology Board We need an EU-wide network of Technology experts We need a technology \u201cincubator\u201d to generate breakthrough approaches And we need an EU-wide network of commonly recognized Centres of Excellence The Defence Science & Technology Board should have the task to set the right objectives for EU defence technology research. It would be a group of high level, competent stakeholders, inspired by both ACARE that has been successfully setting the Strategic Agenda for European Research in civil aeronautics, and by the US Defence Science Board that has been playing such a major role in US technology policy. The network of European Technology Experts exists today; I am referring to EDA\u2019s CapTech Network. We might just need to adjust its effectiveness a little in order to provide the focused support necessary especially for the implementation of some short-term research objectives. As for the Technology Incubator the EU should consider institutionalizing an instrument to foster research in this area. A European derivative of the US DARPA could be such an instrument. Let us not forget DARPA has a USD 2bn budget for such upstream research. As of today, we cannot credibly claim to match such amounts \u2013 but we have to get going! Last but not least, Europe has to eventually start to rationalize its technological capabilities, avoid duplication and concentrate its resources on those research capabilities that are essential to sustain key technologies. I therefore suggest that discussion on the core network of Centres of Excellence around those key technologies begin immediately. Why should Members States not compete for locations of Centres of Excellence and obtain approval based on the attractiveness of conditions offered, like existing capabilities, future funding support, etc.? Probably each capability will necessitate its own technology support network throughout a number of Member States. Still, we should apply a clear lead nation principle here. Lastly, visions will stay just that if there are no targets set to turn them into reality. Therefore, as in the civil research domain, spending commitments must be the foundation for the Strategic Defence Research Agenda. Taking into account the level of subsidiarity in defence R&T spending, those targets must cover national and EU-level research spending in a coherent way. A couple of principles that come to (my) mind are the following: a.much effectiveness can be gained by investing in cooperation with other Member States; thus the majority of national spending in defence R&T should eventually be cooperative \u2013 way above the target of 20% cooperative spending we are discussing today. In substance, all R&T investments into domains that are commonly recognized as belonging to areas of \u201cEuropean deficits\u201d should be cooperative; if for various reasons one Nation decides to invest in these domains on a national level, they must be opened for cooperative approaches at a later stage. Let me recall for our benefit what was said when EDA was created: Europe needs to spend more on defence and spend better; if it continues to be difficult to spend more, spending better is the only alternative! And spending cooperatively on defence research is the only way to spend better in the absence of common spending. Another strong reason to do more jointly resides in the fact that, as you know, Research & Technology has been kept outside of the Voluntary Regime. The potential therefore exists that the present \u201cnational approach\u201d to R&T creates a distortionary effect on the Regime\u2019s operation, since there will not a \u201clevel playing field\u201d in defence procurement without more coordination and cooperation in R&T. b.As in other research areas (like aeronautics, space), common funding through a joint instrument is the most efficient way to ensure a future for European defence technological capabilities. The instrument to do this exists today, we know it all and I only have to refer you back to what the Agency Charta says about allowing ad-hoc/opt-in projects. Now EDA must get the means to assume its role in defence R&T. Here and there we hear that EDA should not be given budgets to invest in R&T because it does not have the credibility and capability to make the best use of public money. I fear, I do not understand the logic of this argument: the Member States as shareholders of EDA are in total control: if they do not transfer the adequate management capabilities together with the budgets and the responsibilities, EDA will forever stay an (almost) empty shell (like all its predecessors on the European scene) \u2013 now who\u2019s credibility is at stake? And since in my view this does simply not make sense, I propose in a first step to create a common EDA Research budget of say \u20ac50 million as soon as national budget procedures allow, but certainly not later as 2007. 3. Solutions How then can we start bridging the gulf that separates present day conditions from the vision laid out before? Modifying policies and agreeing them at the European level inevitably will take time. Time that we basically do not have. In order to advance in the short-term, EDA must get (back) on track with \u201cpromoting more effectively targeted joint defence R&T, drawing on the experience of relevant elements of the WEAG and the WEAO\u201d as the Joint Actions predicates. This is urgent and if it has to be done with only a streamlined CapTech process, so be it. We have recently seen interesting proposals being put on the table by the L.o.I. Research Directors; they should quickly be put into action. Moreover, we see the need for a top-level group. Let me call it \u201cGroup of Personalities Defence & Security\u201d with a reference to the approach that has been used previously for the European Security Research Programme. This group should be a \u201cpolicy-level\u201d precursor to the \u201cDefence Science & Technology Board\u201d that I suggested previously and should comprise decision makers from national governments, EU-level institutions and industry. Among its tasks should be the identification of short & medium term drivers for joint investments in defence research and top-level drivers for long-term R&T investments, among which should figure Investigating and establishing the relationship between technologies and threats (external/internal) Potential contributions of alternative and innovative funding instruments applicable to government-funded research A thorough analysis of and relevant proposals for an evolution of the institutional framework and structures under which defence research is conducted. This \u201cGoP Defence & Security\u201d could render its conclusions at the end of 2006 with initial implementation starting soon thereafter. Ladies and Gentlemen: At the beginning, I said: this conference will be a milestone towards a more efficient, more flourishing European defence R&T landscape. Can we achieve a breakthrough? That will very much be up to you. The issues that you will be debating have a direct bearing on realizing our vision. Let me now wish you a very successful conference day. And as always: a fruitful and \u2013why not \u2013 controversial debate of those issues will advance the European \u201cState of the Art\u201d.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2006/02/08/Research_Technology_Conference_-_Keynote_Speeches"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_1096", "date": "2005-11-21", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EU Governments Agree Voluntary Code for Cross-Border Competition in Defence Equipment Market", "text": " European Union Defence Ministers today agreed a voluntary Code of Conduct for defence procurement in order to encourage competition in the European defence equipment market, where contracts are currently exempt from normal EU internal market rules. At a meeting of the Steering Board of the European Defence Agency, Ministers decided that the new regime would cover contracts worth more than one million Euros and would take effect from 1 July, 2006. \u201cThis is a landmark decision\u201d said Javier Solana, the Head of the Agency, who chaired the meeting. \u201cIt will mean a better deal for European taxpayers, and for their armed forces. And it is a vital step for ensuring that our defence industries remain globally competitive.\u201d \u201cThe need for this breakthrough has been recognised for years \u2013 decades, even. I am delighted that we have got there in the EDA\u2019s first year of operation,\u201d he added. An EDA study earlier this year established that the majority of defence procurement by EU governments was done outside the framework of internal market rules on public procurement because of the exemption allowed under Article 346 of the TFEU establishing the European Community. Member States who subscribe to the new voluntary, inter-governmental regime will commit to maximising fair and equal opportunities for all suppliers based in other subscribing Member States by publicising procurement opportunities through a single online portal and setting transparent and objective criteria for selecting bidders and awarding contracts. The key principles underlying the code are transparency and mutual accountability: regular EDA data-collecting and reporting will allow all participants to satisfy themselves that the regime is working as intended and that all are moving forward together. Special attention will be given to small and medium sized enterprises. Assessing the first year of the Agency\u2019s operations, Ministers expressed satisfaction to see it up and running so quickly and starting to make a real difference. They noted that important advances have been achieved, such as today\u2019s decision on defence procurement -- one of the EDA\u2019s flagship projects for 2005 -- and an initiative to address Europe\u2019s capability shortfall in air-to-air refuelling. \u201cAs I reported to the Council of Ministers, the Agency has become an effective and credible instrument,\u201d Solana said. \u201cThe challenge is now to exploit its full potential and meet growing expectations, in particular to generate new collaborative investment projects.\u201d On another flagship \u2013 Command, Control and Communications (C3) \u2013 an important step forward was taken when Ministers agreed that the Agency should test the viability of a collective European approach to developing a next-generation Software Defined Radio (SDR) as a joint civil/military endeavour. SDR brings together computing and communications technologies and could eventually allow military radio systems that can securely deliver voice, data and video in a variety of different formats. It could enable forces to communicate at all levels and between all levels, the key to interoperability which is a crucial requirement for multi-national ESDP operations. Ministers also approved the EDA budget and the Work Programme for 2006. Work will continue on the 2005 flagship programmes, but much of the Agency\u2019s further work will flow organically from the systematic capability development processes now established by EDA. Some new areas will certainly be addressed, such as strategic lift, space-related capabilities and combat equipment for dismounted soldiers. In 2006 the Agency will also tackle some big strategic issues: developing a Long-Term Vision for European Capability and Capacity Needs; developing thinking on the Defence Technological and Industrial Base in Europe as one entity; and tackling the issue of defence R&T spending. Javier Solana, in his role as Secretary General of the Council of Ministers and High Representative, has been invited by EU Heads of State and Government to report to their December summit his first thoughts on a number of specific issues bearing on the European Security and Defence Policy, including how to raise levels of spending and collaborative spending on defence R&T, and ways of tackling key capability gaps.

Following their meeting in the European Defence Agency\u2019s Steering Board, the Ministers of 10 Member States (Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and Belgium and Portugal) issued the following joint announcement: \u201cInitiatives to build European air-to-air refuelling capabilities, whether in NATO or the EU, have not made the necessary progress in recent years, despite the efforts of some individual EU Member States. ESDP\u2019s new Headline Goal 2010, like the Helsinki Headline Goal before it, will fall short unless we can find a new approach to filling this key capability gap. At Javier Solana\u2019s initiative, therefore, we reviewed current air to air refuelling national capability plans. As a result of our discussion, we have decided to instruct our national staffs to work together, in an EDA-supported ad hoc group, to monitor current developments and consider possible new approaches to filling the capability gap.\u201d Background on Air-to-Air Refuelling The EU Headline Goal process has identified confirmed the importance of air-to-air refuelling (AAR) capability for European crisis-management operations. The current requirement is in the range of just over 70 strategic tankers. Six Member States contribute to this capability: the UK, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain. There is a major shortfall based on what is currently available or planned. The current contributions make up less than half the agreed requirement. The role of strategic tankers is growing while European fleets are getting older. Operations in the Balkans and Afghanistan have shown the importance of these assets. They have undertaken over 30% of the total flying sorties, ensuring that attack and support aircraft can get to and from their targets and enabling fighters to stay airborne to protect friendly civilian populations and military forces. All lessons identified from recent operations have highlighted AAR assets as a \u2018force multiplier\u2019 - allowing more efficient and effective use of expensive and scarce fighter and attack aircraft within the theatre of operations. There are currently European based initiatives in the UK, Germany and Italy. Germany is taking delivery of 4 converted A-310 aircraft and Italy is acquiring 4 new KC 767 to replace their ageing B707TTs. In both initiatives the aircraft will be configured to be Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) capable. The UK is currently in contractual negotiations to provide a replacement to their VC-10 and Tristar aircraft through a Public Finance Initiative (PFI) solution. The European Capability Action Plan (ECAP) and NATO\u2019s Prague Commitment Conference (PCC) have considered various ways forward. The new initiative co-ordinated by the EDA will enable Member States who are willing to commit resources to adopt a more integrated and comprehensive approach to remedying the shortfall. For example, a way forward incorporating the MRTT principle, providing a significant transport capability (both cargo and personnel), could address another significant ESDP capability shortfall - strategic airlift - for both intensive combat situations and in support of civilian operations such as humanitarian assistance. The EDA co-ordinated Ad Hoc Project Team will examine the UK Private Financing Initiative (PFI) model. This considers the provision of a \u2018capability service\u2019 - airborne refuelling stations supplied by a commercial consortium - rather than a classical procurement of aircraft. But it will also review other acquisition options, such as joint procurement, and look at such approaches as pooling of assets.

The purpose of the Code is to inject transparency and competition into defence procurement, an area where, on the basis of the application of Article 296 of the EC Treaty, a majority of defence contracts are currently exempt from cross-border competition. Why does this matter? No EU country can any longer sustain a national Defence Technological and Industrial Base (DTIB) to meet all of its needs. An open market is a vital instrument for the long-term competitiveness and strength of the European DTIB, and a fundamental aspect of support for the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). When will the Code come into effect? Ministers agreed to implement the Code from 1 July 2006. How many EU Member States will be covered by it? The 24 European Defence Agency (EDA) participating Member States (pMS) (all EU members except Denmark) have until 30 April 2006 to decide whether or not to participate. What kind of defence contracts are covered by the Code? All defence procurement contracts, except those specifically excluded from the Code, with a value of at least one million Euros, for which the conditions for application of Article 346 of the TFEU are met. Is anything excluded from the Code? Some areas will be excluded from the Code: procurements of chemical, bacteriological and radiological goods and services, nuclear weapons and nuclear propulsion systems and cryptographic equipment. Some others, exceptionally and for obvious reasons, might not follow the rules of the Code: cases of pressing operational urgency, follow-on work or supplementary goods and services and for extraordinary and compelling reasons of national security. In these exceptional cases, an explanation must be provided to the EDA, in its capacity as monitor of the regime. How exactly will procurement contracts covered by the Code now work? All relevant new defence procurement opportunities will be published on a single online portal operated by the Agency. Fair and equal treatment of all companies will be assured through evaluation of the offers on the basis of transparent and objective standards. The fundamental criterion for the selection of the contractor will be the most economically advantageous solution for a particular requirement, taking into account, among other things, considerations such as compliance, costs (both acquisition and life cycle), and security of supply. What role will the EDA play in implementing the Code? The EDA will act as an instrument of the subscribing Member States to monitor the implementation of the Code and to report back to the Agency Steering Board on its achievements and make proposals for improvements. If the Code is not legally-binding, why will it have any effect? The Code of Conduct will operate on the basis of sovereign Member States voluntarily choosing to align their policies and practices, on a reciprocal basis. Regular reports by the EDA will help to show whether the Code is being interpreted and implemented on a uniform basis and, if not, why not. That will allow for \u201cpeer pressure\u201d to be exercised. How is this related to the work of the European Commission on the defence equipment market? The EDA welcomed in March of this year the efforts of the Commission through their Green Paper on Defence Procurement, as it identifies a number of important reasons for the creation of a European Defence Equipment Market (EDEM) and it illustrates the limits of the existing legal framework. The Commission is now in the process of analysing the responses to its questionnaire with regard to the two proposed community instruments -- an interpretative Communication and a Directive \u2013 which the Agency considers as complementary actions to the Code. Does this mean that non-EU firms will not be able to compete for EU defence contracts? There is nothing in this plan about \u201cEuropean preference\u201d, or denying access to any third party defence companies. The aim is to get each Member State to accept bids to satisfy its defence equipment requirements from other EU countries, and then to evaluate them on a par with bids from its own national suppliers. Whether the Member State concerned also wishes to invite any third-party to a competition will remain entirely a matter for the individual Member State to decide. How can governments be sure that supplies are secure if contracts are won by companies in other EU Member States? The Code includes within its key principles the idea of mutual support: in return for the privilege of improved opportunities to sell into each others\u2019 defence markets, there is a reciprocal obligation to do everything possible, consistent with national legislation and international obligations, to ensure, assist and expedite each others\u2019 contracted defence requirements. The full effective operation of the regime will depend on strong mutual confidence and interdependence and each government will work to improve the predictability and dependability of its regulations and policies. They will also support efforts to simplify amongst them intra-community transfers and transits of defence goods and services. The Agency has been tasked to work further on Security of Supply and to present for adoption roadmaps for this work to the next meeting of the EDA Steering Board in National Armaments Directors formation. How will small companies and the defence industries of smaller Member States benefit from the Code? The Code recognises, as part of the key principle of mutual benefit, that an important part of this benefit is the expansion of opportunities for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) from across Europe to sell into a continental-scale market. The Code will seek to ensure that fair competition and the benefits of the regime are driven down the supply chain. The Steering Board has also directed the Agency to develop a Code of Best Practice in the Supply Chain to ensure fair opportunities, especially for SMEs, for adoption at the same time as implementation of the regime and as an integral part of it. The Code of Best Practice will be about influencing behaviour through improving the quality, effectiveness and efficiency of supply chain relationships. It will enhance opportunities for specialist companies, in particular SMEs. It will also provide for appropriate benchmarking and observance and will be regarded as complementary to any similar codes that may apply at national level. Will additional initiatives be developed to support the regime? The Steering Board has directed the Agency to work further with participating Member States and other stakeholders to keep the operation of the regime under continuous review, to consider adaptation and possible expansion of the regime and to pursue progressively closer alignment of participating Member States policies and practices over time. In particular, the Agency has been tasked to work on security of supply, harmonisation of offset requirements at a European level and on common minimum standards for the security of information, and to present roadmaps for this work for adoption at the next meeting of the Steering Board in National Armaments Directors formation.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2005/11/20/Q_A_on_European_Defence_Equipment_Market"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_1099", "date": "2005-11-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA's Witney Says Main EU Defence Actors Share Commitment to Transformation Agenda", "text": " The main actors in European Union defence have a shared commitment to enhancing global security and the safety of EU citizens by working together to transform Europe's military forces to meet the new threats of the future, EDA Chief Executive Nick Witney said today. In a speech to the \"D\u00e9fense 2006\" Economist Conference in Paris, Witney said the different roles of industry, national governments, the European Commission and the EDA mattered much less than the fact that they had a common agenda. \"Not only that, but there is a high degree of mutual interdependence \u2013 we are trying to climb the same mountain and we are all roped together,\" Witney said. ROLE OF THE DIFFERENT ACTORS: INDUSTRY, NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS, EUROPEAN COMMISSION, EUROPEAN DEFENCE AGENCY Economist Conference \u2013 \u201c D\u00e9fense 2006\u201d Paris, 29 November 2005 - Nick Witney, EDA Chief Executive - Not for the first time, when I began last week to prepare for this event, I was taken aback to see the subject which I had earlier, in a moment of inattention, committed myself to address. I can speak with authority on the role of the European Defence Agency; and, having worked in part of one for a number of years, I can say at least something about the role of national governments. As for the Commission, as a relative newcomer to Brussels, I am still learning to understand this large, powerful, and many-faceted institution. And when it comes to industry \u2013 well, who am I to attempt to lecture the people in this room about their role in European defence? But a commitment is a commitment, and you evidently wanted someone to address this topic of the roles of the different actors, so let me at least try. I will begin with something extremely simplistic, since I think it is interesting to look at the simple picture and work out what is wrong with it. The simple account would begin by straight-forwardly ruling out the Commission from further consideration. Defence is, in the jargon, not a Commission competence. Indeed, defence is an area where the Member States have consistently declined to pool any part of their national sovereignty, or to cede any power of proposal or decision to the Brussels institutions, whether Commission or European Parliament. The only institution that \u201cdoes defence\u201d in Brussels is the Council, where Member States meet and decide what they may be prepared to cooperate on, and what they are not. So it is national governments who are in the driving seat on defence \u2013 and they have decided to create the European Defence Agency, as an agency of the Council, to be their instrument or tool for taking forward what they begin to sense must be, increasingly, their shared agendas. So the simple account is that the interests of the Agency are identical with those of the Member States, and that the Agency\u2019s role is to do what the Member States want it to do. Governments want security and prosperity for their citizens. As one aspect of security, they want capable and well-equipped armed forces, at the minimum possible cost. They can always think of better things to do with their revenues than to increase defence budgets. As for prosperity, they want jobs, and the technology that breeds the jobs of the future. Some have large defence industries, important to the national economy, and adopt various routes to foster or, one might even say, protect them \u2013 routes that may not necessarily run through defence ministries. Finally, industry. I suppose \u2013 you will tell me if I am wrong \u2013 that what the industry side wants is to run successful, profitable businesses, with full order books today and the prospect of being able to achieve full order books tomorrow. For many, this means staying, or becoming, internationally competitive. So that is the simple picture \u2013 and you only have to enunciate it to realise that the world is not actually quite like that. Let us start again with the Commission. Like national governments, they too are interested in the security and prosperity of people \u2013 all the people of Europe. They are fully aware of the importance of the defence sector to the wider economy of Europe, and to the ambitious but necessary aim of ensuring Europe\u2019s future as a knowledge-based economy. They also have money to spend, lots of it \u2013 and plan in the years ahead to spend substantially increased amounts on space and security research. I have heard security research distinguished from defence research in a variety of different ways. But I think the fundamental difference is really who controls the money \u2013 in the case of defence research, national defence ministries, in the case of security research other national authorities and now, too, the Commission. Turning to where the Agency fits in, it is certainly true that the Agency\u2019s job is to do what Defence Ministers want. But the 24 of them working together in the Agency do not always want quite the same thing. Nor do they necessarily want it consistently. On Monday they may be very clear. On Tuesday they may be confronted with a conflicting priority, which can dilute the desire. And then, of course, defence ministries, like the rest of national governments, are human enterprises. So the Minister may want it, the State Secretary may feel lukewarm about, and somewhere down the hierarchy there may be the one colonel who truly understands the subject and happens not to want it all. So you could describe the Agency\u2019s job as to find things that the Defence Ministers, all or some, will embrace on their ambitious days, and then to pursue such agendas on their behalf with insistency, indeed impatience. This is what I mean when I refer to the Agency\u2019s role as a conscience and catalyst. None of this, of course, alters the ineluctable fact that decision-making power, and the money, rests with the 24 defence ministries. Nor, I suppose \u2013 pursuing my theme of why the simple account does not quite work - is the industry a typical supplier. It is sometimes owned, or part owned, by the national governments, who are also its main customer. Governments then control to whom the industry is allowed to sell what it does not sell to them. And the same government may often have to provide the initial investment funding if the relevant project is to be economically viable. A further complication is to know what the industry is. Clearly, it is the big prime contractors. But, these days, it may also be a computing or telecommunications specialist. It may be the small Slovenian plastics company which happens to be the European market leader in masts for sailboards, and is using its skills for some interesting work on ballistic protection. So, what do I conclude from this rather inadequate survey? First, that roles matter less than agendas; and that there is actually a very large degree of congruence between the agendas of all the different actors. Not only that, but there is a high degree of mutual interdependence \u2013 we are trying to climb the same mountain and we are all roped together. Let me try and be a bit more specific about where I see the commonality of agendas: First, we all want to see a Europe that is an effective and credible actor on the international stage, contributing to global security and ensuring the safety of its citizens; But, second, we all recognise the continuing gap between that ambition and our actual collective military capabilities \u2013 a gap which some may argue results from under-funding, but which I tend to believe has much more to do with the ineffective use we make of the \u20ac180 billion that the European Member States collectively spend each year on defence. Third, we all recognise that the solution lies through pursuing what is called the transformation agenda \u2013 accepting that the world and the nature of the operations in which our armed forces will in future be engaged have fundamentally changed, and spending our money on addressing the threats of the future rather than sustaining the legacies of the past. Fourth, we all recognise that transformation is necessary, but not sufficient \u2013 that Europeans need also increasingly to pool their efforts and resources. This is an operational imperative; the future is multinational, deployed operations, and the more commonality we can achieve in the equipment and systems we use the more effective and safer our service men and women will be. It is also an economic imperative \u2013 we simply can no longer afford the duplication entailed in each national military staff deciding upon a different way to meet fundamentally the same requirement, and running separate national programmes. And the supplier is feeling the pinch as much as the customer; no national defence budget in Europe is any longer big enough to sustain a comprehensive set of defence industrial capabilities on a national basis. So \u2013 fifth - we must achieve convergence on the demand side of the defence business \u2013 more collaborative spending, offering contracting opportunities to industry on a scale which makes economic sense, and which may often be needed to support or precipitate the process of industrial restructuring. Because, although much consolidation has already taken place in the European defence industry over the last decade, there is more to do \u2013 something which in its turn requires governments to recognise that it is no longer good enough to think just in terms of the national defence technological and industrial base, and that we must all start to think about the European industrial base as an entity in its own right. We need to work our way forwards on the principles of eliminating duplication, recognising and building upon specialist strengths and centres of excellence, and accepting the greater degree of mutual interdependence which this will entail. Then \u2013 sixth - if we must think increasingly of the demand side and the supply side in continental terms, then so too must we think of the market. So I am particularly pleased that we were able, one week ago, to achieve the agreement of our 24 Defence Ministers to take a long stride down the road of liberalising defence trade in Europe. From time immemorial, the bulk of national defence procurement has been sheltered from external competition. Certainly, since the foundation of the European Union, the usual rules of the internal market have been dis-applied to most defence procurement. Now, the 24 Member States cooperating in the Agency have agreed to invite bids from industries based in each others\u2019 territories as well as from national suppliers, and to treat all bids on a fair and equal basis. This is a voluntary regime, based on a code of conduct. It still allows exceptions, in certain defined categories \u2013 and it will no doubt take time before the in-built mutual accountability and transparency, delivered by a reporting and monitoring system, ensure that the Code operates in a fully effective and consistent fashion. But the key point is this \u2013 that, for as long as anyone can remember, the default assumption has been that governments would source their defence needs from their own territories if at all possible \u2013 and now, for the first time ever, there will be a presumption that the great bulk of defence procurement will be open to bids on a Europe-wide basis. I see this as a landmark decision, which over time should deliver not only the familiar benefits of competition \u2013 value for money, and stimulus to innovate \u2013 but will also inject an invaluable dynamic which can only assist the process of industrial restructuring to which I referred earlier. Nor will it do any harm at all that the Commission, with European Parliament support, will continue to patrol the borderline between the normal internal market and defence procurement under our Code, seeking to ensure that the application of internal market rules is as wide as it reasonably can be. My final, and seventh, point, where I think all can agree \u2013 and that is the need to find ways to devote more of our scarce defence resources to investment, and investment in R&T in particular. Today, more than half of the \u20ac180 billion to which I alluded earlier goes on personnel costs \u2013 the costs of keeping two million men and women in uniform. This situation is unsustainable, for various reasons \u2013 including the demographic trends, which indicate that in future the recruits will simply not be there. Today, it squeezes the resources available for our investments, in particular on research and technology. Yet R&T is the seed corn of the future. How can European industries remain internationally competitive when we are outspent by the US on R&D by a ratio of five to one? Some three weeks ago, at the informal summit held at Hampton Court in London, the European Heads of State and Government recognised the challenge \u2013 the challenge to invest more, and invest more collectively. And they tasked my boss, Javier Solana, to report back to them when they meet again in Brussels in mid-December with some \u201cinitial orientations\u201d on how this problem might be tackled during the Austrian Presidency. That means by the early summer of next year. So, I will close by noting that, if the issue of opening the defence market within Europe has been the particular preoccupation of the EDA during the early months of its life, we can now look forward to addressing the R&T agenda with equal intensity in the early months of the coming year. And I would very much encourage anybody here who has ideas to contribute to the debate to offer them today, or to send me an e-mail. Catching the attention of the Heads of State and Government is not an opportunity that comes around very often \u2013 so we must make sure that we make maximum use of it.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2005/11/28/EDA_s_Witney_Says_Main_EU_Defence_Actors_Share_Commitment_to_Transformation_Agenda"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_1100", "date": "2005-10-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EDA Steering Board Reviews Agency's Plans for 2006", "text": " European Union Defence Ministers agreed today that spending on defence-related Research & Technology needs to increase and to be more effective through greater collaboration between EU countries. At a meeting of the Steering Board of the European Defence Agency at RAF Lyneham in the United Kingdom, the Ministers reviewed the Agency\u2019s plans for 2006. Ministers agreed that the Agency should move into launching ad-hoc projects as soon as possible. Ministers witnessed a demonstration of U.K. air-to-air refuelling capabilities and 10 countries issued a statement announcing that they had agreed to create an ad hoc group, supported by the EDA, to consider possible new approaches to solving the EU\u2019s shortfall. \u201cI very much welcome this step. It is a good example of the way forward\u201d said Javier Solana, Head of European Defence Agency. \u201cWe need more projects like this to address the military shortfalls which are still there in many areas, six years after the start of the European Security and Defence Policy. We need commitments to allocate resources. We need multinational initiatives in smaller or larger groups,\u201d he added. The ministers also reviewed the principles for a voluntary to bring more cross-border competition in the European Defence Equipment Market and confirmed their commitment to take a final decision on the initiative at their Steering Board meeting next month. The Steering Board considered moves to rationalise testing and evaluation of defence equipment, where there may be scope for significant savings by creating centres of excellence in specific technologies in different EU states, and said such work should be pursued energetically.

The Steering Board, the decision-making body of the Agency on which the 24 participating Member States and the European Commission are represented, was meeting for the first time in \u201cCapabilities\u201d formation, involving national Capabilities and Defence Planning Directors. \u201cThis community is crucial to the work of the Agency because of our role in determining the speed and direction of transformation and defence reform in each nation, and the priorities for defence expenditure,\u201d said Lo Casteleijn, Director of the General Policy Directorate of the Defence Ministry of the Netherlands, who chaired the meeting on behalf of the Head of the Agency, Javier Solana, know what we have today and are already planning to acquire, and then work together to address the gaps,\u201d he added. The Steering Board reviewed the Agency's proposals for a way of working which will ensure that the future needs of ESDP operations provide the main orientation for all EDA activity. This innovative \"matrix\" approach will marry military priorities to industrial and technological possibilities to ensure that Europe's future military needs are addressed in a comprehensive, systematic and realistic fashion. It also ties together the Agency's different agendas, covering military capabilities, armaments programmes, research and technology and the strengthening of Europe\u2019s defence industries. Central to this approach will be the use of integrated development and project teams, bringing together military, armaments and research expertise from within the Agency and from a wider community of stakeholders, including industry. More specifically, the Steering Board discussed initial priorities for the Agency's R&T agenda, laying particular stress on the importance for future operations of minimising casualties. \u201cWe must focus our research efforts on the technologies that our crisis-management operations will require in the future,\u201d said Nick Witney, Chief Executive of the Agency. \u201cWe need to look at whatever technology can offer to improve force protection and to limit the damage, human or material, of military operations which will often be conducted among civilian population.\u201d The Board also approved a wide-ranging agenda for the Agency in the critical area of Command, Control and Communication (C3), one of the Agency\u2019s four flagship programmes for its first full year of operations. This agenda includes: work on improving the capacity, security and interoperability of communications for ESDP operations, starting with the battle groups which are at the heart of the EU\u2019s future plans; work to converge European thinking on how best to apply the concepts of network-enabled operations to the context of crisis-management operations; the pursuit of European convergence and cooperation on the emerging technologies of software defined radio.", "url": "https://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/press-centre/2005/06/20/Steering_Board_Sets_Direction_for_Agency_s_Efforts_to_Build_European_Defence_Capabilities"}, {"id": "EDA_NEWS_1103", "date": "2005-04-22", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "European Defence Agency Steering Board Agrees Transfer of WEAG/WEAO Activities to EDA", "text": " The Steering Board of the European Defence Agency agreed today on the aim that the Agency should gradually take over the activities, in particular those covering Research & Technology, of the Western European Armaments Group (WEAG) and the Western European Armaments Organisation (WEAO).

Member States have already agreed to close WEAG from next month and the Steering Board agreed on the need for early complementary legal decisions within WEAO by the Member States concerned to allow the transfer of its functions to the EDA. The Steering Board decided that the EDA should aim to take over the relevant activities of WEAG and WEAO progressively during 2005 and the first quarter of 2006, when additional resources should be available to EDA to handle transferred contracts. \u201cAbsorbing the work of WEAG and WEAO into the EDA will give R&T collaboration a much stronger political impulse,\u201d said EDA Chief Executive Nick Witney. The Steering Board also approved a set of principles governing the Agency\u2019s Research & Technology functions, including plans to establish networks of experts from governments, research centres, industry and international bodies to collaborate in specific areas. The \u201coperational concept\u201d for R&T defines the operating principles and internal organisation which will allow the Agency to absorb existing valuable activities such as those from WEAG and WEAO, manage future collaborative projects, put R&T contracts to industry, monitor progress and allow the Steering Board to define and oversee a European defence R&T strategy. \u201cThe R&T Directors emphasized their commitment to supporting the work of the Agency in this field and intend to remain closely involved in it,\u201d Ellinger said. The Steering Board also reviewed the Agency\u2019s work to date on the technology required for Long Endurance Unmanned Air Vehicles for intelligence and surveillance, one of the Agency\u2019s four flagship projects for 2005. The aim is to encourage collaboration within the European industry to demonstrate the technologies required for such UAVs. \u201cThere are three major and at least five smaller national programmes under way in this area within the EU,\u201d said Witney. \u201cBy studying some of the critical technology elements for UAVs together at a European level, we can ensure that research money is spent in the most effective way \u2013 one of the central aims of the Agency.\u201d The Steering Board also heard a presentation from the European Commission on the European security research programme, part of the 7th Framework Research Programme.

We: noted with approval that the Agency remains on track to achieve \"functioning\" status by the end of the year; agreed the Agency's first annual budget - some \u20ac 20 million - which will allow the Agency to grow to 77 personnel in the first half of next year; agreed the Agency's first annual work programme. This work programme constitutes an ambitious programme that should maintain the momentum of the EDA initiative, and reflects the Steering Board's determination that the Agency should make a real difference.\" 3. The agreed work programme is annexed. In agreeing it, the Steering Board identified in particular four \"flagship\" endeavours for the Agency's four main directorates in the year ahead, as follows: Capabilities Directorate. Command, control and communications (C3): precise direction of the work to be defined by joint study between the EDA Capabilities Directorate and the EU Military Staff - but focussed in particular on adequacy of communications for command and control, and interoperability. R & T Directorate. Preparing and launching, as an \"ad hoc\" or opt-in project, technology demonstration for long-endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Armaments Directorate. Investigation of the armoured fighting vehicle sector, aiming at convergence of requirements, programmes, and (potentially) industries. Industry/Market Directorate. European Defence Equipment Market: exploring both the options that the Commission - with their Green Paper on Defence procurement - have put forward, and possible initiatives that the Agency might take. 4. In connection with this last point, the Steering Board took the opportunity to initiate immediate work on defence market issues, as set out in the Conclusions attached to this release. 5. Finally, as the Agency Establishment Team approaches the end of its mandate, the Steering Board repeated its thanks to all involved for a job well done. Steering Board Conclusions on the Commission Green Paper on defence procurement The Steering Board: Welcomed the important and timely initiative of the European Commission on issuing a Green Paper on defence procurement; Recognised the benefits of harmonising defence procurement procedures amongst the EU Member States with a view to reducing the fragmentation of European markets and thus encouraging the creation of an internationally competitive European Defence Equipment Market (EDEM), including a strong Defence Technological and Industrial Base. The Steering Board expressed its full support for these goals, and reaffirmed the role of the Agency in contributing to their achievement as specified in the Joint Action establishing the EDA; Directed the Agency to work in partnership with the Commission on these issues, exploring both the ideas the Commission have put forward, and possible initiatives that the Agency might take directed to the shared goals; Invited the Agency to report back to the Steering Board - in National Armaments Directors formation in early 2005, with proposals for a Steering Board position as an initial input to the Commission's consultation process and for pursuing the Agency's own work on the EDEM agenda; Expressed its wish that the Commission work closely with the Agency and take into account the Steering Board's position on the EDEM agenda when developing its conclusions.
