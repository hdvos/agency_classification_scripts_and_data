CEDEFOP_NEWS_0001	2020-07-13	NEWS	Apprenticeships for adults bring good jobs for people, skills for businesses	 Apprenticeships for adults are one of the policy solutions to the need for supporting adults willing to train, while broadening the skills base of the working population across Europe. According to Cedefop estimates, there are around 128 million adults with potential for upskilling or reskilling in the European Union. At the same time, in countries with long apprenticeship tradition, such as Germany or Austria, the number of companies providing apprenticeships and of young people looking for them has been falling. In response, EU Member States have decided to open apprenticeships to adults by removing age limits and by making them more flexible. Unlike young people taking up apprenticeships, adults have life responsibilities (such as a family) which are not always compatible with typical apprenticeship provision (such as schooling hours). These same responsibilities, however, can make them highly motivated and reliable apprentices. Many adults also possess skills and work experience. To take this into account, countries have increasingly been offering skills assessments, shortened apprenticeships or even the possibility to sit directly for an apprenticeship exam. Whatever the context, guidance is crucial: adults need to be well prepared to take up an apprenticeship. Read more in our latest briefing note.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0002	2020-07-01	NEWS	Planning the next steps for vocational education and training in Europe	 The post-2020 European policy framework on vocational education and training (VET) was discussed at the high-level joint Cedefop/ETF virtual conference ‘Enhancing European cooperation in VET: looking back – planning ahead’, on 30 June and 1 July. Over 190 experts, stakeholders, European Commission, government and social partner representatives joined forces to debate the role and future of VET at a time of unprecedented challenge due to the coronavirus pandemic. Among the speakers were European Commission Vice President Margaritis Schinas, European Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights Nicolas Schmit, the Croatian Minister for Science and Education Βlaženka Divjak, the German Federal Minister for Education and Research Anja Karliczek, and the Greek Minister for Education and Religious Affairs Niki Kerameus. Starting with the results of the two EU agencies’ monitoring of the 2015-20 cycle of cooperation on VET – the Riga process – discussions focused on how the lessons learned can be applied to meet the challenges of, and make the most of the opportunities for, VET in the next decade. The debate was supported by a joint Cedefop/ETF discussion paper prepared to inform the next steps in VET policy-making at EU level. The conference highlighted that current economic and societal changes – digitalisation, green deal, demographic shifts, economic uncertainty – place VET in the foreground as a flexible means of preparing people for a changing world of work. Continuing VET (CVET) is critical for upskilling and reskilling EU citizens and creating a dynamic workforce, ready to respond to the economic and societal challenges ahead, and allow a smooth transition to a digital and greener economy. Cedefop Executive Director Jürgen Siebel said: ‘While further developing initial VET should remain an essential aim, European policy needs to strengthen CVET to ensure that the new job opportunities created by the transformations of the economy will outstrip job displacement. […] Policy efforts and cooperation should continue toward a “European VET area”, adopting a forward-looking perspective and ensuring attractive, inclusive and relevant initial VET systems for both learners and companies.’ ETF Director Cesare Onestini said: ‘Our work with countries in the neighbourhood of the EU shows that they share the same aspirations as EU Members to put human capital development at the core of their growth and prosperity agendas. As a reaction to the pandemic crisis we see some promising responses but also challenging trends, and the need to focus further on promoting training for excellence and inclusion: a key leverage towards economic development.’ In his address at the conference, Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights Nicolas Schmit announced the European Commission’s new proposal for a Council recommendation on vocational education and training, including a package of initiatives to support youth employment and skills policies. He said that this recommendation ‘will go beyond supporting young people; it is also about encouraging adults in employment for 15 or 20 years to keep learning and change careers without necessarily following long degrees.’ He also complimented Cedefop and ETF on the quality of their work, which he described as ‘a real goldmine to tap into’. In the closing session, European Commission Vice President Margaritis Schinas said that the Commission’s new package of initiatives is novel, ambitious, measurable and inclusive, adding: ‘We all agree that this is a moment we can proclaim that Europe badly needs a skills revolution. Cedefop and ETF's contribution to the initiatives will be crucial. People must be better informed of the skills that will be trending tomorrow and be geared towards targeted training. I hope the two agencies will keep helping us to put VET higher on the agenda and bring about the skills revolution.’ Notes to editors Read the findings of the monitoring exercise of the Riga process in the joint Cedefop/ETF publication: Enhancing European cooperation in VET: outcomes of the Riga cycle.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0005	2020-03-11	NEWS	Towards better skills systems – Cedefop’s 2020 European skills index release	 Cedefop has just released the 2020 European skills index (ESI), which showcases the skills systems’ improvements made since its 2018 edition,  including areas that merit further attention in each country. Cedefop Executive Director Jürgen Siebel notes: ‘The European skills index is a tool designed to help the implementation of the European pillar of social rights. For an efficient skills system, it is important not only to develop skills appropriately, but also to ensure a good transition from education to work and appropriate matching of the skills acquired to those needed in the workplace.’ The new release includes 31 countries: EU-27, the UK, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. Cedefop expert Ilias Livanos points out that ‘the skills system is a cornerstone to the development and growth of each country, as it is a means towards individuals’ development and wellbeing.’ Cedefop created the ESI to help countries observe over time where they stand with respect to their skills systems, how they are doing in comparison to each other, what the areas with room for improvement are, and where to look for best practices. Czechia scores highest in the 2020 European skills index, followed by Finland, Slovenia, Luxembourg and Estonia in the top five. Italy is the lowest scoring country. Czechia scores a total of 77/100, which means that, even if it has the best skills system in Europe, there is still a long way to go to reach perfection. Czechia ranks only 10th and 13th in skills development and activation respectively, but scores first in skills matching. This example highlights the importance of skills matching to achieve a well-functioning system. Sweden, ranking third in 2018, has now gone down to sixth place, due to poorer performance in skills matching. In general, there seems to be an improvement of the skills system in the EU over time. In 2020 half of the countries achieved a total score above 63/100, while in 2018 this number was 1 in 4 countries. Most of the southern Europe and Balkan countries, with the prominent exception of Slovenia, should increase their efforts further, as they remain low in the ranking. Cedefop’s ReferNet network will provide further assistance in 2020 in monitoring progress and highlighting areas in need of improvement,. Notes to editors The ESI is built on three pillars: skills development, skills activation and skills matching. These pillars are divided into six sub-pillars and into 15 measurable indicators that are closely related to policy monitoring and questions. The overall skills system performance is summarised by the ESI score by country. The ESI takes values between 0 and 100, where 100 stands for maximum performance. An independent statistical audit by the Joint Research Centre before new results are released ensures its methodological soundness. More information about the ESI in Cedefop’s briefing note, website, flyer, publication and the Skills Panorama website.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0007	2019-11-13	NEWS	Not just new jobs – digital innovation supports careers	 It is widely accepted that digital innovation is changing work environments and occupational profiles, impacting on people’s learning and work. But how does it affect the way people can manage their careers, train and change jobs? Thanks to innovative tools, greater data availability and artificial intelligence, new approaches to career development support and self-directed learning are transforming lifelong learning. Online job portals offer information on occupations and learning opportunities combined with personal skills and attitudes assessment as well as personal portfolios. Many include matching engines, linking personal traits and skills to advertised vacancies and allowing people to draft their CVs and apply for jobs. Other portals boast new features such as online chats which have become particularly popular with young people. Even gaming has entered the world of online career support, helping people to better identify their existing skills and possible gaps. Cedefop has been looking into European countries’ most recent practices in this field and has analysed the promises and challenges they hold. Read more in our latest briefing note.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0009	2019-10-31	NEWS	Vocational education and training in Cyprus: tell me more about it	 People in Cyprus are positive about vocational education and training (VET), but most are not attracted to it as a learning option. According to Cedefop’s survey about EU citizens’ opinions on VET for those aged 16-18, 67% of Cyprus respondents believe that VET has a positive image. Some 88% believe that it strengthens the economy and 81% that it helps reduce unemployment. VET students in Cyprus are also, generally, more satisfied than participants in general education. Some 78% of upper-secondary VET participants said they were totally satisfied overall with the quality of teaching they received, the general and work-related skills they acquired and the equipment available; this compares with only 44% of general education participants (see Figure). Source: Cedefop’s VET opinion survey. Further, 94% of Cyprus respondents agree that VET students acquire skills needed by employers. VET in Cyprus is not seen as a dead end; 71% of respondents, well above the EU average of 54%, agree that it is easy to continue into higher education, including university, after upper secondary VET. Despite these positive views, participation in upper secondary VET in Cyprus is low. According to Eurostat, only around 16% of upper secondary students follow VET; the EU figure is around 47%. In Cyprus, 83% of Cedefop’s survey respondents agree that general education has a more positive image than VET. Some 79% think that young people with low grades are directed towards VET; 63% believe that VET qualifications are easier to obtain. VET is linked with manual work by 65% of respondents but, despite this connection, 62% believe that it always or often takes place in higher education such as university. The survey findings imply that, in Cyprus, VET at upper secondary level, although seen as being of high quality, suffers from a negative bias compared to general education. The survey suggests that part of this bias may be due to misunderstandings about VET as not enough people in Cyprus know about it. While 7 in 10 European citizens had heard about and know what VET is before the survey interview, the figure in Cyprus was less than half (46%). The general opinion in Cyprus is that VET supports the economy, provides skills in demand and helps young people into work. In a changing labour market, upper secondary VET may provide a suitable path to a job for many more 16-18 year olds. More and better information about VET for young people thinking about their education may encourage more of them to choose it. Notes More in Cedefop opinion survey on vocational education and training in Europe: Cyprus (in English only) Cedefop’s opinion survey, published in 2017, provides new insights into what Europeans think of vocational education and training (VET), its ability to give people the right skills and to help VET graduates to find a job. The survey aims to inform policies to make VET a more attractive and effective learning option. It was conducted in June 2016 and examined EU citizens’ awareness and opinions on VET’s attractiveness and effectiveness, and personal experiences of VET at upper secondary level (typically age 16 to 18).

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0010	2019-10-14	NEWS	VET in Finland: making a good system better	 Vocational education and training (VET) in Finland has an excellent reputation. Popularity of VET as a learning option has increased steadily since the early 2000s; currently, more than 40% of the relevant age group applies for VET studies immediately after basic education. However, building on earlier reforms, Finland plans more changes to its VET system. Over 8 in 10 Finns (84%) said that VET has a positive image, according to an opinion survey carried out by Cedefop to gain insights into the views EU citizens have about VET at upper secondary level. Source: Cedefop’s VET opinion survey Finnish VET matches well with the needs of work: 96% of survey respondents agree that people in VET learn skills that are needed by employers, compared to the EU average of 86%. Students also benefit from studies that take into account their individual needs; 84% of Finnish VET students are very satisfied with the different aspects of their studies compared to 72% in the EU as a whole. Finland offers many opportunities to continue studies after initial VET. The survey reports that 64% of Finns agree it is easy to continue into higher education, compared to 54% in the EU overall. Finnish VET students also have more opportunities to study abroad. Every year, more than 13% of new Finnish vocational students go abroad for two to three weeks of on-the-job learning. Campaigns and skill competitions organised by the government and social partners, such as the annual SkillsFinland, have improved VET’s image across various sectors including metalwork and machinery, and natural and environmental protection. Some 97% of Finnish respondents to the survey agreed that VET strengthens the economy and 94% agreed that it plays a role in reducing unemployment. However, the overwhelming majority of Finns (88%) believe that general education has a better image than VET. Expectations of employment are also not so positive: 63% of Finns agree that VET allows you to find a job quickly after graduation (see figure). The survey shows that the employment prospects for VET graduates are not as good as for those who complete higher education. This view is probably influenced by the relatively high unemployment rate (14%) among young people in Finland. Consequently, as part of the effort to combat youth unemployment, Finland is continuing its VET system reforms. The aims include making access to VET easier, and greater individualisation of people’s learning pathways. Learning environments are becoming more varied with more learning at the workplace. Finland’s efforts to make a good system better reflect the need to keep up as much as possible with changes in the labour market. World class VET systems are always evolving.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0003	2019-10-07	NEWS	An enhanced role for apprenticeship in a changing world of work	 The external factors that have an impact on apprenticeship and the relevant design and delivery responses were discussed at a joint Cedefop/OECD symposium, on 7 October in Paris. New work carried out by international researchers was presented to over 100 participants representing ministries, social partners and national apprenticeship institutions from around the world. Apprenticeship has a long history of enabling young people’s transition from education to sustained skilled employment. When employers are fully engaged, apprenticeship aligns the formative education and training of learners to actual labour market needs. In recent years, governments across Europe and the OECD have invested considerable resources in improving apprenticeship provision, introducing and reforming apprenticeship to reach even more learners, both young people and, increasingly, adults. The aim has been to ensure that apprenticeships are attractive to learners, to employers and to society, providing apprentices with skills demanded by employers while contributing to societal and economic well-being (OECD, 2018).  To achieve this, learning from other countries’ experiences is vital, as they develop apprenticeships within different policy approaches and national contexts (Cedefop, 2018). Today’s symposium looked at the future of apprenticeship from the perspective of new approaches to education and training and external megatrends – such as socio-demographic changes, digitalisation, automation and other new technologies, new forms of work organisation, ageing populations – and considered how they have affected (or will affect) the design and delivery of apprenticeship. Among the topics presented were: how apprenticeship is changing in response to learners’ and employers’ preferences, labour market needs and policy priorities; how companies adapt their training provision to match technological changes; how apprenticeship relates to academic systems and expands to higher education; and selected country programmes. Cedefop Executive Director Jürgen Siebel and OECD’s Director of Employment, Labour and Social Affairs, Stefano Scarpetta addressed the participants. Mr Siebel said: ‘It is really time to think about where apprenticeship is headed. Accelerating labour market change, new forms of work and learning, and changing partnership and cooperation models require fundamental reflection on how to best shape the apprenticeships of the future. I trust the joint Cedefop/OECD symposium will give us food for thought and help us find the ways Cedefop can best support policy-makers in their efforts to build the apprenticeship of tomorrow.’ Mr Scarpetta said: ‘Digitalisation, ageing and globalisation are creating many new opportunities but also new challenges to our education and training systems. Over the next 10 to 15 years, one in seven jobs may be fully automated and another third may be overhauled across the OECD. Good quality apprenticeships, which prepare learners with the skills that employers highly value, must play a central role in the package of effective skills policies.’ You can find the new research presented at the symposium here. A summary publication will be published by the OECD shortly after the symposium and the full papers will be published by Cedefop in 2020.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0008	2019-09-25	NEWS	Vocational education and training in Italy: a well-kept secret?	 Vocational education and training (VET) enjoys a positive image in Italy, but is still regarded less favourably than general education. One reason may be that awareness about VET is amongst the lowest in the EU (see map below), according to the findings of Cedefop’s survey on what EU citizens think about VET for 16 to18 year-olds. In Italy, three quarters (75%) of survey respondents have a positive image of VET, one of the highest levels in the EU. However, over 8 in 10 believe that general education has a more positive image. Source: Cedefop’s VET opinion survey. VET upper secondary graduates in Italy find a job more quickly after their studies than general education graduates of the same age. The drawback is that VET is linked to specific occupations, some of which are not attractive. Only 47% of respondents in Italy think that VET leads to a highly regarded job, well below the EU average of 60%, while 57% agree that VET leads to a well-paid job compared to 61% in the EU overall.  However, VET upper secondary graduates appear more satisfied with their courses. Some 61% of survey respondents who had followed VET at upper secondary level say that, overall, they were totally satisfied with the quality of teaching they received, the general and work-related skills they acquired and the equipment available; this compares to 56% for general education. In addition, 44% of respondents say that Italy should prioritise investment in VET, compared to 32% who favour investment in general education. This indicates that more and better information about VET may help address misconceptions about it. Only 51% of respondents say that they had heard of VET before their survey interview, the joint third-lowest rate in the EU. Only 36% of general education graduates responding to the survey say that they received information about VET when deciding their upper secondary education options. Overall the survey provides a positive picture of VET in Italy indicating that it has much to offer students. Given more information about it, more people may choose a vocational learning path.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0012	2019-09-11	NEWS	Artificial or human intelligence?	 Sweeping technological change has raised uncertainty among workers across Europe. Some forecasts predict that nearly half of all jobs in advanced economies may potentially be automated, and 72% of EU citizens fear that robots may ‘steal people’s jobs’. Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey has added detail to the theories: 43% of adult workers across the EU reported that the technologies they use in the workplace have changed in the past five years, while 47% saw changes in their working methods or practices. Cedefop examines the opportunities and risks of digitalisation for the future of jobs and skills, especially the impact of robots. While past technological breakthroughs tended to replace low-skilled, routine work, today many high-skilled tasks, including in the health, legal, finance and education industries, can be performed faster and better by machines than humans. Cedefop research shows that automation and artificial intelligence do not necessarily destroy, but rather transform jobs. People, businesses and labour markets will have to adapt and acquire new skills, enabling them to cooperate with machines. Education and training provision will have to offer ‘robot-compatible’ skills and competences, blending specific occupational skills with key competences such as entrepreneurship and learning to learn. Political decision-makers must determine how to frame this continuing transformation, ensuring that nobody is left behind as new work methods are introduced. More information can be found in Cedefop’s briefing note (in nine languages).

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0015	2019-08-29	NEWS	VET in the Netherlands: a strong reputation abroad, but a poor image at home	 Despite enjoying an excellent reputation abroad, vocational education and training (VET) in the Netherlands has a poor image at home. This was the striking finding of an opinion survey carried out by Cedefop to gain insights into the views EU citizens have about VET at upper secondary level. Some 41% of survey respondents in the Netherlands say that VET has a negative image, well above the EU average of 23%. More than two-thirds of respondents say that general education has a better image than VET. The survey’s overall VET 'attractiveness indicator' combines answers to questions about VET’s image and relevance for the labour market. On this measure VET in the Netherlands comes next to last, just ahead of France and a long way behind countries such as Germany and Austria, which, like the Netherlands, have strong international reputations for high-quality upper secondary VET. The question is why the Dutch VET system, one of the best in the world according to international organisations such as the OECD, has such a poor image at home. It is certainly not because of a lack of awareness. The vast majority (89%) of respondents in the Netherlands know what VET is. The Dutch VET system is also highly inclusive, comprising high-quality expert and specialist courses as well as support for marginalised social groups. Its inclusive nature and positive labour market outcomes (79% of VET graduates find a job within a month of completing their studies) may be why upper secondary VET in the Netherlands is widely admired internationally. However, VET’s image in the Netherlands does not seem to be influenced by international recognition or the better labour market opportunities upper secondary VET offers compared to the same level of general education. In the Netherlands, upper secondary general education is not expected to offer excellent job opportunities, but to provide access to higher education and the better job opportunities that it can bring. Consequently, a possible interpretation of the survey findings is that, while many Dutch people value VET and believe it to be relevant and important to those who depend on it for a job and an income, it is just not the preferred choice for those seeking to continue to a university education. However, the survey is far from conclusive. Certainly given VET’s perceived success in the Netherlands, Dutch attitudes about it merit more research and analysis to inform future developments.

The survey aims to inform policies to make VET a more attractive and effective learning option. It was conducted in June 2016 and examined EU citizens’ awareness and opinions on VET’s attractiveness and effectiveness, and personal experiences of VET at upper secondary level (typically age 16-18). The survey comprised more than 35 000 interviews of a representative sample of Europeans across all EU Member States.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0014	2019-07-30	NEWS	Vocational education and training: an underused route to a good job in Greece	 Education in Greece at upper secondary level is dominated by the Panhellenic exams; they will decide to which university a student will go and what they will study. Little thought is given to upper secondary vocational education and training (VET) for 16 to 18 year-olds, even though it can offer better job prospects than general education. According to an opinion survey on VET carried out by Cedefop, around 64% of respondents who studied VET in Greece found their first long-term job within a year, compared to 49% of those who studied general education. Although of high quality – nine in 10 Greek upper secondary VET participants responding to the survey said they were totally satisfied with the quality of teaching they received – only around 29% of 16 to 18 year-olds in Greece participate in upper secondary VET, much lower than the EU average of 49%. Low participation is explained, to some extent, by the survey finding that 87% of respondents in Greece think that general education has a more positive image than VET. Over eight in 10 respondents also consider that VET is for students with low grades and think that upper secondary VET qualifications are easier to obtain. However, despite VET’s negative image compared to general education, over half (53%) of Greek respondents feel that upper secondary VET graduates are more likely to find a job after their studies than upper secondary general education graduates. This is unsurprising. Many upper secondary VET students expect to look for a job after finishing their studies, whereas general education also prepares students for higher education. Perhaps more surprising is that 69% believed that completing higher education did not improve their chances of finding a job compared to upper secondary VET graduates. Importantly, upper secondary VET is not just seen as a route into any job. Six in 10 survey respondents in Greece think that it can lead to a highly regarded job. There is an argument that upper secondary VET is underused as a route to a good job and undervalued compared to general education, but attitudes may be changing. The survey found that half of the respondents believe that Greece should prioritise investment in VET compared to one third for general education. In a difficult labour market it is worth considering whether upper secondary VET provides a suitable path to a job for many 16 to 18 year-olds.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0016	2019-06-24	NEWS	National qualifications frameworks gaining momentum across Europe	 Europeans have now better prospects when it comes to employability, mobility and access to further education. The 2017 revision of the European qualifications framework for lifelong learning (EQF), a reference tool making national qualifications more readable across Europe, has stepped up its implementation across countries, systems and institutions. Cedefop has played an important role in devising the EQF and in monitoring and supporting the development of national qualification frameworks (NQFs). The agency cooperates closely with the European Commission, EU Member States, various third countries, social partners and many other stakeholders to help ensure consistent, transparent and coordinated referencing of the NQFs to the EQF. The frameworks’ systematic use of learning outcomes promotes transparency and comparability of qualifications across countries and systems. Steady progress means that imagining European education and training systems without the frameworks has become impossible. Thirty nine European countries are currently developing 43 national qualifications frameworks, which have reached different stages of implementation. For further information on how countries are performing check out Cedefop’s new briefing note.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0020	2019-06-20	NEWS	Many Bulgarians consider vocational education and training to be a quicker way to a good job	 While other European Union (EU) Member States see vocational education and training (VET) as inferior to general education, many Bulgarians consider it a quicker route to a good job, according to an opinion survey on VET carried out by Cedefop. Around 51% of upper-secondary students in Bulgaria follow vocational programmes, compared to 46% in Germany and 49% in the EU as a whole. Most choose VET on the advice of family and friends and because they think that it provides the best chance of finding a job. The survey found that VET participants are more likely than those who followed general education to say that their course helped them to develop communication skills, the ability to work with others and sense of initiative and entrepreneurship. Evidence from the survey is that VET participants find a job quicker. Around 50% of VET participants found a job either before or within a month of completing their studies compared to 40% of general education participants. Some 61% of survey respondents also agreed that VET leads to well-paid jobs. Government policies to make VET an attractive learning option may be having an effect. In contrast with the majority of Member States (see Table above), Bulgarians do not think of VET as a ‘second category’ education for students with low grades. Some 72% of VET participants surveyed said that they would recommend vocational education to a young person; only 25% of general education participants would recommend general education. Some 94% of Bulgarian upper-secondary VET participants also said that, overall, they were totally satisfied with the quality of teaching they received, the general and work-related skills they acquired and the equipment available. This is well above the EU average of 87% and the second highest in the EU behind Malta’s 96%. However, there is more work to do. The survey found that 65% think that the Bulgarian government should prioritise investment in VET over investment in general education. Consideration is being given to increasing work-based learning in upper-secondary VET in Bulgaria and to developing VET curricula based on learning outcomes (what someone can do at the end of any type of learning experience, not just in school). Bulgaria has made progress in breaking down the unfair stereotypes often linked to VET and making it an attractive learning option. An experience other Member States could learn from.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0019	2019-04-11	NEWS	Vocational education and training systems in Europe at a glance	 Cedefop offers a concise, clear and concrete picture of vocational education and training (VET) systems in a new publication (in English) which brings together the main VET features and data in 30 countries: all EU Member States, Norway and Iceland. While countries share goals and challenges, their VET systems are diverse, shaped by socioeconomic contexts and traditions. The Spotlight on VET series compilation is addressed to those who need a quick overview of VET’s essential features in Europe. Clarifying VET’s place in countries’ overall education and training systems, it presents main accession and progression routes for learners; types and levels of qualifications they lead to; types of programmes, delivery modes, work-based learning ratio and duration. It is presented in a way that helps national and international readers understand the different systems and allows for some comparisons. This publication is a useful starting point for policy-makers, social partners, experts, researchers and journalists. It also provides orientation to other actors involved in VET-related activities: VET providers, teachers and trainers; guidance, qualifications and validation staff; and to other readers who want to familiarise themselves with VET systems across Europe.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0018	2019-03-29	NEWS	Millions of online job vacancies used to map employer needs in European countries	 Cedefop releases today new insights on skills and jobs in seven European countries. After several years of development, the agency presents first results of this new type of labour market intelligence, based on information from more than 30 million online job vacancies collected in the second half of 2018 in Czechia, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy and the UK. The classification of European skills, competences, qualification and occupations (ESCO) and complex big data analysis techniques were used to extract information on skills from the vacancies. The results are presented in the Skills online vacancy analysis tool for Europe (Skills OVATE). Skills OVATE complements Cedefop’s toolkit of already well-established sources of labour market intelligence, such as the European skills forecast, the European skills index, and the European skills and jobs survey. These sources are used by policy-makers at EU and Member State levels to inform education and training and employment policies. They help countries keep their education and training systems in sync with rapid changes in the world of work. The vacancies were collected from several types of online job vacancy portals, including multinational portals, websites operated by public employment services, regional and local players and employers’ websites. Cedefop Acting Head of Department for Skills and Labour Market Alena Zukersteinova said: ‘While care has been taken to ensure the presented data are of high quality, more analysis and testing will be done in the near future to provide results for policy-making or to help citizens make career decisions. The initial findings can already stimulate discussion and showcase the potential of using online job vacancies for state-of-the art skills analysis.’ By the end of this year, all EU Member States will be included in the system and the fully fledged tool will be released at the end of 2020.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0025	2019-03-19	NEWS	Lifelong skills development helps people who disconnect	 In 2107, 15.7% of low-qualified young Europeans aged 15-29 were not in education, employment or training (NEET), compared to 9.6% of their better educated peers. In the same year, the unemployment rate of low-qualified adults of working age (25-64) stood at 13.9% in the EU-28 while that of their highly qualified peers was at 4.2%. Low skills, usually associated with low or no qualification credentials, come at a high social and economic cost. They are devastating for the individuals concerned, damaging their social status, earnings, self-confidence, health and ability to engage in civil society. This is why policies across Europe have increasingly been focusing on prevention and early intervention, from tracking youth at risk to offering low-skilled people comprehensive counselling and upskilling measures, especially basic skills training. The EU has launched two large-scale initiatives to help Member States take both preventive and remedial action: the Youth guarantee, which helps countries address the needs of young people who are either at risk of dropping out of the system or have already disconnected, and the Upskilling pathways initiative which is designed to support low-qualified adults, especially in strengthening their literacy, numeracy and digital skills. Cedefop supports European policy with its research and policy advice. It also offers online resources on its website, such as a VET toolkit for tackling early leaving and online resources for guidance.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0029	2018-09-26	NEWS	How effective is your country’s skills system? Cedefop’s new European skills index has the answers	 Cedefop’s European skills index (ESI) makes understanding and analysing the performance of skills systems, within and across EU Member States, possible for the first time. The index was launched today at an event in Brussels. Europe’s skills base is seen as a major driving force in the effort to create more jobs and inclusive and sustainable growth. But other aspects also matter: how smoothly people move into work; how many and which groups of the population are economically active; and how well their skills are utilised at work. Skills development, activation and matching make up a country’s skills system and are the three pillars the ESI score is based on. ESI overall scores per country (maximum score 100) Source: Cedefop (2018). Cedefop Acting Director Mara Brugia noted: ‘To date, there has been no single measure to assess countries’ complex skills systems and compare their performance. Nor are there any easy answers to the question of how they can be made more effective. To fill this gap, Cedefop has developed the ESI. Used as a monitoring tool, it can be useful to policy-makers. It shows how countries’ skills systems perform, helps them understand their results and indicates where they may need to do better.’ The overall index reveals where countries stand. No Member State reaches, or comes close to, the ideal score of 100. In 2016, the Czech Republic scored highest (75), followed by Finland, Sweden, and Luxembourg. Together with Slovenia, Estonia and Denmark, these countries are the top performers with results above 67. Half of the countries, mainly from western, central and eastern Europe, achieved scores in the mid range from 45 to 62. The remaining 25%, most from the south and south-east, scored below 45. A closer look into the three pillars that make up the ESI score shows why the Czech Republic is in the lead. It nearly hits the target for the matching pillar, compensating for lower results in skills development and activation. In contrast, Sweden’s overall rank is mainly rooted in its top scores in skills development and activation, making up for a considerably less strong one in matching. If Sweden wants to close the gap with the Czech Republic, this is the pillar it may want to work on. Looking at Austria’s and Germany’s matching pillars may also trigger reflections on their qualification mismatch scores. Over the years, the ESI will help Member States assess if the steps taken have led to better results and will indicate where further action is required to support continuous improvement of their skills systems.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0030	2018-06-14	NEWS	Less brawn, more brain for tomorrow’s workers	 Work environments in the near future are expected to feature more autonomy, less routine, more use of ICT, reduced physical effort and increased social and intellectual tasks. Labour market skill needs will be shifting, and workers will have to supply new skills to match changing needs. An aging workforce, overqualification and job polarisation at the top and bottom of the skills scale will be some of the key challenges of the next decade; they call for action now. Over recent decades, the global distribution of labour has changed dramatically; global competition and market opportunities are likely to have continued impact on the European employment structure. Relative wages and productivity will play a key role in determining which jobs will remain and grow in Europe, and which ones will be lost to foreign competition. Manufacturing is the main sector affected by both megatrends, global trade and automation: though output will continue to grow, economic growth will be ‘jobless’ (or even accompanied by job losses). Employment growth is expected only in some high value-added sectors, such as motor vehicle production. The service sector – including the platform economy – is expected to see the fastest employment growth in Europe, both in high- and low-skill occupations. Cedefop has been identifying skills mismatches and labour market imbalances across Europe for over a decade, flagging potential issues for the attention of policy-makers. A summary of the findings from the latest forecast of trends and challenges in the coming period can be found in a briefing note here.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0021	2018-06-08	NEWS	Technology impacts future job trends	 Europe’s labour force is projected to remain at a similar level in the period up to 2030 while moderate job growth will likely curb unemployment, according to Cedefop’s skills forecast, released on 8 June in Brussels. The forecast shows that technological change may accelerate known employment trends, such as the shift to services, and may also increase polarisation in job growth, with fast growth projected for high-skill occupations and moderate growth for certain lower-skill jobs. Employment levels in medium-skill occupations will experience a hollowing out, with occupations such as skilled manual workers and clerks, likely to decline or stay the same, as automation and offshoring take their toll. In that context, a rethink of traditional vocational education and training is needed. Cedefop Acting Director Mara Brugia told a high-level event in Brussels where the new forecast was presented: ‘The goal of forecasting is not to predict the future but to help us to make informed choices to avoid deciding on education and training investments in the dark. Acting proactively is more effective, and often cheaper, than fixing adverse effects at a later stage.’ Cedefop collaborated with Eurofound to predict future skills needed in different types of jobs, using the European jobs monitor framework. Eurofound Director Juan Menéndez-Valdés said: ‘This is another concrete example exploiting two of the agencies’ most prominent tools, the Cedefop skills forecast and the European jobs monitor, to get even more added value.’ Manufacturing is the main sector affected by both global trade and automation, with economic growth projected to show no creation of new jobs and even job losses. However, some high-value-added sectors, including electrical equipment, other machinery, and equipment manufacturing and motor vehicles, are expected to see substantial employment growth. Employment is also forecast to increase in computer, optical and electronic equipment. Service sectors will experience the fastest employment growth, notably legal and accounting services, research and development, advertising and market research, along with administrative and support service activities. Chair of Cedefop Governing Board Tatjana Babrauskiene said: ‘The most critical challenge we will have to address in the decade to come is job polarisation, which reduces the amount of good and well-paid jobs. Polarisation means widening inequalities between those who have access to good-quality and skills-intensive work and those who end up being low-paid employees in inferior jobs.’ Director-General, DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion Joost Korte concluded: ‘Cedefop’s skills forecast is an important EU-level data source. It is essential for the work we do in Brussels in the context of the European Semester and to shape the skills for the future labour markets.’ Notes to editors Cedefop’s latest briefing note takes a detailed look at the skills forecast.

To prevent and combat the marginalisation of youth and adults, national authorities across Europe have been developing measures to address the needs of people who slip through the cracks of standard education, training and employment policies. People who lack basic life and work skills require holistic strategies which may mobilise health, social and psychological services and delay standard employability measures, such as job search and traineeship placements, to the last stage of an individualised recovery programme. A wide range of outreach services has been developed across the EU; however, their nature and extent vary considerably from one country to another. To better understand the state of play, Cedefop has produced, in cooperation with its network of national VET experts, ReferNet, a series of reports on outreach services in EU Member States. Cedefop’s latest briefing note gives an overview of the situation.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0028	2018-03-05	NEWS	Qualifications frameworks in Europe: a never-ending success story	 As countries across Europe are developing national qualifications frameworks (NQFs), the question of the frameworks’ added value and contribution to policies and practices is taking centre stage. While every NQF is unique, being organically woven into the fabric of a country’s education and training system, the frameworks share many features. They are based on learning outcomes, support consistency of qualifications, and bring together stakeholders from across the board. Thanks to the dynamic progress of NQF development, several national frameworks now provide comprehensive ‘maps’ of national qualifications and the relationships between them. This increased transparency across systems and borders has helped promote mainstreaming and comparability of qualifications at European level. In recent times, discussions have increasingly focused on the frameworks’ usefulness to employers, jobseekers and, more generally, citizens. In some countries, the frameworks’ level indicators are used to support employers in staff selection, recruitment and development, e.g. by informing job vacancies. In other countries, these indicators have helped integrate private sector qualifications into national qualifications systems or have supported the validation of non-formal and informal learning. Check out Cedefop’s new briefing note on qualifications frameworks’ changing role for an overview of progress achieved and of remaining challenges.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0035	2017-11-30	NEWS	Looking to the future: anticipating skills	 Cedefop has published in Skills Panorama overviews of skill anticipation approaches in all EU Member States.  They show differences and similarities in skills anticipation methods, governance, dissemination and its use in policy-making. They provide insights and possible policy lessons about how to get the best out of a potentially, powerful policy tool. It would be helpful to know what skills are needed by a labour market being transformed by technology, climate change and demography. People would know what type of education and training to follow; enterprises would know the skills they need; and policy-makers could adapt education and training systems to new skill needs. Skills anticipation is not workforce planning; it does not try to predict how many plumbers we will need in 2025. It uses available labour market and skills intelligence (LMSI) to see how jobs, skills and learning needs are changing, to try to improve the balance between skill supply and demand. Not being a crystal ball, skill anticipation makes no claim to being able to predict skills evolution with any certainty, but can point to current and possible future skill mismatches and inform decisions on how to tackle them. Across the European Union (EU), appreciation of LMSI’s usefulness is growing. Many Member States use skills anticipation to support employment and education and training policies; some use it in other policy areas such the move to the green economy. Find out more about skills anticipation as a powerful policy tool for decision-making in Cedefop’s new briefing note.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0037	2017-10-23	NEWS	Vocational education and training in Europe beyond 2020	 In recent years, European countries have been working ever more closely together in vocational education and training (VET) against a backdrop of uncertainties linked to globalisation, digitisation, migration and the transition to a greener economy. In this context, Cedefop is looking further ahead at the main trends in education and training to stimulate debate on European VET cooperation beyond 2020. According to Cedefop’s new briefing note, there is reason to believe that VET will expand and diversify across Europe in the coming years. Current trends include the development of more practice-oriented and work-related learning formats, across all types of education, vocational and general. In parallel, vocationally-oriented education and training is expanding to higher and lower education levels than the traditional intermediate. These developments in turn entail a risk of growing fragmentation of VET provision. This is why policy-makers and practitioners need to engage in a broad discussion on the best cooperation and learning approaches to secure sustainability and accessibility of future VET provision. More than ever, VET’s future is inseparable from the future of work. Download the briefing note for more on Cedefop’s new project on VET’s future.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0038	2017-10-13	NEWS	Here is what Europeans think of vocational education and training!	 Cedefop has published the report of its first European opinion survey on vocational education and training (VET). The survey provides an unprecedented perspective on citizens’ opinions on awareness, attractiveness, experience and effectiveness of VET in the European Union (EU). A total of over 35,500 face-to-face interviews were conducted with citizens of all EU Member States. Findings show that the vast majority of EU citizens (86%) have heard of VET. However, only half (48%) of respondents whose education was primarily general said they received information about VET when making a decision about their upper secondary education. Two thirds of Europeans (68%) think that VET at upper secondary stage has a positive image in their country. Respondents in Malta (89%), Finland (84%), the Czech Republic (77%), the UK (75%) and Italy (75%) are most likely to say that vocational training has a positive image. On a less positive note, three in four EU citizens (75%) agree that students with low grades are directed towards vocational education in their country, but 87% of VET students are happy with the work-related skills they developed and six in 10 said they found their first long-term job before or within a month of finishing their studies. Just over half of Europeans (54%) agree that it is easy to continue into higher education such as university after vocational education at upper secondary level. However, only 39% of respondents who had vocational education at upper secondary level report continuing to higher education. There is support for national governments prioritising investment in vocational education at upper secondary stage. Respondents are most likely to be in favour in Slovakia (76%), Slovenia (75%), Hungary (71%), Poland (70%), the Czech Republic (66%), Croatia (65%), Bulgaria (65%) and France (64%). Support for prioritising general education is highest in Ireland (43%), the UK (43%), Malta (36%), Germany (36%) and Austria (36%). EU citizens generally agree that VET plays an important role in society, specifically by strengthening their country’s economy (84% agree), reducing unemployment (80%) and tackling social exclusion (78%). Cedefop Director James Calleja said about the survey: ‘VET can play a strategic role in providing the EU with a workforce ready for the challenges lying ahead. Improving and maintaining high-level workforce skills and competences is essential to ensuring that Europe remains competitive and innovative against increasing global competition, fast-changing labour market needs and demographic challenges. However, participation in both upper secondary and continuous VET differs greatly among Member States and overall is still far from EU targets. This survey helps us understand why.’ For more information on the findings and specific insights into Member States, download the survey report.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0031	2017-09-20	NEWS	Apprenticeships discussed at Cedefop policy learning forum	 Stakeholders and national experts directly involved in Cedefop’s thematic country reviews (TCRs) on apprenticeships took part in the first policy learning forum on apprenticeships in Thessaloniki. Cedefop launched the TCRs in 2014 to support cooperation among EU Member States and to interact with individual countries wishing to develop quality apprenticeships in line with EU policies. A lighter version of the reviews (flash TCRs) is being piloted in Belgium (French-speaking Community) and Sweden. Addressing the forum, Cedefop Deputy Director Mara Brugia said that 'apprenticeships have experienced a revival in EU policy-making in recent years.’ She added: ‘Apprenticeships are vocational education and training (VET) programmes that promote various talents; they can lead to successful careers and can be a pool of talent for enterprises.’ Lithuania and Malta were the first countries to benefit from the reviews, in 2015, and results have started becoming visible. The second round, involving Slovenia, Italy and Greece, finished in mid-2017, and the third (Croatia and Cyprus) kicked off in early 2017. Below is a summary of the reviews’ objectives in the countries that have taken part in the programme so far: Lithuania: The TCR in Lithuania, completed in 2015, suggested that the apprenticeship pathway should be signposted for all stakeholders, leading to recognised qualifications and better employability. Since then, ministries and social partners have taken significant steps in amending legislation, with the first apprentices in place. Malta: Following the TCR, Malta’s policy priority is to distinguish the reformed apprenticeship from other forms of work-based learning, in particular traineeships and work placements, clarifying its place in the overall VET system. Reform progress is being monitored using Cedefop’s analytical framework. Slovenia: Following the adoption of the Law on Apprenticeship (May 2017), Slovenia finds itself at a crossroads with further decisions needed to put apprenticeship on track. The TCR invites national stakeholders to continue the dialogue to clarify their vision and expectations for the apprenticeship pathway. Italy: The TCR reviewed ‘Type 1 apprenticeship’, one of the three apprenticeship schemes in Italy, leading to upper secondary and post-secondary qualifications in VET and in general education. Though it exists in the legal framework since 2003, Type 1 apprenticeship never took off. The TCR reflected on the conditions for turning it into a system-level opportunity for young people. Greece: Rolled out amidst a major VET reform, the Greek TCR highlighted remaining key challenges regarding the country’s apprenticeship schemes. It presented suggestions for action for national stakeholders to expand and modernise apprenticeships through robust, participatory governance mechanisms and practices for sharing responsibilities and resources. Croatia: The TCR will examine apprenticeship programmes implemented for trades and crafts occupations. Croatia is looking for ways to attract more learners and meet a need for skilled craftspersons and employees. Cyprus: The TCR will look at the new modern apprenticeship programmes that have been implemented as an alternative for learners at risk of leaving education. National stakeholders in Cyprus are looking for ways to raise the quality and improve the image of these programmes, making them a pathway for all learners.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0033	2017-09-19	NEWS	Digital plus: In the digital age, digital skills are not enough	 Excitement at the prospects of the new digital era is tempered by worries that people will lose their jobs to robots and machines. But before reaching conclusions about the future, it is important to understand the different ways technology is changing the world of work; namely job substitution, job creation and job transformation, as Cedefop’s latest briefing note explains. Job substitution is the real concern. According to Cedefop, 43% of adult employees in the EU have seen the technologies they use change in the past five years. As well as routine, low-skilled work, technology can now perform complex tasks, such as legal searches and some surgery. Drivers were once thought safe as driving is unpredictable, but self-driving cars are a reality. Adult employees (%) with technological change in workplace in last five years by sector, EU28 Source: Cedefop European skills and jobs survey. However, technology has also created jobs, which a few years ago did not exist, such as web analysts and applications developers. Cedefop forecasts another half a million new jobs in ICT occupations in the EU by 2025. History also shows technology has unlikely job benefits; who knew what the first flying machines would do for tourism? Technology destroys some jobs and creates others, but its greatest effect is to transform job content. A 2016 study of several OECD countries, calculated that on average just 9% of jobs were at high risk of automation, but at least 70% of tasks could be automated. The way technology transforms jobs shows that to keep up with changes, simply improving digital literacy is not enough. People in jobs requiring moderate level ICT skills also need strong complementary skills. Along with literacy and numeracy they also need to be able to plan, organise, communicate and work in a team. To work in ICT you will probably need a foreign language, often English. Not every lorry driver will become a computer programmer, or needs to; future drivers may use technology to guide several self-driving vehicles or drones to deliver goods rather than sit behind a wheel. But moving from driving to logistics is a step up and places considerable emphasis on education and training systems to provide new combinations of skills throughout working life. Earlier industrial revolutions developed education and training systems that provided young people with social and technical skills for life. Now, technological change is accelerating skill obsolescence, meaning that most future skills will be acquired in the workplace during adult life. Consequently, systems need to be more flexible. Digital skills are amongst those most likely to be developed through practice at work and gaming during personal time. Easier validation of digital skills acquired outside the formal education and training system would make them more visible and improve job prospects. Combining digital with other technical and behavioural skills will ensure that people and technology remain complementary. Technology can perform tasks and collect data, but people must decide what the tasks should be and what the data mean. As Picasso said, ‘computers are stupid, they only know answers’.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0036	2017-09-18	NEWS	#CedefopPhotoAward 2017 winners announced	 Image copyright:  Cedefop Teams of vocational education and training (VET) learners from Ireland and Lithuania are the winners of this year’s #CedefopPhotoAward competition. In total 140 teams consisting of 383 VET learners took part in the competition, representing VET providers from 20 EU Member States. The teams were asked to tell a story of their VET experience. The entry from a group of learners at the Siauliai Vocational Training Centre in Lithuania won first prize – a trip to Brussels to receive their award at the European vocational skills week (#EUVocationalSkills) 2017 award ceremony on 24 November. The second prize, a trip to Thessaloniki for the opening of the 58th Thessaloniki International Film Festival (#TIFF58) on 2 November, went to learners from the Tanagh Outdoor Education and Training Centre in Ireland. Twenty entries made the shortlist and will be exhibited at the Thessaloniki International Film Festival (2-12 November) and in Brussels during the European vocational skills week (22-24 November). A barber’s dream (TIME2CREATE team) The story of Svajunas, a young man who gained a barber qualification and works for one of the most popular barber shops in Vilnius, was told by photography students Edita Aleksandravičienė and Irena Masandavičiūtė. The photographers say: ‘Svajunas’s choice to become a barber was unexpected: a man asked him to cut his hair, he tried and got inspired in the process. He then studied for three years, and now, still only 20, he already impresses, surprises and inspires with his ability.’ Our outdoor education (Tanagh Trainees 2016/17 team) Tomás Mc Kenna, Adrian Callaghan and Ramada Diver depicted the experience of their training to become canoeing and kayaking instructors. They chose the winning images ‘to represent both the vibrant and challenging experiences that we all shared together; as a result, we all share a very strong bond.’ The runners-up list is made up of the following teams: HLUW Yspertal-Island from Höhere Lehranstalt für Umwelt und Wirtschaft (Austria) Media Fanatics from MCAST (Malta) LCFE 1 from Limerick College of Further Education (Ireland) Lemon from Srednja Škola Braća Radić (Croatia) OAED Lakkias from OAED Lakkias (Greece) Gimnazija Ljutomer from Gimnazija Ljutomer (Slovenia) Special Effects SVIE Iatriki Sxoli from IIEK SVIE (Greece) Objectiva Estudante from Centro de Emprego e Formação Profissional de Setúbal (Portugal) The Amazing Students from IES Gabriel Miró (Spain) South Swedish Bakers from Fria Läroverken Ystad (Sweden) Enaip NET from Centro di Formazione Professionale Enaip Veneto (Italy) M@Z from Centro de Emprego e Formação Profissional de Setúbal (Portugal) Start-up Scissors from IEK Dimitra (Greece) Kerry ETB Digital Media from Kerry ETB Training Centre (Ireland) Egalité Fraternité Liberté from Armor Formation (France) Water Tower Vukovar Pinokio from Wood-processing Technical School Vinkovci (Croatia) Carved Flowers from Virgil Madgearu Economic High School (Romania) Mechanical Birds from Kaunas Technical Vocational Education Centre (Lithuania) Downloads Press releaseEN428.41 KB 	https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news-and-press/press-and-media/press-releases/cedefopphotoaward-2017-winners-announced
CEDEFOP_NEWS_0039	2017-07-03	NEWS	Vocational education and training: bridging refugee and employer needs	 Image copyright:  @Shutterstock_Frank Gaertner Over the past two years, Europe has received an unprecedented number of refugees and asylum seekers. Many of these are here to stay, and the European Union needs to ensure that they enter the labour market and become self-reliant as quickly as possible. Cedefop cooperates with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in supporting refugee integration through skilling and qualification. To this end, the two organisations launched a joint survey, carried out by Cedefop’s national ReferNet partners. The results of this survey form the basis of a briefing note published by Cedefop. Vocational education and training programmes can help migrants connect with the labour market and find jobs matching their skills and qualifications. For this purpose, the survey has found, EU Member States have stepped up education and training provision and broadened access to it. Many countries have introduced new features to their systems, such as automated self-assessments, fast-track procedures and local community training supported by mentors. Early support is critical to successful integration of refugees and asylum seekers. Besides language training, assessment and validation of migrants’ skills, guidance and work placements play a crucial role. To be effective, information and guidance should start as early as possible, ideally before migrants reach their destination, especially in view of their (re)settlement within the European Union. This requires EU Member States to exchange information on their labour markets’ needs and to put in place a system for the early skills profiling of migrants to ensure suitable matching, with the aim of rationalising the distribution of humanitarian migrants across the EU.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0040	2017-06-29	NEWS	Towards age-friendly work in Europe: a life-course perspective  on work and ageing from EU Agencies	 Image copyright:  © Shutterstock/Monkey Business Images The EU’s population and workforce are ageing. This has implications for employment, working conditions, living standards and welfare. How should we respond to these challenges? A new report shows how information from four agencies, including Cedefop, can support policy-making that is both complementary and greater than the sum of its parts. The report, coordinated by EU-OSHA, draws on the agencies’ expertise in each of their areas and covers the different challenges associated with the ageing workforce and considers innovative solutions. Cedefop explores how vocational education and training can be used to support active ageing at work. EU-OSHA presents policy examples of integrated approaches to occupational safety and health for an ageing workforce. Eurofound examines working conditions for workers of all ages, related work sustainability outcomes and how the right policies can foster longer working lives. EIGE provides a gender perspective on the issue of the ageing workforce and discusses the different challenges that men and women face. The report also outlines the impact of long-term demographic trends on employment, and examines lifelong participation in learning. This is followed by a call for active ageing solutions that ensure older workers remain active, skilled and employed.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0052	2017-05-18	NEWS	Cedefop launches online toolkit for tackling early leaving	 A new online toolkit for tackling early leaving from education and training was launched at Cedefop's policy learning forum on vocational education and training (VET) as a solution to leaving education early (16-17/5) in Thessaloniki. The Europe-wide toolkit provides practical guidance, tips, good practice and tools to assist policy-makers and education and training providers in activities and policies. It is inspired by successful VET practices which help young people attain at least an upper secondary qualification. The toolkit works in three ways by helping to: identify learners at risk of early leaving or who have already left education; intervene to keep them in or bring them back to the system; evaluate the measures implemented. A new self-reflection tool for policy-makers and two evaluation plans (one for policy-makers and one for VET providers) can be used to monitor and evaluate the performance of policies and practices. Participants from European Union countries, Russia, Turkey and international organisations, including the World Bank, OECD and WorldSkills, had the opportunity to test the tools at the forum and give feedback. Opening the event, Cedefop Deputy Director Mara Brugia stressed that, although the European Union target to reduce early leaving to less than 10% by 2020 is on course to be achieved, ‘early leaving still matters; and we need to understand which policies are likely to be effective in the specific regional or national context.’ Ms Brugia noted that ‘our research findings have given us a deeper understanding of how VET can help break the vicious cycle of early leaving, unemployment and social exclusion.’ Cedefop expert Irene Psifidou, who organised the forum and developed the toolkit, said that ‘we now have the evidence and tools to empower VET so that it becomes the solution to the early leaving problem.’ In his closing remarks, Cedefop Director James Calleja argued that VET must stop being an alternative pathway and become first choice, underlining the importance of the human factor in the fight against early leaving: ‘We must personify early leavers as some countries have succeeded in doing.’ He added: ‘Action has to come from the bottom to reach the ones at the bottom first. Cedefop’s new toolkit can be a powerful weapon in the quest to give young people opportunities to achieve their potential.’ Notes to editors Check out Cedefop’s VET toolkit for tackling early leaving Cedefop policy learning forum: VET as a solution to leaving education early Event hashtag: #VETearlyleaving Find out more about early leaving from education and learning and VET’s role in the fight against it  Downloads Press releaseEN144.12 KB 	https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news-and-press/press-and-media/press-releases/cedefop-launches-online-toolkit-tackling-early-leaving

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0042	2017-02-08	NEWS	As national qualifications frameworks are taking shape, their benefits become visible across the European Union	 After developing and progressively introducing national qualifications frameworks (NQFs), European countries are starting to assess their experiences, and the multiple roles and benefits of the frameworks are gradually emerging. National qualifications frameworks offer policy-makers a more comprehensive picture of the qualifications landscape in their country. They promote the use of learning outcomes as a tool to describe and classify qualifications, thus increasing their transparency. In some countries, NQFs act as a reference point for identifying, documenting, assessing and recognising learning acquired in non-formal and informal settings. Some countries use their framework as a ‘bridge’ to the huge variety of learning activities taking place outside the formal education and training system. NQFs are contributing to strengthening the links between initial and continuing education and training. The frameworks’ levels, reflecting countries’ classification of qualifications, make their way into diplomas and qualifications databases. Twenty countries now award diplomas and certificates bearing a reference to the national qualifications frameworks and the European qualifications framework’s level they correspond to. Also, in some countries NQFs have helped social partners and other policy-makers to identify gaps in the existing qualifications offer. They have inspired the development of new qualifications, especially at level 5 of the European qualifications framework, thus taking on an active role in the renewal of qualifications and curricula. Ultimately however, the NQFs’ impact will depend on their ability to make a difference to end-users, be these learners, employers, or education and training providers.

Presenting Cedefop’s work in 2016-17 to the Parliament’s Employment and Social Affairs Committee, Mr Calleja added: ‘We know from OECD research that two thirds of our primary school children today will land in jobs which do not exist yet. This is why the accent lies on the key competences young people will need to face the challenges of a rapidly changing labour market. This is exactly what we do at Cedefop and why we share our outputs on platforms that could reach more users.’ At the meeting, MEPs stressed the importance of Cedefop and other EU agencies, and asked questions about work on skills and future jobs. According to Cedefop’s performance indicators, in 2016 the agency moved closer to Member States, social partners and European citizens. Mr Calleja said that it will continue working in this direction. It will also focus on supporting the European Commission even better including through the New skills agenda for Europe, which was launched last June. In this context, Mr Calleja identified some of Cedefop’s key challenges and targets for 2017: ‘We are focusing on the New skills agenda for Europe because we want to give priority to skills formation and skills intelligence. Member States need to work on better understanding where their economy is heading, what skills are needed and how this is reflected in vocational education and training (VET).’ According to the Cedefop Director, skills are the most important answer to digital transformation; it is imperative not to let inequalities create social groups who have lost all hope and to ensure that the fourth industrial revolution translates into economic growth and creates benefits for all.    A briefing note accompanying Mr Calleja’s presentation outlines the key roadmaps that the agency’s 2017-20 programming document focuses on: shaping, valuing and informing VET.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0046	2016-12-06	NEWS	New studies highlight the significant contribution of EU Agencies to citizens and administrations	" The 45 EU Agencies and Joint Undertakings make a vast contribution to the economic and political development of the European Union according to two new studies presented today during the EU Agencies Forum at the European Parliament. The studies highlight that while the EU Agencies, including Cedefop, represent less than 0.8% of the EU’s annual budget, their contribution has widespread impact at citizen, industry and policy level. The first study analyses the cost-effectiveness of the seven EU Agencies operating to support the Internal Market, and how they reduce the overall costs to taxpayers. The second study focuses on the contribution of 44 Agencies and Joint Undertakings to the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Juncker Commission Agenda. The studies will be discussed today and tomorrow during the first EU Agencies Forum at the European Parliament. Vice-President of the European Parliament, Mairead McGuinness and Kristalina Georgieva, Vice-President of the European Commission, are speakers at the event. António Campinos, Executive Director of the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) which is currently Chair of the EU Agencies Network, said: 'The EU Agencies are the familiar face of the EU for many Europeans, delivering essential services on the ground for a relatively small proportion of the overall EU budget - less than 0.8%, to be exact. In other terms, they cost €1.23 euros per EU citizen. The cost-benefit ratio is hence very positive, and as the EU Parliament study has shown, agencies save national administrations many millions every year, by delivering synergies and preventing duplication of efforts in each Member State.' Agencies are cost effective and save money Overall, the 2015 budget of the EU Agencies represents less than 0.8% of the EU’s annual budget (about EUR €1.2 billion), while creating significant efficiencies and delivering value for EU citizens across a wide range of policy areas, according to a report by Deloitte (link). A second report commissioned by the European Parliament estimates that it would cost Member States up to €200 million a year to assume the tasks currently done by just seven of the 45 agencies[1]. (link). Agencies are close to EU citizens and businesses As well as supporting the top political priorities of the European Union, EU Agencies play an important role in many other aspects of the everyday life of citizens: in disease prevention and control, security and defence, education and knowledge, stability of the financial systems, and in the fields of digital connectivity or transport, among others. In 32 cities across 24 Member States, EU Agencies work to improve the EU industry and citizens’ lives in many ways. For example: Frontex, the European Border and Coastguard Agency, currently deploys some 1 200 officers at EU’s external borders and has helped to rescue more than 89 000 people at sea so far this year; The European Asylum Support Office currently deploys over 300 staff in around 20 locations in Italy and Greece. They are working to support the implementation of the EU Relocation Programme and EU-TR Statement. EASO has an important role in better managing the Common European Asylum System; In 2015, Europol, the EU’s law enforcement agency, supported  more than 40,000 investigations  against terrorism and serious crime; The EU’s Intellectual Property Office’s study on the economic contribution of Intellectual Property Rights shows that IPR intensive industries in the EU now support directly or indirectly 38% of jobs and 42% of the EU’s GDP; Since 2010, the European Institute of Innovation & Technology (EIT) has created Europe’s largest innovation community, helped set up 32 innovation hubs across Europe, and supported the creation of more than 200 innovative start-ups and entrepreneurship training for 2,000 students and graduates; From 2014-2020 the Bio-based Industries Joint Undertaking is administering €3.7bn investments in bio-based innovation and will be funding more than 200 cooperative projects through cross-industry clusters; The EMCDDA (EU drugs agency in Lisbon), monitors over 560 new psychoactive substances through an EU Early Warning System. Where required, it assesses the risks of these substances to public health in Europe; The European Medicines Agency has recommended over 1000 new medicines for the treatment of patients. In addition to monitoring approved medicines, it also addresses the challenges holding back the development of new medicines, including new antibiotics. NOTE FOR EDITORS The two studies on EU Agencies and Joint-Undertakings The first study on “The Cost of Non-Agencies with Relevance to the Internal Market”  was requested by the Budget Committee of the European Parliament and prepared by the Centre for Strategy & Evaluation Services (link). It shows that the Agencies reduce the overall costs to taxpayers. This report is a snapshot covering just seven agencies: The European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO); The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA); The European Medicines Agency (EMA); The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA); The European Banking Authority (EBA); The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA); The European Insurance & Occupational Pensions (EIOPA). The report shows that it is significantly more cost effective to perform a task once at EU level than to replicate it 28 times at national level. The second study on “How do EU Agencies and Bodies contribute to the Europe 2020 strategy and to the Juncker Commission Agenda?” (link) was commissioned by the EU Agencies Network from the consultants Deloitte. It looks at how the EU agencies and bodies contribute to the Europe 2020 strategy and the Juncker Agenda. The EU Agencies Network The 45 decentralised Agencies and Joint Undertakings of the EU closely interact and cooperate within the EU Agencies Network, a pan-European network, set up by the Heads of EU Agencies, as a collective voice for the Agencies to coordinate, exchange information and agree common positions of shared interest.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0041	2016-10-25	NEWS	Skill shortages in Europe. Which occupations are in demand – and why	 Skill shortages are of particular concern, especially when unemployment is high. People may lack the skills employers need and changes to education and training may also be necessary. Cedefop has developed a way to identify occupations for which a critical shortage has important implications for national economies and their education and training systems. It also provides insights into why skill shortages arise. According to Cedefop Director James Calleja, ‘Our findings are a snapshot of skill shortage occupations in Europe and our method is a vital piece of the skills anticipation jigsaw. We need to know not only where skill shortages arise, but why. The right remedies to tackle skill mismatch require the right prognosis and diagnosis.’ A varied picture Across the EU, the top five skill shortage occupations are ICT professionals; medical doctors; science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) professionals; nurses and midwives and teachers. But the picture varies across countries. While all Member States except Finland lack ICT professionals, Belgium, Greece, Spain, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal and the UK have no shortage of teachers. Other occupations are also of concern to various countries. Estonia and France face shortages of legal professionals. Ireland, Luxembourg, Hungary and the UK need finance professionals. In Italy demand for architects with green skills is growing. Mixed reasons Demand for ICT professionals is rising because almost every economic sector needs their skills. Similarly, STEM professionals are needed in many fields, including emerging ones such as electric-vehicle production. However, the supply of ICT and STEM graduates from upper-secondary and higher education is insufficient to meet demand. Too few young people are studying STEM subjects. Entry requirements and dropout rates are high and participation by women is low. Some countries also suffer from ‘brain drain’ as STEM professionals emigrate for better jobs elsewhere. Europe’s ageing population is causing skill shortages for healthcare professionals and teachers, but in different ways. Many teachers are expected to retire in the coming decade and shortages arise from the need to replace them. For healthcare occupations an ageing society is increasing demand for social care and medical services. But skill shortages arise for other reasons not related to skills. Unattractive and stressful working environments and falling wages can discourage people from entering certain occupations. In some countries teaching has a negative image and salaries are low. Healthcare occupations often require shift and weekend work and have high staff turnover. An increasing number of healthcare professionals work in sectors with better working conditions, such as the biotech industry and pharmaceuticals. Similarly, many STEM graduates take non-STEM jobs. To reduce skill shortages Member States are trying to increase supply of the skills in demand. Changes are being made to education and training, efforts are being made to use existing reserves of labour and skills better and employees are being upskilled. More people, especially women, are being encouraged to study ICT and STEM subjects. Efforts are being made to bring jobseekers together with companies that have skill shortages and will provide training. Fast-track training opportunities for employed and unemployed people to qualify in shortage occupations are also being developed.  For more detailed findings on critical skill shortages for each Member State, go to Skills Panorama, a website operated by Cedefop for the European Commission.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0048	2016-10-21	NEWS	Future of jobs and skills at heart of Cedefop – UNESCO global conference	 Global trends and local challenges in matching skills to the changing job market were examined at a joint Cedefop – UNESCO conference at the UNESCO headquarters, in Paris on 20 and 21 October. More than 125 participants, policy-makers, stakeholders and experts from around the world took part in the event, which promoted international collaboration and discussed approaches to addressing local labour market challenges, emphasising a need for dialogue between education and training across different regions of the world and for a platform to share best practices in anticipating and matching skills in a changing labour market. Opening the conference, the Director of the Division for Policies and Lifelong Learning Systems at UNESCO David Atchoarena welcomed the participants from more than 50 countries, emphasised the importance of an international cooperation and spoke about the significance of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) in the 2030 sustainable development agenda in the lifelong learning context. ‘Youth and adults need better skills to fully participate in their societies and economies. Employers in all sectors are looking for skilled employees who are continually learning. Governments increasingly consider TVET as a key policy instrument to promote employment, inclusion and lifelong learning. The stakes are especially high for young people. Their transition from schools to the world of work raises challenges for all countries,’ he said. Short ‘shelf life’ of modern skills Cedefop Deputy Director Mara Brugia spoke passionately about the short life of skills today compared to the past, about how each potential talent needs to be developed and of the necessity to ease mobility between regions. ‘Qualifications frameworks based on learning outcomes together with policies to validate the skills people have acquired at work or elsewhere, may indeed help support talent and skills mobility. These frameworks can also help to make qualifications more relevant to labour market and learner needs. They could also become the new global skills currency. The joint work of UNESCO, the European Training Foundation and Cedefop on qualifications frameworks beyond Europe could support this process.’ Keynote speaker Saadia Zahidi, Head of Employment and Gender Initiatives at the World Economic Forum, presented outcomes of recent research by the Forum and spoke about how the digital revolution is fundamentally changing the world of work. ‘We’re at the beginning of the fourth industrial revolution, so we have an opportunity to shape it. We need to create a new narrative to be able to shape it, because stories are the way we create common purpose that links people across sectors, cultures, industries and more. It therefore needs to be a powerful, compelling, common and positive narrative,’ she said. Around 25 speakers and panellists shared best practices to tackle global challenges for matching skill demand and supply, facing unemployment and discussing quality assurance of qualifications in a rapidly changing labour market. Conference sessions covered, among others, digitisation of economies and a need for new skills in the digital age, skills and inequality across genders, generations and communities and how skills policies are necessary to improve quality and reduce these inequalities.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0047	2016-10-11	NEWS	Supporting training and learning abroad: the EU mobility scoreboard for initial VET	 Learning abroad is generally seen as an enriching and often far-reaching experience, especially for young people. The European Union has promoted learner mobility for many years through various policies, programmes and tools, with the aim to reduce youth unemployment and to better match its workforce’s skills to labour market needs. The mobility scoreboard is a new online tool designed to complement the existing programmes and to help policy-makers develop learning mobility in initial vocational education and training across Europe. It assesses the EU Member States’ policies and structures that support students’ and apprentices’ mobility, looking in particular at countries’ efforts to remove administrative and institutional obstacles, to recognise skills acquired abroad, to fund mobility schemes and to motivate, inform and guide young people in this context.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0049	2016-07-22	NEWS	Professional development of teachers and trainers in vocational education and training: a warranty of quality	 Committed and competent teachers and trainers are key to ensuring labour market relevance and quality of vocational education and training (VET) in Europe. They are the ‘human factor’, responsible for familiarising pupils with work challenges and labour market needs, for implementing new curricula or work-based learning schemes for apprentices or trainees, and for applying the European tools. This is why the European Union has called on its Member States to offer VET teachers and trainers more professional development opportunities. In recent years, EU-funded projects have substantially contributed to creating learning opportunities for teachers and trainers, be it through improved career schemes, work placements or specific training, e.g. on labour market reforms. It is time that countries pick up more systematically on these projects to make sure that their teachers are well trained and are offered attractive career prospects so that they, in turn, can better teach and train their pupils. Many countries have been taking action to improve the situation. For further reading, download Cedefop’s new briefing note on the subject.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0055	2016-06-06	NEWS	Moving to learn – a new mobility scoreboard for Europe	 Image copyright:  Cedefop The mobility scoreboard for initial vocational education and training (IVET), a new tool to assist policy-makers in the area of learning mobility developed by Cedefop in close cooperation with the European Commission, was presented at an event in Thessaloniki on 3 June. A prototype with information on 28 countries (26 EU Member States, Iceland and Norway) is available on the Cedefop website, while the interactive online tool is being finalised and will be launched during the vocational education and training (VET) week in December. Cedefop Director James Calleja told participants in the event that mobility of learners should be seen as the rule, not the exception, and called the scoreboard a VET reform system. ‘People must learn about mobility as early as possible, as they will be mobile throughout their working life; for young people, especially, mobility is key,’ he said. Participants included Erasmus+ agencies, IVET institutions, companies involved in mobility projects, teachers and trainers, guidance personnel, students’ associations, Cedefop’s ReferNet partners and EU-level stakeholders. Cedefop’s Head of Department for VET Systems and Institutions Loukas Zahilas said that the scoreboard’s objective is to help move ahead in mobility by looking at factors that slow it down. Cedefop expert Guy Tchibozo, the project leader, presented the mobility scoreboard focusing on 10 key areas for action and asked participants for their feedback to help finalise the online tool. The scoreboard offers policy-makers, stakeholders and users EU-level overviews of countries’ structures, policies and performance, using maps, indicators and tables. It also provides country-specific information and analyses through country scorecards and fiches. Notes to editors The mobility scoreboard was created as a result of a 2011 European Council recommendation. Work started in 2015. The final version will cover all 28 EU Member States, Iceland and Norway. Ten key thematic areas for action: information and guidance; preparation; removing obstacles; quality; recognition; portability; partnerships and funding; disadvantaged learners; motivation; multipliers.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0056	2016-05-26	NEWS	How to mainstream successful local policies addressing early leaving from education and training	 In 2014, the rate of early leaving from education and training in the European Union had dropped to just one percentage point above the Europe 2020 benchmark of less than 10%. This encouraging trend is partly owed to the numerous projects and initiatives across Europe which have supported young people at risk of dropping out of education over the past three decades. Yet, many of these initiatives have neither attracted attention nor found a market beyond their local context, in spite of their success. What has prevented policy-makers and practitioners in other places to reap their benefits? What does it take to make successful practices work in different settings? Cedefop has identified several key features common to successful policies and analysed the conditions for mainstreaming successful projects and initiatives into regional/national programmes and for policy learning from one country to another. If the European Union wants to substantially improve early leavers’ perspectives and keep in education and training learners at risk of dropping out, it needs to mainstream successful preventive measures and initiatives into national policies. This is all the more urgent as labour market integration of thousands of young refugees and migrants will require a large-scale implementation of guidance and labour market inclusion measures, some similar to those proposed to early leavers or learners at risk of early leaving. More information on what it takes to mainstream policies addressing early leaving can be found in Cedefop’s new briefing note. You can download it here (in eight languages).

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0057	2016-05-24	NEWS	Commissioner Thyssen opens #CedefopPhotoAward exhibition in Strasbourg	 European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility Marianne Thyssen opened the #CedefopPhotoAward exhibition at the European Youth Event 2016 (EYE2016) in Strasbourg on 20 May. Ms Thyssen presented the 10 best photos of the competition’s first phase. The #CedefopPhotoAward is still open until September 2016. The two winners of the second phase will be invited to Greece to visit Cedefop and join the opening of the 57th Thessaloniki International Film Festival in November. For more information and the photo gallery, go to: www.cedefop.europa.eu/CedefopPhotoAward.   Over 7 000 young Europeans from all 28 EU Member States attended EYE2016 and discussed topics currently affecting Europe. The Commissioner welcomed the two winners and congratulated Cedefop for its initiative which gives more visibility to vocational education and training (VET) and shows that it can be ‘a first choice, not a second option.’ Ms Thyssen stressed the importance of the agency’s work focusing on employability for citizens, e.g. skills anticipation and forecasting, apprenticeships and work-based learning. The Commissioner praised Cedefop’s work on education and training systems for the youth across Europe saying that it is ‘crucial for the upcoming Skills agenda’. One of the #CedefopPhotoAward winners, 24-year-old Vasiliki Kalopita, chose to send a photo that was taken during a youth exchange programme in Spain, focusing on the employability skills of young people through non-formal and intercultural learning methods. The other winning entry, by 18-year-old Antía Varela Torres, focused on women’s access to vocational education and training to illustrate that they can choose any profession regardless of stereotypes. In her closing remarks, Commissioner Thyssen encouraged Europe’s youth involved in education and training to contribute to the ongoing competition. She informed event participants that the #CedefopPhotoAward is still open until September 2016 and that the two winners of the second phase will be invited to Greece to visit Cedefop and join the opening of the 57th Thessaloniki International Film Festival in November. Commissioner Thyssen also spoke at the session ‘Skills gap: Bridge over troubled water’ about how to address young people’s skills gap. ‘One thing is clear: our education and training systems need to be more in tune with the real needs of employers. And we should be much more aware that there is no one-size-fits-all in Europe in terms of the skills demand,’ she said. Ms Thyssen added that ‘education should not only give a solid foundation for life and active citizenship, it should also open doors to quality job opportunities,’ and concluded that ‘apprenticeships are one good way of bringing the worlds of education and work closer together. We want to improve their quality and image, and to get more companies to create such opportunities.’ Downloads Press releaseEN41.37 KB 	https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news-and-press/press-and-media/press-releases/commissioner-thyssen-opens-cedefopphotoaward-exhibition-strasbourg

She said that Cedefop is an invaluable source of expertise for the European Commission to rely on, adding that ‘wherever I go, in discussions on vocational education and training (VET), Cedefop’s work is on the lips of my interlocutors.’ The Commissioner was greeted by the Chair of Cedefop’s Governing Board Micheline Scheys, Director James Calleja and Deputy Director Mara Brugia. Ms Scheys pointed out the importance of the Commissioner’s visit in getting to know Cedefop first hand. Mr Calleja welcomed the Commissioner to ‘the European house of vocational education and training’. He said that Cedefop is where ideas on skills, qualifications, youth employment and European tools are generated for stakeholders. ‘The next big challenge is the upcoming Skills agenda to which we have contributed and we look forward to helping implementing it so that no citizen is left behind,’ he added. Addressing the Cedefop staff, Ms Thyssen said that the Commission wants to get Europe working again by creating job opportunities. She added that ‘youth employment is a priority and thanks to Cedefop’s help we can make it happen.’ Ms Thyssen explained that the Commission’s Skills agenda aims to achieve a new boost for jobs, growth and investment and stressed that ‘we need your help to transform the agenda from ideas to results.’ The Commissioner said: ‘You are in a unique position to monitor and analyse VET trends. You can give direct support to policy implementation in Member States.’ She welcomed Cedefop’s ‘ambition to produce more country-specific reports.’ The Commissioner met with students from a local VET school who offered her handmade sweets and bread ‘I am more motivated than ever to work with you to make social changes European citizens deserve and to make VET a first choice, not a second option,’ she concluded.   Cedefop experts presented to Ms Thyssen various aspects of the agency’s work focusing on employability for citizens, particularly on skills anticipation and forecasting and the Skills Panorama website, apprenticeships and work-based learning, with special focus on SMEs.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0053	2016-03-02	NEWS	Exchange of views: Cedefop at the European Parliament and the EESC	 Left to right: Eurofound Director Juan Menéndez-Valdés, President of the Section for Employment, Social Affairs and Citizenship EESC Pavel Trantina ‎ and Cedefop Director James Calleja at the EESC Image copyright:  (c) Ana Dumitrache, EESC Technological advance, globalisation and integration of migrants pose new challenges to the labour market and have prompted a rethink about the skills needed and how to develop them. Initiatives to improve vocational education and training (VET) are underway across the European Union (EU). This was the central message of Cedefop Director James Calleja’s presentations to the European Parliament’s Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL) Committee, in Brussels on 23 February and the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) the following day. Europe’s ageing labour force has to cope with technological advance. Scope for automating jobs has increased significantly, with some studies suggesting that around 47% of jobs in the EU could be replaced by technology over the next 20 years. Further, over 80% of refugees entering the EU arrivals are younger than 35. Access to education, VET and the labour market is essential to their integration. Skill demand is changing and, in response, European and national VET policies are moving to increase access to training for all age groups. At the European Parliament, Mr Calleja highlighted Cedefop’s involvement in initiatives covering all aspects of learning for work: ‘Cedefop is monitoring the progress of VET reform in Europe and investigating the demands that globalisation and technology are making of VET.’ Emphasis is on developing core competences such as organisation and communication to help people adapt to change. Work-based learning and apprenticeships for adults and young people are being extended to match training more closely to labour market needs. The quality of VET is being improved, including better training for VET teachers and trainers. The European Commission, Member States and social partners are leading the work at European level, with Cedefop providing technical support through research, analyses and other expertise. Tools such as the European qualifications framework (EQF) and validation guidelines aim to speed up integration into the labour market and improve career prospects. Cedefop is also helping develop a mobility scoreboard to encourage mobility for VET and reviewing apprenticeship arrangements in Member States as part of the European alliance for apprenticeships. At the EESC, Mr Calleja emphasised the crucial role of the social partners. Without their cooperation in providing places for work-based learning, the European alliance for apprenticeships cannot succeed. The social partners also need to develop good jobs that provide people with the training they need to keep pace with change. According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey, more than 53% of adult employees in the EU have seen their tasks change significantly since they started their job, but around 22% have not developed their skills since starting their job. In 2016 and beyond, Cedefop will continue to work closely with Member States and social partners in implementing VET reform. Concluding his presentations to the European Parliament’s EMPL Committee and the EESC, Mr Calleja added: ‘Cedefop’s key role now and in the near future is to help implement VET reform. Between now and 2020 the guiding principle of Cedefop’s activities will be to think European and act locally.’ Downloads Press releaseEN523.77 KB 	https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news-and-press/press-and-media/press-releases/exchange-views-cedefop-european-parliament-and-eesc-0
CEDEFOP_NEWS_0060	2016-02-23	NEWS	Towards a new route: learning for work is changing	 Cedefop Director James Calleja Presenting Cedefop’s work to the European Parliament on 23 February The labour market is changing; so too is training and learning for work. Europe’s ageing labour force – by 2025, the number of people aged over 55 in the working population will rise substantially – has to cope with technological advance. Scope for automating jobs has increased significantly. Some studies suggest that around 47% of jobs in the European Union (EU) could be replaced by technology. But despite fears of job losses, employment in the EU is expected to pass its 2008 pre-crisis peak in 2020 and continue to rise. Many in work are busier than ever as new technology makes people more accessible and challenges traditional work patterns. These changes require new skills and, in response, European and national vocational education and training (VET) policies are moving. Efforts are being made to increase access to training for all age groups. Emphasis is being placed on developing core competences such as organisation and communications to help people adapt to change. Work-based learning and apprenticeships for adults and young people are being extended to match training more closely to labour market needs. Quality of VET is also being improved, including better training for VET teachers and trainers. The European Commission, Member States and social partners are leading the work at European level, but technical support through research, analyses and other expertise is provided by Cedefop. Presenting Cedefop’s work to the European Parliament on 23 February, Director James Calleja, said: ‘Initiatives to improve VET are underway across the EU. I am pleased to say that Cedefop is involved in many of them. We are monitoring the progress of VET reform across Europe and investigating the new demands that globalisation and technology are making on VET’. Cedefop also helped develop common tools such as the European qualifications framework (EQF), which compares all types of national qualifications with each other and those from other countries. Increasingly, countries see the EQF and the national qualifications frameworks linked as a tool to reform not only qualifications, but also education and training more widely. New European guidelines for validating informal and non-formal learning, published by Cedefop and the European Commission last year aim to speed up integration into the labour market and improve career prospects. In 2016, the European Commission will launch its skills agenda. ‘Cedefop provides skill supply and demand forecasts for the EU and each Member State and is treating skill mismatch as high policy priority,’ Mr Calleja added. ‘Our European skills and jobs survey provided unique insights into skill mismatch and how it changes over time. The survey highlighted that Europe not only has skill shortages, but does not fully use the skills that the labour force has.’ Other initiatives Cedefop is supporting include developing a mobility scoreboard to encourage mobility for VET and reviewing apprenticeship arrangements in Member States as part of the European alliance for apprenticeships. But Cedefop not only wants to provide new insights and information, but also be a knowledge broker, stimulating action to improve VET. Working closely with Member States and social partners in implementing VET reform is Cedefop’s challenge for 2016 and beyond. The changing labour market is prompting a rethink about many aspects of VET; how are skills developed; how can they be made visible on the labour market; how labour market uses the skills that people have and how can education and employment complement each other at all stages of lifelong learning. Cedefop is providing the food for thought and action by assisting Member States to think European but act locally.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0054	2016-02-12	NEWS	MEPs explore closer cooperation with Cedefop	 Ideas for closer cooperation between Cedefop and the European Parliament, as well as national representations, were explored during a two-day visit (10-11 February) to the EU agency of a delegation of the parliament’s Employment and Social Affairs Committee (EMPL). MEPs Kostadinka Kuneva from Greece and Jutta Steinruck from Germany (committee members), and Pieter Rook of the Committee Secretariat had meetings with Cedefop Director James Calleja, Deputy Director Mara Brugia, heads of departments and several experts who presented the agency’s work.  Both MEPs mentioned the need for Cedefop to be able to work more closely with Member State governments and parliaments, and offered their services to this purpose. Ms Kuneva said that the visit helped her understand the important work carried out by Cedefop’s management and staff: ‘This work helps us all realise the big labour market changes and seek the appropriate tools and policies in a Europe rocked by unemployment.’ She added that Cedefop offers relevant knowledge, methodology and an analytical approach to the Member State governments who seek substantial, not superficial, solutions to unemployment. The Greek MEP wondered why Cedefop is not utilised more by governments and public employment services, adding that they should make use of the agency’s studies on apprenticeship, skills and early leaving from education and training. Ms Steinruck said that Cedefop needs to be more visible in Member States since a lot of work has to be done at national and local levels. She expressed her appreciation of Cedefop’s work, which feeds into the work the Committee undertakes from time to time. The German MEP said contacts with the European Parliament should be intensified and more resources should be allocated to the agency to enable it to fulfil its mandate. In times of unemployment, with skill needs to be addressed, the role of Cedefop is becoming increasingly important. Ms Steinruck added: ‘Cedefop represents an important source of knowledge and information, which could shed new light on the prevailing issues Europe’s unemployed and low-skilled adults face when challenged by the demands of the labour market.’ In a reference to the digital economy, she pointed out that skills development has to be at the forefront and Cedefop could advise on vocational education and training (VET) reform and the social partners’ role. In his address, Mr Calleja indicated that in the short and medium term, Cedefop will be working closely with Member States and social partners to ensure VET reform in line with European policies and priorities based on national labour market needs. The Riga conclusions and Europe’s education and training 2020 targets govern Cedefop’s work programme 2016 and programming document 2017-20: ‘Working closely with the Commission and the European Parliament enables us to reach policy-makers and European citizens more effectively,’ concluded Mr Calleja. The two sides agreed to follow up their meetings and work closer together in the context of the EMPL Committee.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0059	2016-02-03	NEWS	Many qualifications frameworks in Europe now operational	 National qualifications frameworks (NQFs) across Europe are developing fast, evolving from a tool to describe qualifications systems into a means to reform and modernise them. Most countries in Europe have developed NQFs over the last decade, spurred by the European Parliament and Council 2008 recommendation on the European qualifications framework. Following an initial phase of work on the national frameworks’ design and formal adoption, many of these are now attaining maturity. Frameworks in 23 European countries have reached an operational stage. Fully operational frameworks increase the transparency and comparability of qualifications across countries and education systems. They directly benefit both education and training professionals and the general public, e.g. through qualifications databases and the inclusion of European qualifications levels on national diplomas and the Europass supplement. As NQFs develop, they take on new functions. Some NQFs take on a regulatory or reform role and directly influence the way qualification standards are set, curricula are designed, and teaching and training practices integrate learning outcomes. More information on recent developments in the field of qualifications frameworks can be found in Cedefop’s briefing note Qualifications frameworks in Europe – coming of age.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0063	2015-12-10	NEWS	Maximising skills for jobs and jobs for skills in the era of the robots	 More than 130 experts and representatives of governments, social partners, education and training, and the labour market discussed how technology and workplace change impact on skill needs and how to create partnerships to address skill mismatch at Cedefop’s high-level conference in Thessaloniki this week. Findings of Cedefop’s European skills and jobs (ESJ) survey, were also discussed at the conference, which featured some world-renowned speakers. Professor of Economics at Harvard University Richard Freeman talked about robots and the future of work. He argued that robotisation cannot be stopped and that the effect on people’s income depends on who owns the robots: ‘To prevent a small number from ruling the world, we must widen ownership of machines, robots and capital.’ He added: ‘We are entering a new world in which robots are going to be more human than many humans in their work, but won’t make many of the mistakes we make.’ Prof. Freeman predicted that future workers will not need to learn foreign languages, but the languages of computers: ‘Training and skills that work best in the new world are likely to differ from those in the past by being more computer-based.’ He spoke of the rise of the ‘robot-boss’, already in place in some big companies, and said that doctors and lawyers are as likely to lose their jobs to robots as truck drivers and factory workers. World Bank’s Lead Education Economist Harry Patrinos provided international evidence on returns on education and skills, which shows that ‘more education leads to higher earnings.’ He said that the average global private return to schooling is 10.4%, with the European Union being close to that average at 10%. He noted that private returns are about equal between general education and vocational education and training (VET), but the social returns on general education markedly outweigh those of vocational. He suggested people need to invest in skills early: ‘Those who start learning early continue to learn throughout their life.’ Cedefop Director James Calleja said: ‘As Europe is emerging from one of the worst economic crises, people need to align their skills with a labour market in which technology has spread from the production line to being online and everywhere. We know robots and machines create productivity. Some see them as teammates, others as tools taking their jobs away. With the rapid development of technology, learning on the job is the only way forward – hence work-based learning is VET’s future.’ He added: ‘Seeing the results of Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey, I believe skill mismatch mirrors a mismatch between education and employment. Employers need to get involved in education, and educators should play a bigger role in employment. This should be our next policy debate – building a policy highway from education to employment.’ Detlef Eckert, Director for Skills at the European Commission’s DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, mentioned the Skills Agenda to be launched by the Commission in 2016, adding that the initiative is ‘in essence about technology.’ Cedefop’s Head of Department for Skills and Labour Market Pascaline Descy said that skill mismatch is costly for individuals, employers and society in general: ‘The unexploited workforce potential is compromising EU efficiency, with 27% of workers being in dead-end jobs.’ Case studies relevant to the role of partnerships in building skills were presented during the conference, accompanied by a poster exhibition. Participants had the opportunity to learn about innovative projects and good practices from across and beyond the EU that discussed skill needs assessment and anticipation in companies and sectors, the role of VET providers in matching skills, and experience from the workplace. In her closing remarks, Cedefop Deputy Director Mara Brugia called for action to match jobs and skills better from the outset, saying that ‘the tools to do that exist (for example, Europass CV and supplement), but we need to become more aware of them and how to use them. There is also a need to manage people’s talents more effectively once they are in a job, with validation playing a key role in certifying skills learned on-the-job.’ She concluded: ‘We must rethink labour and social policies and think of measures to avoid leaving people behind. This requires more cooperation and trust, and Cedefop will remain at the forefront of developments.’ Notes to editors Launched in 2014, Cedefop’s ESJ survey asked 49 000 adult employees (aged 24 to 65) across all 28 EU Member States how their skills and qualifications match the needs of their jobs. The survey is the first to look at skill mismatch over time, taking account of changes to people’s skills and their job tasks. Evidence from the ESJ survey is available in a free downloadable report titled Skills, qualifications and jobs in the EU: the making of a perfect match?

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0067	2015-12-03	NEWS	Innovation and training: partners in change	 Innovation in the labour market is reshaping vocational education and training (VET). In response VET itself is becoming more dynamic and innovative.  In 2013, around 49% of the 22 million learners at upper-secondary level in the European Union (EU) were in VET. Developing their ability to innovate can bring considerable economic and social benefits. VET also supports social innovation. Civic competences and social awareness skills acquired through VET can improve work organisation and strengthen civil society. International cooperation is boosting innovation. Lubuskie province in Poland and Brandenburg State in Germany, have established an education cluster to share resources (workers, learners and infrastructure) between the municipalities, education providers and enterprises, as well as higher education and research institutions. Italy’s Porto futuro centre for guidance, training and employment drew from the experience of France’s Cité des Métiers and Spain’s Porta 22. Through the European alliance for apprenticeships, countries with strong apprenticeship traditions are sharing their experience of how to develop work-based learning. Using the alliance with Cedefop’s support, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Malta and Slovenia, for example, are reviewing their apprenticeship systems.  Although most initial VET is at secondary level, more people in the EU are studying VET at post-secondary and tertiary levels. VET curricula are also changing with the shift to learning outcomes. Learning inputs structure curricula and qualifications around the duration and place of learning. Learning outcomes base curricula on what a person knows and can do at the end of any type of learning experience, making it possible to take different routes to gain a qualification. Linked to curricula development is innovative teaching. Group work, problem-based and project-based approaches are developing. VET students in Norway’s Aust-Agder region acquire skills about energy-efficient house technology by converting homes built in the 1970s into energy-efficient ‘passive houses’. In Cyprus, VET students have developed garages with solar panels for charging hybrid/electric cars and benches with solar-powered USB connections for charging mobile phones at the bus stop or in the park. In the UK, the Studio School model of education offers personal learning plans and access to personal coaches to encourage independent learning and problem solving. Teaching is also changing with technology playing its part. Denmark’s emu.dk platform helps VET teachers and trainers improve the quality of learning in VET. Austria promotes instruction in digital competences for teachers through its EPICT (European Pedagogical ICT Licence) project, while Estonia is developing e-learning materials and the digital skills of VET teachers to enable them to create e-courses based on national curricula. One thing is increasingly clear; VET and innovation, rather than being separate issues are mutually supportive as one improves the other. More information about these developments and what is driving them can be found in Cedefop’s briefing note on innovation and VET.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0071	2015-12-03	NEWS	Maximising skills for jobs and jobs for skills	 More than one in four (27%) European employees are in dead-end positions with skills higher than needed to do their job and limited potential to grow. At the same time, 22% of employees say that their skills have not developed since they started their current job. These are some of the findings of Cedefop’s European skills and jobs (ESJ) survey, which will be discussed at a high-level conference in Thessaloniki on 7 and 8 December 2015. In his keynote speech, world-renowned Professor of Economics at Harvard University Richard Freeman will talk about robots and the future of work: is technology destroying jobs and skills? World Bank’s Lead Education Economist Harry Patrinos, also a keynote speaker, will provide international evidence on returns on education and skills. The conference hopes to stimulate discussion and identify key policy priorities, challenges and applicable solutions to the skill mismatch problem, with particular emphasis on the role of public-private partnerships and of supportive public policies. More than 100 experts in skills and skill mismatch, along with representatives of governments, social partners, education and training, and the labour market will engage in a series of discussions structured around two key thematic pillars: future challenges for vocational education and training (VET): impact of technology and workplace change on skill needs; fostering partnerships in the workplace: rising up to the challenge of skill mismatch. The objective of the conference is to provide a basis for policies that can stimulate skill demand through innovation and better jobs, effectively matched to the skills of young and adult workers, as stated in the Riga conclusions – the revised priorities for VET agreed by the European Commission, Member States and social partners in June 2015. Notes to editors Launched in 2014, Cedefop’s ESJ survey asked 49 000 adult employees (aged 24 to 65) across all 28 EU Member States how their skills and qualifications match the needs of their jobs.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0064	2015-11-23	NEWS	Vocational education and training and globalisation – changing expectations	 Cedefop is holding a conference on 26-27 November in Thessaloniki to discuss how globalisation influences national vocational education and training (VET) systems and how national VET provision can meet global needs. It will address issues such as quality assurance, cooperation between economic sectors and public authorities, and the renewal of standards, qualification requirements and curricula. Particular attention will be given to the role of economic sectors such as ICT, banking and finance, food and drink, automotive, welding and social work in driving these developments. Speakers will include representatives of the European Commission, governments, social partners and international organisations. In June 2015, EU ministers responsible for VET committed themselves to address the impact of globalisation on VET in Europe. Cedefop is now embarking on research to determine whether, and in what way, European and international sectoral qualifications, standards and curricula are affecting national systems of VET. Leaning too much on global solutions risks loosening standards and diluting the impact of education and training systems. But inadequate integration of such global solutions into the national training landscape risks undermining the relevance of national solutions on a global labour market, a situation which in the longer run, may undermine European competitiveness. The challenge for policy-makers is to cooperate with all interested parties so as to develop VET for a globalised economy – for each sector, and within each education and training system. Cedefop’s forthcoming briefing note Vocational education and training and globalisation – changing expectations and requirements describes in detail what is at stake.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0065	2015-11-20	NEWS	40 years working for you	 More than 200 participants explored and debated work organisation and skill development practices that benefit both employers and employees at a joint seminar organised by Cedefop, Eurofound and the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) in Brussels on 19 November. The seminar was an opportunity to present to policy-makers, academics, practitioners and representatives from national authorities, European institutions, enterprises and trade unions the findings of Eurofound's Third European Company Survey and Cedefop's European skills and jobs survey. The event also marked the 40-year anniversary of Cedefop and Eurofound - the two longest established EU agencies - and recognised the EESC’s strong tripartite role in EU policy-making. Both agencies are tripartite organisations with a governing structure of employers, trade unions and governments. Eurofound Director Juan Menéndez-Valdés said: 'Eurofound's work on new forms of work organisation goes back to the 1970s. The objective at that time and still today is to identify practices that help companies improve their performance while also leading to higher levels of employee wellbeing. By providing evidence on how these win-win outcomes can be achieved we are fulfilling our mandate.' Cedefop Director James Calleja noted: 'Last year, as part of its work on skills, Cedefop carried out its European skills and jobs survey, a major investigation of skill mismatch among adult employees across all 28 EU Member States. The survey is the first to look at skill mismatch over time to take account of changes to people’s skills and their job tasks. Its findings make a strong case for expanding work-based learning; for investing in continuing vocational education and training and adult learning; and show that good jobs develop good skills. All these have important implications for the social dialogue.' EESC Vice-President, Gonçalo Lobo Xavier, underlined: 'Employment is at the heart of citizens' concerns. Not only do we need to create jobs in Europe but also to better match people skills with the market's needs. The EESC is pleased to celebrate 40 years of efforts carried by Cedefop and Eurofound to create an optimal work environment. We, as organised civil society, will keep advocating in the long run for a better organisation of the workplace.' In his closing remarks, Nicolas Schmit, Luxembourg’s Minister of Labour, Employment and the Social and Solidarity Economy, congratulated both agencies on their anniversary and their work. He talked about how technology is transforming the economy, pointing out: 'It is important to understand what the opportunities of this transformation are, as well as the risks for employment, for companies and society in general.' He added that technological acceleration may overtake us, which is why policy-makers in Europe need to take steps to provide citizens and enterprises with the tools to keep up with it. Notes to editors The European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) supports the development of European vocational education and training (VET) policies and contributes to their implementation. The role of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) is to provide knowledge in the area of social and work-related policies. The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) is a consultative body of the European Union. For more information please go to the following links: www.cedefop.europa.eu, http://www.eurofound.europa.eu and www.eesc.europa.eu. Cedefop and Eurofound were the first two specialist EU Agencies to be set up by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union to carry out specific legal, technical and scientific tasks in the European Union. The 42 EU Agencies account for 13% of all EU staff and represent 1.5% of the total EU budget. They are an important component of the EU institutional architecture, and add value by providing timely and reliable expertise in specific areas that are critically relevant both to the competitiveness and the job-rich growth of the European Union, as well as to the lives of all Europeans in areas as diverse as medicines, education, chemical safety, justice, security, transport, fundamental rights and the environment.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0070	2015-11-05	NEWS	Engaging SMEs in apprenticeships – Cedefop conference	 Following on from the success of the first European apprenticeship conference in 2014, Cedefop’s second such event, on 9 and 10 November in Thessaloniki, will be a learning experience addressed to a wide range of stakeholders with a role in helping small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) increase their apprenticeship offer. Participants will learn from: success stories – how SMEs take the lead and set apprenticeship programmes; national practices put in place by industry, social partners, public authorities, and other bodies that have a role in supporting SMEs; messages brought forward by the employers’ representatives at European and national levels. The keynote speaker will be British entrepreneur Jason Holt, CEO, Holts Group of companies, who has won awards and honours for his contribution to promoting apprenticeship. He is a leading SME employer that set up the UK’s sole provider of government-accredited training to the wider jewellery sector. Mr Holt is also Chairman of the Apprenticeship Stakeholder Board at the UK’s Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. The conference is an opportunity for participants to identify ideas that may be turned into cross-country partnerships, find partners, and understand how they may finance their ideas and turn them into reality. The following funding opportunities will be presented: an Erasmus+ call for proposals, which aims at supporting SMEs engaging in apprenticeships; European Social Fund; European Investment Bank. Cedefop expert Ramona David, who organises the conference, said: ‘Small and medium-sized enterprises employ two thirds of the European workforce, but data show that they are more reluctant to engage in training apprentices than larger companies. The challenges they face are known, but ways to overcome them may be less so. The conference is an excellent occasion to discover opportunities and create partnerships to support SMEs in this endeavour.’ Notes to editors You can find the conference agenda here. The conference will be hosted at The MET Hotel, 26th Oktovriou St 48, 546 27 Thessaloniki. There will be interview opportunities with Cedefop experts and participants.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0062	2015-10-16	NEWS	Deutschland vor silbernen Zeiten: Prognosen zu Qualifikationsangebot und  nachfrage	 Demografie und Wirtschaft beeinflussen die Beschäftigungsentwicklung Deutschland ist neben Frankreich, Österreich, Schweden und dem Vereinigten Königreich eines von mehreren Ländern, die heute einen höheren Beschäftigungsstand aufweisen als vor der Wirtschaftskrise. Dennoch sagen Prognosen für Deutschland bis 2025 vorläufig einen Beschäftigungsrückgang voraus – und das trotz des Wirtschaftswachstums. Grund: das sinkende Arbeitskräfteangebot (Abbildung 1). Wie sich der derzeitige Flüchtlingszustrom auf die Gesamtbeschäftigung auswirken wird, ist dabei noch nicht absehbar. Abbildung 1. Früherer und prognostizierter Beschäftigungsstand, Deutschland (in Millionen) Quelle: Qualifikationsprognosen des Cedefop (2015). Die Gesamtzahl der prognostizierten Beschäftigungsmöglichkeiten in Deutschland setzt sich laut Cedefop – der mit Berufsbildung und Arbeitsmarktanalyse befassten EU-Agentur – aus neu geschaffenen Arbeitsplätzen und aus aufgrund von Wechsel oder Verrentung frei werdenden Stellen zusammen. Während bis 2025 90 % der Beschäftigungsmöglichkeiten in Europa dadurch entstehen, dass Arbeitskräfte ersetzt werden müssen, so die Prognose des Cedefop, werden es in Deutschland fast 100 % sein. Die Bevölkerungsprognose für Deutschland verdeutlicht die Gründe hierfür: So wird die Zahl der über 55-Jährigen, die entweder erwerbstätig sind oder einen Arbeitsplatz suchen, deutlich ansteigen. Alle anderen Altersgruppen werden mit Ausnahme der 35- bis 39-jährigen den Voraussagen zufolge schrumpfen (Abbildung 2). Ähnliche Alterungsmuster bei der Erwerbsbevölkerung werden für Griechenland, Estland, Spanien, Lettland, Litauen, Portugal und Slowenien erwartet. Wie und ob die Qualifikationen der in Deutschland ankommenden Flüchtlinge mittelfristig die Qualifikationsnachfrage am Arbeitsmarkt decken können werden, ist noch offen. Abbildung 2. Veränderungen der Altersstruktur der Bevölkerung im Erwerbsalter und der Erwerbsbevölkerung, 2013-25, Deutschland (in %) Quelle: Qualifikationsprognosen des Cedefop (2015). Aufgrund der Alterung der bereits ansässigen Erwerbsbevölkerung treten immer mehr Menschen in den Ruhestand. Die demografischen Trends lassen jedoch darauf schließen, dass auch mehr und mehr Personen in erwerbsfähigem Alter außerhalb des Arbeitsmarkts stehen werden, weil sie familiäre Verpflichtungen haben, krank sind, unter einer Behinderung leiden oder die Hoffnung auf einen Arbeitsplatz aufgegeben haben. Um Beschäftigungsniveau und Wirtschaftswachstum zu sichern, muss Deutschland neue Wege erschließen, unter anderem durch Aus- und Weiterbildungsmaßnahmen, damit sowohl diese Menschen, von denen viele gut qualifiziert sind, als auch die Neuankömmlinge in den Arbeitsmarkt integriert werden können. Hinweise für Redakteure Die Prognosen des Cedefop zu Qualifikationsangebot und -nachfrage bis 2025 beruhen auf der weltweiten Wirtschaftsentwicklung bis Oktober 2014. Die Prognosen gehen von einer bescheidenen wirtschaftlichen Erholung aus, die allmählich zu mehr Zuversicht in der EU und damit zu einer verstärkten Investitionstätigkeit, zu höheren Verbraucherausgaben und zu einer Steigerung der Exporte führen wird. Die Inflation liegt im Bereich der Zielvorgabe, das Zinsniveau ist niedrig, und dank höherer Steuereinnahmen können die Regierungen leichter Schulden abbauen. Die Annahmen basieren auf der neuesten Bevölkerungsprognose von Eurostat (Europop 2013) und der kurzfristigen makroökonomischen Prognose der Europäischen Kommission vom November 2014. Die Prognosen des Cedefop beziehen sich auf die 28 EU-Mitgliedstaaten sowie Island, Norwegen und die Schweiz. Die Ergebnisse, Annahmen und angewandten Methoden werden regelmäßig aktualisiert und von nationalen Experten überprüft. Zur Erstellung der Prognosen werden harmonisierte Daten und Methoden herangezogen, um Ländervergleiche zu ermöglichen. Sie sind kein Ersatz für nationale Prognosen.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0061	2015-10-15	NEWS	Vocational training counteracts and helps prevent early leaving from education and training	 Vocational education and training (VET) can help attract young people with different abilities and learning backgrounds to education. It also plays a decisive role in retaining them in the education system or reintegrating them after a drop-out experience. Recent datasets contain a wealth of qualitative information on young school leavers’ and returners’ trajectories and their individual motives: What type of education/training programme have they left, and why? How many of them return to education? How many choose VET pathways? And how many graduate eventually? New findings which shed light on these issues are presented in Cedefop’s briefing note on the causes of and remedies to early leaving from education and training.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0068	2015-10-08	NEWS	Poland: Economic growth is not enough to increase employment	 Not a lack of economic growth, but rather a lack of people in the labour market could hold back employment in Poland over the next decade. According to forecasts produced by Cedefop, employment in Poland is expected to be slightly lower in 2025 than it is today (Figure 1). In contrast, in the EU overall, employment is expected to rise to its highest levels over the next 10 years. Figure 1. Past and forecast employment, Poland (millions) Source: Cedefop skills forecasts (2015). There will be job opportunities due to newly created jobs or vacancies to replace people going to other jobs or leaving the labour market. In Poland, between now and 2025, job growth is forecast for the distribution and transport sector and in business and other services. Construction is also expected to see a small increase in jobs. Demand is expected to be high for high-level professional occupations in science, engineering healthcare, business and teaching, but also for service and sales workers. To meet demand Poland will have a more highly-qualified workforce. By 2020, around 67% of 30 to 34 year olds in Poland should have high-level qualifications, well above the EU’s target of 40%. The problem is that labour market participation - the proportion of people of working age either working or looking for work - in Poland is forecast to remain between 53% and 52% over the next decade, compared to 55.5% for the EU. One reason is that Poland’s population is getting older (Figure 2). As the labour force ages, more people leave it to retire. Between now and 2025, there will be a significant fall in numbers of people aged between 15 and 39 participating in the labour market. But it also implies that significant numbers of people of working age are outside the labour market for reasons, such as family responsibilities, illness or disability, or because they have given up hope of finding a job. To increase employment levels, as well as economic growth, Poland needs to find ways, including training, to bring these people, many of them well-qualified, into its labour force.  Figure 2.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0066	2015-10-08	NEWS	Ireland: Employment growth forecast but a smaller labour force	 The forecasts produced by Cedefop - a European Union (EU) agency that analyses training and the labour market – show that, between now and 2025, most job growth will be in construction – the sector worst hit by the crisis. Other sectors that should see job growth are distribution and transport sector and business and other services and non-marketed (mainly public) services (Figure 1).   Figure 1. Past and forecast employment, Ireland (millions) Source: Cedefop skills forecasts (2015). Job opportunities include new jobs and vacancies to replace people going to other jobs or leaving the labour market. In Ireland, most job opportunities, around 19%, are forecast to be for high-level professional occupations in science, engineering, healthcare, business and teaching, followed by around 15% for both service and sales workers and elementary occupations. Reflecting growth in construction, the share of job opportunities for craft and related workers in Ireland, around 12%, is well above the EU average of 5% for these types of workers (Figure 2). Less encouraging is that labour market participation - the proportion of people of working age either working or looking for work - is forecast to fall from 60% in 2013 to around 55% in 2025, close to the EU forecast average of 55.5%. Labour market participation can fall for several reasons. More young people staying in education and training longer before looking for their first job reduces participation. However, in the longer term this can be positive as it leads to a more highly qualified labour force. According to Cedefop, by 2020, around 63% of 30 to 34 year olds in Ireland will have high level qualifications, well above the EU’s target of 40%. An ageing population can also reduce labour market participation as more people retire. Ireland’s labour force is getting older. Population growth is projected to be mainly in the age groups over 45 years (Figure 2). But participation also falls because people of working age leave the labour market for other reasons, such as family responsibilities, illness or disability, while some just give up hope of finding a job. Such people, should they wish to return to the labour market need to have opportunities, including training to help them find a new job. As well as welcome news about jobs overall, the forecasts show that demography and not just economics are influencing employment. To achieve high levels of employment, economic growth is not enough. People need to be encouraged to stay in or return to the labour market. Figure 2.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0073	2015-10-08	NEWS	Malta: Qualifying for success	 The outlook for Malta’s labour market over the next decade is reasonably good, but skills need to improve to sustain it. The forecasts produced by Cedefop - a European Union (EU) agency that analyses training and the labour market – show that between now and 2025, employment in Malta is expected to continue to be high (Figure 1). Job growth, like elsewhere in the EU will be driven by the business services and the distribution and transport sectors, with some small job losses predicted in manufacturing and construction. Figure 1 Past and forecast employment, Malta (millions) Source: Cedefop skills forecasts (2015). However, Cedefop data show that Malta lags behind the EU in educational attainment (Figure 2). While Malta should exceed the EU benchmark of 40% of 30 to 34 year olds having university-level qualifications by 2020, around 29% of Malta’s labour force will still have low-level qualifications by 2025, more than twice the 14% forecast for the EU. At 34%, the proportion of people forecast to have medium-level qualifications in Malta is also well below the EU average of 48%. Figure 2 Labour force trends by qualifications 2005-25, Malta (and EU) (%) Source: Cedefop skills forecasts (2015). Too many young people in Malta, around 20%, leave the education and training system with low-level qualifications compared to the EU average of 12%. Malta is one of several countries including Spain, Portugal and Romania that may not reach the EU benchmark of reducing early school leaving to below 10% by 2020. These trends matter. Almost all new jobs created in Malta over the next decade are forecast to require high- or medium-level qualifications. Between now and 2025, most job opportunities, around 26%, will be for professional occupations in science, engineering healthcare, business and teaching, followed by 20% for service and sales workers. Raising qualification levels in Malta provides an opportunity to align skills more closely to labour market needs, for example through apprenticeships. Cedefop is working with Malta, Greece, Italy, Lithuania and Slovenia reviewing apprenticeships as part of their national VET reforms as part of the European Alliance for Apprenticeships. While successful, there are not many apprenticeships in Malta and those that exist only cover medium-level qualifications. According to Cedefop director James Calleja, there are strong arguments for increasing apprenticeships across sectors and qualification levels. ‘Apprenticeships provide employment opportunities for young people,’ he says. ‘In Malta in 2012, of those who did not continue studying after completing their apprenticeship, 92% were in employment. Apprenticeships also have a very small dropout rate and can reduce early school leaving. Current apprenticeship reforms in Malta may link education and work more closely and so help young people, raise qualifications levels and contribute to keeping employment in Malta high.’ Notes to editors Cedefop skill supply and demand forecasts up to 2025 take account of global economic developments up to October 2014.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0075	2015-10-05	NEWS	Europe needs better jobs for better-matched skills – Cedefop survey	 Source: Cedefop ESJ survey, 2015. Image copyright:  Source: Cedefop ESJ survey, 2015. Many of the skills Europe needs for sustainable economic recovery will be learned at work. According to Cedefop’s new European skills and jobs survey, to overcome skill mismatches, more and better jobs that invest in people’s skills are needed. Employees face a constant challenge to learn new things to keep up with rapidly changing skill demands. The survey, the first pan-European on skill mismatch, finds that almost half (47%) of EU adult workers have seen the technologies they use change since they started their job; 21% also consider it very likely that several of their skills will become outdated in the next five years. Many of these workers are professionals and technicians occupied in fast-evolving sectors, such as ICT and financial services. But change does not only affect high-skilled workers. The majority of employees in semi-skilled occupations have also seen their jobs require a greater variety of tasks since they started them. Cedefop Director James Calleja says: ‘Developing the right blend of technical and soft skills in high-quality initial vocational education and training (IVET) programmes is essential for keeping up with job demands, but VET cannot stand alone in the fight against skill mismatch. Skill mismatch is two-sided; people need to have the right skills for the job, but good jobs can be enablers of long-term careers.’ Many of the skills European workplaces need are in fact not learned at school but informally at work. Good jobs that provide opportunities to learn are a sign of a healthy labour market. But Europe needs more of them. The recession that followed the 2008 financial crisis reduced not only the number of jobs, but also the number of good jobs available. More people across the EU have had to take up positions below their qualification or skill level. Cedefop’s survey finds that a quarter of tertiary education graduates in Europe are overqualified for their job. Many new jobs are temporary; although this can act as a stepping stone to employment, it can also limit skill development. Cedefop’s survey observes that the unemployed tend to return to the labour market more frequently in temporary roles that require fewer skills and offer fewer learning opportunities. Although having a job is better than no job, accepting a bad-quality job may compromise skill formation and scar one’s future. The survey also finds that more than one in five adult workers have failed to improve their skills since starting their job; most of them are in dead-end positions with limited opportunities to use and develop their skills. Some 41% of EU jobs only need basic literacy skills, while 58% only need basic numeracy skills. In this technological age, 33% of adult employees need only basic or no ICT skills to do their job. Developing skills that bring competitive advantage requires investment in training, but also the design of good jobs that can harness people’s skills. ‘Organisations have a significant degree of control in crafting autonomous and learning-intensive jobs, which use and cultivate workers’ skills better,’ say Konstantinos Pouliakas and Giovanni Russo, Cedefop experts who designed the survey. The survey finds several sectors to be more likely to underuse skills, such as retail and sales, accommodation, catering and food services, transportation and storage, cultural industries and social and personal services. Europe needs more jobs, but we may only prolong the economic crisis legacy if people do not have good jobs in which to use and further develop their talents and skills. Notes to editors Cedefop’s European skills and jobs (ESJ) survey is a study of around 49 000 adult employees (aged 24-65) in all 28 European Union Member States that examines how people’s qualifications and skills are matched (or not) to the changing skill demands of their jobs and the extent to which employees’ skills are developed and used in their workplace. It is the first pan-European survey on skill mismatch. Data were collected using quota sampling, following extensive testing, including a pilot survey in January 2014. A large-scale mixed mode (online plus telephone interviewing) employee survey was conducted between March and May 2014 to collect the data. Results and indicators will be available on Cedefop’s website and the European Union’s Skills Panorama web portal.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0076	2015-10-01	NEWS	Creating a European community of practice for learning outcomes	 One of Cedefop’s main priorities is to support EU Member States and social partners in further developing and improving vocational education and training (VET) and lifelong learning policies and practices. To be able to do this systematically, Cedefop has launched a series of policy learning forums on a range of subjects. The aim is to establish a continuous process of sharing and learning where initial policy learning events are followed up through continued cooperation. Experts from 24 countries gathered in Thessaloniki on 24-25 September for the first forum, which addressed the way the learning outcomes principle and approach is used to define and describe VET qualifications across Europe. In his opening speech, Cedefop Director James Calleja said that he was delighted to see that the hard work the experiment entailed was bearing fruit, adding: 'In this joint effort with the Commission, our intention is to support Member States and social partners directly on focused policy issues that raise VET to high-quality levels and increase employability for young and older learners.' Learning outcomes are used to define and describe what a student or pupil is expected to know, be able to do, and understand after having completed a course or qualification. Learning outcome descriptions operate at the heart of education and training, endeavouring to express an education and training system’s intentions but also to capture labour market needs. Research carried out by Cedefop demonstrates that while the learning outcomes approach is rapidly gaining ground across Europe, the diversity of interpretations and applications calls for further dialogue and sharing of experiences. September’s policy learning forum responded to this need for mutual learning, with an in-depth discussion on challenges and opportunities. Using three VET qualifications as a starting point – for plumbing, machine operation and travel/tourism – participants took part in exchanges on national practices and identified challenges and opportunities. Cedefop expert Jens Bjornavold said: ‘A key objective of these policy learning forums is to create a European community of practice, allowing for long-term joint developments in this area, improving overall quality and transparency of VET qualifications.’ The forum will be followed in 2016 by the development of a Cedefop handbook for writing learning outcomes, and targeted follow-up events directed at groups of countries. 	https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news-and-press/press-and-media/press-releases/creating-european-community-practice-learning-outcomes
CEDEFOP_NEWS_0069	2015-09-01	NEWS	Adults are learning, but need more encouragement	 Europe’s labour force is getting older, but not enough adults participate in learning. In 2014, just over 10% of adults (aged between 25 and 64) participated in lifelong learning, well below the European Union’s (EU’s) target benchmark of 15% by 2020. There are signs that more employers are providing training, but other changes are needed to encourage adults to learn more. According to the continuing vocational training survey (CVTS), which measures training in enterprises, in 2010, 38% of employees participated in continuing training courses up from 33% in 2005. The survey also found that, despite the economic downturn, between 2005 and 2010 the proportion of enterprises providing training increased from 60% to 66%. But problems in finding time and the costs are barriers both to employers providing and adults participating in learning. Cedefop has looked at how EU Member States are trying to increase adult learning. Many have developed and expanded different learning formats, such as modular courses, to overcome the barriers of time. Member States also have a range of financial measures for individuals and employers to overcome cost problems. But the benefits to the individual of participating in and to the employer of providing training also need to be clearer. For individuals, adult learning often does not lead to a qualification. Consequently, people may be discouraged from participating. Opportunities to validate all types of non-formal and informal learning, including that taking place at work so that it counts towards a recognised qualification and/or other learning pathways could encourage more adults to participate. How employers perceive the benefits of adult learning is influenced by their business strategy. The 2010 CVTS found that for 77% of the enterprises that do not provide training their main reason was that they saw no need. But whether or not an enterprise provides training can depend on if it sees training as a medium- or long-term investment for competitiveness and innovation. A Eurobarometer in 2013 found that 51% of EU enterprises investing in training expect the benefits to last less than two years. Support for small and medium-sized enterprises to integrate adult learning into their business strategies may encourage more employers to provide training.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0078	2015-07-01	NEWS	Jobs and skills in Europe – outlook variable	 By 2020, employment in the European Union (EU) is forecast to be back to its 2008 pre-crisis levels (Figure 1). But the overall picture masks differences between countries on the rate of job growth and the types of jobs that will be available, highlighting the varied challenges for vocational education and training systems across countries and sectors. Cedefop – an EU agency that analyses training policies and the labour market – forecasts that employment, for example, in Italy, the Netherlands and Slovakia, should be back to pre-crisis levels by 2020. But in other countries such as the Czech Republic, Greece, Spain and Portugal, employment is expected to still be below pre-crisis levels by 2025. This contrasts with other Member States, including Germany, France, Austria, Sweden and the UK, where there are already more jobs than before the crisis began in 2008.   Figure 1 Past and forecast employment, EU (millions) Source: Cedefop skills forecasts (2015) Cedefop also forecasts that between now and 2025 business and other services will drive employment growth in most countries (Figure 2). But in Spain, Cyprus, Poland and Romania, for example, most job growth is forecast for the distribution and transport sector. Despite manufacturing jobs declining in the EU overall, small increases are foreseen for Ireland, Cyprus, Poland, Latvia, Slovakia and Finland. Jobs on offer will also vary considerably across countries up to 2025. Cedefop predicts that around a third of job opportunities in Denmark and Poland will be for high-level professional jobs in science, engineering, healthcare, business and education. In Malta and Austria around a fifth of job opportunities are forecast to be for service and sales workers, while in Romania almost one vacancy in two will be for skilled agriculture and fisheries workers. Figure 2 Employment trends by sector, average annual growth rate 2003-25, EU (%) Source: Cedefop skills forecasts (2015) Employers and jobs are also expected to be more demanding, requiring more high-level qualifications. In several countries including Belgium, Luxembourg, Sweden, Slovenia and Slovakia at least half of all job opportunities up to 2025 are forecast to require high-level qualifications. But Cedefop foresees significant numbers of jobs requiring medium-level qualifications and most people in the EU will continue to be employed at this level. Although a little smaller and older, the EU’s workforce will be better qualified. All Member States should reach, or be very close to, the EU’s benchmark of 40% of 30 to 34 year-olds having university-level qualifications by 2020. Numbers of people with no qualifications are also forecast to fall. Some 18 Member States have already reached the EU’s target of reducing the number of young people leaving the education and training system with low-level qualifications to below 10% by 2020. Vocational education and training systems across countries and sectors are already being reformed, but will need to adapt further to seize the opportunities job growth may bring.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0077	2015-06-23	NEWS	Cedefop: acting as a catalyst for an apprenticeship culture	 Mr Calleja (left) at the panel discussing apprenticeships ‘Our role as a European Union agency is to act as a catalyst and facilitate apprenticeship programmes,’ said Cedefop Director James Calleja at the ministerial meeting which endorsed the Riga conclusions on vocational education and training (VET) on Monday. A panellist in the afternoon session which focused on the European alliance for apprenticeships (EAfA), Mr Calleja contributed to the discussion on how to get companies on board, particularly SMEs: ‘We will focus on how we can foster more partnerships between governments and businesses to promote apprenticeships. We need to help instil a culture of apprenticeships as it exists in Switzerland and some Member States.’ The alliance was launched in 2013 to fight youth unemployment in Europe. It is supported by the Commission, Member States and the European social partners. Mr Calleja urged VET stakeholders to ‘transform the EAfA into action at national, regional and local levels to help local alliances between businesses, young people and public institutions and secure return on investment for companies but above all for individuals.’ ‘One lesson I have learned,’ he added, ‘is that employers' involvement is very important. Financial resources must be increased to entice businesses and schools to engage in apprenticeships; for their own good and for the good of young people and society as a whole.’ Mr Calleja pointed to the experience Cedefop has had this year with country reviews: ‘We have seen that jobs create apprenticeships. Investment in growth is important.’ He concluded that apprenticeship culture has to start as early as possible, in school, while children are still young and that such culture has to be backed by partnerships between schools and businesses and between those engaged in the world of education and those in the world of employment. More than 40 companies and other organisations signed pledges to join the EAfA in Riga. They will make a total of 140 000 apprenticeships and training opportunities available to young people. Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility Marianne Thyssen welcomed the new partners, adding: 'Helping Europe's young people to access quality jobs is at the top of my priorities. Together we will create new opportunities for young people to learn the skills and gain the experience needed in the labour market.' Mr Calleja also participated in a workshop for Heads of Delegations in which he stressed the importance of injecting more financial support to VET at European and country levels as well as awareness of the benefits of linking theoretical to practical learning. On Sunday, a Cedefop delegation consisting of Mr Calleja, Deputy Director Mara Brugia and expert Lore Schmid took part in the meeting of Directors General for vocational education and training (DGVT), which prepared the Riga conclusions for endorsement and discussed a possible follow-up to be done by Cedefop and the European Training Foundation (ETF).

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0080	2015-06-15	NEWS	Cedefop celebrates 40 years’ contribution to European vocational education and training	 Image copyright:  Cedefop Cedefop celebrated 40 years’ contribution to vocational education and training (VET) in Europe and 20 years in Greece with the opening of an exhibition on its history (11 June) and a conference (12 June). Friends and stakeholders, Commission representatives, Governing Board members, and present and former staff were invited to the festivities. In his speech before opening the anniversary exhibition, European Commission Director-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion Michel Servoz said that employment recovery depends on skills, vocational education and training, and apprenticeships. Cedefop Director James Calleja noted that 'what Cedefop does, improving and promoting learning for work, has proved to be important over the past 40 years and promises to be even more important for the next and for future generations.' He added that continuing to improve VET is essential to put all of Europe on the road to a strong and sustainable economic recovery. In a video message, European Parliament President Martin Schulz underlined that ‘the main challenge Cedefop now faces is that of elevating vocational training back to the level of respect it enjoyed many decades ago, while at the same time addressing today's realities, especially the need for a very adaptable workforce’, adding that Europe will be counting on Cedefop’s input. Greek Alternate Minister for Administrative Reform George Katrougalos argued that 'in developing VET, Cedefop is deeply rooted in social values at a time and context where we all need to do much more to strengthen social Europe.' Thessaloniki Mayor Yiannis Boutaris thanked Cedefop for its work, stating that during his term, cooperation between the municipality and the agency has taken on a new dimension. Representing Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility Marianne Thyssen, the member of her Cabinet Julie Fionda referred to the Commissioner's aim for VET to be recognised as ‘first choice and not a second option’ by parents and young people. Cedefop's conference on 12 June, under its anniversary motto 'old roots for new routes,' looked at how VET has developed into its present role and discussed its future orientations up to 2020. Opening the conference, Mr Servoz stressed that job creation is very much at the top of the European agenda and clearly linked to VET and skills. Notes to editors Cedefop’s anniversary exhibition charts the political and social circumstances which led to its establishment in 1975, and the events that have shaped its work over the past four decades – first in Berlin and then in Thessaloniki. Through images, texts and artefacts, the exhibition illustrates Cedefop’s eventful history and the main themes of its work, including vocational education and training research, policy analysis and support for mobility. Following its inauguration at the 11 June event, it will be on display at Cedefop’s premises as of 15 June. More info, news and video interviews on Cedefop’s anniversary are available here. Cedefop Director James Calleja is available for interviews.

Discussions mainly focused on library management tools, collaboration and information sharing. Eurolib, the collaboration group of libraries of the EU institutions, EU agencies and services, held its 2015 general assembly on 21 and 22 May at Cedefop in Thessaloniki, Greece. Discussions mainly focused on library management tools, collaboration and information sharing. Chairing the Presidency of the Eurolib network since 2010, Marc Willem, Head of Cedefop’s Research support centre, presented a common European approach towards issues such as provision of access to EU documentation, EU publications and EU grey literature. A workshop focused on an important issue for all EU organisations: the setting-up of Open Access institutional repositories. The participants looked at practical issues, based on testimonials from Eurolib libraries and identified common challenges. Follow-up actions will include a feasibility study and a technical meeting in autumn in Brussels or Luxembourg.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0079	2015-03-31	NEWS	European countries make progress in training reform	 Reform of training systems under the voluntary European framework for cooperation in training, known as the Copenhagen process, has improved training in Europe. However, the full benefits of the changes made still need to be felt by people and enterprises. Since 2010, all countries have been actively reforming their vocational education and training (VET) systems, following objectives set out in the Bruges communiqué. Even countries with strong training systems, such as Germany, France Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Malta, Austria, Finland and the UK, have all adapted existing and introduced new measures since 2010. Others such as Bulgaria, Estonia, Greece, Croatia, Portugal, Poland and Romania have improved their systems and made up ground over the period. According to a new report from Cedefop, the main changes in training since 2010 made by European countries are systemic improvements, namely legislative or policy changes to adapt existing or introduce new programmes, pathways and qualifications (Figure). Improving training quality and attracting more young people into training have also been high on many national agendas. The reforms made by countries reveal a revived interest in apprenticeship and other forms of work-based learning. National qualifications frameworks (NQFs), which began as a way to support mobility by making it easier to understand and compare qualifications from other countries, have become a catalyst for improving access to learning and individualising learning paths across educational sectors, including higher education. Systems to validate non-formal and informal learning are slowly improving. There is increasing emphasis on using training to bring low-skilled and other vulnerable groups back into the labour market. Helped by these changes, the European Union (EU) is on track to reach its target of an average early school-leaving rate of 10% or less by 2020 and participation in training by low-skilled people and other at-risk groups is rising. However, overall participation of adults in lifelong learning has not developed as well as hoped. Most countries have still to reach the EU’s target of 15% adult participation in lifelong learning by 2020. Concerns remain over securing funding for training. Employers and social partners need to work more closely with education authorities. Basic skills still need to be improved and teachers and trainers themselves need more learning opportunities. Adjusting to labour market needs requires flexible education and training opportunities that combine different types and levels of learning throughout life. This is not yet a reality for everyone. European cooperation has made training better, but there is more to learn. More in the Cedefop briefing note Stronger vocational education and training for better lives.

Ο κ. Καλέγια μίλησε για την ιστορία και το μέλλον του Cedefop σε εκδήλωση για την επέτειο των 40 χρόνων από την ίδρυσή του και των 20 από την εγκατάστασή του στη Θεσσαλονίκη, την Τρίτη στα γραφεία του κέντρου: «Το Cedefop δημιουργήθηκε σε μια εποχή, στη δεκαετία του ’70, κατά την οποία υπήρχε ξεσηκωμός των φοιτητών στην Ευρώπη και πολλά εκπαιδευτικά συστήματα περνούσαν κρίση. Ο κόσμος τότε ήταν διαφορετικός, αλλά τα σημαντικά ζητήματα δε διέφεραν από τα τωρινά. Οι βασικοί στόχοι του οργανισμού τότε ήταν η αντιμετώπιση της ανεργίας των νέων, για την οποία ακούμε να γίνεται λόγος καθημερινά και τώρα, οι ίσες επαγγελματικές ευκαιρίες για άντρες και γυναίκες, η κατάσταση των αλλοδαπών εργαζομένων και η άνοδος των νέων τεχνολογιών, θέματα για τα οποία μιλάμε ακόμη σήμερα.» Συνοψίζοντας τους σημερινούς στόχους του κέντρου, ο κ. Καλέγια είπε: «Οι τρεις βασικές μας υποχρεώσεις είναι να κάνουμε την επαγγελματική εκπαίδευση και κατάρτιση πιο ελκυστική, να αντιστοιχίσουμε τις δεξιότητες με την αγορά εργασίας και να συνδέσουμε πιο στενά την απασχολησιμότητα με τη δια βίου μάθηση.» Σε βιντεοσκοπημένο μήνυμά της, η Ευρωπαία Επίτροπος για την Απασχόληση Μαριάνε Τάισεν υπογράμμισε ότι «το Cedefop παραμένει το ίδιο επίκαιρο σήμερα όσο ήταν και πριν από 40 χρόνια». Η κ. Τάισεν πρόσθεσε: «Κανένας οργανισμός δεν κατανοεί καλύτερα πόσο τα ευρωπαϊκά συστήματα επαγγελματικής εκπαίδευσης και κατάρτισης δυσκολεύονται να ανταποκριθούν στις απαιτήσεις του 21ου αιώνα. Ως εξειδικευμένο κέντρο, το Cedefop γνωρίζει τις σημαντικές προσπάθειες που καταβάλλουν η Ευρωπαϊκή Επιτροπή, τα κράτη μέλη και οι κοινωνικοί εταίροι να βελτιώσουν τα συστήματα αυτά. Και οι προσπάθειες αυτές αποδίδουν καρπούς.» Ο Δήμαρχος Θεσσαλονίκης, Γιάννης Μπουτάρης, απευθυνόμενος στους νυν και πρώην εργαζόμενους του Cedefop που ήταν στην εκδήλωση, δήλωσε ευτυχής για την παρουσία του και τόνισε: «Όταν αναλάβαμε τη διοίκηση του Δήμου, η συνεργασία με το Cedefop ήταν σχεδόν ανύπαρκτη. Προσπαθήσαμε να δραστηριοποιηθούμε και να συνδέσουμε το κέντρο με τους επαγγελματικούς οργανισμούς της πόλης για να επωφεληθούν από την παρουσία του εδώ. Δεν είμαι απόλυτα ικανοποιημένος με ό,τι έχουμε πετύχει ως τώρα, γι’ αυτό και ανέθεσα σε ένα σύμβουλο και σε ένα μέλος του Δημοτικού Συμβουλίου να ασχοληθούν με τη σχέση των δύο πλευρών και να καταθέσουν προτάσεις για κοινές δράσεις.» Ο Ιδρυτικός Κανονισμός του Cedefop δημοσιεύτηκε στις 10 Φεβρουαρίου 1975. Το κέντρο εγκαταστάθηκε αρχικώς στο τότε Δυτικό Βερολίνο και μεταφέρθηκε στη Θεσσαλονίκη το 1995.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0084	2015-02-10	NEWS	On the road to reform: European VET on Cedefop’s 40th anniversary	 Vocational education and training (VET) reform is opening up new routes for people into employment and for enterprises to develop the skills of their workforce to compete. However, reform still has some way to go for VET to meet 21st century expectations. But progress is being made, argues Cedefop Director James Calleja* on the occasion of the European agency’s 40th anniversary. Cedefop’s anniversary theme is Old roots for new routes. ‘The old roots of established European VET systems must provide new routes to jobs and careers’ says Mr Calleja, ‘but implementing change can be difficult. The idea behind our anniversary theme is to encourage continued improvement, by looking at progress Europe has already made. Less than 20 years ago the current extent of European cooperation in VET was unimaginable’. Mr Calleja points out that the European Commission, EU Member States and social partners are working together to bring VET closer to labour market needs, make systems more flexible, encourage mobility for learning and working, and increase participation of adults in lifelong learning. ‘This cooperation is substantially changing VET,’ he adds. More young people now stay on in education and training to at least upper secondary level. The EU is on course to meet its target of reducing early school leaving to an average of 10% by 2020. By 2025, around 40% of the EU workforce will have a tertiary level qualification. In a video message to mark Cedefop’s 40th anniversary Marianne Thyssen, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility agrees, adding: ‘We must further reinforce the link between training and labour market needs to reduce skills mismatch and ensure that such programmes act as a bridge to work. We must also do more to increase attractiveness of VET so that it becomes first choice – not a second option.’ Based in Thessaloniki, Greece, Cedefop continues to play an important role in strengthening European cooperation to develop VET policy. Its analyses of VET systems and policies are highly valued and Cedefop is recognised as a leading centre of expertise on qualifications frameworks and skills forecasting. It is also beneficial for its host city as Mayor Yiannis Boutaris explains in his message: ‘Cedefop’s presence has given the city an opportunity to open up, to welcome people from other places, to experience new things and finally acquire a cosmopolitan feel that goes beyond the practical effects of having an international organisation based here.’ ‘Cedefop is very relevant to the challenges Europe faces today in terms of youth employment and developing skills for a strong and lasting economic recovery,’ says Mr Calleja, concluding: ‘We must continue the work to ensure that people and enterprises benefit directly from VET reform.’ * Cedefop Director James Calleja is available for interviews on the occasion of the agency’s 40th anniversary. Please contact the Press Office. Notes to editors Cedefop’s Founding Regulation was published on 10 February 1975. The agency’s first home was in West Berlin, West Germany. Cedefop was set up with the aim to assist the [European] Commission in encouraging, at Community level, the promotion and development of vocational training and of in-service training. In 1995, Cedefop moved from Berlin to its current base in Thessaloniki.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0086	2015-01-29	NEWS	Vocational education and training in Europe: old roots for new routes	 Cedefop Director James Calleja (l) and Deputy Director Mara Brugia The challenges of the 21st century require new approaches to learning for work. Vocational education and training (VET) in Europe is evolving, but we need a clearer vision of what modern VET systems should look like. This was the central message of Cedefop Director James Calleja’s* presentation to the European Parliament’s Employment and Social Affairs committee, in Brussels today. This year marks Cedefop’s 40th anniversary. Citing its theme, Old roots to new routes, Mr Calleja said: ‘The old roots of established European VET systems must provide new routes - pathways, options and opportunities - to jobs and careers. VET has long-established roots in many European Union Member States. These roots nurture skills that grow into qualifications that sustain transition to work and further career development. But those old roots need to provide new routes and new ways for people to update their skills and gain new qualifications to find work, build rewarding careers and enjoy quality of life. Modern VET systems also need to provide new routes for enterprises to develop skills for economic excellence and competitive performance.’ Mr Calleja highlighted that many of the features of modern VET systems are emerging, illustrated by work Cedefop is doing. ‘With the European Commission, Member States and social partners, we are, for example, rethinking the role of work-based learning for young people and adults. We are working together on European instruments to make VET systems more flexible, so that all types of learning count, mobility for learning and work is easier and learning opportunities of all kinds are available throughout life.’ However, these different initiatives need to be integrated more closely. ‘For example,’ he says, ‘it is not just a case of improving how VET systems operate, but also their interaction with and relevance to the labour market. Cedefop has also shown that skill supply and demand forecasts that inform policy-makers about labour market trends are an essential feature of any VET system.’ Mr Calleja stressed that it is for Member States to decide the features of their modern VET systems. However, European cooperation has had a strong and positive influence in this area. Debating, agreeing and translating those features into a shared vision of what modern VET systems should look like may help to focus and uphold VET reform during a difficult period following the economic crisis when resources are limited and tough decisions needed. For the Cedefop Director, ‘modernising VET will probably always be a work in progress.’ He added: ‘This underlines the case for having a point of reference that sets out the features of modern VET systems. These features should recognise the important role VET plays in both personal and economic goals, of helping directly people and enterprises.’   * Cedefop Director James Calleja is available for interviews on the occasion of the agency’s 40th anniversary.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0085	2014-12-05	NEWS	Ενίσχυση συνεργασίας ελληνικής κυβέρνησης και Cedefop σε θέματα επαγγελματικής κατάρτισης	 Από αριστερά: Κ. Πουλιάκας, Τ. Καλέγια, Γ. Γεωργαντάς, Μ. Μπρούτζα, Λ. Ζαχείλας, Γκ. Μπάουζεβαϊν Κατά την πρώτη του επίσκεψη στο Cedefop ο νέος υφυπουργός Παιδείας Γεώργιος Γεωργαντάς διεμήνυσε στους υπευθύνους του οργανισμού τη διάθεσή του για ουσιαστικότερη συνεργασία με στόχο την επίλυση των προβλημάτων που αντιμετωπίζει η επαγγελματική εκπαίδευση στην Ελλάδα. Τον κ. Γεωργαντά υποδέχθηκαν ο Διευθυντής του κέντρου Τζέιμς Καλέγια και η Υποδιευθύντρια Μάρα Μπρούτζα. Ο κ. Καλέγια τόνισε: «Το Cedefop επιθυμεί στενότερη συνεργασία με τα κράτη-μέλη της Ευρωπαϊκής Ένωσης και η Ελλάδα αποτελεί τεράστια πρόκληση. Στόχος είναι να δοθούν όσο γίνεται περισσότερες ευκαιρίες απασχόλησης στους νέους ανθρώπους. Προσπαθούμε να είμαστε σε συνεχή επαφή με τα κέντρα αποφάσεων στη χώρα για να τους προσφέρουμε την τεχνογνωσία που έχουμε αποκτήσει στη σχεδόν 40ετή ιστορία μας.» Ο υφυπουργός Παιδείας τόνισε ότι η παρουσία του Cedefop στην Ελλάδα και η συνεργασία με το υπουργείο είναι ό,τι καλύτερο για τη χώρα: «Η συνάντηση αυτή είναι η πρώτη που έχω με διεθνή οργανισμό από την ανάληψη των καθηκόντων μου. Το έργο του Cedefop μπορεί να χρησιμοποιηθεί ως εργαλείο στα χέρια κάθε κυβέρνησης, και της ελληνικής. Αποτελεί χρήσιμο βοηθό για να καταλάβει η επαγγελματική εκπαίδευση και κατάρτιση τη θέση που της αξίζει.» Οι δύο πλευρές συζήτησαν την ανάπτυξη του ελληνικού Εθνικού Πλαισίου Προσόντων σε αντιστοίχιση με το ευρωπαϊκό και ο κ. Γεωργαντάς είπε ότι έχει ζητήσει αναλυτική ενημέρωση για την καθυστέρηση που παρατηρείται, τονίζοντας ότι η ολοκλήρωση της διαδικασίας εντάσσεται στις προτεραιότητές του. Ο υπηρεσιακός επικεφαλής τομέα Λουκάς Ζαχείλας αναφέρθηκε στο θέμα της μαθητείας, λέγοντας ότι το Cedefop έχει ξεκινήσει πρόγραμμα υποστήριξης των κρατών-μελών στην αξιολόγηση των συστημάτων και ότι η Ελλάδα είναι στο πρόγραμμα αξιολόγησης του 2015. Σύμφωνα με τον Εμπειρογνώμονα του Cedefop Κωνσταντίνο Πουλιάκα, η Ελλάδα αντιμετωπίζει το μεγαλύτερο πρόβλημα αναντιστοιχίας δεξιοτήτων στην Ευρώπη. Σε περίοδο υψηλής ανεργίας, η επιτυχής σύζευξη δεξιοτήτων του ελληνικού εργατικού δυναμικού με τις ανάγκες της αγοράς εργασίας προϋποθέτει άμεσες, αποτελεσματικές και στοχευμένες πολιτικές. Για την ανίχνευση αυτών των αναγκών έχουν αναπτυχθεί βραχυπρόθεσμα και μακροπρόθεσμα «συστήματα διάγνωσης δεξιοτήτων». Ο  υφυπουργός Παιδείας δεσμεύθηκε να επισκέπτεται το Cedefop τακτικά για την παραγωγική αντιμετώπιση των προβλημάτων. Σημειώσεις προς συντάκτες Οι δραστηριότητες του Cedefop που ενδιαφέρουν άμεσα την Ελλάδα είναι: Το Ευρωπαϊκό και Εθνικό Πλαίσιο Προσόντων (ΕΠΠ) Η μαθητεία Η διάγνωση των αναγκών της αγοράς εργασίας σε δεξιότητες και Το ReferΝet, ένα ευρωπαϊκό δίκτυο που δημιουργήθηκε το 2002 και είναι η πρωτογενής πηγή πληροφοριών του Cedefop σχετικά με τα συστήματα και τις πολιτικές επαγγελματικής εκπαίδευσης και κατάρτισης στα κράτη-μέλη. Το ελληνικό ενδιαφέρον για τις τρεις πρώτες δραστηριότητες έχει αποτυπωθεί στην, από 8/9/2014, κοινή επιστολή των Υπουργών Παιδείας και Εργασίας προς το Cedefop για την παροχή τεχνικής υποστήριξης. Η τελική έγκριση θα δοθεί την Τρίτη 9 Δεκεμβρίου 2014 από το Διοικητικό Συμβούλιο του Cedefop. Από το 2008 το Cedefop έχει υποστηρίξει ουσιαστικά την προσπάθεια σχεδιασμού και ανάπτυξης του ΕΠΠ σε αντιστοίχιση με το Ευρωπαϊκό Πλαίσιο. Η προσπάθεια είναι ακόμη σε εξέλιξη και υπάρχουν ζητήματα μεθοδολογίας, ορολογίας, πιστοποίησης και διασφάλισης ποιότητας. Στην καρδιά των αλλαγών βρίσκεται η στροφή στα μαθησιακά αποτελέσματα που ενισχύουν τη διαφάνεια και τη συγκρισιμότητα των προσόντων. Ένα ακόμα σημαντικό ζήτημα είναι η σχέση με την ανώτατη εκπαίδευση καθώς η λογική του ΕΠΠ στοχεύει στην κάλυψη όλων των επιπέδων εκπαίδευσης και κατάρτισης.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0082	2014-10-24	NEWS	Cedefop at the Greek Parliament	 Cedefop presented its work to the Greek Parliament, for the first time, on 23 October. A delegation headed by Director James Calleja addressed MPs of the Education and Social Affairs select committees and answered questions on the agency’s contribution to the development of vocational education and training (VET) and its cooperation with Greek authorities and VET institutions. Welcoming the delegation, Education Affairs committee chair Spyros Taliadouros noted that ‘for many years we have developed strong relations with Cedefop and we have been working together on skills, qualifications and competences, as well as on lifelong learning issues. Especially important has been Cedefop’s contribution to the national qualifications framework (NQF) development process, which is one of the European Commission’s most significant initiatives for recognition of skills and promotion of lifelong learning.’ Mr Calleja told MPs that permanent employment nowadays means permanent employability and that Cedefop's aim is to promote employability, help Member States resolve unemployment issues, give people the opportunity to train and develop apprenticeships. He added: ‘We are here today to link what we are doing in our base in Thessaloniki to what is needed in Greece. We want to help you in terms of the NQF and with skills forecasting. The secret lies in moving closer to Member States and to VET institutions where the real action takes place.’ Cedefop’s head of Finance and Procurement George Paraskevaidis spoke about the agency’s history, expert Konstantinos Pouliakas presented research on improving skills mismatch in the European and Greek labour market, and acting head of area Enhanced Cooperation in VET and Lifelong Learning Loukas Zahilas described the function of the European tools for education and learning. Greek Deputy Minister for Education Georgios Stylios, who hosted the event, concluded: 'We want to work with Cedefop as an adviser and an EU agency based in Thessaloniki. We seek to match students’ skills and competences with labour market needs to make them more competitive. Our aim is to match skills with special requirements in different parts of Greece. We start a cooperation to determine our actions as a country in vocational education and training.' Browse the event's picture gallery here.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0087	2014-10-20	NEWS	Invest in more good quality and innovative jobs – Cedefop Director	 ‘Europe’s true problem is not one of a deficit of skills, but primarily a deficit of creation of good quality jobs,’ Cedefop Director James Calleja told the European Parliament of Enterprises on Thursday in Brussels. In his statement on skills mismatch and youth unemployment, Mr Calleja said that most of Europe’s unemployment is cyclical, not structural in nature: ‘Cedefop studies (2012) indicate a rising tendency towards a higher “over-qualification” or “over-skilling” rate of the employee workforce (i.e. workers have skills that outweigh those needed to perform their job duties).’ He added that ‘skills mismatch is prevalent but it is not the main reason for high youth unemployment rates, nor does it primarily manifest as vacancies that cannot be filled.’ The Cedefop Director proposed six solutions: There is a clear need to invest more in lifelong guidance and counselling services relevant to labour market realities and in stronger European vocational education and training (VET) systems, including Higher VET. Good apprenticeship programmes will also help bridge the gap between skills of new job applicants and those needed by firms. Companies that support apprenticeships count their benefits; companies that don’t, complain about costs. Public-private partnerships will ensure that employers, learning providers and learners do not live in ‘parallel universes’ with regard to the effectiveness of the skill-matching process in their countries (McKinsey, 2012). Skills mismatch at domestic or smaller-sized firms may be addressed via the offer of better working conditions and by improving the image of the sector. A better image of jobs secures attractiveness to VET. Training consortia involving small and larger-sized firms in a sector or region and closer cooperation between VET institutions and businesses in regional/sectoral innovation clusters are likely to encourage employers to invest in staff training. Europe needs to invest in the creation of more and innovative jobs via local or sectoral development investment projects. Compulsory education and VET have a critical role to play in providing key competences and high-quality VET programmes as a drive for creativity and innovation. Mr Calleja concluded: ‘We may never eradicate unemployment in Europe, but we can certainly cultivate the seeds of employability and employment.’ Downloads Full text of the press releaseEN45.72 KB 	https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news-and-press/press-and-media/press-releases/invest-more-good-quality-and-innovative-jobs-cedefop-director
CEDEFOP_NEWS_0081	2014-09-23	NEWS	Vocational education and training: a road to excellence	 The issue of permeability between different sections of education was the subject of two speeches Cedefop Director James Calleja gave at international conferences in September. At the international congress on vocational and professional education and training in Winterthur (Switzerland) on 16 September, Mr Calleja addressed the question of whether vocational education and training (VET) is the end of the road or the beginning of a university career. He argued that, while both negative/positive answers are possible, VET is a lifelong learning process that may start with the acquisition of key competences and, possibly, lead to continuous professional development. The Cedefop Director added: ‘In today’s labour market environment, career prospects are ongoing. VET provides learners with a complete learning pathway up to higher VET and has the advantage of covering all levels of qualifications. It bridges, through apprenticeships and work-based learning, the worlds of work and education. It responds to labour market needs in a very dynamic and direct way, creating a common platform for trainers whether coming from education or industry.’ Mr Calleja highlighted the added value of a Level 5 qualification as the link between upper secondary and higher VET, with significant characteristics leading to employment, particularly as medium qualifications are increasing in demand. At a congress organised by Germany’s Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training (BiBB) in Berlin (18-19 September), Mr Calleja said that permeability between different sectors of education aims to help VET achieve its double objective of contributing to excellence and inclusion. In many countries, VET, and in particular apprenticeship, is still perceived as second-rate and reputation of VET institutions falls short of attractiveness. VET systems in Europe are heterogeneous and Member States are at different stages of developing attractive propositions. According to Mr Calleja, ‘whether VET is considered attractive or not by learners, employers, and generally by society, depends on a complex interplay between socioeconomic and labour market features, education authorities, perceptions, traditions, reputation and factors inherent in the education and training system as such.’ While focus on VET within countries’ youth guarantees emphasises inclusion and permeability, ‘countries increasingly realise its potential at post-secondary and tertiary levels.’ The European alliance for apprenticeships supports initiatives to set up or expand apprenticeship-type programmes at different levels. So, Mr Calleja noted, ‘one of the main internal features that help make VET attractive is the chance for people to progress to higher-level qualifications.’ He also argued that ‘structurally, in Europe there are only few barriers to progression. Where dead ends exist, they tend to be in apprenticeship-type programmes. Germany and Austria (as well as Switzerland) exemplify that apprenticeships can lead to high-level qualifications. The European qualification framework that focuses on outcomes of learning rather than institutions where people acquire qualifications, the Recommendation to validate the skills and competences people have acquired at work and in other situations outside formal education, and the credit system for VET support this endeavour at EU level.’ The Cedefop Director concluded that ‘the role guidance and counsellors play in schools is vital for making VET more attractive to high flyers as well as to low achievers. But it is not enough to amend structures and provide tools; we also need to ensure that the expected outcomes are achieved, as PIAAC survey results suggest. We need to analyse positive and negative data carefully, and understand them in their specific contexts to be able to provide evidence and convince people of VET’s benefits to change their mindsets.’ Downloads Press releaseEN59.09 KB 	https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news-and-press/press-and-media/press-releases/vocational-education-and-training-road-excellence
CEDEFOP_NEWS_0089	2014-09-08	NEWS	Credit transfer systems: what will it take for them to work together?	 Last May, Cedefop held an expert workshop on how credit transfer systems can open doors between vocational and higher education. Participants investigated how credit transfer systems work in practice, and sought complementary and alternative solutions to the challenges these systems face. While distinct, the current two credit systems – ECTS for higher education and ECVET for vocational education and training – share roles and objectives: they protect the learner by allowing recognition of what has been learnt at other levels or settings.  To progress in both education and career, people often move between higher education and VET, and indeed between education or training and the labour market. This means that while keeping their distinctive features, VET and higher education are becoming more closely intertwined. Higher education now includes more work-based and practical learning; conversely, VET needs to cover analytical and critical thinking, active citizenship, and other values that are essential for today’s society. Because of this partial convergence, vocational and higher education must both ensure that their credit systems are mutually compatible and fair to learners. Workshop participants discussed technical and conceptual aspects of how credit transfer systems can open doors between higher and vocational education for the benefit of learners. Establishing what these education subsystems have in common clarifies what credits (in effect, what kind of knowledge and skills) can be transferred between them. Thus, achieving the ‘three Cs’ - compatibility, comparability and complementarity – between the two credit transfer systems, and devising the best ways of linking these systems to validation of non-formal and informal learning became a major focus of the workshop. Some conclusions:   - VET qualifications at higher levels are becoming increasingly common, while both VET and HE are opening up to non-traditional types of learning. This calls for common solutions. For example, the learning outcomes approach - the cornerstone of the ECVET system - is now also being integrated into the ECTS. - At higher education levels, where the two credit systems now run in parallel, having two compatible systems is a bare minimum. A single credit system at higher EQF levels (5 and up) would be preferable for at least four reasons: It is less confusing for learners By using a common yardstick for all it increases transparency It treats higher education and VET on a basis of equality, thus encouraging parity of esteem; To the rest of the world, it displays the coherence of European educational systems - It became clear during discussions on the permeability of HE and VET that while access and admission is adequately covered by system-level solutions outside credit transfer systems, exemption (that is, recognising previous knowledge as equivalent to that obtained in another system) is not. This is where credit transfer systems can play the crucial role in bringing the two systems closer together.  - The most contentious issue was the necessity and calculation method of credit points. All experts agreed that credit transfer and accumulation systems might also work in the absence of credit points. But experience from the ECTS as well as from countries that have developed credit transfer systems for VET (Slovenia, UK Scotland, Malta) shows that not using credit points may compromise transparency. In all cases, it is necessary to express progress in learning. Presenting it as a list of learning outcomes (when some programmes may have hundreds of learning outcomes) is simply not practical. Credit points are necessary if credits are to be transferred between higher and vocational education and training. - Apart from questioning credit points in general, some ECVET team representatives objected to calculating credit points based on workload, arguing that this runs contrary to the logic of validation systems. But learning is always built in time. The French example of validation of non-formal and informal learning (using ECTS) showed that individuals reach high levels (university) of learning outcomes after an average of 8 years of work-experience. Credit transfer systems both within and outside Europe all base credit points on workload, as it is difficult to measure and translate learning outcomes alone into credit points. Thus, ECTS and ECVET can start operating together only if stakeholders agree on a clear method of calculating ECVET points. 	https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news-and-press/press-and-media/press-releases/credit-transfer-systems-what-will-it-take-them-work-together
CEDEFOP_NEWS_0088	2014-06-25	NEWS	Employee skill assessments lack links to national validation systems	 Cedefop report finds that to best serve individuals, validation of non-formal and informal learning must take experience of companies into account. Most of the European debate on validating non-formal and informal learning focuses on how such mechanisms are organised within national education and training systems. Meanwhile, many companies systematically assess employees’ competence and skills, mainly for purposes of recruitment and to formulate personnel management and training strategies. A new Cedefop study, now out in print, has found that most such in-company assessments are not linked to national validation schemes. As a result, while they are of undoubted value within the company, those undergoing such assessments may not find them useful when seeking alternative employment or further learning. Companies also do not focus equally on all staff: competence assessments mostly involve executives and technical specialists. Moreover, company size considerably influences the way this exercise is carried out, or indeed whether it is carried out at all.  Based on a survey of 400 enterprises, 20 in-depth case studies of companies* and interviews with human resource experts in 10 countries, the report, Use of validation by enterprises for human resource and career development purposes, analyses the reasons why competence assessments take place, the standards and methods applied, the employee groups targeted and the way results are documented and used. Cedefop has been actively involved in validation since the mid-1990s and has been instrumental in transforming what was once a topic of interest to a few experts into a core issue of European and national lifelong learning policies.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0092	2014-06-12	NEWS	Press release - Report reveals hidden value of level 5 qualifications for policy-makers in education and training	 Qualifications that correspond to level 5 of the European qualifications framework (EQF) appeal to learners as they open up prospects on several fronts - immediate employment, career advancement, and further learning. At the same time, their focus on advanced technical and managerial skills makes them valuable to employers. These qualifications are typically associated with short-cycle higher education programmes. Yet about 50% of qualifications at EQF level 5 are found elsewhere: in initial and continuing vocational education and training, in general education, or even entirely outside the formal education and training system. The close examination provided in Cedefop’s recent publication Qualifications at level 5: progressing in a career or to higher education indicates the true weight of these qualifications in the labour market. It also demonstrates how policy-makers can use the EQF to improve education and training subsystems, and strengthens links between them. In particular, it can help policy-makers determine whether their own qualifications landscape lacks options which combine labour-market and higher education appeal. They can thus use level 5 as a platform for developing new qualifications, as is already happening in several European countries.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0096	2014-06-10	NEWS	Better vocational options lead to fewer dropouts from education and training	 Early findings of a Europe-wide Cedefop study of the effect of vocational education and training (VET) on the dropout rate reveal that this effect is largely positive. In countries where vocational pathways account for a large share of education and training, rates of early school leaving are below the EU target for 2020 (10%). Conversely, in countries where VET lags behind, the dropout rate is higher than 10%; in some cases, significantly so. The findings were discussed at an expert workshop organised by Cedefop in Thessaloniki  on 3rd and 4th of June. The study also addresses the lack of commonly accepted definition of early leavers from vocational education and training. Data at EU level and in many countries do not accurately track young people as they leave and re-enter learning environments and/or the labour market. The study has found that over 97% of early leavers are dropouts, with the remainder being young people who never start post-compulsory education and training. It also found that one in five dropouts eventually achieve upper secondary qualifications, with 77% doing so within three years. Addressing the workshop, Cedefop Director James Calleja pointed out that the problem of early leaving is largely VET’s to solve: early leavers between 16 and 24 who return to education typically choose vocational options. Mr Calleja spoke of early leavers as ‘casualties of the education system’ whom public authorities have a responsibility to support. Workshop participants agreed that data collection must be improved to provide an accurate overall picture for policy-makers and allow them to implement the right policies. Thanks to such a comprehensive data collection and monitoring system, policy-makers in the Netherlands have solid evidence on which to base policy decisions. As a result, early leaving rates have dropped significantly in the past few years. In addition, systematic tracking (by means of a personal education number which is linked to a social security number) alerts authorities when learners leave or re-enter education and training at any level and in every kind of learning environment. This system has revealed that the real national rate of early leaving from education and training is lower than previously thought. Cedefop has launched a three-year project (2014-17) to address the lack of data on early leaving specifically from vocational pathways and to analyse the role VET plays in reducing the dropout rate. Cedefop’s Irene Psifidou, who organised the workshop, said that the ultimate aim of the project is ‘ambitious but necessary to develop tools that will make it possible for countries to monitor individual learning pathways and to evaluate national policies on early leaving.’ Mr Calleja also emphasised this point: ‘As a public agency, Cedefop must ensure that Member States can use our research in order to implement measures that will make a difference. But it is not enough to develop tools. Countries will also need help in implementing them until they become part of the culture of the education and training system.’ In its first year, the project addresses how to measure the magnitude and determine the causes of early leaving from VET, and the ways in which improved data and analysis can feed into targeted policy measures. Workshop discussions will feed into next year’s research, which is to focus on indicators and on evaluating the impact of policy measures in tackling early leaving from education and training though VET.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0097	2014-06-03	NEWS	Apprenticeships under the microscope in Lithuania and Malta	" A new Cedefop project, which will look into the apprenticeship systems of Lithuania and Malta, has been launched. The project, to be completed in 2015, is in support of the European alliance for apprenticeships and will involve government ministries, vocational education and training (VET) institutions, social partners and other stakeholders in both countries. In Lithuania, Cedefop will be conducting an in-depth review of the apprenticeship schemes at the invitation of the Minister of Education and Science Prof. Dr Dainius Pavalkis. The review aims at providing the Lithuanian government with a proposed roadmap of quality apprenticeships to combat youth unemployment, attract more young and old learners to vocational training and work-based learning, and increase skills and competences for employability.   Minister Pavalkis (l) with Cedefop Director James Calleja in Vilnius 	At the official launch in Vilnius on 29 May, Minister Pavalkis said that he is hoping this review will enable the Lithuanian government to promote the link between the world of education and training and the world of employment. Cedefop Director James Calleja stressed the need for greater collaboration between the education and the employment sectors to ensure the skills and competences of the workforce are relevant to a dynamic labour market. He argued that this project will contribute to strengthening the European alliance for apprenticeships. In Malta, Minister of Education and Employment Evarist Bartolo and the Cedefop Director launched the thematic country review on apprenticeships at the Chamber of Commerce, Enterprise and Industry in Valetta on 30 May. Minister Bartolo (second right) and James Calleja (third right) at the Malta launch Minister Bartolo stressed that apprenticeships should be the product of solid partnerships between VET institutions, industry, employee representatives and civil society. Mr Calleja emphasised that the review’s objective is to create quality apprenticeships and programmes as part of formal education and training, and certified through qualifications referenced to the Malta qualifications framework. Cedefop experts Antonio Ranieri, Ramona David Craescu and Irina Jemeljanova are leading the project in the two countries for the European agency.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0091	2014-05-22	NEWS	Education needs to match industry’s speed to remain relevant	 At a high-level dinner, organised by weekly newspaper European Voice in Brussels on 20 May, Cedefop Director James Calleja said that ‘educational reform must have relatively the same speed as developments in the labour market’ to make it easier for young people to move from education to employment. Mr Calleja was invited to a restricted group of top-level EU policy-makers, business executives and representatives of the education and youth sectors to exchange practical examples of success stories in helping young people move from education into employment.   Participants argued that today’s labour market poses huge challenges to education, businesses and learners. It is not always possible for education and training to tailor skills to labour market needs. Hence, training teachers is paramount to ensure that education remains relevant to employment. Apprenticeship programmes and work-based learning are tools that can accelerate transition from education to employment as they attract learners to a learning environment which integrates the workplace itself. Although forecasting the skills businesses needed is important, this is not easy to achieve in an unpredictable and constantly changing labour market context. The need for new mindsets, particularly on the value of vocational training, was stressed by various speakers. Mr Calleja remarked that the first challenge is to recover the ‘casualties’ of the education system, particularly people not in education, employment or training (NEETs) and early school leavers: ‘This is where education and businesses can join forces and promote quality apprenticeships and work-based learning.’ The second challenge, according to the Cedefop Director, is for education authorities to invest heavily in early education making sure that all young people possess key competences and the right attitude for employment at the end of the schooling period. Trends are clearly showing that, beyond compulsory schooling, sectoral standards and quality assurance govern certification, and public education may well lose its current hold on further and higher education. Mr Calleja reiterated the importance for EU Member States and social partners to put European policies and tools in practice, as these ease transition from education to employment for European citizens.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0098	2014-05-08	NEWS	A successful first step towards European partnerships on apprenticeship	" Apprenticeships and similar work-based schemes have proven to make it easier for young people to move from education to work. But not all countries have highly-developed apprenticeship schemes, and many wish to benefit from others’ experience. A Cedefop event on 7 and 8 May helped to pave the way towards new partnerships for apprenticeship between EU countries. Apprenticeships have become one of the pillars of youth guarantee schemes which Member States are currently establishing in order to help young people get a foothold in the labour market. Within the European youth guarantee, the European Union’s programme for education, training and lifelong learning, Erasmus+, recently earmarked financial support for apprenticeship schemes. This includes the formation of partnerships involving two or more countries or social partner organisations. As part of its support to the European alliance for apprenticeships (EafA), Cedefop, along with the European Commission, organised a special event aiming to help establish such partnerships. The European Apprenticeships Conference showcased examples of actions, programmes and approaches related to apprenticeship which can be adapted by Erasmus+ countries. But the event was primarily designed to help potential partners find each other. For this reason, it did not follow the usual conference format. Instead, interaction, cross-country dialogue and experience-sharing dominated the event, with the aim to allow participants identify potential partners for apprenticeship modernisation. Opening the conference, Cedefop Director James Calleja said: 'Today’s highly complex workplace requires new workers to be even more ""work-ready"" - and that is where apprenticeships come in. Moreover, work-based learning, and apprenticeships in particular, foster a strong sense of professional identity which is important for young people’s self-esteem.' In a video message, Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said that quality apprenticeships facilitate the transitions from the world of education to the world of work and Member States should make full use of funds provided for this purpose through Erasmus+, the European Social Fund, and the European Investment Fund. Speaking at the conference, Antonio Silva Mendes of the Commission’s General Directorate for Education and Culture stressed the importance of action at Member State level to promote a wide array of apprenticeships based on high standards and transferable skills. The conference addressed officials responsible for apprenticeships in initial vocational education and training and social partners (employers and employees) who are willing to cooperate with others in modernising apprenticeship schemes. Participants received information about financial support available, especially under Erasmus+, for which the deadline is 26 June.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0093	2014-05-02	NEWS	Press release - Despite their advantages apprenticeships are underused	 To reduce high unemployment among their young people, countries are looking to others for help. In countries, such as Germany, the Netherlands and Austria youth unemployment has remained relatively low. This is attributed in part to their apprenticeships or ‘dual’ systems and so interest in them has increased. Apprenticeships and other forms of work-based learning are seen as having advantages by combining learning with work experience. They can provide young people and adults with the skills employers need and make the transition from school or other learning to work easier. Apprenticeship systems also strengthen cooperation between governments, social partners, employers and training institutions. But despite their advantages, apprenticeships, like vocational education and training (VET) generally, seem to have an image problem, at least in some countries. The 2011 Eurobarometer found that more than 70% of young people believed that VET is useful for finding a job, but 38% saw the jobs and careers it leads to as unattractive. More apprenticeships are needed in skill-intensive sectors and occupations such as ICT, sales, health care and renewable energies which are seen as offering attractive jobs and promising careers. Developing apprenticeships depends heavily on employers. Employers who train apprentices highlight the benefits, regarding it as an investment in the future. But too few European enterprises offer apprenticeships. In 2010, on average in the EU around 25% of enterprises with 10 or more employees trained apprentices; this figure is much lower in many Member States. Some European countries are working to strengthen apprenticeships. Germany, Greece, Spain, Latvia, Portugal and Slovakia signed an agreement, in 2012, to promote apprenticeships. The European Commission, in July 2013, also launched the European alliance for apprenticeships. On 7-8 May 2014, Cedefop (the European Centre for the development of Vocational Training), based in Thessaloniki, Greece, organises, with the European Commission, a conference to bring together countries looking for advice and examples of good practice on apprenticeship.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0094	2014-04-11	NEWS	European policies: catalysts for innovation and youth employment	 In vocational training, but also for general economic growth needed for employment, European policies are catalysts for innovation, according to Cedefop Director James Calleja. Mr Calleja was a key panellist during the 3rd international conference on industrial technologies research and innovation, held in Athens from 9 to 11 April. The conference attracted over 1 000 delegates from 50 countries as well as 150 speakers in plenary and workshop sessions.  He stressed: ‘Research, innovation and technology are an attraction to unemployed youth whose culture and quality of life is largely influenced by and dependent upon technological developments. With youth unemployment across Europe at 22.9%, vocational colleges can use research, innovation and industrial technologies to attract learners to qualifications, new skills and job experience. European policies and tools can help vocational colleges reinvent education together with industry.’ Mr Calleja referred to European initiatives to promote youth employment such as the youth guarantee and the effective use of structural funds and Erasmus+ during the current funding period (2014-20). With over 22 million SMEs in Europe generating over 66% of employment, industrial technologies can be an effective channel to set up apprenticeship and traineeship programmes. The Cedefop Director pledged more concrete support to the European alliance for apprenticeships as a platform for building learning environments in workplaces. He reiterated that ‘vocational training offers an excellent opportunity to award qualifications at all levels of a qualifications framework and is therefore inclusive, providing balance between theory and practice, study and work periods. Long-term cooperation for innovating capacity is necessary to make Europe competitive by using technology to win back jobs which would otherwise be carried out where labour is much cheaper.’ Earlier this week, Mr Calleja chaired one of the four panel discussions in a high-level European Commission conference on youth guarantee held in Brussels. The conference was chaired by Commissioner László Andor and addressed by President José Manuel Barroso, who stressed that youth are at the core of European priorities, and that concerns in Member States should now be transformed into commitments to allow economies to grow, generate cash flow and create employment.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0100	2014-04-10	NEWS	Press release - Italy: vocational education and training can improve job prospects for young people	 Italy has high numbers of young people participating in initial vocational education and training compared to the EU average. According to indicators compiled by Cedefop (the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training), in 2012, 60% of all upper secondary students in Italy were vocational students, above the EU average of 50.3% and higher than in Germany (48.6%) and France (44.6%). There is growing evidence that young people on high-quality apprenticeships and internships are more likely to acquire useful skills and attitudes to find suitable work and it seems from the data that upper secondary vocational graduates have better job prospects than general education graduates. The employment rate of upper secondary vocational graduates aged 20 to 34 in Italy is 74.6%, some 7.8 percentage points higher than for upper secondary graduates of the same age from general education. In contrast, data for 2012 show that Italy had only 6.6% of adults aged 25 to 64 participating in lifelong learning. This is higher than in France (5.7%), but lower than in Germany (7.9%) and in the EU as a whole (9%) and well below the European average target of 15% to be achieved by 2020. Notes to editors • Data come from indicators compiled by Cedefop (the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training). Data used was extracted in summer 2013 and at the time of writing is the latest available from Eurostat. Data for employment rates for upper secondary vocational and general education graduates (aged 20-34) relate to 2009. • Cedefop’s full publication: On the way to 2020 giving data for all EU Member States is available at: http://www.cedefop.europa.eu/EN/publications/22388.aspx. • Italy’s performance on a range of indicators selected to monitor progress in VET and lifelong learning across the European Union is shown in Figure 1: [VET indicators for Italy for the most recent year available Index numbers (EU=100)]. The indicators are based on the most recent data available (this differs by indicator). Data in the chart are presented as an index where the EU average equals 100. If the index for an indicator is 100, then Italy’s performance equals the EU average. If the index is 90, its performance is 90% of (or 10% below) the EU average. If the index is 200, Italy’s performance is twice (or 200%) the EU average. For some indicators, such as early leavers from education and training, a country is performing better if its score is below the EU average. • Data on which the index scores have been calculated are presented in Table 1, which also shows changes over time: [Score on VET indicators in Italy and in the EU, 2006, 2010 and 2011/12 (where available)].

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0095	2014-04-10	NEWS	Press release - France: young people staying on in school  but not enough adults are learning	 Although around 45% of employees participate in continuing vocational training courses provided by enterprises, adult participation in lifelong learning in 2012 in France was only 5.7%. This is well below the European average of 9.0% and a long way from the European target of 15% to be reached by 2020. According to indicators compiled by Cedefop (the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training), adult participation in lifelong learning in France is also below Spain (10.7%) and Italy (6.6%), but slightly above Germany (7.9%). In contrast, France is making some progress in reducing early leaving from education and training towards its target of 9.5% or below by 2020. The percentage of early leavers from education and training in France was 11.6% in 2012 compared to 12.6% in 2010. In 2012, fewer young people were found leaving education and training with low educational attainment in France than in Italy where the figure is 17.6%, the UK (13.5%) and in the EU as a whole (almost 13%). However, France does not do as well as Germany where the percentage of early leavers from education and training in 2012 was 10.5%, or Poland where the figure was only 5.7%.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0099	2014-04-10	NEWS	Press release - Germany: training brings job opportunities for young people, but training for adults lags behind	 In Germany, students in initial vocational education and training (IVET) accounted for 48.6% of all upper secondary students in 2012, close to the EU average of 50.3%, but below Italy’s 60% according to indicators compiled by Cedefop (the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training). The main difference between Germany’s IVET students and other countries is that 88.2% are enrolled in combined work- and school-based programmes, compared to only 27% in the EU as a whole. There is growing evidence that young people on high-quality apprenticeships and internships are more likely to acquire useful skills and attitudes to find suitable work and this appears to be the case in Germany. The employment rate for upper-secondary IVET graduates aged 20 to 34 is 83.9%, some 26.2 percentage points higher than that of general education graduates of the same age. Some 73% of German enterprises also provide training compared to 66% in the EU as a whole. Also, more employees in Germany (28%) participate in on-the-job training compared to the European average (21%). However, in 2012, the percentage of all adults aged 25 to 64 engaged in lifelong learning in Germany was 7.9%, slightly lower than the EU average of 9%, and below the European average target of 15% to be achieved by 2020, but higher than in France (5.7%) and Italy (6.6%). The percentage of older people, the unemployed and those with relatively low qualifications participating in lifelong learning are all lower in Germany than for the EU as a whole.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0107	2014-03-28	NEWS	Press release - International survey on adult skills in Greece	 Greece’s participation in a survey of adult skills organised by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) with the support of the European Commission was launched on 31 March at the Mapping skills shortages, planning the future, conference in Athens. The survey, known as ‘survey of adult skills’ (PIAAC), will assess the level of proficiency in key foundation skills among approximately 5 000 adults and the extent to which these skills are used in the workplace. Greece, along with eight other countries including Chile, Turkey and New Zealand is taking part in the second round of the survey. The first round covered 24 countries, including France, Germany and the USA. The initial results from all the countries in the first round were published in October 2013. Finland came first in terms of literacy and numeracy, whereas close to a third of the working population in Italy and Spain was found to have low literacy and numeracy skills. Skill development and lifelong learning also fall markedly with age. This is worrying for Greece and some other European countries, including Germany, which have an ageing workforce that needs to keep up with technological and organisational developments. Cedefop is working closely with the EU Commission and the OECD on analysing and interpreting the data’s implications for training in European countries. Konstantinos Pouliakas, representing Cedefop at the event, said: ‘The survey will give us a clearer idea of how skilled the Greek workforce is in relation to other OECD economies. It will provide forensic evidence of the quality of the country’s education and training system and reveal the extent to which there is a mismatch between the skills of Greek workers and the skills they need in their job.’ Results for Greece should be available in 2016. Notes to editors • PIAAC – Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (http://www.oecd.org/site/piaac and http://www.piaac.gr) • Countries included in the survey: Australia, Austria, Belgium (Flanders), Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom (England and Northern Ireland), United States and two partner countries – Cyprus and Russia. Data was collected between August 2011 and March 2012 in most participating countries. • A second round of the survey started in 2012 involving nine additional countries: Chile, Greece, Indonesia, Israel, Lithuania, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovenia and Turkey. Data will be collected in 2014 and results released in 2016.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0105	2014-03-28	NEWS	Partnerships key to preventing skills mismatch and NEETs	 Partnerships between education and training and social partners are not an option but inevitable to prevent skills mismatch and having people not in employment, education or training (NEETs), argued Cedefop Director James Calleja at the Greek EU Presidency’s flagship conference on vocational education and training (VET). The conference, held on 26 March in Athens, gave participating Member States an opportunity to get acquainted with successful VET policies and practices which tackle skills mismatches, focusing on how work-based learning can meet contemporary challenges. Greek Minister of Education Constantine Arvanitopoulos gave the keynote speech in the presence of senior officials from the European Commission, social partners’ representatives and around 200 participants. Mr Calleja noted: ‘VET covers almost the whole spectrum of the qualifications framework. It triggers innovation; we need VET policy-makers and institutions that believe in its potential at all qualifications levels and implement measures to raise quality and excellence with urgency.’ He stressed that ‘the worlds of education and work are not/have not been talking to each other enough,’ which is why ‘we need to strengthen initial vocational education and training (IVET) by coordinating efforts from governments, social partners, the labour market and education and training providers. Without a strong IVET base, it is impossible to have quality continuing VET and VET at higher education.’ The Cedefop Director, who together with a group of the Centre’s experts presented the challenges VET faces when it comes to skills mismatch and work-based learning, argued that ‘before you reform education and training, you need to know what kinds of jobs there are, where and which skills they require; reform in education must go hand-in-hand with economic and social strategies and not in isolation.’ According to Mr Calleja, ‘the European tools are a solid foundation to build a culture of learning by doing; adapt them to your national, regional, local contexts and they will make a difference.’ Cedefop supports the work of the European Commission and Member States based on its expertise on labour market issues, qualifications and VET policies. The envisaged Cedefop policy-learning workshops in 2015 will enable knowledge-sharing towards strategic, prioritised and citizen-centred initiatives in VET institutions. ‘Countries need to identify their growth potential and skills needs, develop training schemes to suit their specific contexts and use the potential of work-based learning. This requires comprehensive strategies, which include competence development of teachers and trainers, and commitment of all actors,’ concluded Mr Calleja. The conference was followed by a meeting of Directors General for VET (27-28 March), during which Directors debated the next set of short-term deliverables for European cooperation on VET 2015-17.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0108	2014-03-19	NEWS	Skill deficits do not cause unemployment; Europe’s most talented workforce is being wasted	 Unemployment in many European Union (EU) countries is alarmingly high. Yet, surveys still find that firms have problems filling vacancies. Manpower’s 2013 talent shortage survey found on average more than 25% of firms across 17 Member States reported recruitment difficulties. Many argue that this is because young graduates and other workers are ill-prepared and the lack of the right skills is responsible for Europe’s high rates of unemployment. But in most EU countries labour shortages are well below pre-crisis levels. Job vacancies in 15 Member States in 2013 were 25% fewer than in 2008. Due to weak employment demand people are accepting jobs which do not match their qualification level. In the EU, around 29% of highly-qualified workers are in jobs usually requiring medium- to low-level qualifications. Consequently, according to Cedefop, while some firms have recruitment difficulties for some jobs, such as ICT developers, rather than a lack of skills evidence points to other factors such as poor wages and working conditions and lack of mobility being mostly responsible for high unemployment coexisting with unfilled job vacancies. With an oversupply of highly-qualified job candidates, firms also prefer to wait for the perfect applicant. The 2013 Manpower study found only 7% of employers willing to redefine recruitment criteria. Firms tend to overlook possible candidates from outside the area as well as young people, women and older workers, many of whom are skilled. The European economy currently has around two million vacancies. But in 2012, around 20% of the EU’s total labour force – some 46 million people – was unemployed or underemployed. The World Economic Forum published a paper on skill mismatch to which Cedefop contributed. It points out that job creation is fundamental but all aspects of skill mismatch must be addressed. Efforts to bring education and training and the labour market closer together should be reinforced. Employed and unemployed adults need to develop their skills throughout working life. Firms must invest in learning for their workforce. But firms also need to review recruitment practices, extend training strategies and broaden recruitment pools. If not we may only prolong the job crisis.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0103	2014-03-12	NEWS	NEETs – prevention is better than cure	 Cedefop Director James Calleja told a conference organised by the European Commission and the Romanian government in Bucharest that ‘in addressing NEETs (people not in employment, education or training) we should keep in mind that prevention is better than cure and that detecting potential NEETs should be a key concern in school education.’ He said that Cedefop also ‘has a role in reducing NEETs through evidence-based research, analysis of Member States’ initiatives as well as support to the Commission on related issues’. The conference (10-11 March) was addressed by Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou, Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta and several ministers. In his presentation, Mr Calleja delved into the importance of European tools, work-based learning, apprenticeship programmes as well as the use of funding from the European Social Fund and Erasmus+. He noted: ‘NEETs are the result of various factors, which can be prevented by our educational systems if more attention is given to individuals as early as possible at school. Prevention may be perceived as an expensive activity but remedial action is even more expensive and no one should expect that vocational education and training (VET) on its own, as a sector, can resolve unemployment issues. Reskilling after school education should not, in principle, include the acquisition of basic skills and competences.’ Several Member States have taken strategic initiatives to reduce NEETs, and those that have been successful (such as Ireland, France and Finland) have accomplished this through approaches at micro-levels on national, regional and local contexts. Mr Calleja argued that ‘EU policies, guidelines and roadmaps can only be effective if Member States create the social, educational and work environment, which recognises all skills and competences (validation) and consider the European tools (Europass, EQF, EURES, ESCO and ECVET) as the means to add value and visibility to VET.’ He added that ‘linking education to the labour market in flexible, attractive and innovative approaches empowers youths, who we term as the “lost” generation, to re-enter the lifelong learning process.’ This can be done through ‘reforms in apprenticeship programmes, work-based learning, acquisition of entrepreneurial skills, and validation of acquired skills from informal and non-formal learning.’ Cedefop’s expert Irene Psifidou reinforced earlier comments by Mr Calleja in showing that successful policies in Member States to attract and retain young people in education and training had been based around partnerships between schools, VET institutions, employers and social partners. ‘We need such partnerships to commit resources to reduce and hopefully eliminate NEETs. Action at the micro-level is the next step towards a sustainable solution. Only initiatives at regional and local levels can bring the desired results,’ concluded Mr Calleja.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0104	2014-03-05	NEWS	Commissioner Andor at Cedefop: Youth guarantee a short-term relief and long-term investment in skills and employability	 European Union (EU) Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion László Andor called his visit to Cedefop premises on 4 March ‘a very important experience’ and stated that ‘good vocational education and training systems are crucial for employment’. Addressing Cedefop staff, Mr Andor spoke about the youth guarantee, one of the European Commission’s new initiatives to combat youth unemployment. ‘It needs to be a short-term relief and long-term investment in the skills and employability of young people,’ he said.  The scheme aims to ensure that all young people under age 25 receive a good-quality offer of employment, an apprenticeship or traineeship or the chance to continue their education within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education. ‘It is important for Europe’s Regions to know how to draw from the EU financial resources, but also how to exploit the experience of others,’ stressed Mr Andor. He mentioned mobility as ‘a very important opportunity, a fundamental right’ of European citizens and argued that ‘we do not consider mobility in the EU loss of human capital,’ adding that there is now less mobility in Europe than before the crisis. The EU Commissioner underlined, as an example, that Germany needs more than half a million workers per year. Cedefop Director James Calleja said that it was ‘a privilege and an honour’ to welcome the Commissioner to the agency and noted that employment is at the centre of its research and forecasting. He added that youth should be empowered through various forms of education and training to be their own guarantee for employability and employment. Senior officials presented to Mr Andor Cedefop’s work on: employment and skills perspectives up to 2025 – EU28 and Hungary; feedback mechanisms between VET and the labour market – the role of apprenticeship-type learning; the relevance of the common EU tools and principles for the labour market.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0106	2014-03-04	NEWS	A model of governance 'to support European tools and employability' – Cedefop Director	 At a European Observatoire of Sport and Employment (EOSE) conference, at Wembley Stadium in London, Cedefop Director James Calleja proposed a joint activity on vocational education and training (VET) and mobility of the sport and active leisure sector and the international financial services sector based on a common model of governance to support the use of European tools and policies related to VET, skills and qualifications. In his testimonial, Mr Calleja spoke about the 7-step model, which was finalised by EOSE in 2011. The seven steps to achieve quality in VET-related qualifications are: labour market intelligence, an occupational map, occupational descriptors, a functional map, a competence framework/occupational standards, a guide to qualifications and learning outcomes, and quality assurance processes. The conference, on 24 and 25 February, was organised by EOSE’s VSPORT+ project, which is funded by the European Commission under the lifelong learning programme 2007-13. Some 64 participants from 20 countries, including Olympic Games medallist Claudia Bokel and senior officials from SkillsActive Australia and SkillsActive Aotearoa New Zealand, had the opportunity to present latest activities and EU policy developments, some concrete national case studies, and to exchange views on the main education and training challenges the sector is currently facing as well as concrete opportunities and suggestions for the development of its workforce. The Cedefop Director focused on the importance of standards in VET-related qualifications, which should fundamentally govern a sector in which qualifications are led by the governing bodies themselves; on mobility, which allows those working in the sectors to move from one region/country to another with recognised knowledge, skills and competences; on transparency as a tool which is today strengthened by the European processes the model uses, such as the EQF, ECVET, quality assurance standards in vocational training, Europass and others; and on employment, which the model aims to achieve. ‘At the end of the day, people need employment, recognition for their work and quality of life within well-defined structures and processes. In this context, the 7-step model is a valid tool, particularly in providing this sector with a European context, which may be easily exported to other regions of the world but also to other sectors, such as the financial sector which is also currently working on a similar model,’ added Mr Calleja. He also stressed ‘the sectoral and global appeal of the model in the context of the economic crisis and youth unemployment’ and ‘how the sector can support people in becoming more employable.’ Downloads Press releaseEN40.39 KB 	https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news-and-press/press-and-media/press-releases/model-governance-support-european-tools-and-employability-cedefop-director

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0110	2014-02-12	NEWS	Getting a job: work-based learning makes a difference	 Young people with vocational education and training (VET) qualifications, which include a significant amount of work-based learning, have higher employment rates compared to those who come from general education or from fully or mainly school-based VET, Cedefop Director James Calleja told the European Commission’s monitoring conference in Brussels (11-12 February). In his keynote speech, Mr Calleja said that, according to Cedefop research, ‘employers place a premium on work experience, and in countries where VET is well developed, includes work-based learning and is governed together with social partners, it results in better labour-market outcomes for VET graduates.’ Apprenticeship is a popular form of work-based learning, especially in several European countries. It provides alternate learning in a VET school/institution and in an enterprise. The European alliance for apprenticeships, which was launched in 2013, aims to bring together public authorities, businesses, social partners, VET providers, youth representatives and other key actors to promote apprenticeship schemes and initiatives across Europe. ‘The revival of apprenticeships can only work if learners and enterprises buy in – and this is a challenge, in particular in countries with high youth unemployment rates or a small share of VET,’ noted Mr Calleja. He emphasised that ‘while even the most labour-market relevant education and training cannot create sufficient jobs, apprenticeships and other forms of work-based learning can provide high-quality training and help match learning outcomes to the skills employers require.’ The Cedefop Director said that the Davos World Economic Forum had also ‘underlined the value of these schemes to promote transition to the labour market and activation of young people out of work.’ What makes apprenticeship attractive, according to Mr Calleja, is that it provides the skills that companies need, acts as a stepping stone to the labour market, offers learners a formally recognised qualification, which entitles them to exercise an occupation, and gives them access to further education and training. ‘Several EU Member States have shaped policies to make VET more attractive and have worked on common criteria to assure it is of high quality,’ he added. However, Mr Calleja stressed, just one in four enterprises with 10 or more employees trains apprentices. So, ‘if we want to give more young people a chance to get an apprenticeship, we have to encourage more enterprises in more countries to train, and also in other sectors and occupations than those in craft-type professions traditionally taking on apprentices, such as in ICT, sales, healthcare or renewable energies.’ While the pressure to tackle youth unemployment has moved work-based learning high up on the European policy agenda, Mr Calleja warned that ‘it is a risk if we expect too much in virtually no time; what we need is policy learning from good and bad experience, to understand what works and what doesn’t.’ He concluded that we also ‘need to work closer with VET institutions in Member States to support cooperation between VET schools and enterprises, the use of the European tools for transparency, recognition and mobility, and to build a culture of “learning by doing” at all levels of the qualifications frameworks based on good governance, quality assurance and sustainable partnerships’.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0109	2014-01-23	NEWS	Cedefop at the interface of training, skills, qualifications and employability	 Presenting Cedefop’s work at the European Parliament, the Centre’s new Director, James Calleja, said that all its activities ‘aim at emphasising the inescapable link between training, skills, qualifications and employability.’ ‘Cedefop’s work is at the interface between education and training and the needs of the labour market,’ stressed Mr Calleja. ‘Employability is crucial for the future of the Union and it is necessary to ensure that the economic crisis is tackled through a responsive and skilled workforce,’ he added. Mr Calleja noted that, when he was appointed Director in October 2013, he found ‘a vibrant European Centre, which is increasingly pivotal in the European Union’s mission to address high levels of unemployment, particularly among young people.’ He cited a recent positive external evaluation of Cedefop’s work, adding that his challenge is ‘to keep up the high standards achieved but also to ensure that Cedefop continues to provide answers to policy-makers dealing with unemployment, preventing people leaving vocational education and training early and unqualified, helping those who lack skills and competences for today’s and tomorrow’s labour market, ensuring that all types of skills are recognised, and supporting businesses who wish to provide work-based learning.’ Mr Calleja remarked that the labour market today, and more importantly that of tomorrow, demands that people continue to learn. In conclusion, Mr Calleja highlighted three facets of a common challenge that will define Cedefop’s work in 2014: adult education and learning – an area which Cedefop is strengthening so that more people find the acquisition of skills and competences closer to their work experiences; European alliance for apprenticeships – Cedefop will fully support the Commission in its work on the alliance, and Member States working together to create an attractive apprenticeship culture within the 2020 education and training targets; technical support to Member States in all aspects of European tools and synergies between tools – not all Member States are cruising at the same altitude on European initiatives and tools, and Cedefop proposes to intensify its support to help Member States come closer to the 2020 education and training targets.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0115	2013-12-18	NEWS	Press release - For young people to stay in education, labour market measures are also needed	 Too many young people leave education (including vocational education) too soon. Yet early leavers are at greater risk of long-term unemployment, poverty and crime, while the cost of early leaving to the European economy is now 1.25% of GDP. But keeping people in (vocational) education is not only an issue for vocational education and training alone. It also depends on wider labour market and social welfare issues: initial salary policy, employer participation, access to professions, the perceived value of qualifications, and the range of guidance services available to students. Cedefop’s latest briefing note Keeping young people in (vocational) education: what works? examines the complex reasons behind early leaving from vocational education and suggests policy options to help early leavers acquire a qualification.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0111	2013-12-16	NEWS	Press release - Turkish photographer receives Cedefop / Photomuseum Prize	 Cedefop Director James Calleja presented on Monday in Thessaloniki the Cedefop / Photomuseum Prize to Turkish photographer Aydin Cetinbostanoglu for his project ‘Diary of a village doctor’. Mr Calleja stressed ‘the truly international character of the prize’ and added that the award is ‘not only a way to support the art of photography but also to visualise vocational education and training and to draw attention to the big issue of today: how to bridge education and work’. Since 2007, Cedefop and the Thessaloniki Museum of Photography have been organising international competitions for the best photographic portfolio on the theme of working and learning.  The 2012/13 winner Aydin Cetinbostanoglu was chosen by an international jury consisting of Simon Edwards from the Maison Européenne de la Photographie, Elina Heikka, Director of the Finnish Museum of Photography, Jennifer Trauscher, who manages the Impossible Project in Vienna, Vangelis Ioakeimidis, Director of the Thessaloniki Photomuseum and Christian Lettmayr, Deputy Director of Cedefop. He received EUR 5 000 and his prize-winning work will be exhibited in Thessaloniki. The theme of the competition was ‘Learning for life, working to grow’. This collaborative effort by the two institutions draws attention to the themes of Cedefop’s mandate: training, skills, lifelong learning and the links between employment and education. Criteria for the award selection are mostly based on the creative and innovative capacity to interpret the theme. A winner of several awards in his career, Mr Cetinbostanoglu was born in Izmir, in 1954. He staged his first photo exhibition in 1973. He studied Political Sciences at Ankara University. He likes to share the happiness and sadness of human beings using his camera lens and to make friends while taking their pictures. He has made 22 personal exhibitions and has taken part in 20 group ones. In 2014, when Thessaloniki is the Youth Capital of the European Union, the theme for the Cedefop / Photomuseum competition will be ‘Reinventing the present: original jobs’.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0113	2013-12-10	NEWS	Literacy skills of vocational education and training graduates differ significantly across European countries – PIAAC survey	 According to first findings from the OECD survey of adult skills (PIAAC), literacy levels vary across countries and between vocational education and training (VET) and general education graduates at upper-secondary levels. Cedefop is working closely with the OECD on developing indicators for the survey to measure development and use of skill. At a joint workshop on 4-6 December the two organisations examined the findings. Across all 24 countries (and sub-national regions) participating in the survey the mean literacy score for young adults aged 16-29 whose highest level is vocationally oriented upper-secondary education is 273 out of a possible 500. In some European countries such as Finland or the Netherlands literacy scores are significantly above the OECD mean for this group, while in Spain, Poland and Ireland they are below. These differences matter. In Finland, for instance, literacy skills of young graduates from general upper secondary programmes are as good as those of university graduates in Italy. Cedefop Director James Calleja told the participants: ‘Skills are a passport to progression. No matter how many qualifications you have, it is what you can do that interests employers. It is time to look at education from a holistic point of view – horizontally and vertically. OECD’s survey of adult skills shows that education is making a difference in many countries.’ Notes to editors • PIAAC – Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competences • Countries included in the survey: Australia, Austria, Belgium (Flanders), Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, South Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom (England and Northern Ireland), United States and two partner countries – Cyprus and Russia. Data was collected between August 2011 and March 2012. • A second round of the survey started in 2012 involving nine additional countries: Chile, Greece, Indonesia, Israel, Lithuania, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovenia and Turkey.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0114	2013-12-09	NEWS	Press release - Qualifications frameworks raise new policy challenges	 Qualifications frameworks based on learning outcomes are now a global phenomenon. Over 30 European countries are in the process of introducing comprehensive national frameworks. But the long-term success of these frameworks depends on creating close links with other education and labour market policies and practices; on citizens’ awareness of their uses; and on active involvement of social partners every step of the way. Cedefop’s latest briefing note Qualifications frameworks in Europe: forging the right links discusses the various stages of national framework implementation, and outlines challenges policy-makers face in making qualifications frameworks operational. The Centre has been actively involved in the conceptual and practical development of the European qualifications framework and closely monitors development and implementation of national frameworks. The shift to learning outcomes and its impact: taking stock of European policies and practices, an international conference organised by Cedefop in Thessaloniki on 21 and 22 November 2013, discussed how this shift, including in the new qualifications frameworks, affects a range of policies and practices in education and training.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0118	2013-12-03	NEWS	Six solutions for effective vocational education and training – proposed by the Cedefop Director	 Cedefop Director James Calleja told participants at a conference on skills mobility and competitiveness that there are solutions to the ‘worrying situation with millions of jobs in Europe still remaining vacant while 27 million people are unemployed’. Mr Calleja addressed particularly the issue of youth unemployment, saying that it is up to 23% – in some countries even hitting the 60% mark. ‘This is an issue, which will be picked up again in this particular city next year because Thessaloniki will be European Youth Capital, and I think it will be particularly appropriate for us as an EU agency to really focus on this,’ he noted in his speech at the conference organised by the European Economic and Social Committee’s Labour Market Observatory. According to Mr Calleja, ‘we have a choice here: we can be technical and, therefore, act as kings; we can be prophets and predict but do nothing about it; and we can be brokers and do something about our own predictions.’ The Cedefop Director talked about six solutions: • We need to ensure easy access to labour market needs, to counsellors and guidance teachers in schools as early as possible. It’s very important that young people start seeing the labour market in secondary school. They should be seeing qualifications as the end result of compulsory education, but they should see the labour market as an important end result of their general education. • Forecasting of skills should go hand in hand with qualifications. People need to acquire qualifications. We cannot tolerate people without any formal qualifications anymore. There should be no failures in compulsory education. No one should go into vocational education and training (VET) with zero qualifications. • Continuous VET and initial VET should be given more importance by all social partners, by industry itself. We should make them more visible, more attractive to young people. It is a solution for unemployment. • The dialogue with schools, with general education, should be more intensive. VET, Higher Education and General Education should speak to each other more frequently because people ought to acquire skills as early as possible in life. So, the earlier the intervention the better. • Apprenticeship schemes, work-based learning, workplace learning are all solutions that we have already proposed, and the European Area for Skills and Qualifications, which the Commission has launched, and the European Alliance for Apprenticeships elaborate on these propositions. We need to make them more visible to Member States and to our stakeholders. • We have to convince more institutions to use the European tools. Universities today have organised themselves in such a way that there is synergy between them across Europe. This is not the case with vocational training, and I think this is a challenge for us. We have a credit system in place, we have a VET quality assurance policy in place, we have Europass. ESCO (classification of European Skills/Competences, Qualifications and Occupations) was launched a few weeks ago. We have been talking about the learning outcomes approach for quite some time now as well as the validation of informal/non formal learning. All these are tools, which promote employability and give solutions to the need for skills and mobility for competitiveness. Mr Calleja concluded: ‘We should address our messages to everyone; to all learners, to all employees, employers and social partners. Skills and qualifications are a necessity for today’s and tomorrow’s labour markets.’ Downloads Press releaseEN92.17 KB 	https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news-and-press/press-and-media/press-releases/six-solutions-effective-vocational-education-and-training-proposed-cedefop
CEDEFOP_NEWS_0117	2013-12-02	NEWS	Cedefop discusses results of OECD survey on adult skills – Thessaloniki is the host	 Countries, employers and individuals need a clear idea of how labour markets and economies are changing and how people are meeting the demand for skills in the 21st century. People with low skills face a greater risk of economic disadvantage. They are more likely to be unemployed and suffer from poor health.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) survey of adult skills (PIAAC) aims to provide some insights into how skills are being developed and used in 24 countries. The first findings of the survey were published in October 2013. They show that the young are more literate, but proficiency in literacy peaks at around 30 years of age. This reflects that most formal learning is done early in life and that skill development in lifelong learning falls markedly with age. This is worrying for Europe, which has an ageing workforce that still needs to keep up with technological and organisational developments. Cedefop is working closely with the OECD on developing indicators to measure development and use of skill based on PIAAC data, and will host a workshop with the organisation on 4-6 December 2013 (Thessaloniki, Cedefop premises). Cedefop Director James Calleja said: ‘Cedefop is committed to developing with the OECD new indicators on skills in VET. We will use the survey data to investigate skill requirements of today’s jobs and to improve our understanding of how the labour market will look like in the foreseeable future. Our objective is to help young people acquire relevant skills and older workers to tap the necessary education and training programmes and qualifications to keep themselves employable. Skills and qualifications are prerequisites to employment.’ Notes to editors • PIAAC – Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies • Countries included in the survey: Australia, Austria, Belgium (Flanders), Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom (England and Northern Ireland), United States and two partner countries – Cyprus and Russia.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0119	2013-11-19	NEWS	Press release - Cedefop conference: The shift to learning outcomes and its impact - taking stock of European policies and practices	 Some 140 experts, policy-makers, social partners, teachers and trainers from 27 countries will take part on Thursday 21 and Friday 22 November 2013 in a Cedefop conference on learning outcomes to discuss how learning-outcome developments have affected policies and practices in education and training during the past decade. The conference ‘The shift to learning outcomes and its impact: taking stock of European policies and practices’ addresses the on-going shift to learning outcomes across European education and training systems. For many, this shift is an opportunity to create education and training systems better able to support lifelong learning, and promote a learning culture closer to the needs of the individual. Others, however, view this approach as problematic; they criticise it as overly bureaucratic, favouring standardisation over diversity and individual choice. The event is aimed at the wide range of stakeholders currently involved in the shift to learning outcomes providing an updated picture of developments in this field. It will support a common understanding of how to promote implementation, avoiding the dangers associated with this shift. The meeting will provide an opportunity for policy-makers, practitioners and researchers to exchange experiences and views in a field where all groups are or should be actively involved. A mix of plenary and working group sessions will discuss in detail learning outcomes as a prerequisite for flexible (lifelong) learning, the dimension of governance through learning outcomes and the implications of the learning outcomes approach in teaching and training. Notes for editors: There will be interview opportunities with Cedefop Director James Calleja and other participants during the event. Please contact the press office in advance.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0116	2013-11-18	NEWS	Press release - Cedefop at the Lithuanian Presidency VET events	 A high-level Cedefop delegation contributed to the EU Lithuanian Presidency’s vocational education and training (VET) events in Vilnius.Cedefop Director James Calleja welcomed Croatia to the agency at the meeting of Directors-General for vocational education and training (DGVT) on 11 and 12 November. He praised the contribution Croatia has already made to vocational training, describing it as a ‘VET-friendly country’. Mr Calleja noted that Cedefop is looking forward to working with the new EU Member State and to forging a new relationship. Responsibility for reporting on Croatia’s VET performance has passed from the European Training Foundation (ETF) to Cedefop, following the country’s accession to the EU in July 2013. ETF Director Madlen Serban spoke about the close collaboration during the pre-accession period between the agency and the Croatian authorities. Croatian government representative Sabina Glasovac spoke about the VET system in the country. The ETF and Cedefop directors presented the Spotlight on VET – Croatia, a concise guide to the country’s VET system, which was produced jointly by the two agencies. At the conference on the role of VET in making education more inclusive, also in Vilnius (12 and 13 November), Cedefop Deputy Director Christian Lettmayr, who moderated a workshop on VET and early school leaving, pointed out that ‘the cause of early leaving is not just found within VET but is influenced by many other factors; it also takes a joint effort and a wider partnership approach to attract learners to VET programmes that suit them and keep them engaged.’ Cedefop expert Alexandra Dehmel presented the findings of the study Return to learning, return to work, which looks at work-based learning and the reintegration of unemployed adults into the labour market. Ms Dehmel said that the main messages for policy-makers are ‘the use of full potential work-based learning has to offer, implementation of holistic policies and programmes, key competence development, use of key success factors for programmes, support of employer involvement and intermediary function of training organisations and improvement of monitoring and implementations of quality assurance systems.’ Downloads Full text of the press releaseEN40.26 KB 	https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news-and-press/press-and-media/press-releases/press-release-cedefop-lithuanian-presidency-vet-events

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0123	2013-10-24	NEWS	Press release - Croatia’s job market between now and 2020	 Although generally similar to the rest of the EU, Croatia’s labour market has some interesting differences. For example, Croatia’s labour force is slightly younger and has a higher proportion of people with medium-level and a lower proportion of people with low-level qualifications than the EU averages. Also, compared to the rest of the EU Croatia has a relatively high share of employment in agriculture and manufacturing. However, although employment in the EU overall will return to its pre-crisis 2008 level between 2017 and 2018, in Croatia employment will still be below its 2008 peak in 2020. These data for Croatia’s labour market come from Cedefop’s skill supply and demand forecasting project. They provide some insights into the challenges and opportunities for people in Croatia and enable comparisons to be made with other EU Member States. Between now and 2020, most job opportunities in Croatia are forecast to be in distribution and transport, and non-marketed services. Total job opportunities include newly created jobs (expansion demand) and the need to replace people leaving jobs, for example, to retire (replacement demand). In Croatia, replacement demand is forecast to provide almost seven times more job opportunities than newly created jobs up to the year 2020.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0128	2013-09-30	NEWS	Press release - Cedefop celebrates study visits success, looks forward to Erasmus+	 Study visits programme for education and training specialists, the first peer-learning programme in the European Union (1978) is coming to an end, with the last of the visits to be held in June 2014 (applications accepted to October 15). In its last phase, under the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007-2013, the programme involved over 15 000 people in positions of authority in education and training. Beneficiaries used the study visits to set up networks, review their own practices and influence policy change. The successor to the lifelong learning programme (LLP), Erasmus+, will bring together various programmes under three Key Actions: learning mobility, cooperation for innovation and good practices, and support for policy reform. What these changes mean for the people who have found value in the study visits, and how the advantages of the study visits can be integrated in Erasmus+, was the focus of Cedefop’s conference ‘Promoting change in education and training policy and practice – The value of peer learning’. The event involved visits organisers and participants, national agency representatives, social partners, members of the Lifelong Learning Committee and European Commission officials. The core of the conference was 13 groups structured like ‘mini study visits’, with former organisers/participants detailing what had been of value to them in the programme and drawing suggestions for Erasmus+. Opening the conference, Cedefop Acting Director Christian Lettmayr said: ‘Participation of civil society in the implementation of any policy change is of paramount importance. We should find an alternative way to retain the benefits of peer learning, which helps to build a European identity.’ Anna-Maria Giannopoulou of the European Commission said that Erasmus+ continues the study visits ‘in spirit and impact’. But because both EU and national contexts have changed – with greater ‘streamlining’ of education policies thanks to the open method of coordination – the new programme needs to focus on the systemic level, where the policy impact is expected to be stronger; and on the EU targets of Europe 2020.   Downloads Full text of the press releaseEN220.93 KB 	https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news-and-press/press-and-media/press-releases/press-release-cedefop-celebrates-study-visits-success-looks-forward-erasmus
CEDEFOP_NEWS_0131	2013-09-25	NEWS	Press release - The European social model, a key driver for competitiveness	 (Brussels, Belgium): The European social model is more important than ever to help tackle the jobs crisis in Europe, participants were told at the joint EU agencies and European Parliament event on the European social model and competitiveness in Brussels on 25 September 2013. The European social model relies on partnership, trust and consultation for finding fair and productive solutions. Enshrined in the EU treaties, social dialogue is an integral part of the system. The recurring question debated at the event was whether Europe can afford its social model and still be among the most competitive economies in the world. ‘The theme of the seminar is most appropriate’, said Xavier Prats Monné, Deputy Director-General for Education and Culture, European Commission, in his opening keynote speech. ‘The essence of the European social model is not just that solidarity and social protection are a good thing in themselves, but that, in order to achieve higher rates of employment, sustainable growth and competitiveness, the European Union must protect social integration and combat discrimination’. ‘The work and contributions by the four EU agencies are more important than ever in these times of economic and employment crisis. We are overwhelmed by negative economic studies and reports in the media but, as policymakers, we need more evidence-based policy recommendations on employment creating measures and fewer aspirational statements of further austerity measures, says Pervenche Berès, Chair of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, European Parliament. ‘Europe needs to repair its business model,’ says László Andor, Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, European Commission. ‘Solidarity within EU Member States can only be strengthened if solidarity between Member States improved. Therefore, there is an urgent need to step up social partners contribution to social dialogue debate, to provide a stable, transparent input required to the EU semester.’ Christian Lettmayr, Acting Director of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) stressed that vocational education and training is essential for Europe’s competitiveness. He demonstrated how Europe must get the best out of its people in order to be competitive, calling on companies to increase work-based learning by taking on more apprentices. Enterprises have to become learning organisations, he added. Christa Sedlatschek, Director of European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) outlined that good health and safety is good for business, and safe and healthy workplaces are indeed more productive. She argued that small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and microbusiness will create jobs and drive the economy, and that health and safety is an integral part of running a business independent of size. Madlen Serban, Director of European Training Foundation (ETF) provided clear evidence that improved education and training in the neighbouring countries of the EU enhances employability, competitiveness and entrepreneurship. Juan Menéndez-Valdés, Director of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) provided compelling research findings that there is no inherent trade-off between a fair and a competitive society. Four EU agencies - Cedefop, ETF, Eurofound and EU-OSHA – and the EP Employment and Social Affairs Committee joined forces on 25 September 2013 to examine and highlight how each one is contributing to a strengthened European Social Model – in its own unique way. Assessing how exactly the European Social Model can contribute to increased competitiveness, the Agencies provided different perspectives in the context of the current crisis. Considering the challenges for Europe’s businesses, workers and young people, the Agencies presented a multidimensional approach to a better and more sustainable future for the Europe of tomorrow.    Downloads Full text of the press releaseEN73.76 KB 	https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news-and-press/press-and-media/press-releases/press-release-european-social-model-key-driver-competitiveness
CEDEFOP_NEWS_0125	2013-09-16	NEWS	Press release - Opportunities and challenges for the European vocational credit transfer system	 Cedefop's briefing note on ECVET Cedefop has published a briefing note on ECVET: ‘Opportunities and challenges for ECVET, the vocational credit transfer system’. Cedefop’s monitoring report shows that most countries see the European credit system for vocational education and training (ECVET) as an instrument to enable cross-border mobility of vocational students. Hundreds of transnational pilot projects are in place, largely funded by the EU. However, the report concludes that for ECVET to go a step further and contribute to recognition of learning outcomes and allow accumulation of credits towards qualifications, it needs to be firmly and fully integrated into national lifelong learning policies and aligned with evolving validation practices. The briefing note is available in nine languages (Spanish, German, Greek, English, French, Italian, Lithuanian, Polish and Portuguese) and in two formats (Pdf or eBook optimised for tablets and smartphones) at: http://www.cedefop.europa.eu/EN/publications/21517.aspx For the full briefing notes archive go to http://www.cedefop.europa.eu/EN/news/briefing-notes.aspx 	https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news-and-press/press-and-media/press-releases/press-release-opportunities-and-challenges-european-vocational-credit-transfer

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0127	2013-07-04	NEWS	Press release - Croatia: How is the EU newest member performing on vocational education and training and lifelong learning?	 To mark Croatia’s accession to the European Union (EU) on 1 July 2013, Cedefop has prepared a statistical overview on vocational education and training (VET) and lifelong learning in the country. Selected for their policy relevance and importance to achieving the Europe 2020 strategy’s objectives, the indicators quantify key aspects of VET and lifelong learning and relate Croatia’s performance to the EU average. Key findings for Croatia • Initial VET is well represented at upper secondary level, accounting for more than 70% of students enrolled at this level in 2011, well above the EU average of 50%. • Participation in continuing vocational training (CVT) and adult learning is low compared to other European countries. In 2010, around 23% of employees participated in CVT courses, well below the EU average of 38%. However, a relatively high number of Croatian enterprises, around 57%, provided training in 2010. • Participation by adults aged 24 to 64 in lifelong learning was at 2.4% in 2012, well below the EU average of 9%. The European target is an average of 15% by 2020. • In 2012, the percentage of 30 to 34 year-olds with a university-level or equivalent vocational qualification was close to the EU average of 9%. • In the same year, some 22% of 18 to 24 year-olds were not in employment, education or training, compared to the EU average of 17%. • Latest data show that in Croatia some 24% of people aged 30 to 34 have at least a tertiary-level qualification, compared to 36% at the EU level. The trend, however, is clearly upward as the 24% rate in 2012 compares to just 16% ten years ago. • In 2012, 55% of adults aged 20 to 64 were employed in Croatia (the lowest level in Europe together with Greece), compared to the EU average of 68%. However, fewer adults had low levels of education, around 21% of people aged 20 to 64, compared to the EU average of 26%. Responsibility for reporting on Croatia has passed from the European Training Foundation (ETF) to Cedefop following the country’s accession to the EU. At a knowledge-sharing seminar involving Cedefop and ETF in April, Vesna Hrvoj-Šic, Senior Adviser on VET at the Croatian Ministry of Science, Education and Sports, said: ‘We expect Cedefop to support us in joining the club. Up to now, working with ETF, we were comparing [our practices to those in the EU]. Our main challenge is not education itself but the impact on the EU labour market. We’ve been looking at what’s happening in our neighbourhood and we’ll now find ourselves in a new situation.’ Cedefop’s Loukas Zahilas, Senior Expert on qualifications and learning outcomes, noted: ‘We are looking forward to cooperating with Croatia, the 28th member of our big European family and working together to develop European VET policy.’ Read the full statistical overview on Croatia here: http://www.cedefop.europa.eu/EN/articles/21604.aspx  For more information on these issues: www.cedefop.europa.eu Subscribe to Cedefop’s free electronic newsletter: http://www.cedefop.europa.eu/EN/news/newsletters.aspx Downloads Press release as a Pdf fileEN46.77 KB Press release in CroatianHR96.32 KB 	https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news-and-press/press-and-media/press-releases/press-release-croatia-how-eu-newest-member-performing-vocational-education-and
CEDEFOP_NEWS_0122	2013-06-27	NEWS	Press release - Report: European countries make real progress toward greater transparency for qualifications	 Over the past year, progress in developing and implementing national qualifications frameworks (NQFs) has allowed more countries to link these to the common reference framework for qualifications, the European Qualifications Framework (EQF). How far each country has progressed along this road can now easily be seen by clicking on country chapters in Cedefop’s working paper, Analysis and overview of NQF developments in European countries, the fourth annual report Cedefop has prepared on this topic. This linking process makes it easier for countries to understand one another’s qualifications. As a result, it also eases citizens’ lifelong transitions between learning and working, across sectors, and within the entire European labour market. Some countries also see qualifications frameworks as tools for education reform and institutional change. Twenty national frameworks are now linked to the EQF At the end of the period covered by the working paper (December 2012), 16 out of 36 countries working together on the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) - Austria, Belgium (FL), Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal and the UK - had linked their national qualification levels to EQF levels. By late May 2013, this number had gone up to 19, with the addition of  Italy, Poland and Slovenia. Moreover, some countries, including the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Lithuania and Portugal, have started featuring NQF and EQF levels on new certificates, diplomas or Europass documents.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0130	2013-06-13	NEWS	Press release - Time for action on work-based learning	 Participants in Cedefop’s conference on tackling skills mismatch agreed that Europe needs to implement policy initiatives on developing work-based learning as an answer to rising youth unemployment. High-level participants in the two-day conference, which finished on Thursday 13 June, included European Union Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth Androulla Vassiliou, German Parliamentary Secretary of State, Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Thomas Rachel and Thessaloniki Mayor Yiannis Boutaris. In her keynote speech, Ms Vassiliou argued that the risk of a lost generation is ‘a real threat’ but added that ‘at EU-level we are working with the Member States to put Europe back on the road to jobs and growth’. The Commissioner referred to the upcoming launch of a European Alliance for Apprenticeships as something to be ‘proud of’ and noted that apprenticeships are ‘a win-win situation – employers get to know potential employees, while apprentices directly contribute to the output of the company’. Ms Vassiliou stressed that ‘it will be only by pooling the efforts of EU Member States, social partners, business, other relevant actors and the European Commission that we will be able to develop high-quality apprenticeships across Europe’. Thomas Rachel called for ‘systematic reform’ in vocational education and training. He told the conference that ‘the dual system is the backbone of Germany’s economic success’ and that his country wants to support its European partners ‘in their reform process’. In his address, Thessaloniki Mayor Yiannis Boutaris highlighted the importance of vocational education and training, especially in countries like Greece, pointing out that ‘the reform should have started before the crisis’. Cedefop Acting Director Christian Lettmayr said in the conference’s closing statement: ‘There may be limits to growth but there are no limits to change.’ Downloads Full text of the press releaseEN40.73 KB 	https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news-and-press/press-and-media/press-releases/press-release-time-action-work-based-learning

Cedefop will explore ways of tackling skill mismatch through work-based learning and apprenticeships at a conference on 12 and 13 June in Thessaloniki, Greece. Experts on vocational education and training, policy-makers from the European Commission and Member States as well as social partners’ representatives will take part in the debate. European Union (EU) Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth, Androulla Vassiliou, will deliver the closing statement. Greek Minister for Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports, Konstantinos Arvanitopoulos, German Parliamentary Secretary of State, Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Thomas Rachel, and Thessaloniki Mayor, Yiannis Boutaris, will be among those addressing the event. To see the full programme, go to: http://events.cedefop.europa.eu/VET-conference-2013/en/programme. The conference will debate how vocational education and training can be improved by information on labour-market trends, how various forms of apprenticeship can address youth unemployment and how peer learning and alliances can help develop work-based learning. Cedefop’s Acting Director, Christian Lettmayr, says: ‘This event is important because it deals with skill forecasting and the European alliance for apprenticeships. The former questions if better information on future needs of the labour market can help adapt the education system in general and vocational education and training in particular to future needs, thus providing young people with a better chance to find a good job. The latter will help countries who wish to develop their apprenticeship and work-based learning systems. This is a promising measure to decrease youth unemployment as countries with a strong apprenticeship system show.’ Downloads Full text of the press releaseEN104.84 KB 	https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news-and-press/press-and-media/press-releases/press-release-renewing-vocational-education-and-training-tackle-skill-mismatch
CEDEFOP_NEWS_0124	2013-03-19	NEWS	Press release - What about the (older) workers?	 The reality of the UK’s ageing workforce is that most of us face the real prospect of having to get out of bed in the morning to go to work until we are around 70.The recent House of Lord’s report Ready for Ageing? discusses the implications of an older workforce for pensions, health and social care. Things mainly provided by the state. Although the report entreats employers to be more positive about employing older people, it doesn’t say much about jobs or working conditions for older workers. Between now and 2020 the number of people in the UK aged over 50 either in or looking for a job will increase by more than a million and will make up nearly a third of the workforce. In contrast there will be half a million fewer young people aged between 15 and 24. According to Cedefop (the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training), Employers recognise the problem of ageing, but do not appear ready. Older workers will have to cope with advances in technology, new tasks and changing work organisation. To do that they need to learn, but older workers tend to receive less training and their participation has been consistently below European targets. Older workers need help to stay fit and keep their skills up-to-date if UK businesses are to be both competitive and environmentally aware. The problem is that neither employers nor ageing workers always see the benefits of investing in their skills. New approaches are needed to keep people in the workforce and to tap an ageing workforce’s potential.

The initiative, which focuses on apprenticeship-type, work-based learning, was launched on 11 December 2012 in Berlin. Germany and six other Member States have signed Memoranda defining the scope and objectives of future collaboration. Germany has been at the forefront of dual training, i.e. vocational training that includes both a theoretical, school-based component, and a period of practical work within a company. In light of the Education and Training 2020 Strategy, which focuses on job-related training, several countries had expressed a keen interest in developing dual forms of training in close cooperation with Germany. On the invitation of German Federal Education Minister Annette Schavan, Germany, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovakia and Spain, in association with the European Commission, signed a memorandum of cooperation on vocational education and training in Europe on 11 December 2012. At the conclusion of the meeting, Xavier Prats Monné, Deputy General Director for Education and Training at the European Commission, said that this is the beginning of a European initiative which other Member States will soon join.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0136	2012-11-22	NEWS	Press release - Despite changing attitudes, employers are not yet prepared for an ageing workforce	 Attitudes toward what used to be called “the demographic time bomb” are improving: Europe’s ageing workforce is increasingly seen as a factor of growth and innovation. Yet while employers are fully aware that the workforce is ageing, they do little to prepare for this change, and certainly not enough to make the best of it. Cedefop’s latest publication on working and ageing, The benefits of investing in an ageing workforce, collects papers that examine this ‘ageing paradox” and show how investing in learning later in life can bring real benefits to companies as well as individuals. The papers cover, among other EU Member States, Germany, Italy, England, Austria and Belgium, but also look at developments in Canada and the USA; sectors discussed range from the pharmaceutical industry to retail. The papers collected in this publication emphasise that employers need first and foremost to develop ‘demographic literacy’, i.e. to understand how to create a learner-friendly environment for employees of all ages. Successful companies, research shows, take a life-cycle approach to active ageing, addressing the learning needs of employees from recruitment to retirement.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0134	2012-10-03	NEWS	Press release - For young people, vocational education is a better route to employment	 Vocational education graduates of upper-secondary or post-secondary schools have a greater chance of being employed than graduates of general education at the same level. They are also less likely to spend prolonged periods without work, and more likely to stay on in their first job for more than four years. These are among the findings of a new Cedefop report, From education to working life: the labour market outcomes of vocational education and training. Comparing young graduates of 20-24 years of age shows a considerable gap in employment prospects between vocational and general streams. Almost 76 % of 20-24 year olds with secondary or post-secondary vocational education were working compared with 67 % for general graduates. At present about 23 million young people (aged 25-34) in the European Union are graduates of upper secondary and post-secondary vocational programmes – a figure higher than the population of Romania. Although short-term employment prospects are better for vocational graduates, project Manager Alex Stimpson warns against complacency.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0138	2012-07-12	NEWS	Press release - Austrian vocational training needs to become more open to adult learners	 Pressemitteilung - Die österreichische Berufsbildung muss sich erwachsenen Lernenden stärker öffnen The number of younger workers in Austria is set to increase by 2020, and a greater proportion of Austrian workers achieve the all-important medium-level qualifications. But in developing skills for the next decade, the country faces similar challenges to the rest of Europe – an ageing workforce. The labour force aged 25-34 will increase in Austria, unlike the EU as whole. But the country’s workforce is still ageing. And just like the rest of Europe, Austria needs to move away from age-bound education and training, to more flexible arrangements. Cedefop’s Steve Bainbridge, who recently presented the latest skills forecast (2012-2020) at the OeAD in Vienna, explains: “The education and training system in Austria is renowned across Europe for its high quality, particularly in terms of initial vocational education for young people. But the demographic data cannot be ignored. Austrian workers will need systematic continuing training, and in some cases, reskilling.”     Bis 2020 wird sich die Zahl der jüngeren Arbeitnehmer in Österreich erhöhen, und ein zunehmender Anteil der österreichischen Arbeitnehmer wird die alles entscheidende mittlere Qualifikation erlangen. Betrachten wir aber das nächste Jahrzehnt, so steht Österreich vor ähnlichen Problemen wie der Rest von Europa: Es müssen neue Kompetenzen angelegt werden – bei einer alternden Erwerbsbevölkerung. Die Erwerbsbevölkerung im Alter von 25-34 wird in Österreich, im Gegensatz zur EU als Ganzes, zunächst noch wachsen. Dennoch altern die Erwerbstätigen des Landes. Und wie der Rest Europas muss sich auch Österreich von einem altersbeschränkten Bildungs- bzw. Berufsbildungssystem verabschieden und flexiblere Vorkehrungen treffen. Steve Bainbridge vom Cedefop, der kürzlich die jüngsten Qualifikationsprognosen (2012-2020) des Cedefop bei der österreichischen Nationalagentur Lebenslanges Lernen (OeAD) in Wien vorstellte, erklärt: “Das österreichische Bildungs- und Berufsbildungssystem ist in ganz Europa für seine Qualität, insbesondere in der Erstausbildung junger Menschen, bekannt. Doch die demographischen Fakten lassen sich nicht wegdiskutieren: österreichische Erwerbstätige müssen sich ihr ganzes Erwerbsleben hindurch weiterqualifizieren, und hierzu zählt auch die systematische Weiterbildung und – in besonderen Fällen – die Neuqualifizierung erwachsener Erwerbstätiger“.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0140	2012-06-20	NEWS	Press release - Governments and employers must act to help people develop skills for green jobs	 The greening of the European economy, as outlined in the EU 2020 strategy, will have profound effects on the labour market. Yet not enough is being done to make sure people are acquiring the right skills. Cedefop’s new report Green skills and environmental awareness in vocational education and training shows that difficulties of employers to influence the development of new, green qualifications in VET and the uncertainty surrounding regulations and policies are slowing down developments towards a greener economy. Learning providers report difficulties in understanding the skill needs of employers and employees. The study identifies main challenges and priorities in eight EU Member States (Germany, Greece, Italy, Hungary, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Finland and the UK), and takes as examples nine occupations affected by the green economy. Overall, the report found little evidence that green policies are influencing skills development and hiring policies. There is clearly a need for policy-makers and social partners to raise awareness and take common action. Several occupations relate directly to the greening of European economies - such as energy auditors, insulation workers, solar panel installers and environmental engineers. But not enough people are aware of such occupations as possible career options. This may be because training routes into some of the occupations are not clear, while others are very new. The report found few examples of projects seeking to steer unemployed workers, disadvantaged groups or young people towards such occupations. Improving the status of these occupations could make the general public, policy-makers and learning providers more aware of the opportunities created by the transition to a low-carbon, resource-efficient economy.

But how can we be sure we mean the same thing by the same term? Cedefop’s new language tool is here to help. The new Multilingual Synopsis of the European Training Thesaurus is an electronic publication relevant to anyone working in the education, training and employment fields. It selects 1207 terms and concepts which appear frequently in literature related to European vocational education and training. The aim is for users to develop a common understanding of the terms used in the field. The synopsis, which allows for a quick navigation by language, term and topic, forms the basis of the full-fledged online thesaurus Cedefop is currently preparing. Marc Willem, Head of Cedefop’s Library and Documentation service, which manages the thesaurus project, explains: ‘We have found that people working in education and employment need a kind of ‘Swiss Army Knife’ that will allow them to pin down the meaning of terms and tie similar ideas together. This is what we believe this synopsis can provide.’ Each term is presented in 11 languages: Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, and Swedish.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0149	2012-06-11	NEWS	Press release - Member States to take charge of European mobility instrument for vocational students	 Starting in 2012, responsibility for the implementation of the European Credit system for Vocational Education and Training will lie mainly with the Member States. The co-organisers of the third annual ECVET Forum demonstrated how useful communities of practice can be for the smooth implementation of the system by setting up the event itself as just such a community of practice. Speaking at the Forum, Antonio Silva Mendes, Director at the European Commission, said that the challenge is to close the gap between the supply and demand for skills. One important way of doing this is to foster mobility. “We need to encourage companies to take on a bigger role in developing emerging skills. For this we should help to make an individual’s learning – however and wherever acquired – clear to prospective employers. At present, only about 3 % of initial vocational education graduates do part of their training in another EU country. Our aim is to double that percentage by 2020.” Cedefop’s Acting Director Christian Lettmayr pointed out that this effort is driven by the pressure of rising unemployment. “Typically, European tools are not a quick-fix solution for immediate problems; they take time to develop and implement. But we are facing a crisis, and need to act now so that people see concrete results in terms of employability.” ECVET makes it easier for anyone undertaking vocational education and training to move across countries by enabling people to accumulate credits from different training providers in different countries. Credits are validated by each institution and recognised by the awarding body of the final qualification.The system was designed by the European Commission in cooperation with Cedefop, which continues to monitor how it operates across Europe.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0141	2012-03-21	NEWS	Press release - Skills forecast reveals risks and opportunities in Europe’s labour market	 Cedefop’s latest skill forecast shows that the European Union can expect a net increase in employment of 8 million new jobs between 2010 and 2020. Nearly ten times more jobs (around 75 million) will be generated to replace workers who leave the labour market.But skill mismatches and, in some sectors, skill shortages raise risks for the European labour market and the competitiveness of the European economy. Slower economy, greater mismatch  The need for higher qualifications continues to rise, but because of the crisis the immediate demand has slowed down. This has led many people to take jobs for which they are overqualified and increased the risks of mismatch. Cedefop’s Acting Director Christian Lettmayr cautions against drawing the wrong conclusions. Presenting the findings of the skills forecast at the European Economic and Social Committee today, he said: “Concerns over possible mismatches should not discourage people from seeking higher qualifications. A highly-qualified workforce is one of – if not the – most important factor for Europe’s competitiveness.” Shortages persist despite high unemployment While workers are affected by mismatches, some sectors face shortages. Too few people, for example, are studying science, technology, maths and engineering. These fields continue to be in high demand. By 2020, about 40 % of young people will have a university degree or equivalent. But qualifications are not enough. In search of the right skills profile, more and more students are opting for upper-secondary, pre-tertiary and university-level vocational qualifications. In 2020, jobs requiring medium qualification levels will still outnumber those requiring high and low qualifications.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0148	2012-03-08	NEWS	Press release - Increasing shortage of green skills in Germany raises concerns	 Deutschland: Qualifikationsengpässe bei grünen Arbeitsplätzen geben Anlass zur Sorge   A lack of long-term investment in green skills has potentially serious repercussions for Europe’s economy and labour market. Shortages in fields related to the low-carbon economy are already becoming apparent in countries with low unemployment, such as Germany, the Netherlands and the UK, and are expected to rise in all EU countries.    A forthcoming Cedefop publication suggests this outcome can be avoided if Germany makes a bigger push to recruit new people into science, technology and engineering. All EU countries also need to better integrate skills strategies into environment and energy policy.      Ein Mangel an langfristigen Investitionen in so genannte grüne Qualifikationen hat schwerwiegende Folgen für die europäische Wirtschaft und Arbeitsmärkte. Der Strukturwandel zur kohlenstoffarmen Wirtschaft führt bereits jetzt in Ländern mit niedriger Arbeitslosigkeit wie Deutschland, den Niederlanden und Großbritannien zu Engpässen, die auch in anderen EU-Mitgliedstaaten spürbar zu werden drohen. Eine kürzlich erschienene Veröffentlichung des Europäischen Zentrums für die Förderung der Berufsbildung (Cedefop) legt nahe, dass Deutschland die Neueinstellungen in naturwissenschaftlichen und technischen Sektoren und Ingenieurberufen sehr viel entschiedener aufstocken müsste, um Engpässen entgegenzusteuern. Alle EU-Länder sind gefordert, ihre Qualifikationsstrategien enger mit ihrer Umwelt- und Energiepolitik abzustimmen.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0147	2012-02-29	NEWS	Press release - Underinvestment in green skills raises concerns	 For many companies in the environmental field, the current crisis means easier access to qualified workers. This situation encourages firms to cut back training for green skills. But without long-term investment, particularly in science and technology training, employers may soon experience a shortage of people with the right skills. In fact, countries with low unemployment are already facing such shortages. The potential repercussions for the European economy and labour market are serious. A forthcoming Cedefop publication suggests this outcome can be avoided if, among other measures, countries integrate skills strategies into their environment and energy policies. Cedefop has found that despite the role of policy and regulation in influencing demand for green skills, most Member States do not yet integrate national skill strategies with their environment policies. This means environmental goals are not sufficiently backed up by education and training. What policy-makers can do The study suggests policy makers should focus on encouraging close cooperation between employers, training providers and workers; developing cohesive policies; and ensuring the provision of guidance and career counselling to make green jobs more attractive. The Cedefop study covers all educational levels – from nanotechnologists to recycling collectors – in eight EU countries (Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovakia and the UK) representing various stages of developing a sustainable economy. The main findings were presented at the OECD/Cedefop Green Skills Forum in Paris on 27 February 2012. What the green economy means for employment Opening the Forum, Pascaline Descy, Head of Research and Policy Analysis, spelled out the potential for employment. ‘Between 2005 and 2009’, she said, ‘it is estimated that the renewable energy sector generated 220 000 additional jobs. If the EU reaches the objectives set for sustainable growth in the Europe 2020 strategy, the potential for job creation in Europe is over a million new jobs. But these cannot be covered only by fresh graduates – it is imperative to retrain workers, especially as part of the process of restructuring.’ Downloads Full text of the press releaseEN90.04 KB 	https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news-and-press/press-and-media/press-releases/press-release-underinvestment-green-skills-raises-concerns

It gives a new meaning to the knowledge we have about our own educational system and helps to predict educational trends in the coming years’ (Director of a public school from Spain). Almost 60 % of participants in the Study visits programme for education and vocational training professionals ‘find solutions to work problems during the visit’, according to the programme’s impact assessment. They also come back to work with new ideas: 55 % suggested changes to the work of their institution, and 34 % suggested policy changes. ‘What was valuable to me was not only to learn the host country’s strategy but to see it in action. To meet ""soldiers"" not ""generals"".’ (Representative of national authority from the Czech Republic). Most of the changes they suggested involved new ways of managing their work or a wider philosophy of management; new ways of working within their teams, partnerships with business; and new teaching methods and leaner-centred classrooms. In policy, they suggested improvements to, among other issues, investing in ICT and manager training. About a third of participants developed and submitted cooperation projects after finding partners as a result of the visit.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0142	2011-11-28	NEWS	Press release - The involvement of employers and trade unions is crucial to achieve an open labour market that values all forms of learning	 The common European tools for education and training - such as Europass, the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) and the European credit system for vocational education and training (ECVET) - will make it easier for citizens to pursue learning throughout their lives, and to document their skills and knowledge in a form which is recognised by employers and the labour market across Europe. Employers and trade unions are important partners in the implementation of these tools. Cedefop’s conference ‘Common EU tools for education and training – Working together for shared vocational education and training policies’ - taking place on 24-25 November in the European Parliament - was organised together with and for the social partners. Common to all the tools is their focus on the outcomes of learning, on what a person knows, understands and is actually able to do, rather than a concentration on how, how long and where somebody has been learning. The focus on learning outcomes is helpful to employers and employees alike - clarifying for learners the objective of their learning process and clarifying for employers what they can expect from a particular qualification.

The common European tools for education and training , Europass, European and National Qualification Frameworks, Credit transfer systems and Quality Assurance, will make it easier for citizens to pursue learning throughout their lives, and to have their skills and knowledge recognised across Europe. The question now is how to release the full potential of these tools. After a long development phase, the tools are now being implemented in many countries and becoming of use to citizens. In the past five years, 43 million EU citizens have used Europass, while all EU countries are in the process of establishing national qualification frameworks which refer to the European Qualifications Framework. These make education and training systems easier to understand, and show learners how to make their way within national systems and between countries.

Cedefop’s most recent research paper, ‘Migrants, minorities, mismatch? Skill mismatch among migrants and ethnic minorities in Europe’ shows that migrants from outside the EU typically find jobs beneath their real skills level (‘overeducation’), while ethnic minorities are more likely to lack the educational level required by jobs (‘undereducation’). Minimising the mismatch between skills and jobs is good for individuals as well as for our economies, as it leads to better use of human potential. Accordingly, the report makes policy suggestions, such as setting common standards for the recognition of third-country qualifications, improving access to employment and encouraging companies to offer more opportunities for on-the-job training.

But to ensure success, these curricula need to be carefully designed, delivered and assessed - a process which requires the involvement of key stakeholders and well-trained teachers. This month’s Briefing Note outlines the main conditions to design and deliver outcome-oriented curricula in various European countries and presents the potential benefits to learners. Outcome-based curricula are currently being introduced across Europe - not just in vocational education and training, but also in higher education and, increasingly, in general education. Cedefop is currently carrying out a comparative research study to identify and analyse current curriculum policies and practices in 32 countries. The requirements for success in developing outcome-based curricula were discussed at Cedefop’s 2nd international workshop, Curriculum innovation and reform: an inclusive view to curriculum change, held on 20-21 January 2011 in Thessaloniki with the participation of 45 senior experts from 20 European countries.

But as Cedefop argues in its recent research report, Modernising vocational education and training (see link below), this carries the risk that the efforts to modernise VET will not achieve the desired results. This report, the fourth in Cedefop’s research series, shows how socioeconomic pressures push vocational education and training (VET) systems to change. It also shows how VET itself can be a factor for change: it supports economic development, encourages innovation and productivity in companies, and helps provide the skills that employers and employees need.

Achieving decent work for youth is a challenge shared by all countries across the world. On average, young women and men are two to three times more likely to be unemployed than adults.

Within the international community, the ILO has a special role to play in promoting youth employment.

This programme, in line with the Commissions proposal on the overall budget for this period, envisages a doubling of EU funds for research and development.

The present background note highlights some of the findings of the impact assessment. It identifies the strong and positive impact that research and development in general, and the European Framework Programme in particular, has on the European economy.

Moreover, countries that have not applied restrictions since May 2004 (UK, Ireland and Sweden) have experienced high economic growth, a drop of unemployment and a rise of employment.

He also emphasized that the proportion of participants in the human sciences and pedagogy has considerably increased while strong labour market demand can be observed for experts in the field of technical and physical sciences. In order to meet these challenges the following changes are to be implemented: strengthening education in the field of natural sciences, performing better cooperation between education and the labour market, and reducing the number of students in state financed education. The introduction of a new financing system from 2008, including the so-called ""training contributions"" to be paid by HE participants, will ensure more independence for the institutions concerning the use of available resources.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0240	2009-11-28	NEWS	The European Commission has confirmed the accession of Bulgaria and Romania by 1 January 2007.	" The final monitoring report by the Commission indicates tougher conditions on their entry. Areas of concern Both countries will be closely monitored on the remaining areas of concern. For Bulgaria, these are the justice system, the fight against corruption, police co-operation and the fight against organised crime, money-laundering, integrated administrative control system for agriculture (IACS), transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), and financial control. For Romania, these are further efforts in the justice system and the fight against corruption and IACS, Paying Agencies, TSE and interconnectivity of tax systems. Safeguard measures If the requirements are not met, the Commission has the possibility to invoke safeguards. Under the Accession Treaty, there are three types of safeguard measures: economic, internal market and JHA safeguards, which can be invoked up to three years after accession. These could effect food export bans and cuts to EU funds, such as agricultural and structural funds, as foreseen in the report. In addition, there are transitional arrangements, such as the restriction of free movement of workers from new member states. Also the Commission can take remedial measures to ensure the functioning of EU policies. This concerns the areas of food and air safety, agricultural funds, the judiciary and the fight against corruption. Enlargement pause Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said: I do not think it would be wise to proceed with any enlargements before we have resolved the constitutional issue in Europe. This may raise doubts about to Turkey and the Western Balkans joining the EU soon. Nevertheless, Barroso conceded that he would like Croatia to join as quickly as possible, if it fulfils all the criteria. Latest & next steps: The two countries will join as of 1 January 2007, unless the Council decides to postpone the accession until 2008.

It reinforces the critical importance of skills, and demonstrates how the achievements of the LSC and its partners are having a significant impact across a broad range of political, economic and social policy agendas. Delivering Learning and Skills shows more people are completing courses and achieving qualifications. Success rates have risen by 2.6 per cent to 73.8 per cent in further education and work based learning, a clear signal that the sectors efforts are impacting where they should most. The economic impact of the sector is reflected by a significant increase in the number of people taking Level 2, 3 and Apprenticeships. This includes a 9.4 per cent rise in the number of adults taking Level 2 qualifications and the number completing their Apprenticeship increasing by 31 per cent between 2003/04 and 2004/05. Beyond this, Delivering Learning and Skills reveals how the sector is working hard to drive social mobility and inclusion and having a positive impact on communities. Adults taking part in basic literacy and numeracy training as part of the Skills for Life strategy increased by 22.3 per cent, and a total of 1.275 million adults have now received basic skills training. Similarly, the Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA), which provides financial assistance for training young people, saw a take-up rate of 82 per cent in its first year. 	https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news-and-press/press-and-media/press-releases/uk-learning-and-skill-council-launches-new-progress-report

In 2005 the Government's Five-Year Strategy for Children and Learners set out plans for a refocusing of current performance management arrangements for teachers and head teachers. Revised arrangements for performance management, that build on these plans, and reflect the wider aim of creating the new professionalism for teachers (described by Rewards and Incentives Group (RIG) in its May 2005 evidence to the School Teachers' Review Body) were published for consultation in June. The proposals were broadly welcomed but feedback from local authorities early in the consultation highlighted concern about introducing the revised arrangements in the autumn term. This view was reinforced by the responses to the consultation. It is evident that schools and local authorities are keen to get the introduction of the revised arrangements right and therefore need more time to prepare. Having considered the outcomes of the consultations and the advice of the RIG social partners, Ministers have agreed that the timeline for implementing the revised arrangements for teachers' performance management will be extended until autumn 2007. The revised regulations and guidance will still be published as planned in the 2006 autumn term to ensure schools and local authorities have as much time as possible to plan and prepare in the current academic year. The Training and Development Agency for Schools is supporting the implementation and will also be supporting workshops this term and providing guidance and other support for schools, governors and local authorities over the coming academic year. 	https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news-and-press/press-and-media/press-releases/uk-performance-management-arrangements-teachers-and-head-teachers

Not only is it esential in terms of knowing how to do your job, workers also need to be able to communicate with their colleagues and understand important health and safety information. Many vulnerable workers who don't yet speak fluent English will be let down by this decision. 'Workers who have a good command of the English language are also less likely to be treated badly at work. Individuals who don't speak enough English to understand about the minimum wage and working time rules for example are much more likely to be exploited by bad employers. 'We are worried that limiting access simply to those on benefits and tax credits will cause real problems for vulnerable workers. Applying for benefits requires an understanding of English, but this is exactly what many people living an working in the UK don't yet have. A fairer way would be to give free language training to anyone who can show they are on a low wage or un-waged rather than making someone prove they are in receipt of benefits. 'If free language courses are to end, then the Government must do more to make employers meet the cost of training their employees. Sensible employers already realise the business benefits of having an English-speaking workforce. Ministers should get tough with bosses who are too mean to run free courses or who will now try to pass the costs onto their workers.' 	https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news-and-press/press-and-media/press-releases/uk-tuc-disappointment-ending-free-language-training

That is the main conclusion of the Commission's Strategic Report on economic reform across Europe, published today. The report demonstrates that the Lisbon Strategy is contributing to the recent much improved performance of the EU economy. Structural reforms are also starting to raise potential future growth, improving the long-term prospects for prosperity. However, some Member States have responded more robustly than others and some signs of ""reform fatigue"" have become apparent over the last twelve months. Europe will need to press ahead with further economic reforms at both Community and national level in the next cycle of the Lisbon Strategy to help it weather the impacts of global financial turmoil and higher commodity prices. The report sets out a series of new policy initiatives to respond to this challenge and to reinforce Europe's efforts to shape and respond to globalization. It will be submitted to the Spring European Council in March 2008.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0331	2009-11-27	NEWS	Erasmus Mundus II  the reference for international cooperation in higher education	 The European Commission adopted today a proposal to launch the new generation of the Erasmus Mundus programme for the period 2009-13. Erasmus Mundus started in 2004 to promote European higher education as a centre of excellence in the world. In the first three academic years (2004-2006), more than 2,300 students have participated in the programme and over 1,800 have just been selected to start their studies in Europe in September this year. The new Erasmus Mundus II programme builds on this by aiming to become the EU reference programme for cooperation with third countries in this area. Over a period of five years, just over 950 million euros will be available for European and third-country universities to join forces in joint programmes or collaborative partnerships, and to grant scholarships to European and third-country students for an international study experience.

CEDEFOP_NEWS_0328	2009-11-27	NEWS	Commission launches initiative to facilitate mobility in vocational education and training	 The European Commission has presented plans for a Europe-wide credit system in vocational education and training. This system, called ECVET--ECVET the European Credit system for Vocational Education and Training, would make it easier for citizens to get formal recognition of knowledge, skills and competences they have gained in another country. Member States are encouraged to sign up to this voluntary scheme that does not seek to replace national systems but to facilitate the transfer between them.In ECVET, learning outcomes acquired by an individual in different contexts, whether this is abroad or under another system, can be easily transferred to the individual's home context for accumulation and the achievement of a qualification.The Commission has also put forward plans for a new reference tool that would help Member States exchange best practice in vocational education and training policies. The European Quality Assurance Reference Framework (EQARF), which is the subject of a separate Recommendation, aims at increasing transparency and consistency of policy developments in this field. Member States are invited to improve their quality management practices by applying this set of common criteria and indicative descriptors and measure their policies against it.In ECVET, learning outcomes acquired by an individual in different contexts, whether this is abroad or under another system, can be easily transferred to the individual's home context for accumulation and the achievement of a qualification. 	https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news-and-press/press-and-media/press-releases/commission-launches-initiative-facilitate-mobility-vocational-education-and
CEDEFOP_NEWS_0324	2009-11-27	NEWS	The renewed Lisbon Growth and Jobs Strategy is working, but the EU must reform further to succeed in a globalised age	" Three years after it was relaunched in 2005, the Lisbon Growth and Jobs Strategy is working. That is the main conclusion of the Commission's Strategic Report on economic reform across Europe, published today. The report demonstrates that the Lisbon Strategy is contributing to the recent much improved performance of the EU economy. Structural reforms are also starting to raise potential future growth, improving the long-term prospects for prosperity. However, some Member States have responded more robustly than others and some signs of ""reform fatigue"" have become apparent over the last twelve months. Europe will need to press ahead with further economic reforms at both Community and national level in the next cycle of the Lisbon Strategy to help it weather the impacts of global financial turmoil and higher commodity prices. The report sets out a series of new policy initiatives to respond to this challenge and to reinforce Europe's efforts to shape and respond to globalization. It will be submitted to the Spring European Council in March 2008.
