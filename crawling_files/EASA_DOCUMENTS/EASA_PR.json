This is the first EU-wide operational measure to control the spread of COVID-19 in Europe. The safety directive specifies measures to be taken for flights serving high-risk destinations. It mandates thorough disinfecting and cleaning of aircraft which operate from high-risk destinations after each flight. Exceptions can be made only when disinfectants with a longer-lasting effect are used \u2013 but even in those cases a thorough disinfection is mandated no later than 24 hours after departure from a high-risk airport. \u201cWe need to reassure the passengers, the airline crews and the airport staff that their health and safety is our top priority,\u201d European Commissioner for Transport Adina Valean said. \u201cEU is taking concrete measures to limit and to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. That\u2019s why EASA issued a new safety directive concerning the full disinfection for all the aircrafts after each flight from the high risk areas both in Europe and beyond.\u201d The definition of high risk geographical areas will be based on all available information, taking into account World Health Organisation (WHO) situation report assessments, guidance issued by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and regional public health assessments. EASA further recommended that airlines operating on all routes step up the frequency of cleaning, disinfect as a preventative measure and ensure full disinfection of any aircraft which has carried a passenger who was suspected or confirmed as being infected with COVID-19. Airport operators should similarly disinfect terminals regularly. \u201cThis directive reaffirms the commitment of aviation to combatting the spread of the novel coronavirus,\u201d said Patrick Ky, Executive Director EASA.\u00a0 \u201cWe are aware that many airlines have already enhanced their cleaning procedures, and member states have put additional measures into place. Given that air transport is by its nature international \u2013 and we are dealing with a global pandemic \u2013\u00a0standardisation at European level will make these measures even more efficient.\u201d Additional guidance to be published shortly will recommend that in cases where flights are not full, passengers should be spaced throughout the cabin if possible. Wherever possible, passengers should also be provided with single-use disinfection wipes allowing them to additionally clean their seat area for personal reassurance.\u00a0 Specific recommendations for cabin crew state that crew members who had direct contact with a confirmed case should be placed under 14-day quarantine. Other crew members on the same flight, or who came into contact with a suspect case, should be asked to monitor their own health and react quickly at the first signs of infection. These measures will help to slow the spread of the disease and will support business continuity for flight operations, by ensuring staff do not pass on the virus to colleagues.\u00a0 Related Safety Directives: SD-2020-01 \t\t\u00a0 SD-2020-02 ", "easa_category": "NULL", "url": "https://www.easa.europa.eu/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/easa-issues-safety-directive-combat-spread-covid-19-airline"}, {"id": "EASA_PR_0002", "date": "2020-02-25", "title": "European Industry and Regulators Unite to Provide a Roadmap for Zero Emissions Aviation", "text": " OSLO, Norway, February 25, 2020\u00a0 Key players from the European aviation industry met in Oslo to set the framework for a unique programme that will transform Norwegian air transportation and serve as a learning ground for sustainable aviation on a regional scale.\u00a0\u00a0 Representatives from Airbus, Avinor, Leonardo, Safran, SAS Scandinavian Airlines and Wider\u00f8e attended a meeting led by the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to initiate the work of the Task Force on Zero Emissions Aviation.\u00a0 Minister of Transport of Norway Knut Arild Hareide, joined for the opening session. \u201cIt is in the transport sector that we will contribute the most to emissions reductions. The world is confronted with a climate crisis, and since I took office a few weeks ago, I have been very clear that this is my main mission as Transport Minister. We will have to deliver.\u00a0 We hope that the constant focus on zero emissions technologies will contribute to emissions reductions,\u201d said the Minister of Transport. Early implementation in Norway \tBuilding on experience in other transport sectors and addressing the expectations of its citizens, Norway is taking steps toward the early implementation of emissions-free air transport in its regional market. The geography of Norway means that its many fjords and mountains hinder ground transport \u2013 making air transport an essential component of its overall infrastructure.\u00a0 European collaboration \tFor EASA as European regulator, the programme is aligned with its twin mandate to reduce the environmental impact of aviation while ensuring air travel is safe.\u00a0 \u201cEASA plays a leading role in actively developing and implementing measures to address environmental challenges. This collaborative effort with CAA Norway and leading representatives from industry provides a strong basis for concrete and effective action to enable innovation and reduce aviation emissions,\u201d said Patrick Ky, Executive Director of EASA. For Norway, the establishment of the Task Force brings a valuable international dimension to their regional ambition. The engagement of new and established aviation players to consider the environmental, economic, technological, and institutional challenges ensures a comprehensive approach. \u201cThere is significant commitment to this initiative. We believe collaboration is key to succeed in finding new solutions and reducing emissions. Norway is well-positioned to become an arena for innovation in the field because of our well-developed network of regional airports, our access to clean and renewable energy, and of course a dedicated aviation industry and proactive authorities\u201d, said Lars Kobberstad, Director General of CAA Norway. Actionable recommendations \u2013 summer 2020 \tIn its kick-off meeting, the Task Force agreed to draw up a report and roadmap of actionable recommendations to support the Norwegian ambition, which will be presented to the Norwegian government in summer 2020. This will include short-term actions that could be implemented by 2025 or so as well as longer-term actions stretching to 2030 or beyond. In parallel, the Task Force will work towards solutions that can contribute to the wider European efforts for sustainable aviation. Particular consideration will be given to potential measures and incentives to promote the transition towards emissions-free aircraft.

Societal concerns was a recurring theme in speeches and panel discussions during the two day conference held in Amsterdam. Manufacturers, politicians, societal experts and regulators alike found a common interest in resolution of these concerns, as they would otherwise present a considerable barrier to the successful introduction of drone services.\u00a0 \u201cWe have had feedback from other countries around the world where there are regular drone operations that the concern of the population is not that much about privacy, is not that much about safety, but it\u2019s very, very much about noise, EASA Executive Director Patrick Ky said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that, as we put together the regulatory framework for drones operations in urban or populated areas, we set the right societal targets in terms of safety, risk exposure and environmental impact.\u201d EASA is working at an unprecedented pace to issue rules and guidelines on drone activities to meet the demands from industry for the basic rules for drone operations. Requirements for mandatory registration of all drones will already pass into law in mid-2020.\u00a0 Joachim Luecking, Head of Unit Aviation Safety in the Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport of the European Commission, noted that societal concerns had been factored into the drones regulatory framework from the outset.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe issue of societal concerns was very much at the heart of the development of this regulatory framework that we undertook together with EASA. In that sense it is quite special for an aviation safety legislation because it goes really beyond safety,\u201d Luecking said. \u201cIt tries to give answers to the questions (as to) how to deal with issues in relation to security, privacy, and data protection and also on noise and emissions.\u201d A further recommendation to the EU legislator, known as an \u201cOpinion\u201d is due for publication by EASA late in the first quarter of 2020. This will focus on urban airspace, known as \u201cU-space\u201d, the label used by European Union to refer to unmanned traffic management. It will lay down the principles that will allow multiple types of drone traffic to interact safely within an urban airspace, taking account also of other airborne and ground traffic, and people, in the same location. At the conference, EASA\u2019s Drone Programme Manager, Maria Algar Ruiz gave some insight into the main principles of the regulator\u2019s recommendations in this areas. Initially, the Opinion would focus on specific areas and would then expand as the market developed, she said. For example, the regulation would initially target densely-populated urban areas or locations close to an airport and would not attempt to cover the entire airspace.\u00a0 \u201cWe are not aiming to address traffic predictions that we are having from industry for 2035. The regulation is for tomorrow,\u201d Algar Ruiz said. \u201cWe are thinking that this regulation shall be implemented by the end of next year or the beginning of the next. Therefore it is the first step. It is based on what we consider to be mature services and solutions. The assumption is that U-space/airspace at the beginning will not be everywhere. This is a very important point to clarify.\u201d Closing the conference, EASA\u2019s Executive Director Ky stressed the importance of all parts of the aviation industry working together to pave the way for a successful usage of drones, adding that once the societal concerns had been addressed, there were many advantages for society from efficient drone usage. \u201cThe conference this year I hope has shown that we are really working in partnership between institutions, Member States, Eurocontrol, Sesar Joint Undertaking and the industry and that it\u2019s only through working together that we can meet the very short time scales we have achieved so far,\u201d Ky said.\u00a0 \u201cWe have also seen, that there is still a lot of work that needs to be done and on which this partnership will need to be maintained. And I can assure you that we in EASA are committed to continue to work together with you to complete all the relevant work to make the drones a big success for society.\u201d\u00a0 The conference was held in Amsterdam, Netherlands on December 5 and 6, 2019.\u00a0 Follow this link to view the videos of the full conference.\u00a0\u00a0 ", "easa_category": "Drones", "url": "https://www.easa.europa.eu/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/regulators-and-industry-unite-need-address-societal-concerns"}, {"id": "EASA_PR_0004", "date": "2019-11-21", "title": "ICAO, European Union and South East Asia join forces to achieve the Beijing Ministerial Declaration commitments for aviation safety ", "text": " Ha Long, Viet Nam, 21 November 2019: In their second such event since 2018, ICAO and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) brought together South East Asian aviation officials this week to discuss new ways to improve local cooperation and strengthen regional safety performance. The jointly-hosted ICAO-EASA Forum on Civil Aviation in South East Asia explored key objectives of the recently approved Asia-Pacific Regional Aviation Safety Plan (AP-RASP), and took stock of the regional initiatives underway supporting the implementation of the Beijing Declaration which was adopted at last year\u2019s Asia and Pacific Ministerial Conference.\u00a0 The 2019 event\u2019s way forward conclusions noted the volume of safety data produced in the aviation sector and encouraged stakeholders to process and share data to enhance aviation safety through a data driven approach; endorsed the benefits of closer cooperation between States, ICAO and with Regional Safety Oversight Organisations, like EASA and other related agencies, to continue to improve aviation safety for the travelling public; and recognised the ICAO-EASA Forum as a key platform to facilitate the dialogue between national aviation authorities and stakeholders. As a final conclusion, it was agreed to promote a 3rd ICAO-EASA Forum with an agenda focused on discussing the main safety topics in more detail. \u201cAviation safety and security is a collective responsibility, and it\u2019s for this reason that ICAO promotes new and strengthened partnerships in aid of both regional and global objectives,\u201d commented Arun Mishra, ICAO Regional Office Director for the Asia and Pacific (APAC). \u201cEASA\u2019s collaboration with ICAO is well-recognised and very much appreciated in this regard.\u201d Mishra also underscored the slow progress being seen in some States with respect to the goals and targets of the ICAO Global Aviation Safety Plan and Regional APAC Air Navigation Plans, and that concerted effort was needed to improve Regional ICAO compliance and optimize the socio-economic impacts of both local and global air connectivity. Luc Tytgat, Strategy and Safety Management Director of EASA, reflected on the European experience and highlighted \u201cthe need to establish sound partnerships with global and regional actors to ensure the effective and efficient implementation of safety actions\u201d. He also stressed EASA\u2019s commitment to advancing aviation safety and partnership with South East Asia in light of the more diverse air traffic and capacity challenges now forecast, stressing the need for enhanced safety standards to be developed. In January 2018, governments of the Asia Pacific region met in Beijing, China to endorse a declaration formalising their shared commitment to high-priority objectives in the areas of aviation safety and air navigation services efficiency. They agreed to pursue cooperative progress on objectives related to aviation safety oversight, State Safety Programme (SSP) implementation, international aerodrome certification, the timely implementation of the Asia/Pacific Seamless Air Traffic Management Plan, sharing of information and best practices for air navigation, independence in accident investigation and human resources development.\u00a0 Aviation Cooperation Programmes in South East Asia About ICAO The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is a UN specialized agency, established by States in 1944 to manage the administration and governance of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention). ICAO works with its 193 Member States and industry groups to reach consensus on international civil aviation Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) and policies in support of a safe, efficient, secure, economically sustainable and environmentally responsible civil aviation sector. These SARPs and policies are used by ICAO Member States to ensure that their local civil aviation operations and regulations conform to global norms, which in turn permits more than 100,000 daily flights in aviation\u2019s global air transport network to operate safely and reliably in every region of the world.\u00a0 ICAO facilitates the COSCAP-SEA programme, which supports the South East Asian aviation authorities with advisory and training assistance in civil aviation, mainly focused on achieving a high level of aviation safety and raising the Effective Implementation of ICAO SARPs.\u00a0 (https://www.icao.int/APAC) About European Union Aviation Safety Agency - EASA\u00a0 \tThe European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is the centerpiece of the European Union's strategy for aviation safety.

While safety is widely established as the top priority for the aviation industry, commercial pressures can present a challenge to that focus. Compromises on safety however run the risk of losing the confidence of the general public, said Pekka Henttu, Director General of Civil Aviation at the Finnish aviation agency Traficom, co-host of the two-day event: \u201cAirline operational safety: a vision for the future\u201d. \u201cCommercial pressures. For the first time actually in this conference we have discussed this and they are a fact. We have to admit that they are present,\u201d Henttu said. \u201cAviation has to find a good balance between safety, security, environmental sustainability and the business side.\u201d Speakers warned repeatedly that strong growth in the aviation industry in coming years meant that more had to be done if the safety record were to be maintained. The consequences of fatal accidents for public trust were very clear, as demonstrated following the tragic accidents sustained by the Boeing 737 MAX. Topi Manner, CEO of Finnair said: \u201cAviation is a growth industry. If aircraft and flight numbers double in the next decade, maintaining the current fatal accident rate would mean significant absolute increase in fatalities.\u00a0 That is not acceptable. We must continue to improve safety.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPeople want to fly at competitive prices and they want to fly safely,\u201d said Joachim Luecking, Head of Unit Aviation Safety in the Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport of the European Commission. Environmental issues were also extremely important, Luecking added: \u201cThe aviation industry should not underestimate the pressure coming from that side.\u201d EASA\u2019s Executive Director Patrick Ky pointed to technological development as a way to increase future safety, citing various old technologies still in use in aviation, for example the continued use of radio frequencies for communication with air traffic controllers. \u201cThe future is certainly that we as a community need to decide to invest into technologies which increase the level of safety,\u201d he said. This could include using automation to cover non-critical operations to allow a pilot or other crew members to focus on more critical tasks. A wide-ranging discussion on digitalisation addressed the pros and cons of autonomy \u2013 aircraft flying without a pilot \u2013 with the conclusion that this was a long way away for commercial flights, though probably much more immediate for urban air taxis. It also tackled the need for data sharing, as widely as possible, so as to allow for a predictive and preventive approach to safety and progress on environmental protection. Artificial intelligence would be required to process that information which could lead, for example, to reductions in CO2 emissions through better fuel planning. Taking advantage of the conference\u2019s location in one of the EU\u2019s northernmost capitals, a discussion of winter operations focused on the importance of preparedness, including staff training. Climate change was making winter conditions less predictable. The need for development of more environmentally friendly, but effective, de-icing methods was also raised Aircraft leasing is a growth area in the industry with different scenarios and business models related to seasonality or shortages of aircraft. It was generally agreed that leasing did not in itself create any compromise on safety, but that the regulatory system may need to better evolve to support increased leasing transactions. Finally, the case for reinforcing the safety management function within an airline was discussed. Support from the top of any organisation was seen as a key component in establishing and maintaining a safety culture. A multi-disciplinary top management team with operational experience and engineering knowledge, trained safety managers at a senior level in the organisation as well as open exchange with operational staff were key assets. Effective risk management relied on organisations regularly examining their risk tolerance and monitoring their conformance to it.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The conference took place in Helsinki on Monday November 4 and Tuesday November 5.

In order to bring clarity to what we have responded by email to their written questions, and not as advertised in an interview, we are publishing our responses below. \t\u00a0 \t\u201cAn aircraft is certified based on the demonstration that its design complies with all relevant airworthiness requirements and all features are safe. Our airworthiness requirements are not prescriptive. Depending on the technology and system architecture used, aeroplanes can meet the safety objectives differently. Therefore, we would not compare aircrafts to each other, rather assess how they comply with the requirements.\u201d \t\u00a0 \t\u201cAircraft longitudinal stability is subject to airworthiness requirements. Boeing has to demonstrate compliance of the 737 MAX airframe with these requirements. Consequences of failures of systems affecting potentially the aircraft stability need to be assessed using acceptable safety analysis methodology also subject to airworthiness requirements. Pilot training requirements are not meant to compensate for non-acceptable design on the compliance and safety standpoint.\u201d \t\u00a0 \t\u201cSome investigations are ongoing on the certification process followed by the FAA in the case of the B737 MAX.

It is not unusual that, depending on the differences between two models, flight crews are trained on a flight simulator not specific to the model (in this case it would be a B737 NG flight simulator) and then a computer-based difference training is provided in addition. This has been shown to be acceptable and effective in a number of cases.

Patrick Ky, EASA Executive Director declared \u201cWe are actively engaging with the industry to develop the right technical requirements to take benefit of the new technologies bringing safety and environmental benefits to the community. The establishment of a common set of conditions for the certification of these new concepts of vehicles will enable a fair competition on the European market as well as clarity for future manufacturers and their investors.\u201d The final Special Condition published today provides the framework for manufacturers to develop innovative VTOL aircraft. It applies to person-carrying VTOL heavier-than-air aircraft in the small category, with lift/thrust units used to generate powered lift and control. The small category covers aircraft with a passenger seating configuration of 9 or less and a maximum certified take-off mass up to 3175 kg. The Special Condition was opened for public consultation in October 2018 and widely consulted with stakeholders worldwide. The certification objectives are made dependent on the type of operation in order to provide flexibility and proportionally and also to give a clear visibility to the industry of the objectives for their designs.\u00a0 Two certification categories are introduced in this special condition namely Basic and Enhanced and are linked to the intended type of operations. A direct relationship between airworthiness and types of operations already exist, for example when certifying for VFR or IFR operations. Introducing this additional link provides greater scalability in setting safety objectives and allows to assign the highest safety levels of Category Enhanced to protection of third-parties when flying over congested areas and commercial air transport of passengers. The operational rules can then be built on demonstrated aircraft safety levels and adapted as necessary to local particularities. The Agency engaged with its international partners in order to work together towards achieving common standards. The current regulatory framework has initially been designed for conventional fixed wing aircraft, rotorcraft, balloons and sailplanes. Propulsion was mostly provided by piston or turbine engines using fossil fuels. The introduction of new technologies and concepts of air transport requires to revisit this framework. The Agency is currently consulting with its Advisory Bodies on a new Rulemaking tasks (RMT.0731) to develop rules or amend existing ones, to address new technologies and operational air transport concepts, with the objective to be agile and to adapt the regulatory framework in line with Performance Based Regulations principles.

The rules will amongst others help to protect the safety and the privacy of EU citizens while enabling the free circulation of drones and a level playing field within the European Union. \u201cEurope will be the first region in the world to have a comprehensive set of rules ensuring safe, secure and sustainable operations of drones both, for commercial and leisure activities. Common rules will help foster investment, innovation and growth in this promising sector\u201d said Patrick Ky, Executive Director of EASA. The common rules will help drone operators, whether professional or recreational, to have a clear understanding of what is allowed or not. At the same time it enables them to operate across borders. Once drone operators have received an authorisation in the state of registration, they are allowed to freely circulate in the European Union. This means that they can operate their drones seamlessly when travelling across the EU or when developing a business involving drones around Europe. The new rules include technical as well as operational requirements for drones. On one hand they define the capabilities a drone must have to be flown safely. For instance, new drones will have to be individually identifiable, allowing the authorities to trace a particular drone if necessary. This will help to better prevent events similar to the ones which happened in 2018 at Gatwick and Heathrow airports. On the other hand the rules cover each operation type, from those not requiring prior authorisation, to those involving certified aircraft and operators, as well as minimum remote pilot training requirements. The new rules will replace existing national rules in EU Member States. While the EU regulation will enter into force in the next 20 days, it will be applicable only in one year, to give Member States and operators time to prepare and implement it. \u00a0As of June 2020 operators of drones will need to register in the Member State where they have their residence or their main place of business.\u00a0 The applicability will be gradual according to a timeline that can be consulted on the EASA drone page. What\u2019s next? EASA will soon publish guidance material and a proposal for two \"standard scenarios\" to support drone operators to comply with the adopted rules.

This drastically simplified airworthiness system will be developed in cooperation with our stakeholders.\u00a0 EASA GA Safety Award launched As part of its on-going commitment to General Aviation, EASA will launch the EASA GA Safety Award \u2013 a contest for awarding the most safety-beneficial smartphone/tablet application for use by GA pilots. The GA Safety Award aims to promote development of reliable tools to improve safety, encourage investment in this area, support and enhance visibility of valuable products, and further enhance the GA community\u2019s engagement to safety.\u00a0 New Approach to Safety Promotion \u2013 GA Safety Together! EASA will further seek to improve Safety Promotion for GA - Safety Together! \u2013 by using interesting and innovative communication methods. Since last year\u2019s AERO, EASA\u2019s GA Community site could establish itself as a platform for discussions on safety-related and regulatory matters, while EASA\u2019s fully in-house produced multi-language Sunny Swift cartoons have already been issued 11 times with a variety of stories promoting safety. Good Safety Promotion depends on collaboration and useful information from everybody involved. Therefore, EASA and AOPA showcase their Safety Promotion efforts at AERO and discuss how the whole General Aviation Community can get involved in Safety Together!\u00a0 EASA certifies Tecnam P2012 Certification Director Rachel Daeschler also handed over the EASA Type Certificate for Tecnam\u2019s new model, the P2012 which expands Tecnam\u2019s aeroplane portfolio now up to a 9 passenger, twin engine aeroplane with IFR and FIKI (Flight into known icing) capabilities and the intended use for commercial air transport. EASA also issued a STC (Supplementary Type Certificate) to Garmin for their GFC500 autopilot system. Throughout the fair, EASA\u2019s GA team is ready to explain the novelties and alleviations in the different areas of GA Licensing, Operations, Maintenance and Initial Airworthiness, as well as give support in case of questions and discuss in a transparent and informal manner at our EASA stand in Hall A5-300 and at our various ongoing events.

This conference prepares the way for a European groundhandling roadmap and supports EASA in developing a European approach to ensure safety in groundhandling. Amongst others, the aim was to collect feedback from stakeholders on the draft GH Roadmap published prior to the conference and discussed with the audience. At the same time, the purpose of the conference was to raise public awareness on this new domain that has entered under EASA\u2019s remit. With the extension of scope of the new Basic Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, groundhandling activities will complete the European aviation safety map.\u00a0 Opening the EASA GH Conference, Massimo Mazzoletti, Head of Strategy and Programmes Department of EASA, pointed out the extended scope of EASA as established by the New Basic Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 and clarified the legislator\u2019s intention to put groundhandling on the European aviation safety map. He also highlighted that the GH roadmap was drafted by industry experts for the industry. The conference was organised around six main areas of improvement in the groundhandling domain, namely:\u00a0 Management System Operational standards Ground Support Equipment Training\u00a0 Staff turnover Oversight These key areas had been identified in the first phase of the GH project with the help of more than 45 interviews that EASA did with various stakeholders.\u00a0 The different panel workshops provided valuable insights and helped the GH Roadmap to evolve into a consistent document, indicating EASA\u2019s next steps in implementing its new mandate for groundhandling. The conference ended with the wrap-up session where Jean-Marc Cluzeau, Principal Advisor to the EASA Executive Director, reiterated a few main points of the GH roadmap resulting from the conference presentations and discussions. Looking into the future, EASA will initiate a rulemaking task and a safety promotion task to develop the necessary requirements and non-regulatory activities with the aim of increasing the safety level in the groundhandling domain. Close cooperation is envisaged with GH industry and national aviation authorities.

Results of the initial phase of this large European-wide scientific study in the field of Flight Time Limitation (FTL), highlight that prescriptive limits alone are not sufficient to prevent high fatigue during night flights. Further research is recommended alongside other actions to support air operators with their responsibility to tailor more effective fatigue risk management strategies for night duties. The initial phase assessed the impact of \u2018night duties longer than 10 hours\u2019 and \u2018disruptive schedules\u2019 on the alertness of aircrews. Research found an increased probability of high fatigue levels, especially during nights and duty periods with late finishes, among both pilots and cabin crew. The strongest predictors of high fatigue in these periods, compared with daytime duties, varied by type of flight duty. For early starts, the only significant predictor was the earlier start time itself. For nights, the pertinent predictors were encroachment on the window of circadian low (WOCL, typically the period between 2 am and 5.59 am in the time zone to which a crew member is acclimatised) and short prior sleep. Based on the conclusions drawn from the outcomes of the analyses, six recommendations were made regarding further fatigue mitigation measures.

This assessment, which comprises a large scope of tasks, was split into several phases with the first phase focusing on the two duty periods that had the highest expected level of aircrew fatigue. These were duties of more than 10 hours at the less favourable time of the day and disruptive schedules.

The report provides an assessment of the historic and forecasted environmental performance of the European aviation sector, along with the latest information on various mitigation measures to reduce the environmental impact of aviation.\u00a0 The report states that overall environmental impacts from aviation have increased by 10% for CO2, 12% for NOX and 14% for noise since 2014. Looking ahead, in the most likely traffic forecast, existing environmental impact mitigation measures are unlikely to counteract the increasing environmental impacts as the number of flights in Europe are expected to grow by 42% from 2017 to 2040. In that same timeframe, aircraft CO2 emissions are predicted to increase by 21% and NOX emissions by 16%. The number of airports that handle more than 50,000 annual aircraft movements is expected to increase from 82 in 2017 to 110 in 2040 and aviation noise may therefore affect new populations in the future. The aviation sector must act \u2013 EASA to take on a leading role EASA Executive Director Patrick Ky underlined that \u201cwe need concrete and effective action to reduce aviation emissions over the next 10 years in order to support the Paris Agreement objectives and mitigate climate change. The aviation sector must play its part in this global effort. Addressing noise and air quality issues at a local level are also critical. Since EASA\u2019s rules and our competencies with regard to environment have been further strengthened by the European Union, EASA now plays a leading role in actively developing and implementing measures to address these challenges in cooperation with our partners.\u201d Commissioner Bulc pointed out that \"as Europeans we must continue to pioneer the battle against climate change. This new report shows that our joint actions are working: we have reduced fuel burn and noise per flight; investments have delivered more efficient technologies; airports are becoming carbon neutral, and finally we are starting to implement the first-ever global scheme to offset CO2 emissions!\" EASA\u2019s new regulation enables the Agency to play a greater role on environment and work together in developing solutions in partnership with stakeholders (e.g. EU institutions, States, Industry, NGOs). As well as the publication of the European Aviation Environmental Report that contains an objective, accurate overview of the environmental performance of the aviation sector, the Agency\u2019s extended environmental remit now includes, amongst other things: maintaining state-of-the-art environmental standards; certifying aircraft and engines against environmental standards; environmental modelling; research on new emerging topics (e.g. sustainable aviation fuels, electric and hybrid engines, drones, supersonics); promotion of improved environmental performance and international cooperation projects on environmental protection.\u00a0 The European Aviation Environmental Report 2019 is available on the EASA website.

This regulation entered into force on 11 September 2018. It enables the Agency to prepare rules for all sizes of civil drones and harmonise standards for the commercial market across Europe.\u00a0 Already in February this year EASA issued a proposal for a new regulation and published Opinion 01/2018 (\u2018Unmanned aircraft system (UAS) operations in the \u2018open\u2019 and \u2018specific\u2019 categories\u2019) on safe operations for drones in Europe to keep drone operations safe and secure and build a wider regulatory framework. The proposal is serving as a basis for the European Commission to adopt an EU regulation in 2019 which will cover the categories open, specific and the certified category. This first EU-wide regulation for civil drones will be based on an innovative way of regulating, keeping rules as simple as possible with a strong focus on particular operational risks and taking into account that flying a drone over a city centre has a very different level of risk compared to the operation of a drone over the sea (the so-called Operation centric concept) International experts from across the drone community have worked together on this new regulatory framework for the safe operation of drones across European airspace, thus bringing legal certainty and clarity for this rapidly expanding industry. Patrick Ky, Executive Director: \u201cThis regulation will enable the free circulation of drones and a level playing field within the European Union, while also respecting the privacy and security of EU citizens, and allowing the drone industry to remain agile, to innovate and continue to grow\u201d.

Challenges and opportunities were discussed at the first ICAO-EASA forum on Civil Aviation in South East Asia.\u00a0 For the first time, the UN International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) joined forces to bring together South East Asian aviation stakeholders and discuss the future of air transport in the South East Asian region. Patrick Ky, Executive Director of EASA, said \u201cDevelopment of the Seamless ASEAN Sky together with the ASEAN Single Aviation Market is a must. It will soon become irrelevant how many passengers the airlines carry, aircraft are bought or freedoms of the air are agreed \u2013 if the air traffic management system cannot handle the demand, the only thing that is created is delays.\u201d \u201cBesides the forecast growth here, many South East Asia governments will be confronted by a rapidly evolving sectoral environment in terms of technologies, operations, and business models,\u201d commented ICAO Secretary General Dr. Fang Liu. \u201cBut as operations here continue to grow, and States continue to prosper from that growth, it is imperative that we continue to work continuously and cooperatively toward our shared objectives.\u201d Right to left: H.E. Ministry Arkhom Termpittayapaisith, Minister of Transport, Thailand; Dr Fang Liu, Secretary General, ICAO; Steve Creamer, Director of Air Navigation Bureau, ICAO; Arun Mishra, Regional Director, ICAO; Patrick Ky, Executive Director, EASA; Paolo Zingale, Head of FPI, EU delegation to Thailand. Travel to, from, and within South East Asia is projected to grow at an average 6.6% annually over the next 20 years as passenger demand is stimulated by low cost carriers with expanding routes. The civil aviation authorities of South East Asia are facing increased air traffic despite continued major infrastructure limitations, leading to enhanced requirements for safety and the need to oversee and efficiently operate aviation facilities and services. The ASEAN Single Aviation Market and Seamless ASEAN Sky therefore bring both opportunities and challenges \u2013 for example the region\u2019s airports and air traffic management (ATM) systems need to cope with the ensuing traffic growth. Since regional cooperation is essential, both ICAO and EASA implement a number of aviation safety programmes, allowing for the integration and harmonisation of rules and standards in safety, air traffic management, and climate change reduction from airline emissions.\u00a0 The forum also discussed climate change, which has prompted ICAO to advance environmental standards for civil aviation without disrupting traffic growth, and the advanced digitalisation of aviation data to raise efficiency and safety whilst also enhancing commercial value. Other critical issues were also debated, such as cybercrime which is also extending to civil aviation and threatens to disrupt communications, and other critical elements of airlines and ATM. Data mining and analysis, shared cyber-security, and other counter measures to cyber threats are however building resilience to this. The forum concluded with a wide range of recommendations for further development of the ASEAN Single Aviation Market, Seamless ASEAN Sky and other thematic challenges in civil aviation. These recommendations can then be considered by the South East Asian states, their partners and the aviation cooperation programmes in the region. Aviation Cooperation Programmes in South East Asia \tAbout ICAO \tICAO implements the COSCAP-SEA programme, which supports the South East Asian authorities with advisory and training assistance in civil aviation, mainly focused on achieving a high level of aviation safety and raising the Effective Implementation of ICAO SARPs (https://www.icao.int/APAC).\u00a0 About EASA \tEASA implements the ARISE Plus Civil Aviation project, which supports ASEAN integration in line with the ASEAN ATM Master Plan (http://www.ariseplusaviation.org/). EASA also implements the EU-South East Asia Aviation Partnership Project, which enhances cooperation with major regional stakeholders in safety, ATM and climate change action\u00a0(https://www.eu-sea-app.org/). About the European Union \tThe European Union as a global actor works to improve the lives of people in Europe and worldwide. The EU and ASEAN have a long-standing partnership. Through the exchanges of best practises and know-how, the EU is committed to support ASEAN's rapid growth and development.

The Agency\u2019s thoughts remain with the families and friends of the victims of this tragic accident. EASA acknowledges the significant work of the AIBN to carry out an extensive investigation into the accident of LN-OJF. While the final report contains a number of opinions and hypotheses, in relation to the actions taken after the G-REDL accident and Return To Service (RTS), it is important to consider these in relation to what was known at the time. \u00a0 Actions after the accident of G-REDL The investigation on the G-REDL accident did not establish the root cause of the gear fatigue failure because several parts were not recovered. However, there was evidence of spalling occurring before the accident, including the detection of a gear particle by the maintenance organisation. This led to the decisions allowing increased detection of particles by recurrent maintenance. The decisions taken by EASA after the G-REDL accident were based on the knowledge available at the time, and the actions put in place were justified and commonly agreed. The AIBN report now identifies micro pitting as initiating the crack that, with limited spalling, led to the gear failure in the case of LN-OJF.\u00a0 This had not been identified with respect to the G-REDL accident investigation or analysis. \u00a0 Actions after the accident to LN-OJF and the Return to Service The RTS consisted of a number of mandatory airworthiness actions meeting the safety objectives as defined in Annex 1 (Part 21) of Commission Regulation (EU) No 748/2012. \tThe RTS was a first step in a sequence of actions that were foreseen in the associated Continuing\u00a0Airworthiness Review Item (CARI) having the objective to consolidate and develop further safety improvements for the mid- and longer term. This means that the initial actions which were suitable in the short to medium term would be replaced by less maintenance intensive solutions. \tFrom the AIBN report, EASA understands that the investigation did not reveal any facts or evidence available at the time that would invalidate the basis for the RTS. \u00a0 Finally, EASA notes that the design, certification and continued airworthiness aspects of the Main Gear Box have been the main focus of this investigation. While EASA concurs with the AIBN\u2019s final report regarding the most likely fracture mechanism, all the possible contributing factors to the failure initiation should still be considered relevant, even if the likelihood is considered remote or circumstantial by the AIBN. EASA will continue to take actions to address all such possible risks where considered necessary. Safety is EASA\u2019s mission and utmost priority.

This formal Opinion is an important stepping-stone to keep drone operations safe and secure and build a wider regulatory framework. The Opinion will serve as a basis for the European Commission to adopt concrete regulatory proposals later in the year.\u00a0A first meeting chaired by the European Commission to discuss this Opinion with the EU Member States already took place on 21 February 2018. Patrick Ky, EASA Executive Director said: \u201cthis regulation will enable the free circulation of drones and a level playing field within the European Union, while also respecting the privacy and security of EU citizens, and allowing the drone industry to remain agile, to innovate and continue to grow\u201d. The EASA Opinion comes up with an innovative way of regulating, where the rules are kept as simple as possible with a strong focus on the particular risk of the operation: flying the same drone over a city center or over the sea entails a completely different risk. The Opinion also breaks new ground by combining product legislation and aviation legislation: design requirements for small drones (up to 25kg) will be implemented by using the well-known CE (\u201cConformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne\u201d) marking for products brought on the market in Europe. The operator will find in each drone package a consumer information with the \u201cdo\u2019s and don\u2019ts\u201d on how to fly a drone without endangering other people. Background: The proposed approach is innovative and globally recognized as the best way forward to keep drone operations safe. The requirements do not focus on the drone itself, but consider a range of elements such as where the drone is flown (over the sea or over a city centre), who is flying the drone (a child or a professional pilot) or what drone is actually being used (how heavy is the drone or what safety features it does have). The \u2018open\u2019 category of operations\u2019 does not require a prior authorisation by the competent authority, nor a declaration by the operator, before the operation takes place. Safety is ensured through a combination of operational limitations, technical requirements for the machine and the competency of the remote pilot. Examples of operations that fall into this category are filming and taking photographs, infrastructure inspections, and leisure activities in which the remote pilot keeps the unmanned aircraft in sight at all times. The \u2018specific\u2019 category of operations requires an authorisation by the competent authority before the operation takes place. Here, safe operations are guaranteed through a system in which the drone operator is required to carry out an operational risk assessment and put in place the resulting mitigation measures to obtain an authorisation to fly the drone. Examples of this category are flights where the operator can no longer see the drone (so-called beyond visual line of sight or BVLOS), flying over populated areas and operations with heavier drones. The Opinion allows a high degree of flexibility for the EASA Member States. They will be able to define zones where drone operations will be either prohibited or restricted (for example, to protect sensitive areas), or where certain requirements are alleviated (for example, areas dedicated to model aircraft). EASA will develop standard scenarios that will make it simpler to obtain authorisations for well\u2011defined operations (such as, for example, linear inspections conducted in BVLOS, or crop spraying). The proposal also recognises the good safety records of model flying clubs and associations and it provides special alleviations for members of those clubs and associations. This Opinion follows a preceding consultation document (Notice of Proposed Amendment - published by EASA in May 2017), and it takes into account thousands of comments received from private citizens, industry, operators and national authorities during the four-month public consultation period.

All interested parties are welcome to comment this proposal from 12 May until 12 August 2017. The proposal provides a framework to safely operate drones while allowing this industry to remain agile, to innovate and continue to grow. The risk posed to people on the ground and to other aircraft as well as privacy, security and data protection issues created by such drones are also taken into account. The proposed regulation defines the technical and operational requirements for the drones. Technical requirements refer for example to the remote identification of drones.\u00a0 Operational requirements refer among others to geofencing, a system that ensures drones do not enter a prohibited zone. The proposal also addresses the pilots\u2019 qualifications. Furthermore, drone operators will have to register themselves, except when they operate drones lighter than 250g. This proposal is breaking new grounds by combining product legislation and aviation legislation; design requirements for small drones will be implemented by using the legislation relative to making products available on the market, the well-known CE (\u201cConformit\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne\u201d) marking. The standard CE marking will be accompanied by the identification of the class of the drone (from C0 to C4) and by a do\u2019s and don\u2019ts leaflet that will be found in all drone boxes. Based on the drone class, an operator will know in which area he can operate and what competence is required (see Flying a Drone - do\u2019s and don\u2019ts). The proposal allows a high degree of flexibility for EASA Member States; they will be able to define zones in their territory where either drones operations are prohibited or restricted (for example to protect sensitive areas), or where certain requirements are alleviated. For operations that pose higher risks, an operational risk assessment will define the requirements that the operator needs to comply before flying the drone. The proposal also provides special alleviations for people flying model aircraft - which are also drones \u2013 to recognise the good safety records in aero modelling. Published in a document called a Notice of Proposed Amendment (NPA), the proposal has been developed with the support of a large group of experts: representatives of the EASA Member States, the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) industry, UAS operators, aviation representatives and aero modelling associations.

Modern aircraft have very precise guidance systems for landing / take-off and taxiing; this means that the current international and European provisions for designing runway, taxiway and other areas can be lightened without compromising safety. The new proposal is meant to take this technological evolution into account. The public consultation on this so called Notice of Proposed Amendment (NPA) ends 31 May 2017. EASA will review the comments received and prepare during the summer its decision for a regulatory change of certification specifications for aerodromes design. With the proposed new CS, airports will be able to accept large aeroplanes within the existing infrastructure and thus increasing capacity, in particular at congested aerodromes. The proposed modification of the aerodrome CS will also generate significant cost savings for the aerodrome infrastructure: construction and maintenance costs of runways, runway shoulders, and taxiways will be reduced due to the proposed provisions. The airlines would also benefit from the proposed provisions, since they would be able to operate large aeroplanes from more aerodromes and to better plan their network. Apart from the economic gain, the proposed provisions will have positive environmental benefits due to more efficient use of available land and reduced consumption of construction materials for infrastructure. As from 2015 EASA, launched an initiative at EU level with the objective to find swifter solutions for the accommodation of large aircraft at existing aerodromes. From the very beginning the activity gathered experts from National Aviation Authorities (NAA), ACI Europe, aerodrome operators and manufacturing industry. Similar to the EASA initiative, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) established the Task Force at global level with the purpose to revise its Standards and Recommended Practices for aerodrome physical characteristics. The outcome of the work and proposed changes were presented to the relevant ICAO and EASA bodies with the wide agreement to be incorporated in ICAO and EASA provisions. With the strong support from ACI Europe, the material was incorporated into the EASA NPA. EASA will synchronise its NPA public consultation process with the ICAO consultation also expected in spring 2017, which will provide a better overview of the proposed developments to ICAO Member States.

These principles should be taken into account by the airlines when they perform their safety risk assessment. PEDs containing lithium batteries are considered as dangerous goods. When carried by passengers, they should preferably be carried in the passenger cabin. This would enable the crew to react quickly in case an incident involving such PED occurs. When the carriage of PEDs in the cabin is not allowed, it leads to a significant increase of the number of PEDs in the cargo compartment. Certain precautions should therefore be observed to mitigate the risk of accidental fire in the cargo hold. In particular, PEDs placed in checked baggage must be completely switched off and well protected from accidental activation. \u201cPassengers and crews safety is our highest priority.

Study 1: Cabin air quality (CAQ) measurement campaign - study conducted by a consortium of the Fraunhofer Institute for Toxicology and Experimental Medicine and the Hannover Medical School. In-flight measurements have been conducted on a number of commercial flights after defining adequate and reliable air contaminants measurement methods for cockpit and passenger cabin areas. The results show that the cabin/cockpit air quality is similar or better than what is observed in normal indoor environments (offices, schools, kinder gardens or dwellings). No occupational exposure limits and guidelines were exceeded. In total, 69 measurement flights were performed between July 2015 and June 2016 on 8 types of aeroplane/engine configurations. This included 61 flights on aeroplanes equipped with engine bleed air systems, and 8 flights on Boeing 787 which is equipped with electrical compressors (\u2018bleed free\u2019 system). For all flights, measurement equipment was installed in the cockpit and in the cabin. Special attention was paid to organophosphates, in particular Tri Cresyl Phosphates (TCP) with the use of high sensitivity analysis techniques. Study 2: Characterisation of the toxicity of aviation turbine engine oils after pyrolysis - study conducted by a consortium of the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research and the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. This study characterised the chemical composition of some transport aeroplane turbine engine oils (including pyrolysis breakdown products), and the toxic effects of the chemical compounds that can be released in the cabin or cockpit air. It concluded that neuroactive products are present, but that their concentration in the presence of an intact lung barrier is too low to be a major concern for neuronal function. TCP was present in the analysed oils, however no ortho-isomers could be detected. Finally the analysis of the human sensitivity variability factor showed that the complete metabolic pathway and the contribution of inter individual variability in the metabolic enzymes is still largely unknown for the majority of industrial chemicals, including cabin air contaminants. Two brands of oil were used in this study, and both new and used oil samples were analysed.

The EASA Technical Opinion sets the direction to be followed for all future work to be done to ensure unmanned aircraft are operated safely and interact safely with other airspace users. The aim is to provide a framework that is proportionate to the activity, ensuring safety and at the same time enabling this innovative industry to continue to grow. The opinion also serves as guidance for the European Union Member States that have no rules for small unmanned aircraft or plan to modify their existing ones, to ensure consistency as much as possible with the intent of the future EU rules. It also provides a roadmap presenting the steps to be taken in the future. \u2018Unmanned aircraft and the technological innovations they bring, are changing quickly the landscape for aviation. The Agency proposals ensure safety remains a priority while allowing proportionality and flexibility for new innovations\u2018, said Patrick Ky, EASA Executive Director. The opinion includes 27 concrete proposals for a regulatory framework for operating all unmanned aircraft irrespective of their mass. The proposals focus more on how the drones will be used rather than their physical characteristics. The proposal establishes 3 categories of operation: \u2018Open\u2019, \u2018Specific\u2019 and \u2018Certified\u2019 with different safety requirements for each, proportionate to the risk. Most of the drone usage will belong to the \u2018Open\u2019 category which is foreseen for operations with limited safety risk, requiring a minimum amount of safety rules, overseen by law enforcement agencies. One of the key measures for this category will be limitation \u2018Zones\u2019, geographical areas in which use of drones will be limited or not allowed at all. To prevent unintended flight in restricted flight zones, a functionality automatically generating geographical limitations is also foreseen (i.e. geo-fencing). The more complex and risky the operation is, the more stringent the requirements will be. For example the requirements for \u2018Certified\u2019 operations are similar to those for manned aviation. The Technical Opinion follows the principles established by the European Commission in the Aviation Strategy published on 7 December 2015.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EASA will now work on the most appropriate set of tools - development of rules, guidance material or safety promotion \u2013 depending on what is more appropriate to each category in order to meet the overall objective to ensure safety while letting innovation develop.

Its in-service safety record will now be monitored by Airbus and EASA through continued airworthiness activities. Note to editors: The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is the centerpiece of the European Union's strategy for aviation safety. Our mission is to promote and achieve the highest common standards of safety and environmental protection in civil aviation. Based in Cologne, the Agency currently employs more than 650 experts and administrators from all over Europe. Every new type of airplane needs to obtain a type certificate before it can be delivered to an airline. This guarantees that the aircraft meets the regulatory safety requirements defined by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) for Europe. EASA is responsible for airworthiness and environmental certification since 2003. 1st Step \u2013 Certification Basis From the moment the aircraft manufacturer (Airbus or Boeing for instance) considers that its programme has reached a sufficient maturity, it presents its project to the certification organisations: EASA for Europe, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for the United States. This certification authority establishes the \u201cCertification Basis\u201d, meaning the regulatory requirements applicable for this type of airplane. 2nd Step \u2013 Establishing the Certification Programme The aircraft manufacturer must demonstrate that the product complies with the regulatory requirements: this includes the structure, the avionics, the electrical systems and also the performances in flight The manufacturer has 5 years after the Certification Basis is frozen to carry out this demonstration. In case of delay this deadline can be extended. 3rd Step \u2013 Execution of the Certification Programme The demonstration of this compliance is made through analysis and also during a series of ground tests (tests on the aircraft structure, bird strike resistance, fatigue\u2026), in simulators, and in-flight tests where the flight envelope and flight conditions are evaluated. This 3rd step is the longest phase of the programme. 5 airplanes have participated so far in the flight tests campaign for the A350 XWB. 4th Step \u2013 End of the process The compliance findings resulting from tests and analysis are detailed in more than 2000 documents. EASA verifies the findings throughout the certification programme based on a risk analysis. EASA will particularly focus on technological innovations introduced by the aircraft manufacturer in the development its new programme.

The new guidance allows airlines to permit PEDs to stay switched on, without the need to be in \u2018Airplane Mode\u2019. This is the latest regulatory step towards enabling the ability to offer \u2018gate-to-gate\u2019 telecommunication or WiFi services. PEDs include any kind of electronic device brought on board the aircraft by a passenger such as\u00a0smartphone,\u00a0tablet,\u00a0laptop,\u00a0e-reader, MP3 player,etc. It is up to each airline to decide to allow the use of PEDs. In order to do this, the airline will have to go through an assessment process, ensuring aircraft systems are not affected in any way by the transmission signals from the PEDs. For this reason, there may be differences among airlines whether and when PEDs can be used. Passengers must at all times follow the airline crew instructions.

More than 300 aviation specialists are gathered in Cologne, Germany to consider the future of oversight by regulatory authorities, when Safety Management Systems (SMS) will be fully implemented by organisations in all aviation domains including Airworthiness, Operations, Licensing, Aerodromes, and Air Navigation Services. The objective of Performance Based Oversight is to achieve the highest possible level of safety in the aviation system with a series of defined, organisation-wide processes that enable effective day-to-day risk-based decision-making. Experiences and initiatives by industry and regulators to develop different practical approaches for inspection, assessment and oversight will be presented and discussed at the conference. Opening the conference, Patrick Goudou, EASA Executive Director said: \"I am very pleased to see so many aviation specialists from all over the world at this conference. Effective safety management is the recognised way forward in performing safety oversight. However, this is a significant challenge for all of us in aviation, particularly due to the increasing complexity of the industry and the difficult financial times we are in. We therefore need to focus on safety performance in addition to complying with the relevant regulatory frameworks\". There are many benefits to be gained from a performance based approach: organisations can better understand the potential risks they face and be better informed about the implications of those risks in their daily activities. Similarly, authorities benefit from more effective targeting of their oversight, as well as improvements in efficiency and productivity.

On the second day of the exercise,\u00a0a\u00a0new harmonised European approach will be tested. This approach is in line with draft guidance material from ICAO \u2018Management of Flight Operations with Known or Forecast Volcanic Cloud Contamination\u2019 which has been developed since April 2010\u00a0 and\u00a0allows airlines to decide if they will fly in areas contaminated by ash, on the basis of a safety risk assessment accepted by the relevant national supervisory authority.

In this sense, the proposals intend to simplify and lessen the administrative burden faced by operators from third countries. EASA NPA 2011-05 harmonises and streamlines the authorisation process for third country operators by proposing a single, risk-based assessment process, proportionate to the operations and simple to implement. Applications would be submitted to EASA which would be responsible for issuing an authorisation valid across the territory of the EU and for ensuring that this authorisation remains continuously valid. This authorisation system would complement the existing system for vetting the safety performance of air carriers in the framework of the European Safety List. With the publication of this NPA, the proposal is the first step of a fully transparent public consultation process. All third country operators operating or intending to operate commercial air transport services into the European Union are invited to submit their comments to EASA .

To reach this objective, EHSAT, the EuropeanHelicopter Safety Analysis Team, was formed with the purpose of identifyingsafety issues and intervention recommendations. The report presents the resultsof 186 accidents where a final investigation report has been issued by the responsibleAccident Investigation Board. Of the accidentsanalysed so far, 72 involve General Aviation operations, 66 AerialWork, 40 Commercial Air Transport, and 8 State Flights. 68% of the fatalaccidents and 34% of all accidents analysed by EHSAT occurred during the enroute phase of flight. In 33% of the accidents, the pilot had less than 1,000hours total helicopter experience. In 26% of the accidents, the pilot had lessthan 100 hours flight experience on the helicopter type involved in theaccident. However, accidents also occurred to very experienced pilots. The accidentanalysis aims at identifying all factors, causal or contributory, that played arole in the accidents.The top three identified areas are Pilotjudgment and actions, Safety Management andSafety Culture, and Pilot situation awareness. \u00a0Different patternswere observed for Commercial Air Transport, Aerial Work and General Aviation. To tackle thevariety of languages used in accident reportsand optimise the use of resources, EHSAT has established nine regional analysisteams across Europe.

The number of fatal accidents involving aircraft registered in Member States of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) performing commercial air transport operations dropped from six in 2006 to three in 2007. This accounts for only some 5 per cent of all fatal accidents that year. Regarding aircraft registered in the rest of the world, the number of fatal accidents in the same type of operation increased from 36 in 2006 to 54 in 2007 and is above the decade average (52). Nevertheless, and despite the tragic accident of a Spanair MD-82 on 20 August 2008 which caused 154 fatalities (not subject of the report), the trend for the decade still indicates that the number of accidents worldwide in commercial air transport is declining. The report also includes data on accident rates for commercial helicopter operations, for aircraft involved in General Aviation and for light aircraft. The Annual Safety Review is compiled by EASA to inform the public of safety levels in civil aviation. The data used are provided by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the NLR Air Transport Safety Institute and the Agency\u2019s 31 members, which include the 27 Member States of the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Maintaining and improving aviation safety in Europe and worldwide is the main priority for the Agency. Through specific certification, rulemaking and standardisation activities, the Agency actively engages in accident prevention.

Today, 150 experts are working in the headquarters in Cologne. I can only say that, thanks to the strong support of the European Institutions, the National Aviation Authorities, the Central Joint Aviation Authorities and industry, we have managed to meet our deadlines. To highlight just a few milestones and figures: 20,000 certificates have been issued since the Agency started operations. Standardisation inspections of Member States have been reinforced. Working arrangements have been concluded with Brazil, Canada, China, Israel, and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). A privileged partnership has been established with the Federal Aviation Administration. The 'Fees and Charges' regulation was adopted by the European Commission and is now implemented by the Agency. Although we experienced some minor turbulence here and there, the picture is altogether positive. There remains a lot on our plate. The recent accidents sadly remind that we have to work even harder to establish and maintain a high and uniform level of civil aviation safety and environmental compatibility in Europe. In this context, and with the support of all partners, we will expand our scope of competences, first to flight crew licensing, air operations and third country aircraft and later to airport operations and air traffic control.
