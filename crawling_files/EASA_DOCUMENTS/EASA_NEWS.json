This is the first EU-wide operational measure to control the spread of COVID-19 in Europe. The safety directive specifies measures to be taken for flights serving high-risk destinations. It mandates thorough disinfecting and cleaning of aircraft which operate from high-risk destinations after each flight. Exceptions can be made only when disinfectants with a longer-lasting effect are used \u2013 but even in those cases a thorough disinfection is mandated no later than 24 hours after departure from a high-risk airport.\u00a0 \u201cWe need to reassure the passengers, the airline crews and the airport staff that their health and safety is our top priority,\u201d European Commissioner for Transport Adina Valean said. \u201cEU is taking concrete measures to limit and to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. That\u2019s why EASA issued a new safety directive concerning the full disinfection for all the aircrafts after each flight from the high risk areas both in Europe and beyond.\u201d The definition of high risk geographical areas will be based on all available information, taking into account World Health Organisation (WHO) situation report assessments, guidance issued by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and regional public health assessments.\u00a0 \u201cThis directive reaffirms the commitment of aviation to combatting the spread of the novel coronavirus,\u201d said Patrick Ky, Executive Director EASA.\u00a0 \u201cWe are aware that many airlines have already enhanced their cleaning procedures, and member states have put additional measures into place.

Drawn up in close collaboration with its various stakeholders, the EPAS lays out the current and future work EASA will be undertaking in coming years to support the introduction of new technologies and innovative solutions.\u00a0 While the steady pace to build a regulatory framework for the operations of drones will continue, regulatory actions to enable concepts such as urban air mobility or technologies such as novel propulsion systems are now already part of EPAS. These developments have the potential to further improve the level of safety whilst creating a level playing field for new business models and operating concepts.\u00a0 The Agency is also stepping up its actions to create a cleaner, quieter and more sustainable aviation system in this EPAS edition. Actions related to ICAO\u2019s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the implementation of ICAO environmental standards are included.\u00a0 The 180 EPAS actions contained in this edition include activities to improve our air traffic management system, address cybersecurity threats or to develop safety requirements in the area groundhandling. The Agency\u2019s Roadmaps, proposing coordinated actions in areas such as artificial intelligence, rotorcraft or general aviation are an integral part of EPAS.

The CZIB is valid until 16/07/2020 and reflects the conclusions of the EU Integrated Aviation Security Risk Assessment Group, which comprises EASA, the European Commission, European External Action Service and the EU Member States.\u00a0 The CZIB is based on a deep analysis by the EU Integrated Aviation Security Risk Assessment Group of all available information. It states: \u201cDue to the hazardous security situation, and poor coordination between civil aviation and military operations, there is a risk of misidentification of civil aircraft. Due to the presence of advanced air-defence systems, it is advised to be cautious with the risk associated to civil aviation. The risk to operations is assessed to be HIGH for Flight Levels below 250.\u201d As the situation in Iran is currently very dynamic, a further more restrictive recommendation, issued on 11/01/2020 by EASA and the European Commission, also remains in place. This recommendation states that overflights of Iran at all levels should be avoided until further notice, as a precautionary measure. This recommendation was issued to EU National Aviation Authorities in response to Iran\u2019s admission that it had accidentally shot down passenger aircraft PS-752. This recommendation does not have the more formal status or fixed time limitation of a Conflict Zone Information Bulletin and may therefore be adjusted quickly, as appropriate, in response to any new information as it becomes available.

Common rules will help foster investment, innovation and growth in this promising sector\u201d said Patrick Ky, Executive Director of EASA. The new rules include technical as well as operational requirements for drones. On one hand they define the capabilities a drone must have to be flown safely. For instance, new drones will have to be individually identifiable, allowing the authorities to trace a particular drone if necessary. This will help to better prevent events similar to the ones which happened in 2018 at Gatwick and Heathrow airports. On the other hand the rules cover each operation type, from those not requiring prior authorisation, to those involving certified aircraft and operators, as well as minimum remote pilot training requirements. The new rules will replace existing national rules in EU Member States. While the EU regulation will enter into force in the next 20 days, it will be applicable only in one year, to give Member States and operators time to prepare and implement it. \u00a0As of June 2020 operators of drones will need to register in the Member State where they have their residence or their main place of business.\u00a0 The applicability will be gradual according to a timeline that can be consulted on the EASA drone page.

Get involved and share #notonmyflight", "text": " Every 3 hours the safety of a flight within the EU is threatened by passengers behaving in an unruly or disruptive manner. At least 70% of these incidents involve some form of aggression. Once a month a flight is forced to perform an emergency landing when such situations escalate.* The number of reported incidents in 2018 have increased by 34% compared to 2017. These figures are worrying as they show an increasing trend. What is particularly disturbing is that these incidents have a direct impact on both the safety of crew and passengers. Even though the number of unruly passengers is small considering the total number of people flying, the impact of their actions can have a disproportionate effect both on the smooth operation of the flight and more importantly on its safety. Intoxicated passengers may not be able to follow safety instructions when needed and aggressive behaviour distracts the crew from their duties. Physical violence can be a traumatic experience for those involved and also reduces the ability of the crew to respond in case of an emergency. Any kind of unruly or disruptive behaviour whether related to intoxication, aggression or other factors introduces an unnecessary risk to the normal operation of a flight. This is why we believe that we need to work together in reducing these incidents.

Further research is recommended alongside other actions to support air operators with their responsibility to tailor more effective fatigue risk management strategies for night duties. The initial phase assessed the impact of \u2018night duties longer than 10 hours\u2019 and \u2018disruptive schedules\u2019 on the alertness of aircrews. Research found an increased probability of high fatigue levels, especially during nights and duty periods with late finishes, among both pilots and cabin crew. The strongest predictors of high fatigue in these periods, compared with daytime duties, varied by type of flight duty. For early starts, the only significant predictor was the earlier start time itself. For nights, the pertinent predictors were encroachment on the window of circadian low (WOCL, typically the period between 2 am and 5.59 am in the time zone to which a crew member is acclimatised) and short prior sleep. Based on the conclusions drawn from the outcomes of the analyses, six recommendations were made regarding further fatigue mitigation measures.

I see that the global market for drones will grow immensely in the coming few year. And that this industry needs a good European framework to unlock endless future technologies and applications. I have mobilized my contacts in the aviation and aerospace sector, governmental bodies and educational institutions and especially my contacts with EASA. Together with them we want to build an international platform that connects the entire UAS ecosystem to unlock the potential of the new solutions the drone industry can bring to societies.\u00a0 What does RAI and EASA have in common? \tThe drone industry is growing enormously, and we are seeing major opportunities to contribute to this by facilitating discussions, innovation and contacts. New European regulation for drones will be introduced in 2019, giving the sector a huge boost. A great deal is already possible in technological terms, and the coming years will show what businesses and organisations are willing and allowed to do with these new technologies, taking issues of privacy and safety into account. RAI and EASA are working very closely together here. Could give us more details about the initiative \u201cAmsterdam Drone Week\u201d? (and related activities like the \u201cAmsterdam city of drones\u201d?) \tFrom 26 to 30 November 2018, a range of activities in the field of drones will be hosted by the RAI under the flag of Amsterdam Drone Week (ADW). This platform is intended for all companies with operations in the UAS (Unmanned Aircraft Systems) sector or those who professionally deploy the relevant technology. The various activities will focus on Smart Mobility, Regulations, Technology and Solutions. Amsterdam Drone Week is a co-created events festival, that unites the brightest and most creative minds of the UAS Industry, showcases the latest technology and helps unlock the potential of drones and discovery of new applications. For the duration of one week, this umbrella event connects the entire UAS value chain through a diversity of events around drone regulations, new technology and future solutions. \tEASA will also organise its High-Level Conference on Drones 2018 together with the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management during ADW. ADW invites all start-ups, regulators, corporations and academic institutions to contribute ideas and initiatives.\u00a0 What do you look forward to during the Amsterdam Drone Week? \tWith its focus on education, innovation and technology, the city of Amsterdam is a perfect base to bring all these aspects together. Until now, most drone events were local and aimed at consumers. With this initiative, we are able to create a platform on a global scale, helping the sector develop as a whole. That platform will all come together during Amsterdam Drone Week. I have very excited and looking forward to the end of November.\u00a0 Paul Riemens is CEO/ Chairman of the Executive Board at RAI Amsterdam, a leading international exhibition and conference organization in Europe. He has made his career in the aviation sector. He has been CEO and chair of the board at Air Traffic Control the Netherlands (LVNL) since 2008, during which time he successfully converted the organisation into a results-oriented, open company. Since 2011 Paul Riemens is Chairman of the CANSO Executive Committee. CANSO is the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation,. He has proven his capacity to operate in an international arena in which stakeholder management is critical to success.

Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 empowers the Agency to propose to the European Commission the technical expertise to regulate drones of all sizes, including the small ones.\u00a0 These first EU-wide regulations for civil drones are based on an innovative way of regulating, where the rules are kept as simple as possible with a strong focus on the particular risk of the operations: flying the same drone over a city centre or over the sea entails a completely different risk. It takes into account the expertise of many international players in the drone domain. They will allow remotely piloted aircraft to fly safely in European airspace and bring legal certainty for this rapidly expanding industry.\u00a0 What are drones? In technical terms, they are Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), as they are aircraft operated with no pilot on board. Nevertheless, everybody calls them drones. They can vary from very small aircraft as big as a fly (nano-drones weighing 10-20 grams) to very large ones such as the Global Hawk with its 15 tons, used by NASA for scientific purposes. Major aviation companies already have started projects for cargo aircraft with the size of an Airbus A320 and their next step will be to propose unmanned passenger flights. Applications for small drones are unlimited. As the technology is constantly improving and prices are dropping (from tens to thousands of euros), anyone can buy a drone and start their own activity or new hobby. The potential market for drones is huge and will create new job opportunities. In addition, drones can also save lives and improve efficiency. They can be rapidly deployed as response in disaster and relief operations. They can be also used for power line inspections, minimising the human involvement under risk. Another very positive impact might be a reduction of carbon emissions, as they could replace some big and heavy helicopters by small electrically-powered drones. The EASA Opinion on Drones Before the new EASA Basic regulation was formally adopted, Member States were responsible for all drones lighter than 150 kg. Ahead of the extension of competence EASA decided in February 2018, to issue the proposal for a new regulation \u2013 EASA Opinion No 01/20181\u00a0\u2013 to the European Commission. EASA has been working on this draft regulation for the last two years, taking into account both the expertise gained by Member States and all the developments in the international arena (e.g. work done in the International Civil Aviation organisation (ICAO); in the Joint Authorities for the Rulemaking of Unmanned Systems (JARUS); and thousands of comments received from private citizens, industry and operators during the four-month public consultation period.\u00a0 The proposed regulation will harmonise operations regulations in Europe and create a common EU market for drones. It will allow everyone to buy and operate a drone ensuring: Safety, by keeping drones away from manned aircraft, protecting people and critical and sensitive infrastructure; Security, by keeping drones at an appropriate distance from nuclear reactors, military bases or oil pipelines; Privacy, by means of a proper separation from residential areas; Environmental protection, by reducing the noise level. CE Marking & Consumer information One of EASA\u2019s novelties is the combination between product and aviation legislations in these new rules. In particular, design requirements for small drones (up to 25kg) will be implemented by using the well-known CE marking (\u201cConformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne\u201d) for products brought on the market in Europe. All European drones will have assigned a CE-Marking with a number between 0 and 4, that will specify the class of the drone (C0, C1, C2, C3 and C4). The operator will then find in each drone package a digital consumer information with the \u201cdo\u2019s and don\u2019ts\u201d related to each class on how to fly a drone safely. U-Space U-Space is the term adopted for a set of services supporting low level drone operations (below 120 m). A fully automated infrastructure will provide the drone pilots with all the information needed to conduct a safe operation, including air traffic management, and will ensure that drones do not enter any restricted zones.\u00a0 In particular, U-Space will provide support to Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) operations and will be the fundamental basis for dense operations in urban areas. The latest technology will be used to reinforce the regulation and protect citizen\u2019s rights.\u00a0 Starting in 2019, U-Space will be gradually deployed, the foundation elements will be set up: drone registration, electronic identification and geo-awareness. Additional functionalities will be progressively added until U-Space is operational in 2025, allowing fully autonomous operations.\u00a0 Please visit our website for more information about what EASA does for drones. 1 EASA Opinion No 01/2018\u00a0\u201cUnmanned aircraft system (UAS) operations in the \u2018open\u2019 and \u2018specific\u2019 categories\u201d ", "easa_category": "EASA Newsletter: On Air article", "url": "https://www.easa.europa.eu/newsroom-and-events/news/safe-operations-drones-europe"}, {"id": "EASA_NEWS_0118", "date": "2018-09-19", "title": "Sunny Swift: Wake vortex avoidance", "text": " View translations ", "easa_category": "Sunny Swift", "url": "https://www.easa.europa.eu/newsroom-and-events/news/sunny-swift-wake-vortex-avoidance"}, {"id": "EASA_NEWS_0119", "date": "2018-09-17", "title": "ICAO, European Union and South East Asia working together for cheaper, safer and more sustainable aviation ", "text": " Bangkok, Thailand, 12 September 2018: Cheaper, safer and more environmentally sustainable aviation with less delays will be enabled by the ASEAN Single Aviation Market and Seamless ASEAN Sky.

Alcohol testing: As an additional safety barrier, alcohol testing of pilots and cabin crew for all European and foreign airlines who fly into the territories of the European Union, has been added. Alcohol testing is already a well-established practice in some Member States and with this Regulation alcohol testing will now be extended to all EU Member States within the next two years.

The milestones and latest achievements of the GA Roadmap, which has now come close to completing its original list of actions[1], were presented at our stakeholder & press event at AERO. The reactions to the event were encouraging \u2013 \u201cenlightening, confident, open in a mutual manner, motivating to take on the challenges and opportunities of the future in a positive and curious spirit\u201d \u2013 these were some of the impressions given. We already created a light, flexible and resilient regulatory framework \u2013 it is now up to the Member States to endorse and support this! The way forward from here is a common vision and strategy for General Aviation involving us all. We already created a sound basis with the new lighter and more flexible regulatory framework coming into place that will support GA in Europe and make it more resilient and adaptive to new demands. The timeline varies depending on where in the legislative process the action items are. To take one example: With the Opinion for a lighter Part-M, we proposed a smart, resilient and flexible rules framework to the Commission and the Member States. It is now up to the Member States \u2013 the representatives of your countries - to endorse and adopt them! Currently, we still face considerable challenges when it comes to implementation of the GA Roadmap at the national \u2013 the Member States\u2019 - level. For European GA to really be successful and \u2018take off\u2019, we need to improve this cooperation. What culture do we want? One of separation and division or one where we work together and feel and act as the community we really are? Things will really start to happen when we decide for the latter. Innovation, research, data, young people \u2013 for all this we have to bring people together and create a team beyond EASA! While most GA Roadmap action points have been tackled and solved, we cannot sit back. We need to move on, review the Roadmap, adjust and adapt continuously (this is also a requirement of our new Basic Regulation) \u2013 and we have to focus on the future: on our future pilots; on new and innovative technologies such as electric & hybrid propulsion; but also on drones, airspace usage, and new business models of flying. Data collection & analysis and research, for example, are powerful tools that help us staying on top of things. For all of this to \u2018fly\u2019, a few conditions need to be met. Firstly, we need to talk to each other and do so as a community. We have to draw the attention of potential new aviators and future pilots. EASA\u2019s recently launched safety promotion activities all target GA: the EU-wide airspace infringement campaign; Sunny Swift, the cartoon on mitigating risks and better flying; or the GA community site that invites everybody to participate in discussions and share information about all kinds of topics within GA. The general feedback to our efforts in communication and safety promotion have been positive. Safety Promotion does not only explain safety rules \u2013 in some cases, it may even replace certain rules (where such rules would serve only to further complicate things without adding any safety-related added value). However, to be really successful at this, again, we cannot do it on our own. We need the whole GA community\u2019s \u2013 your - ideas and participation! This will make safety promotion effective \u2013 it is practiced Safety Together!, our new slogan for safety promotion activities. Whether it\u2019s the common work on the rules, their implementation at national level, sharing data, ideas and research activities or working together on safety promotion: To gain confidence and trust, to face the future in a positive and optimistic spirit we absolutely need to strengthen and truly act as the community we are! The simplified rules already pave the way for a different mind-set - where we as EASA, all NAAs and associations offer a tailored approach taking into account the specificities of GA activity. We can improve and work on this vision, together!

IAOPA has represented international GA aviation for more than 55 years. The combined total of individuals represented by these constituent member groups of IAOPA is over 400,000 pilots, who fly general aviation aircraft for business and personal transportation. Today IAOPA has 30 affiliates in Europe, which is the most active IAOPA region in the world. Some of the main IAOPA objectives are to facilitate the movement of general aviation aircraft internationally, for peaceful purposes and to coordinate with other international and national organizations to promote and represent better understanding of general aviation's requirements. Furthermore we also encourage representatives of national general aviation member groups to meet with and work with their national authorities in the interest of general aviation; the collection from ICAO Contracting States and dissemination by ICAO of information, data and statistics relating to general aviation to provide a meaningful base for development of technical programs. In general, what is your relationship with EASA and other regulators? I think \u201cconstructive criticism\u201d describes the relation between an authority and an association best. The most valuable asset IAOPA can offer in such a relation are cooperation, the provision of expertise, and in general an honest feedback. For this purpose we are active in many of EASA\u00b4s Rulemaking Tasks and Advisory Committees. Some years ago it was evident that our honest feedback was not much appreciated, but instead considered as a disturbance and clear evidence for ungratefulness. EASA was very successful in regulating airlines and commercial aircraft manufacturers, but all too often was applying a \u201cone size fits all approach\u201d that led to over-regulation of general aviation in Europe. In a democracy it is normal that an interest group wants to have a say on how it is regulated, especially as there are international benchmarks, which clearly showed we were not doing well in international comparisons. But the economic prosperity and the safety of our sector clearly go hand in hand. Only in a prospering environment with sufficiently low operating cost private pilots can afford a sufficiently high number of flight hours. And proficiency of pilots clearly increases their safety. Only if the general economic expectations are good, new investment into new safety technology is made. If not a dangerous downward spiral starts: Increasing cost lead to less flight activity, less flight activity decreases pilots proficiency and increases the cost for operation even further. GA is very sensitive to the level of regulation, in some states GA is prospering, in others it is clearly not, although the objective economic data give no reason for such a disparity. Most rulemaking officers love their jobs, so they write rules. But they need to withstand the temptation to come up with more and more rules during their careers, because finally the rules still need to be understood and accepted by their target audience. What do you think about the achievements of the EASA GA roadmap and what does this mean for the future? Can you talk about the challenges lying ahead? The achievements of the GA Roadmap are very remarkable, even our colleagues from North America envy us a bit for the progress we made, which clearly hasn\u00b4t been the case some 10 years ago. The climate between EASA, AOPA and other GA associations has significantly improved, and as a consequence the outcome of the GA Roadmap is very showable. The big challenge today is the implementation of what has already been achieved within the GA Roadmap: There are many opinions like the Part M Light that were agreed upon in Rulemaking Groups, but they became seriously delayed within the EU Commission. There are many competent authorities which still haven\u00b4t fully adapted the new regulations yet, but also many maintenance shops and of course also pilots haven\u00b4t fully digested the positive changes yet. Rules are often difficult to understand and consequently open to interpretation. The light end of GA appears to be already very well covered by the GA roadmap, but we also need to focus on the small commercial enterprises within GA. To give one example: For pilots within commercial parachute and commercial sight-seeing-operators as well as flight schools, the Commercial Pilot Licenses are too burdensome to achieve today. Their theoretical exam requires about 80% of the ATPL knowledge, which is too much. The solution could be a light/competency based CPL, following the example of the Competency Based Instrument Rating. Apart from flexible risk-based rulemaking and certification, what is the role of Safety Promotion? And which other tools should be implemented in General Aviation to improve safety? Safety promotion is most important. Rules that are not well known do not help to improve safety at all. Instead, the authorities and the associations need to reach out to the community, explain the new legal framework and support the pilots in improving their attitudes and skills. Our association does invest a lot into flight safety promotion: AOPA-USA is the shining example with the Air Safety Institute and a plentitude of freely available online courses and videos. But also here in Europe we do what we can in order to reach out to our community: We offer various Flight Safety Seminars, Flight Instructor Refreshers, Safety Letters covering many critical subjects, Flight Safety Training Events bringing together trainees and flight instructors, Upset Recovery Trainings, Sea Survival courses, etc. We negotiated with Insurance companies, and several of them do give discounts as incentives for pilots who attend flight safety events or install collision avoidance systems.

It commits to progress towards lighter, simpler and better regulation for General Aviation. In the past 3 years, EASA has worked relentlessly on the action items enumerated in the GA Roadmap, delivering in accordance with its commitments and close to completing the original list of rulemaking activities. We are further striving to incorporate our 6 GA strategic principles.* We have also been able to achieve several of our strategic key objectives (namely, to develop the use of industry standards for CS-23 reorganisation to allow and promote the introduction of new technology, and the Standard Changes and Repairs Process).\u00a0 Following the rule changes, we have to work hand-in-hand with the Member States to ensure swift implementation: simpler certification process; simplify and reduce aircraft maintenance costs \u2013 Part-M Light, Part-CAO; allow training for private pilot outside Approved Training Organisation \u2013 Part-DTO; and facilitate access to IFR flying. Let us give you a brief update and insight into these actions. Some of them have entered or will soon enter the implementation phase. \u00a0 * 6 GA principles: One size does not fit all; use rules when it is the only or the best way to reach the safety objectives; adopt a risk-based approach; protect \u2018what shows to work well\u2019 unless there are demonstrable and statistically significant safety reasons against doing so; apply EU smart regulation principles; make the best use of available resources and expertise. \u00a0 A new way of thinking: reaching milestones in Maintenance and Certification First experiences with the new CS-23 One of the highlights last year was the new CS-23: smart and flexible rules that support innovation and are a true game-changer. The latest amendment (n\u00b05) of CS-23 - certification specifications providing the technical requirements for certification of small aeroplanes \u2013 has been effective since 15 August 2017. EASA published the AMC/GM (Acceptable Means of Compliance & Guidance Material) in December of the same year including a first set of accepted consensus standards. Since then, 5 new Type Investigations, including an eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) aircraft have been using the new rule as certification basis. We now can confirm a greater agility in accommodating innovation and stronger focus on desired safety performance. Sometimes this is reflected in more decisions to be taken at project level. This aspect, together with the integration of the VTOL requirements and the full harmonization with FAA are the challenges we are working on. Continued Airworthiness (Maintenance) update EASA had a favourable vote for the proposed text on B2L and L aircraft maintenance licenses by the EASA Committee in April 2018 and expects the further adoption as EU-regulation by the Commission within the following 9 months. That means that National Aviation Authorities could start issuing the new licenses in 2019 and converting existing national licenses in 2020. In detail, the B2L aircraft maintenance licence applies for avionics and electrical systems; and for aircraft other than those in the group of complex aircraft (Group 1). It is based on system ratings and considered as progressive (eventually leading to a full B2, if appropriate). The licence holder can increase the privileges by adding new system ratings at any time. The L aircraft maintenance licence refers to airframe, power-plant, mechanical and electrical systems, radio, ELT, transponders and limited avionics. It is intended for sailplanes, powered-sailplanes, balloons, airships and ELA1 aeroplanes. The L-license does not require training but an examination by a National Aviation Authority (NAA), Part-147 organisation or anywhere agreed with the relevant NAA. It will replace at a certain point the current national qualifications. Current certifying staff under national rules will obtain the L-licence with the same privileges by conversion. In the near future also Part-ML (Part-M Light) and Part-CAO (Continuing Airworthiness Organisations) will be adopted. Part-ML will be applicable to private and commercial (except CAT) operations of aeroplanes (if they are not complex motor-powered aircraft) up to 2730 Kg, as well as other ELA2 aircraft and helicopters up to 4 occupants and 1200 Kg. It allows more attributions to the pilot (deferment of certain defects) and certifying staff/maintenance organisations (airworthiness reviews). Its maintenance programme will not require any authority approval. Part-CAO will be applicable to organisations for maintenance & maintenance management of non-complex non-CAT aircraft (some aircraft will follow Part-M and others Part-ML). It combines the privileges of a Subpart-F maintenance organisation and a CAMO (Continuing Airworthiness Maintenance Organisation). They will continue with the current Quality System (or organisational reviews if the organisation is small), so no SMS (Safety Management System) will apply. Last but not least, Part-CAO introduces simplified requirements. An alleviation from EASA Form 1 for certain parts is expected in the medium future. The regulatory activity is aiming towards installing some spare parts during maintenance without a Form 1. The proposal of this concept is already included in the text of NPA 2017-19. This text, which has already received some positive comments from the GA community, is scheduled to be proposed to the Commission for end of 2018. It will be applicable only for not-safety-critical parts, as identified by the aircraft manufacturer (or by EASA, in special cases), and is particularly interesting for light aircraft. The concept of standard changes and repairs \u2013 CS-STAN All changes and repairs are subject to approval (under Part 21, Subparts D + M) but since a few years Part-21 also allows to derogate for standard changes and repairs. The specifications are laid down in CS-STAN: a set of provisions allowing the embodiment of simple changes or repairs to GA aircraft without a dedicated approval process, provided that specific conditions are met. The purpose for allowing standard changes/repairs is to: Reduce the regulatory burden for embodiment of simple changes and repairs Facilitate introduction of more modern and safer equipment As CS-STAN evolves, certain topics will be covered in its next issue, such as: new standard changes for balloons; installation of flight time counters; replacement of starter batteries; installation of attachments / brackets for various purposes; headset exchange; clock replacement; repainting of composite aircraft acrylic; installation of weather warning functionality for VFR a/c; improvement/ extension of existing provisions; etc. Part-21 Proportionality The existing AMC/GM to Part-21 are written mainly for large aircraft and companies. In particular, the Product Organisation approval (POA) lacks scalable alternative means of compliance. In addition, there is a split foreseen in the rules between approvals of design and production organisations, and also maintenance organisation, which for small companies - who work in small, consolidated teams - is not natural; and Part-21 Section B (Procedures for competent authorities) mandates a process-oriented approach, which may not necessarily be the best approach for small companies. We know that innovation is the future for GA and new ideas and players on the market should be encouraged and supported. Today\u2019s rules for design and production are challenging for start-up organisations. Therefore, the \u201cPart 21 proportionality\u201d project is intended to change this in 2 steps. In a first step, we are developing a proposal for a set of alternative acceptable means of compliance (AMC), which may be used by companies designing or producing ELA (European Light Aircraft), aiming at complementing the existing AMC with more flexible and scalable AMC. The second step is to develop new or alternative rules within Part-21, in line with the new toolbox available under the new Basic Regulation. Another breakthrough towards simpler and lighter rules: Air operations and Licensing Balloon & Sailplane Regulations The air operations Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 contains about 1900 pages of rules and associated soft law (the AMC/GM material). But only around 120 pages apply to balloons, and even less to sailplanes. The way forward is to extract the applicable rules for balloons and also for sailplanes from the Regulation, making them simpler and proportionate. The new rules separate Balloon and Sailplane in two different ones. The first rule completed is Regulation (EU) 2018/395 for balloons. At present, it includes Annex I with Definitions and Annex II (Part-BOP,*, Air OPS). Annex III (Part BFCL* Licensing) will follow. The Balloon Rule Book is already available on the EASA website. Its main chapters refer to Air Operations, Licensing, Continuing and Initial Airworthiness. This consolidated version contains all information a balloon pilot or operator needs to know in the form of an easy-to-read rule book. A similar one for sailplanes is foreseen to be published in the first half of 2019. See also our GA Talking points on simpler and lighter rules for balloons and sailplanes. *BOP\u00a0=\u00a0Balloon Air\u00a0Operations *BFCL\u00a0=\u00a0Balloon\u00a0Flight\u00a0Crew\u00a0Licensing Aircrew: further landmarks in sight New rules for balloon & sailplane pilot licences are currently under development. \tThese new parts of the balloon & sailplane regulations are named Part-BFCL (Balloon Flight Crew Licensing) and Part-SFCL (Sailplane Flight Crew Licensing) respectively and will form part of the new balloon and sailplane regulations as described in the Chapter above. Requirements for balloon and sailplane pilot licensing have been revised to be more proportionate to GA. The Opinion is planned to be published by 31 October 2018. The publication of the Opinion on the Basic Instrument Rating (BIR) is expected on the same date. With the BIR, it is proposed to introduce into Part-FCL a new rating for flying IFR (Instrument Flight Rules), tailored to the needs of leisure pilots, with a full competency-based training in modules, a revised theory syllabus and, in return for numerous alleviations, limitations for approach minima.\u00a0 In the past, the requirements applicable to Approved Training Organisations (ATOs) were found too demanding for small GA training providers. That\u2019s why EASA developed new and lighter rules: Part-DTO (Declared Training Organisations). Part-DTO (a new Annex VIII to Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011) contains provisions for a new type of training organisation for leisure pilots for aeroplanes, helicopters, sailplanes and balloons. DTOs will not have to undergo the same comprehensive certification process as the ATOs which provide training for obtaining commercial pilot licences. The transition for existing training organisations will be easy. Publication of Part-DTO is expected for July 2018. The concept of a modular light aircraft pilot license LAPL(A) is currently under revision, and a concrete proposal under development. This revised concept considers the option for LAPL training delivered in modules, and these modules would be determined by each Member State. After the last comments and criticism received, the opt-out for LAPL is extended until April 2020, in order to have more time to develop the concept of modular LAPL.\u00a0 Furthermore, EASA has proposed to amend requirements for the LAPL to include seaplane privileges in Opinion 05/2017. See also our GA Talking Points on simpler and lighter rules for GA pilot training. What\u2019s next? Communication, Safety Promotion, cooperation We created or proposed light and flexible rules for General Aviation that in some cases have already been implemented. Where there are delays it is usually due to the adoption discussions and process in the EU Commission. The next phase is however coming closer, where we support implementation and monitor the intended effects of our simplification of the regulatory system. For this we need to better understand the current and intended future of GA. This is one of the reasons why we need a common vision and strategy for GA involving all players. If put in place, the new regulatory framework will support and strengthen General Aviation in Europe. \tAs the rules become lighter, Communication and Safety Promotion have to take up speed. EASA is taking a leading and more proactive role in Safety Promotion, which has become one of the Agency\u2019s priorities. Current successful activities in GA safety promotion are: the start of a GA Community Site for exchange of information, sharing of experiences and discussion around GA topics; the Sunny Swift cartoons on mitigating risks while flying, completely produced by EASA colleagues in 24 European languages; the publication of the European Airspace Infringement Campaign with several short videos and additional materials on the subject, looking at different national specificities as well. \tIn order to replace or also to strengthen rules, good and effective Safety promotion is best done in cooperation and exchange. National contributions and support of the European campaigns and efforts are crucial. So is the sharing of data and research. This is the way we can work on a vision together, reach out to future pilots, support new technologies and continue our successful path in General Aviation.

The event was organised by, the Polish Civil Aviation Authority and EASA, sponsored by the Polish Prime Minister and the Polish Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure. A Memorandum of Cooperation was signed between EASA and the Polish CAA for the pilot phase of the European Centre for Cybersecurity in aviation on 8 November 2017.\u00a0 This High Level Conference offered the possibility to further develop discussion held in previous conferences, in particular the High level conference on Cybersecurity in Civil Aviation held in November 2016 in Bucharest, which called for an EU strategic coordination on the subject.\u00a0 In response to this, the European Strategic Coordination Platform (ESCP) on cybersecurity in aviation has been then established in the 2017 and started its \u201cEngagement Phase\u201d. This year, participating organisations are finalising its Charter and coordinating the work on Cybersecurity in Aviation strategy and regulatory needs.\u00a0 At the conference in Krakow, EASA recalled this achievement and took the chance to propose objectives common to all aviation stakeholders, as well as to explore synergies with other transport means, in view of an integrated multimodal transport dimension. The main objective is not only to engage all stakeholders in a fair and non-discriminatory frame, but establishing a resilient European transport system and creating the largest level playing field in the world on cybersecurity.\u00a0 All aviation sectorsi represented at the conference recognised that the interdependency of services and cross border nature of the aviation business require a trans-organisational coordination to properly address the cybersecurity risk. A common approach to abandon of the separation between safety and security was also unanimously declared. The conference participants discussed the establishment for the future European strategy for Cybersecurity in Aviation and the Cybersecurity Road Map.

Cybersecurity should become the pioneer in exchanging information on the risks perceived from the ground to the aircraft. This should create a new level of risk assessment compatible at all level and enable information sharing by all actors in civil aviation. We have started to work on a European Strategic Coordination Platform together with key Industry stakeholders, EU Member States and Institutions to facilitate the collaboration at institutional level. We have also set up the European Centre for Cyber Security in Aviation in order to provide information and assistance to EU aviation stakeholders to protect the critical assets of civil aviation. With the evolution of EASA\u2019s basic regulation, our vision is that cybersecurity will be fully integrated in the remit of the Agency which will be set-up to drive the EU aviation system to become more resilient to cyber threats.

ENISA, the European Union Cybersecurity agency, is a center of expertise that supports Member States in enhancing their cybersecurity posture. ENISA is facilitating the MS in the implementation of relevant regulation (NIS Directive, eIDas regulation, Article 13a etc); is investing on national capabilities through trainings and exercises (e.g. Cyber Europe, Cybersecurity Challenge) and finally is providing guidelines on the most important emerging technical topics (e.g. Blockchain, IoT security).\u00a0 In 2016, ENISA published a study on \"Securing smart airports\" providing airport decision makers and security personnel with a start-up kit to prevent possible attacks and implement available good practices, in order to secure passengers and operations.\u00a0 In 2017, ENISA is cooperating with EASA on building cyber security awareness in aviation. In this respect, EASA, the European Aviation Safety Agency, in collaboration with ENISA, hosted the first ENISA training on cybersecurity in aviation on the 20th and 21st of November in Brussels. ENISA\u2019s future work in the field aims in enhancing the security and resilience of air transport in Europe together with all relevant key stakeholders and agencies. You are also taking part to the foundation of the European Centre for Cybersecurity in Aviation, what is your role there and in aviation in general?\u00a0 ENISA is strengthening cyber security in all Critical Sectors (energy, transport, finance health etc) providing guidelines to all MS and bringing stakeholders together to share information. Specifically, for Aviation, ENISA is a member of the Executive Committee and Technical Advisory Committee together with other 30 Representatives from EU-Level Institutions, EASA Member States, Aviation Industry Associations and observers from ICAO, FAA and AIA. In general, we can summarize our activities in aviation as follows: Support aviation stakeholders: 2016 ENISA report on threat modelling and security measures for airports and relevant stakeholders \u201cSecuring smart airports\u201d.\u00a0 \t\tENISA aims to help airports making use of integrated Internet of Things (IoT) components on top of the legacy infrastructure. These airports are implementing these new smart components to offer travellers a portfolio of services that spans from self or automatic check-in, baggage & document check, flight booking management and way finding services to automated border control and security checks. These components while enhancing the user experience, they also pave the way for new attack vectors and expose airport assets to a larger attack surface. The goal is to provide an easy and comprehensive guide for airport decision makers to implement available good practices, in order to secure passengers and operations.\u00a0 \t\t\u00a0 Knowledge and capacity building: Trainings \t\tEASA, the European Aviation Safety Agency, in collaboration with ENISA, the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security, hosted the first ENISA training on cybersecurity in aviation on the 20th and 21st of November in Brussels. The main goal of the training is to inform aviation IT security experts on the latest cyber threats, on the handling of cyber incidents and provide a starting point for the challenges ahead. So ENISA is building capacity in the sectors.\u00a0\u00a0 \t\t\u00a0 Sharing of Information and Reporting: Support EA-ISAC, ECCSA and NIS Directive implementation \t\tWe are currently supporting the creation of the European Aviation ISAC (EA-ISAC) which will provide a platform for cyber security information exchange across Europe. Moreover, ENISA is currently mapping the existing information sharing activities and can support with the extensive expertise in the field (studies, training, etc).\u00a0 \t\t\u00a0 Policy Implementation: The Network and Information Security Directive \t\tThe NIS Directive was published in June 2016; all MS should implement it by May 2018. The specific provisions include the implementation of baseline security measures and incident notification for the operators of essential services. The Aviation sector covers specifically: Air carriers Airport managing bodies, core airports and entities operating ancillary installations contained within airports Traffic management control operators providing air traffic control (ATC) services. In 2017 we are supporting all stakeholders involved in the implementation process of upcoming NIS Directive and accordingly providing input to the Cooperation Group. ENISA can collaborate by focusing its ongoing efforts for NISD implementation in the direction of the transport stakeholders\u2019 needs. What is the extent of the cooperation between ENISA and EASA? ENISA is a member of the Executive Committee and Technical Advisory Committee together with other 30 Representatives from EU-Level Institutions, EASA Member States, Aviation Industry Associations and observers from ICAO, FAA and AIA. We currently assisting EASA, for Collaboration of the NIS Directive and Aviation cybersecurity, with:\u00a0 Overview of ENISA NIS Directive current activities in support of the cooperation group understanding EASA Aviation cybersecurity needs and possible synergies supporting their capacity building\u00a0 The goal is to synergize with EASA and promote Cybersecurity Awareness and Preparedness in the aviation sector. ENISA is a knowledge partner of EASA and aims to bring cybersecurity expertise to EASA in order to meet the needs of future challenges and streamline future efforts. What are the main challenges faced by the Aviation sector as far as cyber security is concerned? Cyber security is something new for the Aviation sector. Primarily stakeholders need to conjugate safety (where maturity is high) with cybersecurity. As the attack vector is widening, the aviation sector should prepare for upcoming more sophisticated attacks and hybrid threats.\u00a0 From the organisational perspective the Aviation sector need to invest more on raising the next generation of aviation cyber security experts and on promoting a wide spread culture of cybersecurity awareness in all areas of air transport.\u00a0 ENISA\u2019s future work in the field, aims in developing the security and resilience of air transport in Europe together with all relevant key stakeholders and agencies. In the context of the NIS Directive , ENISA will assist Member States and the European Commission by providing expertise and advice, as well as developing and facilitating the exchange of good practices, with the ultimate goal to enable higher level of security for Europe\u2019s air transport infrastructure. \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "easa_category": "EASA Newsletter: On Air article", "url": "https://www.easa.europa.eu/newsroom-and-events/news/european-union-cybersecurity-agency-enisa-interview"}, {"id": "EASA_NEWS_0172", "date": "2017-12-15", "title": "Memorandum of cooperation signed between EASA and ECHA", "text": " EASA and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) concluded on 13 December 2017 a Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) between the two Agencies to provide a framework for their cooperation.

This will give the possibility of identifying and assessing systemic and emerging safety risks in aviation. There are major and important programmes run by the airline operators or the national civil aviation authorities but so far none of the programmes provide a consolidated version. Despite all the collaboration efforts and data sharing, the fact is that today in Europe the wealth of safety data is not exploited as a whole and the analytical capacity is not synergised to its full extend.\u00a0 Well, with D4S we would like to change this approach.\u00a0 The programme intends to gather the efforts and provide the needed synergies.

Together with Erick Ferrandez and the other TB members, I am responsible for the day to day operation of the programme. In this startup phase that involves drafting the procedures and agreements and processing the inputs from other technical board members and presenting the end product to the Steering Board for approval. \tAs an organisation, ECA is one of the key stakeholders in the European Civil Aviation industry. Representing 38.000 airline pilots, we are the key representative of the profession. As such we commit to work with the industry and EASA to maintain and improve the high safety record of European aviation. We see our role in D4S as twofold: On one hand, we bring the expertise and first-hand experience from the \u201cfront end\u201d of the industry to the various task teams, thereby helping to give the operational context input to the data analysis and help translate the findings of the programme into tangible practical safety solutions. \tOn the other hand, we strive to be seen as a \u201cpurveyor of trust\u201d, not only to the pilots from the operators involved in the programme but also by the different stakeholders, whether EASA or industry. 2) How will this kind of initiative further improve aviation safety? \tFirst of all, it is important to emphasize that the D4S programme relies on trust and a just culture approach. Because both of these elements are incorporated at every level of the programme, D4S will be able to bring more information together than ever before. \tIf successful, D4S will allow us to get an overarching overview of the European aviation system from a systemic safety perspective.\u00a0 With the existing safety initiatives, whether we look at an occurrence reporting system or an operator\u2019s FDM programme, we are only able to analyse and focus on safety issues on very limited scope, with regard to\u00a0 an operator, an airport, an ANSP\u2026. The vast amount of data available to D4S will enable us to identify less obvious and possibly latent systemic issues that would otherwise remain \u201cbelow the radar\u201d. \t\u00a0 3) In your opinion, how does it compare or differs from other data collection initiatives? \tGenerally speaking, data collection in aviation tends to focus on \u201cevents\u201d such as exceedances, incidents and accidents. This means that the vast majority of flights are hardly analysed. With D4S we not only open up the possibility to analyse all flights, but, as menitioned before, we will be able to compare data across the entire European Aviation. In practice this means that an individual organisation can compare their own data against the aggregate results of all other programme members. At the same time the aggregate results themselves provide a powerful basis for EASA to further improve their rulemaking process. 4) What added value do you see generated by the D4S project? \tBeyond the core aims of the D4S and the added value that the programme is supposed to bring to the European aviation stakeholders, it has the potential, just like many other collaborative safety initiatives, to build trustful relationships between stakeholders. Whether regulators, operators, manufacturers or professional associations like ECA, stakeholders are naturally often at odds with one another\u2019s goals and aspirations. On the other hand we all share a common cause when it comes to safety of the traveling public, whose trust is the backbone of the commercial success of the industry. Collaborative programmes such as D4S give the industry the chance to come together and work on a common goal and interact on a deeper level, away from political or commercial issues. As such, ECA is convinced that the success of D4S and the way the stakeholders will learn to cooperate within this programme as well as in other safety initiatives will be a good indicator of the maturity of the industry as a whole.

Data4Safety (also known as D4S) is a data collection and analysis programme that will support the goal to ensure the highest common level of safety and environmental protection for the European aviation system. The programme aims at collecting and gathering all data that may support the management of safety risks at European level. This includes safety reports (or occurrences), flight data (i.e. data generated by the aircraft via the Flight Data Recorders), surveillance data (air traffic data), weather data - but those are only a few from a much longer list. As for the analysis, the programme\u2019s ultimate goal is to help to \"know where to look\" and to \"see it coming\". In other words, it will support the Performance-based Environment and set up a more predictive system.\u00a0 More specifically, the programme will allow to better know where the risks are (safety issue identification), determine the nature of these risks (Risk Assessment) and verify if the safety actions are delivering the needed level of safety (performance measurement). It aims to develop the capability to discover vulnerabilities in the system across terabytes of data. A voluntary partnership for aviation safety \tThis programme is highly innovative, very complex and ambitious enough to be a \u201cgame-changer\u201d. It is not an initiative that EASA contemplates doing alone. Not because the Agency is afraid of the complexity, but because it would not make sense. Hence, as of day one, the idea was an EU wide partnership with EASA\u2019s safety partners. First and foremost, you have the organisations that will be full members of the programme. They are usual safety partners from the European Aviation Community: the airlines, manufacturers, Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP), National Aviation Authorities (NAA), pilots, maintenance organisations, airports, etc. Such a programme is meant to be done with them. They have the data, the expertise and we share the same goal of enhancing safety. EASA\u2019s safety partners are meant to be programme members and will be part of the D4S governance. As data owners, they need a system of checks and balances to ensure that their data will be used in an appropriate manner. The Agency have also associate partners from universities and research centres that have developed expertise and savoir-faire on how to use the Big Data and other leading edge IT technologies (such as text mining) when applied to aviation data. There is a need to include a considerable amount of research efforts in the programme, but we also rely as much as possible on what has already been done and is available. Taking data collection and analysis to another level \tCollecting and analysing data is not new in aviation. A number of regulations oblige the different organisations involved in aviation safety to report, collect, analyse safety data such as occurrences or flight data, and act on it. However, each organisation is collecting only a sample of the overall data set available. If you collect a part of the data you will only get a part of the picture.\u00a0 The main innovation of this project is that, for the first time in Europe, a programme has the ambition to provide the full and complete picture. D4S aims to organise the collection of all the safety data that are currently scattered and fragmented all over the different organisations in Europe. The data will then be integrated into a Big Data platform. Thanks to powerful algorithms this technology will enable us to process the data and extract all the information in it. However, just amassing data could be quite a futile exercise if you are not able to analyse it. Therefore, other novelty is the creation of an analysis platform that will gather aviation experts from all domains and organisations in a way we have never seen before in Europe. The aviation experts will be supported by Data Scientists (mathematicians) who analyse and interpret complex digital data and develop the famous algorithms. D4S organisation in practice Data4Safety would be a Private Public Partnership or PPP \u2013 a partnership between public bodies such as EASA or NAAs and the private sector, like airlines or manufacturers. Creating such a PPP would make sense as the programme is aligned with and support the European Commission strategy for transport (including synergies with maritime and railways strategies) and the EU Digital Agenda. There are several forms of PPP, SESAR JU (Single European Sky ATM Research Joint Undertaking) is one example. EASA is currently exploring the best legal form for the D4S programme. It is a long process and should take about 3 years. EASA Senior Management is conducting the high-level political discussions required at EU level to explain, convince and secure the buy-in and funding of Data4Safety. In the meantime, EASA launched an initial phase called the \u201cProof of Concept\u201d in 2017. The objective is to build a prototype or tester with a limited number of partners and a limited technical scope to test the technical and organisational challenges of the programme before launching the operational phase planned for 2020. Measures of success \tThere are three elements that will be closely monitoring and will be good measures of this programme\u2019s success. First, our ability to build trust. If the safety partners (and data owners) do not trust that their data are in good hands with D4S - not only secured technically, contractually and legally- but also that the programme will use them for the sole purpose of safety, they will simply not share them. Delivering trust is therefore a priority.\u00a0 \tOn this point, the fact that the founding members have signed the programme charter is already a milestone achievement (i). Second, the programme will have to live up to the expectations of technical delivery. No one will care if we are capable to amass terabytes of data on an IT platform. The measure of success will be assessed by our ability to develop the algorithms that will infer intelligence and knowledge out of the data. Ultimately, this means our ability to discover the vulnerabilities of the aviation system through this programme. Last but not least, this programme must be fully integrated into the European safety system. Indeed, Data4Safety is an enabler, not an objective in itself. The outputs (again, \"know where to look\" and \"see it coming\") will be useless if they do not support the processes to decide and implement the relevant safety actions. For instance, D4S must become the main feeder for the EPAS (European Plan for Aviation Safety) and will practically support rulemaking or certification activities. Beyond Europe, D4S must also be connected to similar international initiatives. The cooperation with the US counterpart programme (ASIAS) has already been formally established, and we are also in discussion with IATA and others.

Over the 15 years that EASA has been in operation, CASA has worked closely with EASA in international forums, including on the panels and working groups of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). We work formally and informally through information sharing arrangements and well developed person-to-person contacts at the subject matter expert level. This allows CASA opportunities to advise European counterparts of the similarities and differences in our operational environments and aviation industries. CASA and EASA first signed an arrangement on enhanced cooperation for the oversight of the Airbus A380 fleet in 2008 and in January 2017, CASA joined the EU SAFA Programme when I signed a Working Arrangement with the EASA Executive Director. We look forward to aligned procedures and findings of ramp inspection surveillance through participation in the SAFA Programme. Joining Singapore in the Asia and Pacific (APAC) Region as a SAFA member will also strengthen regional links for the programme. How important is it to meet with other Aviation regulators and industry partners? Engaging with the global aviation industry, and with aviation safety regulators is a vital part of CASA\u2019s role and is an expectation of the Australian Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. The recent EASA-FAA International Aviation Safety Conference which brought regulators and aviation community representatives together to discuss global aviation safety issues in Brussels provided an opportunity prior to a number of key APAC regional engagements to discuss views on current aviation safety elements. It is important to me that CASA takes on board the views of other regulators through global and regional forums so we are well informed of the emerging issues. In this regard, I don\u2019t see any international forum as standing alone, as these discussions as well as the important domestic considerations with our own industries are blended to inform our national view. In this regard, I was pleased to participate in a panel discussion session on \u2018Building Mutual Trust\u2019 at the Brussels conference, where I discussed CASA\u2019s work towards embedding our regulatory philosophy across the organisation including implementing the principles within CASA and in our dealings with the aviation community including dealing with our international counterparts. From CASA point of view, what are the latest challenges you are facing to keep the aviation system safe? Like many regulators, whilst focusing on attracting and retaining specialist personnel, CASA faces a number of key challenges and trends, including: Growth and evolution of remotely piloted aircraft sector and introducing modernised regulations to effectively manage safety; Increased participation in sport and recreational aviation; Continuing to develop regulatory options to address ageing aircraft issues; Continued oversight of international carriers, including low cost carriers with different operating models, through existing regulatory framework and focused stakeholder engagement; and Introduction and application of new technologies and materials. These challenges and trends are set against global shifts in risk-based regulation development and the implementation of Safety Management Systems. In the Australian context, CASA will also oversight major infrastructure developments including at and around aerodromes and with the introduction of Project OneSKY in Australia, a joint project to combine military and civil air traffic management. Biography \tShane Carmody, Chief Executive Officer and Director of Aviation Safety Mr Shane Carmody is the Chief Executive Officer and Director of Aviation Safety of the Australian Government\u2019s safety regulator, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). Mr Carmody acted in the position from October 2016 to June 2017 and was appointed to the position permanently on 7 June. Previously, Mr Carmody was Deputy Secretary of the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development with responsibilities including the Office of Transport Security, Aviation and Airports, Local Government and Territories and the Western Sydney Airport project. Furthermore, he has extensive experience in policy, regulatory and business management and at different senior levels in the Australian Public Service since joining in 1989 including Deputy Secretary positions at the Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs and Department of Defence, previous Deputy CEO of CASA and Deputy President of the Repatriation Commission. Mr Carmody studied Bahasa Indonesia at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.\u00a0 He has a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Queensland, a Master of Business Administration from Monash University and is a graduate of the Australian Institute of Company Directors.

The conference brought together not only the authorities, but also leading CEOs from the European and Chinese aviation industry, as well as attracting more than 40 members of the domestic and international media. \tThe conference marks a new high in aviation ties between the European Union and China, which have steadily grown closer in recent years. In the presence of CAAC Administrator Feng Zhenglin and the European Commission Director General for Mobility and Transport Mr Henrik Hololei, leading members of the aviation community discussed progress on establishing a future Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreement (BASA) between China and the European Union. Trends defining the future of aviation safety were discussed in the different panels of the conference. Topics included implementing efficient safety management systems for maintenance, new technologies and developments in the field of aircraft navigation systems, as well as efforts to promote the wider use of rotorcraft in China. The plenary session discussed the benefits that a bilateral aviation safety agreement (BASA) may bring, especially in the context of ongoing negotiations between the European Union (EU) and China. In broad terms, a BASA would provide a mechanism for a more efficient validation and oversight progress for authorities and industry. uring the discussions the panelists from the EU, CAAC, EASA and as well as industry from Europe and China agreed that a BASA can create substantial benefits in terms of efficiency. Such a mode of cooperation would have the potential to bring clarity, thus promoting safety, the certainty provided by a BASA in terms of validation processes enhance their ability to estimate important parameters such as costs and time considerations, e.g. entry into service. Participants also found that beyond seeking compliance with rules, it is important to learn from each other through increasing cooperation for an equal and high level of safety between the EU and China. For the cooperation to be successful, participants agreed that developing mutual trust in the respective rules and procedures is important. The EU and China will continue their efforts to agree on a BASA in the near future. \t\u00a0 Panel Discussion on Aircraft Navigation Systems Panel members discussed developments in airborne technologies and explored their impact on air traffic management and aircraft navigation systems. As the regulator in China, CAAC explained their roadmap for the implementation of these new technologies. \tCurrently, there are about 3,000 civilian aircraft in use in China. The total fleet is growing quickly with one aircraft entering the market every day. Every new Airbus aircraft is equipped with ADS-B technology and about 1,500 aircraft in the market are manufactured by Airbus. \tAutomatic dependent surveillance \u2013 broadcast (ADS\u2013B) is a surveillance technology in which an aircraft determines its position via satellite navigation and periodically broadcasts it, enabling it to be tracked. The information can be received by air traffic control ground stations as a replacement for secondary radar. It can also be received by other aircraft to provide situational awareness and allow self-separation. \tA technology upgrade for better air navigation is needed, since China has no complete radar coverage over its territory. Especially the western parts and provinces of China lack radar coverage due to geographic conditions, which include some important air routes such as those leading from the Pearl River Delta to the Northwest Chinese province of Xinjiang. \tThe CAAC Flight Standards Department has published a roadmap for implementation of ADS-B in all civilian aircraft over the next three years. According to CAAC, the current number of civilian aircraft equipped with the technology is already above 80%. Major investments in ADS-B ground stations are planned for the same period and European companies such as Thales are ready to support the process of building up and implement this technology. Panel Discussion on General Aviation Rulemaking and Oversight \tThe panel members discussed general aviation rulemaking, oversight and civil helicopter operations in Europe and China as a unique form of transport. This included recent and future developments, the role of the manufacturer in achieving the appropriate safety level, understanding the risk environment, certification specifications, regulations from the operator\u2019s point of view, as well as the development of helicopter operations in China, specifically for Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS). \tThe general aviation sector is growing in China and HEMS operations are beginning to emerge. CAAC highlighted their commitment in terms of developing the policy that will facilitate GA operations and specifically HEMS. To that effect CAAC aims to put in place proportionate GA rules. The development of HEMS is a priority due to its added value for the society. European participants pledged their support for these efforts as Europe has a long-standing HEMS experience. The HEMS sector could therefore be a good starting point for productive cooperation on developing a strong regulatory framework that will enable and facilitate helicopter services in China. The Conference not only brought together the leadership of CAAC, EASA and key stakeholders from the aviation industry but also provided an excellent opportunity to tighten bilateral aviation relations between Europe and China. As a testament of the strong relationship between the two authorities, a Joint Statement on Cooperation between CAAC and EASA was signed by EASA Executive Director Mr Patrick Ky and CAAC Deputy Administrator Mr Li Jian. The Statement reiterated their commitment to aviation safety by continuously sharing information and best practices on organisational and technical developments in the respective aviation safety systems as well as on-going information and data exchange to further improve aviation safety in China, Europe and beyond. \tAs Mr Ky pointed out in his concluding remarks: the Conference and accompanying discussions between Administrator Mr Feng and Director General Mr Hololei contributed to the convergence of views on aviation developments and cooperation between the EU and China. The friendly relations greatly compliment technical and business interests and cooperation across all stakeholders in the aviation industry. \tFurther underlining the success of the 1st CAAC-EASA Aviation Safety Conference, Mr Ky and Mr Jian agreed to establish a tradition of bi-annual conferences, the next one to be organised in 2019 in Europe. The Safety Conference was supported by the EU-China Aviation Partnership Project (APP). APP is an initiative funded by the European Union and implemented by EASA and CAAC, with the aim of strengthening cooperation between the EU and China at an official and authority level linking technical cooperation with policy dialogue. This is reflected in the project's objective of strengthening the economic partnership between the EU and China in the civil aviation domain.

GAMA has grown continuously from its founding in 1970.\u00a0 Originating as a US-based organisation created by the main fixed-wing GA manufacturers at the time, it has evolved into a global association with member companies spread across five continents.\u00a0 In Europe alone we have companies with primary bases in France, the UK, Slovenia, Germany, Italy, Poland, Austria, Switzerland and Luxembourg \u2013 not to mention the footprint of these and other member companies across EU Member States.\u00a0 It\u2019s often overlooked that we bring together airframe manufacturers from both fixed-wing and rotorcraft, as well as the leading avionics, engines, simulator manufacturers as well as large Maintenance Repair and Overhaul companies.\u00a0 We also recently created a new GAMA membership category for companies that have yet to certify their aviation products, to bring together the exciting world of electric and hybrid-propulsion as well as technological innovation such as flight automation. What is your relationship with EASA and other regulators in general? GAMA has been a strong advocate of EASA from its start. Our staff of 18 women and men work with EASA to provide a single, constructive voice to articulate the views and expertise of GA manufacturing and beyond.\u00a0 Our European activities are managed by our dedicated team in GAMA\u2019s Brussels office; bringing together experts from GAMA\u2019s global staff and membership.\u00a0 This means there are GAMA reps in Cologne on almost a weekly basis to support discussions on certification, validation, rulemaking and broader strategy, which involves GA.\u00a0 We try to take a holistic look at how rules impact everything from light GA, up to large business jets and rotorcraft; spanning from the development of new safety products, to the operational environment for both the commercial and non-commercial world.\u00a0 We do similar work with bodies such as ICAO, ANAC Brazil, the US FAA and Transport Canada.\u00a0 We see great potential in the ability for these regulators to further harmonise rules and to avoid duplication of oversight.\u00a0 A lot of our emphasis is on the development and realisation of the benefits brought about through bilateral and multilateral safety cooperation.\u00a0 One of the most exciting examples of this kind of cooperation is happening right now: the forthcoming re-write of the existing CS-23 certification rules for GA aeroplanes.\u00a0 EASA\u2019s role in ensuring the cooperation of the leading global authorities to forge a common framework \u2013 working alongside all interested industry partners \u2013 holds immense potential to rapidly bring new aircraft and safety technologies to international markets.\u00a0 People may not yet realise how much benefit these new flexible rules can bring to almost all aspects of the GA community, and attract more people into flying overall.\u00a0 That\u2019s the ultimate reward for our shared efforts. What do you think about the latest measures to support GA from the European Aviation Safety Agency, compiled under the so-called EASA GA roadmap? The GA Roadmap is a key component in making rules work for a community as diverse as GA.\u00a0 It has been a crucial step to have all sides acknowledge that existing rules have weighed too heavily on this community, and come together to address them.\u00a0 Continued political support for this initiative is vital: EASA staff and stakeholders are working together well to address issues from the ground-up.\u00a0 Now we need to see the practical application of these proportionate rules, and we look to all Member States to follow-through on their shared commitment to implement these changes without delay. The challenge lies in ensuring the consistent, unambiguous application of these new lighter rules.\u00a0 The overall concept of the appropriate level of safety stands to benefit all the different levels of GA, and is thankfully reflected in the future EASA Basic Regulation.\u00a0 That\u2019s the future of effective rulemaking. What other tools play a key role in General Aviation in improving safety and where do you think EASA can most help? Rules form only a part of a successful safety culture.\u00a0 One other key area that GAMA is keen to see addressed is the lack of current GA data analysed at European-level.\u00a0 Right now, the statistics collected by Member States are not systematically pooled in a way that the Agency or other appropriate bodies can use to help understand and address the root cause of incidents and accidents.\u00a0 Experience shows us that regulators can focus their finite resources on the right issues if they are able to monitor trends in GA activities.\u00a0 Without basic pan-European analysis of data, such as aggregate aircraft, licenses and hours where possible, we can\u2019t really see how well rules are working and what is happening to this sector overall.\u00a0 We are hopeful the current update of the Basic Regulation will begin to address this blind spot.\u00a0 In addition, the recent development of EASA\u2019s Collaborative Analysis Groups (CAGs) is a very positive move towards a data-driven analysis to address safety priorities.\u00a0 We need all sides to come on board to make these efforts a success. \u00a0 Biography \tPeter Bunce, President & CEO In April 2005, Peter (Pete) Bunce became President and CEO of the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA), the international general aviation manufacturer association, when he retired from the United States Air Force. During his 26 year Air Force career, Pete was Director of the Air Force Congressional Budget and Appropriations Liaison and flew F-15s and A-10s, while commanding several large operational fighter units. Among many awards received in his career he was inducted as one of the seventy Living Legends of Aviation in January 2010. \tPete is an active pilot with experience in civil piston, turboprop and business jet aircraft, as well as military fighter and training aircraft. \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "easa_category": "EASA Newsletter: On Air article", "url": "https://www.easa.europa.eu/newsroom-and-events/news/interview-pete-bunce-president-ceo-gama"}, {"id": "EASA_NEWS_0206", "date": "2017-05-08", "title": "General Aviation Roadmap Update 2017 ", "text": " We are moving on! EASA established a few years ago some commitments about better and lighter regulation for General Aviation.\u00a0 There was an urgent need for a change on the GA community. Aiming to ease the GA segment of unnecessary regulatory burden, and in taking a proportionate and risk-based approach to rules, we can now present a number of tangible results in various topics from the last 3 years: 1) Flying schools & private pilot training: The requirements applicable to Approved Training Organisations (ATO) have been found too demanding for small GA training providers mainly run by private flying clubs or even private individuals. EASA has taken these concerns on board and has developed new rules to make life easier for training organisations in GA. In accordance with the new Part-DTO (Declared Training Organisation), training providers for Light Aircraft Pilot Licence (LAPL) and Private Pilot Licence (PPL) will no longer need a prior approval of their training organisations. Instead of this, they will just need to declare the establishment of the training organisation to the competent authority. Operations and training manuals, as known from approved training organisations (ATOs), will not be needed. The new Part-DTO will grant significant alleviations for the GA training domain and is expected to enter into force by April 2018. 2) Instrument Flying Rules (IFR) Easier access of General Aviation pilots to Instrument Flying Rules (IFR) flying is considered a high priority measure that will improve safety and utility of GA flying. The NPA (Notice of Proposed Amendment) 2016-14 was published in November 2016 and proposes the introduction of a \u2018Basic Instrument Rating (BIR)\u2019, which is a qualification to fly in Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), but based on more proportionate requirements when compared to the traditional instrument rating. EASA is aiming for a modular \u2013 less prescriptive - training for GA pilots and the BIR is tailored to their needs. 3) Balloons and Sailplanes Air operations with balloons and sailplanes, commercial and non-commercial, were initially addressed by the Air OPS Regulation (Air Operations Regulation (EU) N\u00b0 965/2012). Affected EASA stakeholders highlighted the complexity of the regulatory framework. Consequently, EASA took those parts back to the drawing board with the aim of working together with the two communities in order to produce stand-alone regulations for commercial or non-commercial operations of balloons or sailplanes. The draft Regulation on air operations with balloons has been finalised and is currently undergoing the adoption process. The work on the Regulation covering air operations with sailplanes was started in 2016 and EASA plans to publish its Opinion by mid-2017. 4) Aerial Work (SPO) in Europe On 21 April 2017, European rules addressing aerial work (or so-called specialised operations - SPO) with aeroplanes and helicopters came into effect in all 32 EASA states (28 EU Member States plus Iceland, Lichtenstein Norway and Switzerland).\u00a0 Specialised operations (SPO) or Aerial work means any operation other than commercial air transport (CAT) where the aircraft is used for specialised activities such as: agriculture, construction, photography, surveying, observation and patrol, aerial advertisement, etc. Part-SPO applies to all commercial specialised air operations with aeroplanes and helicopters with complex and non-complex aircraft. It also applies to non-commercial specialised air operations with complex aeroplanes and complex helicopters. For most specialised operations there is no need for a prior approval from the competent authority. Instead the operator only needs to declare its activity to the competent authority in the Member State in which they have their principal place of business. After declaring the activity, the SPO operator can immediately start operation. A prior authorisation from the competent authority is only foreseen for some high-risk commercial specialised operations. Therefore, Member States will have to provide an information on which specialised operations are considered to be high-risk. 5) Part-M Light Owners of light aircraft can get prepared for the improvements \u2013 Part-M Light in its full extent (Phase 1 and 2) has already been voted favourably by the European Member States and is currently undergoing the adoption process by the European Commission, expected to be completed by the end of 2017. Key deliverables are: Based on the Minimum Inspection Programme (MIP), owners of light aircraft (aeroplanes up to 2730 Kg, other ELA2 - European Light Aircraft \u2013 planes and helicopters up to 4 occupants and 1200 Kg) can write their own maintenance programme. There is no need to have the maintenance programme reviewed by your Civil Aviation Authority or by a Continuing Airworthiness Management Organisation (CAMO). Any independent EASA-licensed engineer can do the annual inspection. Possibility for the pilot / owner to defer defects. Guidance for Time Between Overhaul (TBO) extensions. Combined approval (Part CAO) for small organisations to manage (former CAMO) and do maintenance (replacement of Part-M subpart F) within one approval. Part-M Light simplifies existing maintenance rules, and offers a less prescriptive and burdensome approach to maintenance programmes, airworthiness reviews, defects deferments and TBO extensions. It also provides more privileges for pilot, owner, independent mechanics and small maintenance organisations. 6) Standard changes & repairs (CS-STAN) The Agency issued the first set of standard changes and repairs (CS-STAN) with ED Decision 2015/016, reducing maintenance and operating costs for the following aircraft: Aeroplanes of 5 700 kg Maximum Take-Off Mass (MTOM) or less, Rotorcraft of 3 175 kg MTOM or less, Sailplanes, powered sailplanes, balloons and airships as defined in ELA1 or ELA2 (European Light Aircraft categories). CS-STAN makes changes, repairs and upgrades of and to light aircraft easier, quicker and less costly since there is no approval required. The safety catch for these changes and repairs is the release and involvement of the appropriately licensed mechanic. In some cases, CS-STAN allows the fitting of non-certified equipment to certified aeroplanes. CS-STAN will be further regularly amended on the basis of lessons learnt and proposals submitted by affected stakeholders, as well as industry technological innovations which can bring safety benefits in a cost-efficient manner. 7) Industry Standards: the re-organisation of CS-23 EASA NPA (Notice of Proposed Amendment) 2016-05, introducing objective rules supported by consensus standards, was published in June 2016. It follows the same logic as the new Federal Aviation Administration Part-23 rule that was published in December 2016. The EASA Certification Specifications will be replaced by objective and design-independent requirements for CS-23 aircraft: The new CS-23 concept \u2013 with more involvement by industry - will cover the current CS-23 scope and that of CS-VLA simple two-seater aeroplanes Therefore new designs would not be hampered by detailed prescriptive rules The design-specific details for both CS-23 and CS-VLA will be captured in industry standards that will become Acceptable Means of Compliance (AMC) to CS-23 Introduction of new technologies or safety-enhancing features becomes part of the industry standards development, and therefore will not be subject to the current slow rulemaking process. Results: Lower certification costs for applicants Better up-to-date industry standards 8) Simplified entry levels for small low risk aircraft It is the intention to drastically simplify the airworthiness system for the low end of GA with small aircraft and low risk operation by developing simplified entry levels into the EASA system in a 2 phased approach:\u00a0 On the long term, it is foreseen to apply a risk based approach and to use qualified entities and user organisations for oversight, or practically combine organisational approvals while relying on industry standards endorsed by EASA.For these changes to happen, more flexibility for GA needs to be allowed in the Basic Regulation. Part-21 - which contains the airworthiness procedures - can only be changed when the Basic Regulations has been amended. On the short term, in spring 2017, new acceptable means of compliance (AMC) for small companies applying for a Production Organisation Approval (POA) are being developed by EASA. These AMC focus on showing that the actual produced aircraft, engine or propeller are in accordance with the approved design. \u00a0There will be less procedures and organisational checks. The AMC will be accompanied by specific templates facilitating an easier and faster certification process. 9) EASA administrative validation of the FAA Basic Specific Type certificate (STC) What exactly is an EASA administrative validation of FAA Basic STCs? It is a simplification of the EASA validation process for those cases where the US STC Holder of a FAA STC classified as Basic is unwilling or unable (orphaned STC) to apply for EASA validation. This new approach foresees that an application can be made by the owner/operator of the aircraft to EASA and that the validation will be limited to a single specific serial number applied for by the CAMO (Continuing Airworthiness Maintenance Organisation) or the aircraft owner/operator. \u00a0 ", "easa_category": "EASA Newsletter: On Air article", "url": "https://www.easa.europa.eu/newsroom-and-events/news/general-aviation-roadmap-update-2017"}, {"id": "EASA_NEWS_0207", "date": "2017-05-08", "title": "On Air, Issue 15: General Aviation - Editorial", "text": " General Aviation (GA) is among EASA\u2019s top priorities. The Agency has dedicated a large amount of resources and effort to develop simpler, lighter and better rules for GA. In partnership with the national aviation authorities, EASA created in 2014 the roadmap for Regulation of General Aviation (known as the GA Roadmap) as a contribution to a safer European aviation system. The Agency aims at bringing positive change to the GA community by simplifying existing regulations where possible, introducing flexible measures where necessary and developing safety promotion to address safety risks when rules are not necessary. The task to develop simpler, lighter and better rules for GA will take time to be completed and it cannot be done by a single party.\u00a0 It can only be the result of a series of coordinated and harmonized actions from EASA, the European Commission, Member States, National Aviation Authorities, but also by operators, private pilots, flying clubs and associations. During this year\u2019s edition of AERO, the biggest GA trade fair in Europe, held in Friedrichshafen, Germany, EASA presented several strategic key objectives of the GA Roadmap which have already been reached: alleviations for training schools and better access to Instrument Flying for GA pilots, the stand-alone OPS rules for Balloons and Sailplanes, the single set of rules for specialized operations, simplified maintenance rules and specifications for changes and repairs. EASA has also re-written CS-23 certification rules for small aircraft that aim to enable innovative solutions enhancing safety and reducing time and costs. And it was not all about rules: I handed over the type certifications for BlackShape TC 115 and Socata TBM 910 and the Charter on Safety of non-commercial GA flights with light aircraft with the flight sharing companies COAVMI, Flyt.Club and Wingly. The size of the show, the number of very innovative products, composite materials everywhere, electrical and hybrid propulsion, avionics and affordable glass cockpit solutions are a sign of how dynamic the GA market is.

These principles should be taken into account by the airlines when they perform their safety risk assessment. PEDs containing lithium batteries are considered as dangerous goods. When carried by passengers, they should preferably be carried in the passenger cabin. This would enable the crew to react quickly in case an incident involving such PED occurs. When the carriage of PEDs in the cabin is not allowed, it leads to a significant increase of the number of PEDs in the cargo compartment.

CERT-EU\u2019s mission is to enhance the security of the information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure of all EU institutions, bodies and agencies (hereinafter referred to as its \u2018constituents\u2019).\u00a0 It supports incident prevention, detection, mitigation and response by acting as the cyber-security information exchange and incident response coordination hub for its constituents. \tOur goal is to help our constituents to avoid being breached by cyber-attacks and in case they would be compromised nevertheless to detect and remediate incidents as quickly as possible. \tOur work in prevention consists in drawing lessons from relevant past incidents in the constituency or the broader community into best practices in hardening, configuration management and awareness raising to mitigate the risk of cyber-attacks. Prevention advice is made available through white papers, advisories and reports. Many of these can be found on our website www.cert.europa.eu. \tIn terms of detection and response, we try to keep abreast of the most relevant and recent threats to our constituents, convert this knowledge into technical detection rules and share these with our constituents. We also report on important trends in threats, techniques and adversaries to inform technical and senior management, and help them to take precautionary measures. \tEven though CERT-EU has 30 highly trained staff at its disposal, its work would not be possible without having a strong cooperation with similar teams in the Member States and with the best experts in the commercial world. On 10 February 2017 CERT-EU signed a Memorandum of cooperation with EASA, what does this partnership imply? Under the agreement, CERT-EU will provide to EASA expertise and tools to help setting up threat information sharing systems for EASA's stakeholders. Both organisations will also share with each other threat information of a general nature or specific sector allowing them to alert their respective communities on new risks, issuing advice on prevention or providing overviews of important trends in the cyber-threat landscape. \tThis newly forged cooperation allows the two organisations to join forces and build on each other's strengths. With the help of CERT-EU, EASA will be able to concentrate on specialized aviation cybersecurity components and services while benefitting from CERT-EU's insights and products in terms of general threats.\u00a0 \tTogether, this collaborative effort will result in improved protection against intentional and malicious cyber-attacks on the critical infrastructure of air transport, creating a more secure Europe.\u00a0\u00a0 \tThe cooperation directly benefits the EU citizen: now, the added value for the traveler will be a more robust security infrastructure.\u00a0 It directly supports the European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection, as reducing the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure and increasing their resilience is one of the major objectives of the EU. In addition, this cooperative agreement will facilitate the work undertaken by the Directive on security of Network and Information Systems (the NIS Directive), which scope is to ensure a high common level of network and information security across the Union. What do you expect from this cooperation with EASA? I expect this cooperation to help boosting the collaboration and information sharing in the aviation sector to help mitigating the cyber risks in this critical infrastructure. In my view, it will provide added value to the aviation industry and also foster the voluntary cooperation between peers in a trusted environment.\u00a0 \tI also hope that this cooperation will provide CERT-EU with new insights on new threats, techniques and vulnerabilities which could help us to provide a better service to our constituents.\u00a0 What are the next steps? The technical work to design and implement tools and infrastructure for EASA has already started. EASA will also make available one of its staff members to work within CERT-EU's team to foster a seamless interface between the general threat intelligence work done at CERT-EU and the more specialised and sector-specific work at EASA. \tInformation products like advisories, newsletters and threat landscape reports on cyber-security will also be designed, produced and disseminated to EASA's stakeholders in the coming months. \tRest assured that the signature of the agreement will not be just another piece of paper!

The EASA \u2018Cybersecurity roadmap\u2019 presented in 2015 has been considered as basis for implementing a cybersecurity framework for aviation \u2013 taking into account the principles laid in the new European ATM Master Plan and in the EU Aviation Strategy- acting as support to the European Commission, EASA Member States, EASA and industry work. The memorandum includes the areas of responsibility of both parties. On the one hand, CERT-EU agrees to provide the appropriate and secure IT infrastructure services as well as the cybersecurity tools and threat management services needed for the development of cyber-secure components in aviation. On the other hand, EASA will provide the analyst resources and technical expertise for the coordination of the ECCSA. Both agree to execute the Technical Roadmap within the given milestones for this purpose and maintain close collaboration between their analysts\u2019 teams. What will ECCSA do? ECCSA will primarily serve as an information sharing and management platform, a key enabler for implementing a resilient aviation cyberspace. ECCSA will provide secure means for aviation stakeholders to exchange domain relevant cybersecurity information, such as vulnerabilities, i.e. weakness that can be used for malicious purposes, as well as events and incidents that might be worth sharing with the aviation community. The ECCSA\u2019s operational team of analysts will provide additional inputs to the information shared by the participants, with the aim to facilitate the creation and the management of an aviation cybersecurity threats knowledge and risk picture. Furthermore, ECCSA intends to assist its members in the successful prevention and response to cyber security incidents. For this purpose, the centre will also concentrate on cybersecurity initiatives to promote awareness and will organise to provide in the future further services in the range of reactive, proactive and preventive measures to its stakeholders in accordance with their needs. Which is the role of EASA in ECCSA? EASA is currently supporting the foundation of ECCSA by making available both the IT infrastructure and the necessary operational team for the provision of cybersecurity services, but the Agency will guarantee the ECCSA independence by participating to the centre governance at the same level of other stakeholders. The provision of EASA\u2019s expertise and resources to roll out and maintain ECCSA should make its core services widely accessible and at no cost for the participants.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EU Information sharing landscape Who will be its members? The participation to ECCSA will be voluntary and so it will be the information sharing. The organisations that will join ECCSA as member will become part of its Constituency and a number of them will be involved in the governance in order to ensure that the cyber security centre will be independently managed by its members. With regards to eligibility, in principle all stakeholders (i.e. small, medium to big manufactures, airlines, research organisations, etc.) relevant for the safety and security of European Civil Aviation may apply for ECCSA membership, assured to meet applicable security selection criteria. In particular the initial group of ECCSA founding members should be representative of the following stakeholders: Aviation manufacturers: aircraft, parts, avionic systems or ground systems, etc. Aviation organisations: airlines, maintenance repair organisations, aviation communication services providers, etc. Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP): national and cross-border ANSPs. European Commission, EASA, CERT-EU, ENISA, National Aviation Authorities and governmental Civil Aviation institutions etc. A \u2018Pilot Phase\u2018 to enrol the ECCSA\u2019s funding Members will be launched soon. Which are its benefits? The benefit for members will consist of a secure information exchange and aviation cyber-intelligence sources platform. This platform will provide awareness of attacks and, on demand, to have operational means to face cyber security threats. The expected benefits for EASA and the European regulators will be to obtain information about cyber security threats and within its remit to improve the safety of air transport. In addition, it is fundamental for ECCSA\u2019s constitution and its operations to establish precise rules for dissemination and information exchange amongst members.\u00a0 For this purpose it is planned to use a Traffic Light Protocol (TLP). TLP is a set of designations used to ensure that sensitive information is shared with the correct audience. It employs colours associated to different sensitivity levels and the corresponding sharing authorisation to be applied by the recipients.

This SIB contains general recommendations regarding the transport by air, as cargo and by passengers, of damaged, recalled, defective or potentially hazardous lithium batteries, including those contained in equipment. The difference between this new SIB and the previous one is that the recommendations contained in the SIB 2017-01 do no longer refer specifically to Samsung Galaxy Note7 devices. EASA has continued to monitor the situation with the Samsung Galaxy Note7 devices and noted that there are no recent reports of fire related incidents or accidents involving these devices on board of the aircraft. EASA has also continued to be in contact with representatives of Samsung Electronics Co. who updated the Agency regularly regarding the measures initiated by them in response to this situation. Based on the latest information provided by Samsung Electronics Co., the Agency noted that: over 94% of all devices originally sold on the European market have been successfully recalled and 96.5% worldwide by 02 February 2017 on 31 January 2017, Samsung Electronics Co. released in Europe an update to the software that would prevent the device from charging and would eliminate their ability to work as mobile devices (http://www.samsung.com/uk/note7exchange/) The Agency also took note of the update on January 12, 2017 of the Emergency/Prohibition Order issued in October 14, 2016 by the FAA (Order No. FAA-2016-9288), which prohibited the transportation of any Samsung Galaxy Note 7 device by the passengers, in carry-on baggage, in checked baggage, or as cargo. The Amended Emergency Restriction/Prohibition Order removes the requirement for air carriers to alert passengers to the prohibition against air transport of a Samsung Galaxy Note7 device, in particular, immediately prior to boarding. The prohibition for its transport, however, remains.

It is used amongst others as a mode of transport for emergency medical services, for VIPs, offshore operations, aerial work and for military activities. The cooperation between EASA, the industry, manufacturers and operators is the key to success for a safer helicopter environment. \tThe rotorcraft industry is constantly changing: new technologies (e.g. tilt rotors) and new types of operation (e.g. wind farms) offer new perspectives and also new challenges. The momentary decline of the offshore industry is also part of the equation to be taken into account. Among the new areas which EASA is exploring are: the evolution of the rotorcraft regulatory requirements in an international collaborative context, the expectations of industry and the EASA way towards a more risk based approach. Also, staff exchange schemes\u00a0with the industry are fostered in order to achieve higher synergy, trust, mutual recognition and understanding. A specific Rotorcraft Sectorial Committee was recently created and kicked off on the 24-25 January 2017. The group will provide industry inputs into the EASA safety risk management process. The Committee is composed of 25 high level representatives from the European Rotorcraft community and is one of the new EASA stakeholders advisory bodies. The development of the rotorcraft sector in regions of the world such as Asia and the cooperation activities undertaken by EASA over there are also pillars of the EASA model.

Innovation is key to the capability to stay competitive, to play a leading role and for future overall growth of a company as well as the aviation sector in general. What you mentioned are clear examples of the three different paths of rotary-wing product and technology development we\u2019ve been walking through for years now. Leonardo\u2019s been investing to develop new technologies, concepts, equipment, solutions and tools, demonstrated via existing test-beds or incubators and then installed into all new products while aiming at reducing time-to-market and deliver real benefits, truly enhanced capabilities and ever increasing levels of safety. More and new capabilities, more affordably and with greater safety is what the operators and the market are looking for. You have a growing International presence in all continents, how do you see the evolution of the rotorcraft market? Although the whole rotorcraft industry has experienced varying trends across geographies, segments and applications in recent years, it is clear to everybody that the need for vertical lift capabilities is strong and it represents a fundamental transport and utility asset to carry out missions or access confined areas impossible for or unreachable by other means. The value of the rotorcraft business and technology is such that many new comers from emerging markets and fast-developing nations are trying to access this sector and challenge the established presence of traditionally strong players. This opens new scenarios for both competition and cooperation but also new opportunities to perform a quantum leap forward in capabilities, both in terms of conventional helicopters and all new designs and concepts such as tiltrotors, compound and unmanned vehicles and all the relevant features and technologies. Furthermore, competitiveness more and more means an OEM can\u2019t just merely offer a platform. It must develop and deliver total capability solutions combining a capable and safe product with comprehensive through-life-cycle support packages comprising advanced training and cost control. Staying at the forefront of breakthrough technology is therefore crucial to shape the future of the rotorcraft arena as leaders, not just as followers. And this is something relevant not just to the industry and companies but to nations and organizations such as the European Union, for example.\u00a0 How do you expect the regulatory framework to adapt to the new challenges coming up with the new products and new markets? Which areas would you see more regulatory support is needed? We believe regulatory authorities should devote any possible effort to allow, reasonably and safely, the market, the aircraft operators and the service end-users to maximize the benefits given by any new capability enabler. We do expect also to get some benefits from latest certifications which are expanding safety\u00a0threshold compared to old models. Rules and infrastructures need to evolve to align to the new platforms, performance and navigation/mission technologies if we want innovation to step from mere prototyping to real service and generate true benefits. The Helicopter Division is co-leader of the \u2018Green Rotorcraft Integrated Technology Demonstrator\u2019 project, under \u201cClean Sky\u201d initiative, what is this project about? The Green Rotorcraft Integrated Technology Demonstrator, which adds to the Clean Sky 2 initiative where we\u2019re focusing on the development of a Next Generation Tilt Rotor, aims at designing, testing and validating a range of rotorcraft technologies and systems allowing significant emission abatement in line with the ambitious and pioneering objectives of the well-known European initiative for the future of aviation. Leonardo is devoting efforts mainly in the fields of noise reduction and efficiency, in particular through active rotors, more electric technologies and low noise flight paths. The shape of rotor blades is a major influence on the overall rotorcraft performance, vibration and noise. Active rotors enables the geometry of the blade to change in flight, providing a larger design space for optimisation. The Active Gurney flap approach we\u2019re focusing in the framework of the Green Rotorcraft project is to provide rotor performance enhancements (3-5%). Leonardo is then actively exploiting opportunities for increasingly more powerful, compact and lighter electrical systems including batteries, generators, motors with new technologies, and preparing for the future integration. For the Green Rotorcraft initiative we\u2019re investigating electric tail rotor drive technologies which can deliver several benefits such as reducing the number of parts, improving mean-time between maintenance, permitting rpm variation for power saving in cruise and heading control, allowing excellent power surge and saving rotor inertia for autorotation. Furthermore, for overall noise abatement we\u2019ve been studying and assessing flight path optimization to minimize noise and pollutant emissions and developing procedures, for example\u00a0 through VFR/IFR flight tests with 30% reduced noise footprint and tiltrotor-air traffic system coupled simulation. It is worth mentioning that not only we\u2019ve been progressing significantly this year in all of those fields, but also we\u2019re already supplying to the market some of those capabilities such as in the case of the AW169 all-electric landing gear or our GrandNew and AW Family models capable of advanced navigation and combined with mission planning systems allowing minimized environmental impact and greater efficiency.\u00a0\u00a0 EASA has established cooperation agreements with a number of international partners (FAA, TCCA, etc.).

The rotary-wing sector will much benefit from these agreements if they will allow for a mutual, simultaneous recognition of type/kits certification and approvals as we\u2019ve already seen happening in commercial airliners. There might be differences at operational level between some authorities, for example for the use of single-engine helicopters for commercial air transport operations. Nevertheless, keeping a channel of communication between authorities for an open discussion on how best to achieve safety objectives has to be welcomed. Industry can have a key role in this frame, bringing its \u201con-field experience\u201d of the design, manufacturing and support to operators. Industry can also play an important role to contribute to rotorcraft development and entering into commercial service. We are now close to the introduction of the AW609 as the first tiltrotor with civil certification in the transport category. We believe it will revolutionize the way the market looks at vertical flight, as it will further extend its capabilities in most segments where helicopters are used today. We are actively working with the international civil aviation regulatory community to ensure the current aviation legislation is adapted to allow the capabilities of the tiltrotor concept to be fully exploited. From what we see, the response of the civil aviation community worldwide is very favourable to this approach. In line with this philosophy, within a working group made up by major international rotorcraft OEMs that have joined together on a voluntary basis, we are also contributing to reviewing Part 27/29 certification rules for helicopters and specifications to make certification processes more efficient and seamless, favor innovation, while preserving adequate level of safety, the first priority of all aviation stakeholders.

This attracted about 240 delegates from all around the world, plus a number of participants and presenters from EASA. \tThe preparation started well early, in spring last year and was quite special this time, n \u2013 EASA would have for the first time hosted the symposium in its new building. Not an easy task, but the efforts were crowned by high level of satisfaction from the participants, and we are all grateful to the organizer, Paola Galmarini, and the colleagues who assisted her. The Symposium is lectures, presentations and discussions on topics of high actuality, it is people connecting and talking to each other about their business. It is a great opportunity for EASA and the industry to know each other better, to meet and to speak, to listen and to understand real industry concerns. This year we decided to run a number of parallel sessions: after the opening common session, the attendees had a choice from certification and operational topics plus a specific seminar on transmission safety. Needless to say that those topics encountered very high interest from the delegates. Mentioning all the presentations would take long, a few examples could suffice to give the flavour of the event. EASA presented the work being progressed by a joint aviation rulemaking advisory committee (ARAC) working group in which it participants aimed to introduce bird strike resistant elements (one for all, the cockpit windshield) in the Part 27 helicopters, which are limited to a maximum take-off weight within 7.000 pounds. These lighter helicopters often have a large canopy windshield, and its strengthening, normally corresponding to a thickness increase, would bring unacceptable deformation to the outside visible scene, other than heavy weight penalisation. The significant increment of the bird population in different areas of Europe and the globe renders bird encounters more and more frequent, presenting an increasing threat in particular to helicopters, operating mostly at low altitude.\u00a0 The advent of new polymers, characterised by higher strength and easier manufacturing may bring a suitable solution to this kind of issues. \tA unique presentation on the same subject from Bell Helicopters, who provided a summary of their studies on bird strike simulation technologies, as opposed to actual bird strike tests which these where shown to well match, and the utilisation of simulation for certification purposes. It was fascinating and rewarding to get a number of lectures from the Federal Aviation Authorities (FAA) as evidence of mutual recognition and willingness to share experience working together in this symposium. Of extreme interest was their \u201cSafety Continuum\u201d draft policy: this is aimed at tailoring the safety requirements not only to the class of threat, but to newly identified classes of rotorcraft in the same Part 27 domain. FAA perceives that such differentiation has the potential of boosting safety of the lighter ones by facilitating introduction of cheaper, still useful, pieces of instrumentation that would be true life-savers in a number of scenarios. This is going to trigger plenty of interest and discussion in the aviation industry and the authorities. \tA specific event was the Transmission forum, magisterially run by our colleague Alastair Healy. The spring of 2016 was darkened by a terrible accident in Norway. While investigations are still ongoing, whatever the triggering cause, it was evident then that the main gearbox suffered a catastrophic failure. Helicopters are unique aerial vehicles and encompass a number of \u201ccritical\u201d parts, i.e. those parts the failure took place might create a catastrophic event; and one of the key assemblies of those parts is the main gearbox. These shall be designed, manufactured and maintained with the highest care, to ensure helicopter continue to be the safe vehicle they are and even safer in the future. A number of studies and researches are ongoing, on material properties, mechanical fracture technology and health and usage monitoring systems, and even completely innovative concepts for future drive systems on helicopter, Tilt Rotor and Hybrid aircraft. In addition, there were presentations and discussions about the current studies on pilot behaviour when facing technology (like eye tracking), about best practices in the offshore environment,\u00a0 on flotation stability systems in water and use of simulation, advanced navigation functions, hoist design in line with hoisting missions, ARAC \u201coccupant protection\u201d working group, rotorcraft airbags to improve crashworthiness, flight test techniques as well as certification in icing conditions, cooperation between EASA and CleanSky. But also standard operating procedures in Aerial Work, the development of operational rules for the new tilt rotor generation and a presentation of the new MI-38 Russian helicopter. At the end, lot of attention was generated by unmanned air vehicles/ Systems (UAV/UAS): their certification challenges and risk based approach. About 40 presentations, offering food for thoughts to many and in all different fields, and an exercise not closed with the Symposium but starting with it. Several topics had been identified that will deserve further attention like: \u2022 Maturity of rotorcraft regulations versus large airplanes regulations \t\u2022 pilot \u201cage 60\u201d \t\u2022 single engine IFR helicopters \t\u2022 drones challenges and potential risks to Rotorcraft Topics that will be further discussed and validated by the industry via their committees (e.g. the new Rotorcraft Sectorial Committee) for further elaboration by EASA and the Industry. \tThe Rotorcraft Symposium has once again proven to be the place where the Rotorcraft community gets together to listen and comment on the newest development of technology, on existing and incoming regulations, on certification and operations and any other topics in connection with them and their concrete needs. We are already thrilled by the idea of setting up the next edition allowing even more people to get access to this major European Rotorcraft event and rest reassured that it will continue to surprise you!

In line with this, the Commissioner for Transport and Mobility Violeta Bulc has therefore tasked EASA to become global leader in the area of aviation safety. The international work of EASA, which has always been a core element of our activities, could thus only intensify. The proposed new EASA Basic Regulation sets a framework for better coordination towards the International Civil Aviation Organization of the United Nations (ICAO) and foresees more flexibility when accepting third country certificates and concluding working arrangements. One of EASA\u2019s priorities is to ensure better recognition of regional aviation systems in the ICAO framework.

In 2013 he is appointed Vice President Engineering & Technology. The aviation industry is, today more than ever, a global business, operating beyond national or even regional frameworks. What are the main challenges for the industry in this respect, in particular with regards to safety? \tOne of the main challenges for industry is to demonstrate compliance with worldwide recognized airworthiness standards for safety management of our aeronautical products. This standard needs to be international and respected by all the actors of the commercial aviation community: It is important to apply same airworthiness rules all over the world, in China, Europe, Russia, US\u2026 and same safety and quality level with regards to design, manufacturing, repair or fleet support for a Type Certificate holder, a part manufacturer, a repair shop or an on-wing support organisation. How can the regulators support this international dimension of the industry, while ensuring the same, high level safety standards? \tAccording to me, the key words are Agency\u2019s certification/continued airworthiness support to the industry and worldwide recognized Airworthiness Regulation, harmonized with the main world Agencies. These are typical assignments for regulators with the objective to take into account the best technical experience, to focus certification rules on safety mandatory requirements while allowing more flexibility for the Manufacturer to demonstrate conformity to the rule. A good example of cooperation between industry and authorities has been provided through the certification of the new technology woven composite fan blade and case of the CFMI LEAP engines with the establishment, early in the game, of a shared vision of the needs in term of safety for the engine, in term of objectives for demonstration by analysis, similarities and tests, and in term of process capability to define adequate level of quality survey. How do you expect EASA\u2019s role at international level to evolve in the future? \tAeronautical products are now used all over the world, meaning that our engines are installed on many non-EU aircraft manufacturers (Boeing, COMAC, Sukhoi\u2026), in which countries the ICAO regulation requires local validation. Moreover, International cooperation between industrials is becoming the standard of many major recent aviation projects. In that frame, it is of prime importance for the EU industry that EASA establish Airworthiness Agreements with major Agencies to ease the Certification and Safety management at international level.

It implements these projects together with its European partners to address the full scope of aviation. It coordinates with other technical assistance providers such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to focus on efficient, practical and sustainable solutions.

The industry is growing rapidly but it is an innovation that does not comes from the traditional aviation. Many different types of drones are used for different purposes (surveillance, filming, transport, etc.) and it is not possible to cover all these applications with only one rule. The risks generated are also new: for example, who takes responsibilities when a 3rd party is damaged? What happens at the airspace level with potential collisions? Following the so-called Riga declaration in March 2015 which set the scene for the European approach to enable the opening of the drone market, we have reached a new milestone this week with the adoption of the Warsaw declaration in the way this promising market should be regulated. The declaration: noted the enormous potential of the drone services market with estimates ranging as high as one hundred billion euros in the coming years. urged the further development of this potential to support European Union (EU) competitiveness and global leadership. called for the swift development of a drone ecosystem that is simple to use, affordable, commercially and operationally friendly, yet capable of addressing all societal concerns such as safety, security, privacy and environmental protection. welcomed the progress being made towards a flexible framework of safety regulation at EU level based on the operation centric approach, and called for the safety rules to be kept simple, proportionate to the risk of the operation, performance-based, future-proofed, and based on global standards.

Drones, RPAS, UAVs\u2026 what is the correct term? And what is it exactly consider as an \u201cunmanned aircraft\u201d? \tI am afraid the correct regulatory term is Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). It has replaced UAV (Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles) and is the most general term. It indicates that the UAS is an aircraft and a system (the unmanned aircraft that flies; its command and control link and the control station). An unmanned aircraft is an aircraft without a pilot on board. Please note that this does not exclude to carry passengers. UAV includes RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aircraft System) which are controlled by a pilot and also autonomous aircraft. Drone is a term used by the general public and is equivalent to UAS. Drone refer to the noise the first UAV where making when in flight. When did it become a need to regulate this new type of aircraft? \tUAS have been used mostly by the military until\u00a0around 2010 when the multi-copter (4, 6, 8 electric engines)\u00a0appeared and enjoyed a very fast deployment in the civil world. Member States had to regulate to allow safe, secure, environmentally friendly operations which at the same time would reflect the concerns of privacy and data protection. As the multi-copters have a mass\u00a0far below 150kg, they are not today regulated at EU level. However, things are changing within the discussions on the new EASA Draft Basic Regulation, which will extend the EASA EU competence to all UAS except those used for State missions (e.g. Police, military, Coast Guards, etc.). It should be mention that a \u201c0pt-in\u201d provision has been included in the draft Basic Regulation that would allow a Member State to have such activities regulated at EU level. Can you explain to us in simple terms what the main components of the rules are? \tThe prototype rules are implementing an operation centric concept. Indeed the consequences of an incident are highly dependent of the environment in which the operations are conducted (e.g. over a city or over high seas). In order to facilitate the development of the UAS industry, the rules must be performance and risk based. Performance based is necessary not to freeze technology development that are very quick in the UAS domain. Risk-based is necessary to avoid over-burdening the Industry. The rules are addressing 3 categories of operations: open, specific and certified. The open category does not requires pre-approvals for the UAS, its remote pilot or the operator. The risk is minimized by a combination of operational limitations (e.g. flight below 150m; maximum mass 25kg, operations conducted in Visual Line of Sight) , of technological features (e.g. Geo-fencing: a feature that makes the UAV remains where it should be; electronic-identification, registration) and of competence for the remote pilot. The specific category requires an authorization from the National Aviation Authority based on a risk assessment of the operations being conducted. The specific category applies as soon as the operations are beyond the limits of the open category. As systematically performing risks assessment may be burdensome, a concept of standard scenarios applying to clearly identified operations (e.g. infrastructure inspections) is being developed: the standard scenarios is a pre-digested risk assessment which contains also the risk mitigating measures. So by following it, the operator can in some cases declares its activity or obtain in simple manner the Authority approval. Another option is for the operator to obtain an operator\u2019s certificate that will give it privileges to start operations or change its operations without authorization from the authority. Last but not least, the certified category would apply to complex operations with complex UAS and would be regulated in a comparable manner than manned aircraft (Type certificates; certificates of airworthiness, organizations approvals and licenses for the personnel).\u00a0 Why do you call your rules \u201cprototype rules\u201d? \tThey are called \"prototype regulations\" because we don\u2019t have the legal power to issue them. The regulation present a worked out example on how to implement the operation centric concept. They are actually not regulations. Feedback has been requested from Stakeholders and the prototype regulation will evolve into a Notice of Proposed Amendment (NPA) for the open and specific categories to be published end of March 2017. Prototype means also that they will further developed and improved having undergone the test of the comments (Around 600). What are the main risks you see associated to drones? \tThere are two main risks that need to be mitigated: hurting people on the ground and the collision with a manned aircraft. The first one is mitigated by fixing safe distance from people and by the use of an injury scale as one of the criteria to set-up sub-categories in the open category. The risk of collision is mitigated by geo-fencing and the creation by Member States of prohibited zones and limited access zones. The EASA has set up two task forces: one on geo-fencing and the other one on collision with manned aircraft. Reports of both task forces are available on our web-site. The report of the first one provides recommendations that will help further developing the concept of geo-fencing. The report of the second one will be used to develop a research programme to better understanding the mechanics of the impact In the future the development of Unmanned Aircraft Traffic Management systems will provide further improvements in this field too. Are you also regulating the military drones? \tAs explained above, the EASA is not competent for \u201cState operations\u201d. However, many UAS have a dual role. Therefore EASA is developing a path in\u00a0cooperation with the military to create synergies and avoid duplication. An example of such cooperation is our work with the European Defense Agency (EDA) with we , for example, exchange of information of risk assessment methods. The EASA intends to further\u00a0increase the cooperation with our military colleagues. When are your rules going to enter into force? \tAs mentioned already, the adoption by the Commission of our UAS rules depends first of the adoption by the European Parliament and Council of the changes to the Basic Regulation. This adoption should occur in 2017 and therefore our rules could be adopted in 2018.

They are also known as drones\u00a0by the general public. The word \"drone\" refer to the noise of the engine of the first generation of UAS.\u00a0From these days, as example,\u00a0the De Havilland Queen Bee derived from the Tiger Moth had already remote controls installed at the place occupied by the back seat. For quite a long time, UAS were used for military purposes as target aircraft or for reconnaissance and lately for precision attacks. The latter\u00a0gave them a bad image. Here some current\u00a0facts: A very fast civil development in Europe and elsewhere occurred since 2010. This is due to the emergence Multi-copter which has made UAS affordable for professional\u00a0but also for leisure activities. UAS are characterised by a great variety of external configurations: You may find rotorcraft, fixed wings, flapping wings, tilt rotor, airship and configurations that are mixing the previous ones. Their mode of propulsion\u00a0is also very variable: piston, turbine\u00a0or electric engines (using batteries, fuel cells or solar cells) are commonly found. Some are remotely piloted; some use a high degree of automation and in the future may be fully autonomous (e.g. the ability to learn and to decide) Finally the range of mass and size is very wide: the so called nano-drones have a weight of 10/20 grams or less. The heaviest UAS is the Global Hawk. It has a wing span comparable to the one of a Boeing 737. UAS are also used for a great variety of operations: Photography; news industry; movie industry; Data-collection: this is one of the main functions. A UAS is a data collector; Precision agriculture; Infrastructure inspection (Short and long distance); Very high altitude operation (above FL 600) as surrogate satellites (telecommunications and surveillance). Many actors are non-classical aviation actors: manufacturers, operators or service providers for small UAS are usually small and medium enterprises (SME). Other may belong to distribution industry such as Amazon or internet companies (Google and Facebook). Amazon is interested in urban distribution. Google and Facebook are more interested in extending the coverage of internet by using satellite surrogates. Large telecommunications companies such as Vodaphone and Nokia are investing in the UAS industry as data-collectors. The classical aviation manufacturers (Airbus, Boeing, Lockheed-Martin, Northrop-Grumman, Dassault) are producing larger UAS mostly for the military market. The market is in constant evolution: new aircraft; new software and new services are announced very frequently. The services market is the most important one with the highest potential for development. This combination of new technology; new business models and constant evolution of the UAS industry has led EASA to propose a safety regulatory framework with the following characteristics: Operation centric: there is no one on board of an UAS so the consequences of an incident are highly dependent of the operational environment (Airspace and overflown area); Performance and Risk based therefore with a key role for industry standards; performance based (e.g. regulating by objectives) is necessary to avoid freezing the technology. Risk based is necessary is order to not to overburdening the Industry. Ideally the risk could be seen as a continuum but for practical reasons we have created three categories: open, specific and certified; Relying on aviation regulation and EU product legislation (\u201cCE marking\u201d): as said above many actors are SME and are used for product legislation. Product legislation rely on essential requirements on the design of the product complemented by Industry standards. It also includes a system of market surveillance\u00a0 which allow to remove products from the market when they are\u00a0shown to be dangerous. Product legislation stops at putting objects on the market and therefore need to be complemented by aviation regulation for operational rules (e.g. limitations, pilot training). There are other challenges than safety that need to be addressed to ensure societal acceptance. EASA regulation may contribute to address them but for security and privacy we have no mandate: Security (UAS has been used to fly over sensitive areas or can become a weapon) Privacy and data-protection; UAS can fly over walls and ground barrier and therefore pose a new dimension to the privacy. Environmental issues The risks and challenges posed by UAS should not hide that they can save lives: sending an UAS to do an inspection of a structure is less risky than sending people. In emergency situations, UAS can deliver medications when roads are blocked. EASA activities: UAS are a priority for the EASA because of the significant implications of this industry on our society. Significant achievements have been made (e.g. prototype regulations; task forces on geo-fencing and collision with aircraft) supported by several workshops. The prototype regulation and the report of the two task forces may be found on the EASA web-site at the page civil drones. Cooperation and communications are fundamental with: Member States The UAS community; the model aircraft community, the manned aircraft aviation community EC especially DG\u2013MOVE and DG-GROW Other EU Agencies (e.g. EDA (European Defence Agency),\u00a0 SESAR Joint Undertaking (SJU)) International organisations such as ICAO and JARUS Our bilateral partners (FAA, ANAC and Transport Canada) Certification role is developing: On-going Certification of a fixed wing (Atlante from Airbus defence); of a rotorcraft (Schiebel) and of a tethered drone (electricity production); \t\t\u00a0-Special conditions such as system safety; ground control stations; flight controls have been published. They are based on JARUS or STANAG work Two recent applications for high altitude aircraft have been made; The possible validation of a US Unmanned Aircraft is being explored together with the FAA. EASA is also ready to cooperate with the relevant Authorities for certification of \u201cState\u201d Unmanned aircraft: UAS have quite often a dual use for example civil-military and synergies may be found in this cooperation. We are also preparing a formal Notice of Proposed Amendment (NPA) for the Open and Specific categories with the support of an expert group. The NPA should be published in March 2017. But Rulemaking is only one part of our work, it needs to be complimented by research and most important education and safety promotion. A bit of prospective Autonomous drones are under development and will be ultimately capable of learning and taking decisions: They could even fly in swarms Coexistence of manned actors and robotic actors will be a key issue Experience from automotive may be useful Airbus, Uber and others are developing the concept of flying taxis There will be people on board but they will be passengers They will share the urban airspace with delivery drones. This is only the beginning: Technology will enable new means to manage manned and unmanned traffic at low altitudes and in urban areas.

The objective of this so-called Notice of Proposed Amendment (NPA) is to provide a more accessible instrument rating for pilots holding non-commercial licences in general aviation. The NPA therefore proposes the introduction of a \u2018Basic Instrument Rating (BIR)\u2019, which is a qualification to fly in Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), but based on more proportionate requirements when compared to the traditional instrument rating, and tailored to the need of GA pilots. This is one of the key initiatives for meeting the Agency\u2019s road map and GA community\u2019s objectives. As an innovation, the key principles for the BIR are as follows: Training that is entirely competency-based. There will be no minimum hours requirement set for the BIR. All the required competencies that a GA pilot needs for an IFR flight are analysed and grouped into three modules of training. Candidates will progress to the next module or skill test when ready to do so. Training that is flexible. The core module of instrument flying skills must always be completed first, and after having done so, the candidate may choose which further module to tackle next, within a timescale that suits them. This takes into account the fact that GA pilots may often not have the time or financial resources to commit to a more conventional full course of training towards the IR. Focus on the practical needs of GA pilots. Holders of the BIR should feel confident to use it to the full extent of its privileges. While IFR flight has many safety advantages, what is central to its philosophy is to assess the risks of a particular flight in a more systematic way. To this end, the training will be focused on the real-world instrument flying needs of GA pilots, with particular emphasis on practical application of threat and error management. This will ensure that the full safety and utility benefits of IFR flight are reaped. High standards of training and testing.

Technologies develop in a very rapid pace. In the 90\u2019s we were using faxes and telex and now we cannot imagine our professional life without emails. But how can we make innovation safe? How can regulators accomplish with innovation? Of course innovation is in the DNA of aviators. Flying today has nothing to do with the way we did 50 years ago, the airplanes and aircraft technologies as well as the components of the aviation system have experimented the more spectacular changes as the use of composite materials, the level of optimization of engines\u2019 performance, the use of electronic systems or the automation in cockpit components. Sometimes \u201cmore Safety\u201d is the enemy of \u201cSafety\u201d. When we are banning, when we do not want to put equipment on board light aircraft just because they are not certified I think we are not increasing the level of safety. Whereas we could bring in some aircraft some uncertified components which will increase the level of safety for small planes. Innovation is not only technological and in fact, being innovative doesn\u2019t mean being revolutionary. It is also innovate in the way we do business and organise ourselves. So the question is, can we regulators be flexible enough to adapt to these business changes? Of course we are trying to adapt to the challenges the new societies are facing and cope with the level of change. We are also innovating in our field, also because we have challenges of our own: less resources, we are faced with more and more technical and complex issues that need to be solved. Therefore in order to continue perform our work on those topics we need to innovate. We are increasingly inventing on risk based oversight, data analysis and try to be involved upfront in research programmes. We are also trying to adapt ourselves quickly to the changes in the field. General Aviation (GA) is a very good example for it. We are trying to be as flexible as possible to tackle the challenges GA is facing. We do believe that it is not necessarily trough regulation to increase the level of safety but it is also though safety promotion, through communication. We are trying to adapt to the needs of the market and the society, but also to the fact that young pilots in GA have less patience to read the complex books and rules; they are more interested in being trained in applications on their smartphones or tablets. We need to make sure that we keep the pace with the evolution of our societies. Our main challenge is to move from prescriptive rules to rules that enable innovation to take place. Instead of saying \u201cyou have to do this and that\u201d when you design an aircraft, we have to say \u201cyou have to design an aircraft that is safe\u201d. As an example, we have revised the Certification Specifications for Light Aircraft (CS.23) with our colleagues from the FAA. It was a tremendous effort. We went down from 699 prescriptive design requirements to 67 high level safety objectives. \tThis is the way we should go, and the way we can enable innovation to take place. But this is not the only way. So we will be pleased to learn with and from you how to adapt better to the challenges of this new world.\u201d Patrick KY\u2019s Welcome speech extract at the EASA Annual Safety Conference 2016 \u201cNew Technologies & New Business models: Meeting the expectations of a changing aviation industry\u201d in Bratislava, 25th October 2016 ", "easa_category": "EASA Newsletter: On Air article", "url": "https://www.easa.europa.eu/newsroom-and-events/news/air-issue-10-annual-safety-conference-special-editorial"}, {"id": "EASA_NEWS_0263", "date": "2016-11-07", "title": "Innovation is constantly changing the way aviation operates", "text": " Some new technologies and some new business models are so novel that they were unthinkable a few years ago. \tIn aviation, even the most innovative idea or product is useless, unless the rules allow its installation or use. In this environment, which some call \u2018disruptive\u2019, rules need to be changed in order to adapt to the new needs, or even, the new reality. One example of new business models bringing change is the one affecting the airline industry: a single airline can have multiple Air Operators Certificates from different European countries. This airline\u2019s business model is created on the basis of a single market, where all airlines have equal rights and nationality of the owner is not a factor. This requires oversight of remote basing and generates new types of employment. In other cases, we see the consolidation of large holding groups with several entities but one single safety management system. We also witness interoperability/interchangeability of aircraft across operators worldwide. These business models challenge past norms and existing rules, proposing a new way of conducting air transport utilising the rights given from the single European market. \tOn the technology side, the SESAR deployment offer new capabilities which in turn enable a new type of operation: Some examples worth mentioning: the concept of Remote Tower, the Ground based Augmentation System, alliances between ATM/ANS service providers within Europe but also between EU and non EU. For the regulator this means identifying, with an open mind, any potential new areas of risk while ensuring that rules reflect objectives to be met. \tIt is important that such innovation are safeguarded and in a way nurtured, by ensuring that the regulatory environment provide enough flexibility to accommodate new business models and technology without, of course, any compromise on safety. The drones are another technology which requires a new way of thinking. Regardless of how the operational application of drones will happen from a commercial perspective, one thing is certain: rules need to foster innovation without compromising existing levels of safety. For this reason, the European proposal has been to regulate drones based primarily on the characteristics of the operation rather than the drone itself. More rules will not result in higher levels of safety. Better rules, which are proportionate and risk based, will be more effective towards addressing safety issues.\u00a0 For this reason, safety rules should describe goals to be achieved or performance to be met, rather than the technological solution to be used. \tWith these principles in mind EASA started, in coordination with the FAA, to \u2018rewrite\u2019 our aircraft certification rules for small aircraft, CS-23.\u00a0 The changes we have proposed make this a total \u2018rethink\u2019 rather than just a \u2018rewrite\u2019. The proposal is reducing the number of 399 prescriptive and design-detailed requirements, to 67 safety objectives. It enables innovative solutions to be used to meet safety objectives. It is important that regulators keep an eye and an open mind for innovation in business and technology if they want to be in a position to support innovation. At EASA we have decided to anticipate as much as possible and be involved in new technological developments as early as possible, in order to ensure that new technologies can be certified. It is also crucial to make use of industry standards where possible and promotes worldwide harmonisation.

All those third country operators must have a TCO Authorisation by 26 November 2016[2]. The TCO authorisation process managed by EASA requires operators to comply with applicable ICAO standards and to make certain declarations to EASA. The applicable ICAO standards include those in Annex 19 (Safety Management) to the Chicago Convention.\u00a0 Annex 19 standards require AOC holders authorised for international commercial air transport to establish an SMS acceptable to the State of the Operator, in accordance with the framework elements contained in Appendix 2 [of Annex 19], and commensurate with the size and complexity of operations[3]. Comprehensive guidance on the implementation of the framework for an SMS is contained in the Safety Management Manual (SMM) (ICAO Doc 9859), including a phased implementation approach[4]. It is against this background that EASA, in the ambit of TCO authorisation, requires operators to establish an SMS and declare the maturity of their SMS corresponding to the four implementation phases proposed as per the ICAO SMS framework.\u00a0 Clarifications \tAs of 26 November 2016, international standards for SMS become enforceable under the EU\u2019s TCO Regulation and need to be complied with in order to obtain or maintain EASA TCO Authorisation. EASA had repetitively communicated on the above. Within the auspices of TCO authorisation, the SMS requirement equally applies to operators certified in States that may not have established national requirements for SMS implementation for all or a part of their certified commercial air transport operators.\u00a0 Operators are required to make a self-declaration of their SMS implementation status in section II of the \u201cBasic Operator Data\u201d form in TCO web-interface. EASA reserves the right to verify the actual status of implementation during the initial TCO authorisation process and as part of the continuous monitoring programme. EASA does not currently accept, as an equivalence or substitution for the verification of operator\u2019s compliance with Annex 19 standards, a voluntary participation in, or certification/registration by, third-party industry programmes.\u00a0 Justifications \tAnnex 19 to the Chicago Convention is fully applicable, and SMS is a long-standing requirement for air operators certified in the EU. The TCO Regulation is part of the EU\u2019s framework aimed at ensuring a high level of civil aviation safety in the European Union. On 26 November 2016, the 30-months transitional period intended to achieve full implementation of the TCO authorisation programme will end. EASA shall issue authorisations when it is satisfied that a third country operator has established compliance with the applicable requirements of Part-TCO, including with Annex 19. Corresponding to the ICAO framework for SMS implementation, EASA considers that only SMS as of Phase 2 onwards will have established essential safety management processes and are therefore considered when determining compliance with applicable Annex 19 standards.\u00a0 EASA position After 26 November 2016, a level 1 finding pursuant to ART.230(b) of the TCO Regulation will be issued by EASA against all third country operators (holders or not of a TCO Authorisation) when their SMS is still at Phase 1 implementation. Those operators will be afforded two (2) weeks to achieve accomplishment of SMS Phase 2 and to inform EASA accordingly; and \t\t\u00a0(a) Operators that will have achieved SMS Phase 2 within the timeline: see point (2) below; or \t\t\u00a0(b) Operators that will not have achieved SMS Phase 2 within the timeline: refusal of TCO application or suspension of TCO Authorisation, as applicable. \t\t\u00a0 For third country operators having applied to EASA for a TCO Authorisation before 26 November 2016 and having achieved Phase 2 of SMS implementation by that date, a Level 2 TCO finding pursuant to ART.230(c) of the TCO Regulation will be raised by EASA. Those operators will be afforded four (4) weeks to develop and obtain from EASA formal acceptance of their corrective action plan aimed at achieving SMS Phase 3 by 31 December 2017.\u00a0 \t\tOperators unable to demonstrate achievement of SMS Phase 3 by 31 December 2017 will face suspension of their TCO Authorisation. \t\t\u00a0 For new TCO applicants from 27 November 2016 onwards, an SMS below Phase 2 will lead to a level 1 finding pursuant to ART.230(b).

This includes Samsung Galaxy Note7 devices. The SIB 2016-04-R1 also advises operators to inform passengers that Samsung Galaxy Note7 devices should not be put inside the checked baggage and that passengers and crew should keep the devices turned off and not charge them at any time while on board the aircraft. The Agency continued to monitor the situation and was in contact with representatives of Samsung Electronics Co.; who updated the Agency regularly regarding the measures initiated by them in response to this situation. The Agency also took note of the Emergency/Prohibition Order issued by the FAA (Order No. FAA-2016-9288) prohibiting the transportation of any Samsung Galaxy Note 7 device by the passengers, in carry-on baggage, in checked baggage, or as cargo. Based on the information provided by Samsung Electronics Co., the Agency noted that: no confirmed case of a Galaxy Note 7 device experiencing any anomalous behaviour (i.e. dangerous heat emission, fire) while turned off. the number of devices sold on the European market is substantially lower than the those sold in the US. Moreover, Samsung informed EASA that over 60%(*) of all devices originally sold on the European market have been successfully recalled and are off the market. Samsung provided assurances that the recall programme will continue; Samsung is maintaining all efforts to significantly increase the above figure in the coming weeks. Samsung Electronics Co. committed to introduce additional mitigations which will further reduce the risk exposure (e.g. remote power-down the devices, drastically limiting the state of charge of the battery, restricting carrier service to such devices and enhanced compensation mechanisms). Samsung Electronics Co. committed that all recalled devices shall not be shipped by air. Based on the above, the Agency considers that the mitigations already in place are sufficient and is not currently considering advising any further actions. Notwithstanding, this should not prevent operators to implement additional actions/restrictions if they deem necessary. On this occasion the Agency is urging aircraft operators from EASA member states and foreign operators flying into, within or out of Europe to implement the SIB-2016-14-R1.

The NPA proposes a comprehensive set of measures (IRs, AMC and GM) addressing, to the required level of detail, the provision of Air Traffic Services; the large majority of these measures is based on the applicable ICAO provisions, in particular those in Annex 11 and PANS ATM, adapted to the EU legislative system and conventions. The proposed \u2018transposition\u2019 of ICAO material into the EU legislation has been performed in full respect of the Member States\u2019 obligations stemming from the Chicago Convention; therefore, those who were already compliant with ICAO would have no difficulty to align to the proposed legislative framework. The proposed measures are fully consistent with and complementary to other EU ATM/ANS-related legislation, and in particular with Regulation (EU) 923/2012 (Standardised European Rules of the Air - SERA) and its subsequent amendments, the Single European Sky Regulations, and with Regulation (EU) 2016/1377, the so-called \u2018ATM/ANS Common Requirements Regulation\u2019. As an innovation, the NPA includes a set of high-level requirements for the provision of Aerodrome Flight Information Service (AFIS), which is not explicitly addressed within the current ICAO framework. It supports the appropriate selection of Air Traffic Services to be provided at aerodromes and harmonises the principles for working methods and operational procedures, thus enhancing safety. Furthermore, by recognising that at some aerodromes local activities may be facilitated by the so-called \u2018Unicom stations\u2019, which are not subject to the proposed EU ATS scope and are to be regulated under national schemes. This solution aims at ensuring proportionality and prevents any negative impact for local aerodromes, typically used by general aviation. The NPA 2016-09 is divided in two sub-parts: sub-NPA(A) includes: the procedural information pertaining to the regulatory proposal; the explanatory note to the proposed amendments; and the regulatory impact assessment. sub-NPA(B) includes the proposed amendments (Implementing Rule and Acceptable Means of Compliance Guidance Material).

Since 2010, he is Airworthiness Expert for Connectivity and Data Recording products. He is also responsible for providing Airworthiness expertise of future products to enhance data recording recovery and aircraft location. He represents AIRBUS in international regulation working groups (ICAO/FLIREC, EASA/EFRPG) to contribute industrial positions and opinions. Most citizens don\u2019t understand why a large aeroplane with 250 passenger can\u2019t be found for months or even years despite all the technologies available today, even in the simplest personal devices. How would you explain the challenges of tracking and locating an aircraft everywhere, in plain words? On the rare occasions when accidents occur, rescuing survivors has the highest priority, followed by the recovery of casualties, the wreckage and the flight recorders. To ensure that these objectives will be met, ICAO, EC and EASA regulations became effective and evolved progressively. These regulations require installation of means for location of aircraft tracking and identification of distress in any airspace, and to support getting the data and searching for the wreckage in remote area and underwater. However, circumstances of accidents are usually very different. Some abnormal events may have happened on-board before the crash impact, which could prevent functioning of such means supporting continues location. Tracking capabilities, supported by satellite services, are considered as truly promising means to determine the location of aircraft at any time. There are good services already available\u2013 for instance Flightradar24 (https://www.flightradar24.com ). However, as mentioned above, the distress conditions of aircraft on the eve of an accident is almost difficult to master. Electrical power may not available anymore; the aircraft attitude does not allow continues link connection to satellites or, in the worst case, the crew disables or manipulates tracking functionality. Finally, global coverage of satellite services is not guaranteed. In short, any of current means of flight tracking do no guarantee to function under all possible worst conditions. Therefore, AIRBUS is working on improvements of aircraft tracking functions. An area of improvement is the development of the second generation Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT), which will allow transmitting emergency messages before the aircraft will be exposed to the crash impact, as early as the aircraft is in distress. The emergency message could include the aircraft ID and actual position. Another means concerns a complex aircraft design change, which is the introduction of a new feature in civil commercial air transport: The Automatic Deployable Flight Recorder (ADFR) with integrated ELT. This recorder unit would be deployed in the event of an accident, and will therefore be less exposed by the crash impact. It will float on water. The integrated ELT would allow location of the accident, and it is therefore very important for rescuing survivors. It will be used subsequently to support searching the wreckage underwater and finally to recover the recorded fight data (CVR, FDR). So, where are we? AIRBUS provides solutions for all existing regulations, for instance ELTs (survival type, and automatic type of ELTs) and Underwater Location Devices allowing sonar location. Other means, based on communications, as aircraft tracking are available as well, and can be installed on customer\u2019s requests. In addition, Research and Development projects have been launched to study and to develop improved technical solutions, e.g. the Second generation ELT, Enhanced Aircraft Tracking, and the ADFR. One of the open points is the unknown future rulemaking progress of non-European States and the potential inconsistencies between them. How do you overall assess the response of regulators to the issues raised by the accidents of AF447 and MH370? What would you like to recommend to authorities on the topic of aircraft tracking and aircraft localisation? These two accidents raised high attention within all AIRBUS communities. Shortly after the AF447 accident, AIRBUS invested time, competences and energy together with Investigation organisations on many initiatives to find ways of improving aircraft and wreckage location. One of the initiatives was the \u201cFlight Data Recovery Working Group\u201d, which mainly focused on Triggered Flight Data Transmission and enhanced capabilities for underwater location devices. Many recommendation of this working group became standards incorporated in ICAO Annex 6, and in the latest amendment of Commission Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations (Third Edition/2015). We are working already on other requirements, where the effective date of regulations will be in the future, for instance \u201cCAT.GEN.MPA.210 Location of an aircraft in distress\u201d. Our recommendations concerning related regulations are following: AIRBUS considers that EC/EASA implemented regulations in the most advanced way following ICAO SARPs of Annex 6, and recommendations, which were consolidated during the High Level Safety Conference of ICAO in 2015. With respect to this ICAO implementation, EC/EASA is leading the way of rulemaking worldwide. What we are observing is that other parts of the world are following slowly. The worst case would be that some administrations will follow different directions. Promoting global harmonisation is a key that would help finally all involved stakeholders. Airbus believes that the best approach is for the industry to pursue the implementation of the EASA policy to establish on all new/amended regulation/requirements with \u201cperformance-driven regulations and requirements\u201d. This policy became reality with the latest amendments on the operational regulation mentioned above. However, there is still room to build-on this policy in more \u2018performance-driven\u2019 bases. For example, there is one new regulation [CAT.IDE.A.285 (f) Flight over water], which requires an underwater locating device that operates at a frequency of 8,8 kHz \u00b1 1kHz, However, this is nevertheless a rather prescriptive requirement. Therefore, Airbus very much feels that the continuation of EASA\u2019s \u201cperformance-driven regulations and requirements\u201d policy is the right way forward. Are there, in your opinion, some difficulties ahead for aircraft manufacturers or operators to implement the measures related to aircraft tracking and aircraft localisation adopted by ICAO and the EU? Airbus did not identify at that time show stopper to develop adequate solutions. However, it should be noted that for a successful implementation of the whole concept, operators ground segment and also satellite service providers must contribute as well. There is a need that operators have to implement procedures in the communication chain allowing aircraft tracking consistently. If I am boarding an Airbus aeroplane in five years\u2019 time, can I trust that it will be located quickly in case of an emergency situation? Even if AIRBUS will be able to provide highest level of design and technology standards, the final location capabilities remain dependent also on other organisations as well. The operators and the communication service providers have to contribute as well in order to re-gain the trust of final customers - the passengers - on A/C location.

Starting from today, a brand new set of rules becomes fully applicable, replacing the existing national regulations in the field of air operations This means that instead of fragmented rules in each of the 32 EASA States there will be a coherent, modern and updated European standard, applicable from Iceland to Cyprus and from Portugal to Finland. The existing national rules are replaced by the European ones. Even though the rules are newly introduced in Europe, the majority of their content is based on the ICAO requirements. Therefore, the States who were already compliant with ICAO will have no difficulty to adjust to the new legislative framework. To provide proportionate rules, the Agency established two different sets of rules for non-commercial operations depending on the complexity of the aircraft operated. For the operation of non-complex aircraft, proportionate, basic safety rules apply (Part-NCO). For the operation of complex aircraft (aeroplanes, helicopters) more advanced safety rules apply (Part-NCC and partly Part-ORO), particularly taking into account that complex aircraft may carry a larger number of passengers and usually require professional teams for their operations. The new rules for non-commercial operations: ensure compliance with ICAO and cater well for global operations; offer enhanced flexibility and efficiency e.g. through the concept of alternative means of compliances; adhere to performance-based rulemaking principles; provide for a harmonised regulatory framework that will enable the safe development of General Aviation throughout Europe.

As a consequence, specific operational approvals are only required for some type of approaches, such as for example approaches with curved flight paths in the final approach, as well as specific helicopter operations. This new regulatory approach is expected to increase safety and to significantly reduce administrative resource needs for air operators and national aviation authorities. The increase in safety results in particular through: mandatory PBN-related training in theoretical knowledge and practical skills; inclusion of PBN operations to the regular mandatory proficiency checks; and new and revised operating requirements. The regulatory approach of EASA has been the reference for similar regulatory changes by a number of other regulators around the world and by ICAO.

Released in a document known as an Opinion, these proposals introduce the following new requirements, among others: strengthening the initial and recurrent medical examination of pilots, by including drugs and alcohol screening, comprehensive mental health assessment, as well as improved follow-up in case of medical history of psychiatric conditions; increasing the quality of aero-medical examinations, by improving the training, oversight and assessment of aero-medical examiners; preventing fraud attempts, by requiring aero-medical centres and AMEs to report all incomplete medical assessments to the competent authority. These proposals have been subject to consultation with all concerned stakeholders. They address relevant safety recommendations made after the Flight 9525 accident by the EASA-led Task Force, as well as by the French \u201cBureau d\u2019Enqu\u00eates et d\u2019Analyses\u201d (BEA).

Next steps: The EASA Opinion will serve as the basis for a legislative proposal by the European Commission towards the end of 2016. To support the implementation of the new rules, EASA has prepared draft guidance material (so-called Acceptable Means of Compliance and Guidance Material - AMC/GM), annexed to the Opinion.

As technology evolves and the industry is demanding well-prepared pilots, with strongly built core competencies, it is important that student pilots are taught theory which reflects the operational environment they will encounter as professional pilots. It is also important that their theoretical knowledge is oriented towards practical application already from day 1 of their ground training. For these reasons, EASA has started the process to review, update and modernise the syllabi for commercial licences (ATPL, MPL, CPL and IRs) that establish the objectives of initial training courses, called \u2018learning objectives\u2019. The EASA proposal aims to ensure that with the update,\u00a0 the pilot training syllabi will bridge the gap between theory and practice, helping pilots to apply their knowledge and develop the right skills and attitudes even before they enter the cockpit for the first time. The EASA Notice of Proposed Amendment (NPA 2016-03), published on the 9 June, aims to ensure that the learning objectives correspond to today\u2019s operational environment and that commercial pilots are equipped with the knowledge and understanding relevant to modern flight deck and current industry needs. As a result, the courses will be designed to enhance the pilots\u2019 core competencies and their ability to take informed decisions. The proposals go beyond the requirement to achieve a relevant and current level of knowledge in the various subjects of examination (such as, for example, knowledge about the aircraft, flight planning, human performance, meteorology, navigation, operational procedures, etc.). \u00a0 The NPA puts forward new learning objectives in Area 100 KSA (Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes), as a tool to help training organisations instil a philosophy of training, which should prepare students for the entire life as pilots, not just for the exams. The new learning objectives of Area 100 KSA aim at the development of proper skills and attitudes, such as leadership, determination, teamwork, communication, etc. \u00a0The future pilots will be challenged to apply the already assimilated theoretical knowledge to practical exercises involving their decision-making abilities and their capacity to think under pressure, identify and correctly manage the threats and errors, developing the right attitudes at assessing a problem to find the correct solution. The NPA also proposes a transition period of 4 years to update all the relevant training material and design the courses using the new syllabi and learning objectives. Stakeholders are invited to send their feedback on the proposed transition plan. The Agency is seeking comments and input on the work of the industry-led group. . Following the publication of NPA 2016-03, the Agency organised a Workshop on the 15th June, with the participation of more than 80 persons from National Aviation Authorities, training schools, associations of ATOs, airlines, individual flight instructors and student pilots.

The Agency invites stakeholders to provide their feedback on the proposal by end of February 2016 latest by using the Agency\u2019s comment response tool (CRT). This NPA introduces the concept of the basic training organisation (BTO). This new concept is proposed as a new Annex to the aircrew Regulation and is based on a performance-based regulation offering a much less prescriptive approach than the existing ATO framework while maintaining the level of safety. It focuses on developing safety awareness within the training structure and keeping only the essential elements in the rule itself as far as organisational and authority purposes are concerned. In particular, the proposed rules concerning oversight of a BTO also aim to ensure a harmonised and lighter form of oversight taking a more risk- and performance-based approach. The competent authority (CA) is therefore neither required nor expected to put in place a rigid and burdensome oversight programme, such as is the case with the current ATO requirements. The oversight activities should take into account factors such as safety performance, results of the hazard identification and risk assessments conducted by the BTO. The Notice of Proposed Amendment (NPA) was developed by the Agency in consultation with the task force representing stakeholders, including national aviation authorities. The NPA aims to shift the General Aviation (GA) pilot training paradigm by introducing a proportionate risk-based approach to pilot training. The proposed amendments relate to training for Part-FCL non-commercial pilot licences, including the light aircraft pilot licence (LAPL), private pilot licence (PPL), sailplane pilot licence (SPL), and balloon pilot licence (BPL), as well as for the associated ratings, certificates and privileges. Why is change to the existing pilot training system needed? Upon completion of the transition work from JAR-FCL registered facilities (RFs) to full ATO status, many stakeholders repeatedly reported that a training system that consists only of approved training organisation (ATOs) is not the best and most proportionate way to deliver the full range of Part-FCL training for non-commercial pilot licences. Therefore, and in line with the strategic direction of the General Aviation GA) Safety Strategy adopted in 2012, the Agency put forward an idea to the EU Member States and the Commission in October 2014 for developing an alternative pilot training system for training towards non-commercial pilot licences.\u00a0\u00a0 ", "easa_category": "NULL", "url": "https://www.easa.europa.eu/newsroom-and-events/news/easa-proposals-training-outside-approved-training-organisations-atos"}, {"id": "EASA_NEWS_0322", "date": "2015-12-11", "title": "EASA introduces important alleviation for Business Aviation Operators", "text": " Under Part-TCO, EASA requires third country operators to apply for a prior authorisation before a new fleet with different ICAO type designator can be used for flights under their TCO authorisation. Until now, business jet operators needed to apply with EASA for prior re-authorisation before operating a new aircraft fleet (different ICAO designator) under their TCO Authorisation. In order to facilitate the specific needs of the Business Aviation sector, EASA has introduced an important alleviation for this industry segment: Business aviation aircraft falling into a class specified by EASA for TCO purposes will be combined in a single TCO Specification Sheet called \u201cTCO Business Aircraft\u201d. New aircraft types meeting the criteria may be used by the TCO Authorisation holder right upon notification of that new aircraft to EASA using the Agency\u2019s online \u2018TCO Web-Interface\u2019. A prior explicit approval from EASA is not any longer required. It remains the responsibility of the operator to ensure that new aircraft are compliant with all applicable international standards. EASA will continue to perform a technical assessment of the fleet, but will not issue a separate specification sheet any longer. This ensures that the safety objective is met with less paperwork involved. In order to qualify for the combined specifications under \u201cTCO Business Aircraft\u201d the following criteria must be met: The operator\u2019s primary business is non-scheduled passenger transport, business aviation or the conduct of air ambulance flights; and The new fleet: i. is not used for scheduled operations; \tii. is a multi-engine passenger aeroplane; \tiii. is operated by multi-crew; \tiv. does not exceed an MCTM of 45 500 kg; \tv. is not authorized to carry more than 19 passengers; \tvi. holds an EASA type certificate; \tvii. holds a standard Certificate of Airworthiness; \tviii. is compliant with all applicable international standards. The decision to issue combined specifications for \u201cTCO Business Aircraft\u201d is at the sole discretion of EASA and depends among other factors on the safety performance of the operator. It is neither necessary nor desired that operators explicitly apply for this alleviation. EASA will grant this alleviation at the next opportunity to qualifying operators, whenever the conditions are met.

They are currently only allowed to be flown commercially in daytime, with weather conditions allowing the pilot to fly the aeroplane with visual reference to the ground, obstacles and other aircraft . When it\u2019s dark, or very foggy or cloudy, the pilot would have to rely on instruments to navigate and avoid obstacles. Such is a situation when the pilot flies under \u2018instrument meteorological conditions\u2019 (IMC). At present, this is forbidden for all single-engined aeroplanes that are operated commercially. What have been the limitations so far? But there are countries in Europe with wide and empty spaces, or with isolated areas. These places are often difficult to reach by car, train or scheduled flights. There are as well some routes in Europe which can only be operated by such aeroplanes because of some necessary performance capabilities or cost efficiency. In several EU countries, some commercial operators of single-engined turbine aeroplanes are nevertheless \u2013 within limitations - allowed under a derogation to carry fare-paying passengers or cargo (CAT- Commercial Air Transport) in IMC conditions or at night. Other European countries have up to now been reluctant to allow passenger or cargo transport with such aeroplanes on a commercial basis under these IMC conditions. Their concerns have been that the combination of an aeroplane with only one engine, flying with reduced visibility and carrying paying passengers or cargo on a route over potentially densely populated areas would be too risky. Opening new possibilities while keeping safety high However, instruments and engines have become very reliable \u2013 in particular turbine engines. Such operations are now considered to be as safe - or even safer - than similar operations with twin-engined aeroplanes. Consequently, a common European rule will make CAT SET-IMC operations accessible throughout Europe. It will open up economic possibilities while ensuring safety. It will enable opening up new low-density routes, and it will make life easier for the people who live in these remote places. This is why EASA - together with operators, manufacturers, pilots and EU Member States \u2013 has worked on a proposal for common European rules on CAT SET IMC. These rules will guarantee high safety standards, mainly in the area of maintenance and aeroplane operations, including pilot training. This proposal has now been finalised and published as\u00a0Opinion 06/2015, and as such has been submitted to the European Commission for the further decision-making process.

It was one of the biggest conferences on General Aviation to be conducted in Europe with more than 50 speakers related to GA from associations, industry and\u00a0authorities. During the conference the Agency presented the first results towards achieving a more proportional approach to GA. These included the specifications for changes and repairs of GA aircraft which reduce administrative costs and promote innovation. Also included were the simplification of certification standards for GA aircraft and the adjustment of rules to better reflect the GA realities where individuals undertake most of the tasks rather than organisations. The discussions during the conference focused on the need to have proportional rules. Patrick Ky said \u2018We are creating a more proportionate framework, focusing on safety culture, safety promotion and common sense! We are in the start of the process and I believe we are on the right path. During the conference we showed the first concrete results of our determination and used the opportunity to listen and discuss with the whole General Aviation community\u2019.

Airbus demonstrated that the aircraft complies with the regulatory safety and environment requirements defined by EASA for the European Union. Every new type of aircraft needs to obtain a type certificate before it can be delivered to an airline. This EASA certificate guarantees that the A350-900\u00a0is set for delivery from a safety and environment point of view. The Airbus A350-900 is the first Airbus passenger aircraft with a new design to be entirely certified by EASA, from the application by Airbus in 2007 until the type certification. When handing over EASA type certificate to Airbus, Patrick Ky, EASA Executive Director said: \"We dealt with a very mature aircraft. Airbus and EASA have learnt from experience and have established pragmatic working methods which have proved to be the recipe for the successful type certification and the way forward for future certification programmes. I wish a long and safe journey to the A350 programme throughout its life in service\". During the certification programme, EASA has established 16 technical panels composed of 40 engineers and test pilots, covering the full range of the programme from structure to avionics and\u00a0from cabin safety to flight tests. EASA flight test teams have actively participated in more than 250 hours of flight testing. Nearly 700 certification documents were reviewed and accepted by EASA. More than 60,000 hours were logged by EASA staff or experts from European National Aviation Authorities to enable the certification of the A350.

Airlines can also allow the use of portable electronic devices (PEDs) throughout the flight, after a safety assessment process.\u00a0As a result, passengers will be able to use their PEDs just like in any other mode of transport: throughout the trip. The new guidance allows airlines to permit PEDs to stay switched on, without the need to be in \u2018Airplane Mode\u2019. This is the latest regulatory step towards enabling the ability to offer \u2018gate-to-gate\u2019 telecommunication or WiFi services. PEDs include any kind of electronic device brought on board the aircraft by a passenger such as\u00a0smartphone,\u00a0tablet,\u00a0laptop,\u00a0e-reader, MP3 player, etc. It is up to each airline to decide to allow the use of PEDs. In order to do this, the airline will have to go through an assessment process, ensuring aircraft systems are not affected in any way by the transmission signals from the PEDs. For this reason, there may be differences among airlines whether and when PEDs can be used. Passengers must at all times follow the airline crew instructions. Safety always comes first onboard of an aircraft. This measure follows the initial action from EASA in December 2013, toward\u00a0permitting the use of PEDs through almost all stages of flight,\u00a0when the \u2018Airplane Mode\u2019 not transmitting was allowed.

EASA also proposes to equip large aeroplanes overflying oceans with a new type of ULD that have longer locating range than the current flight recorders ULDs. Alternatively, aircraft may be equipped with a means to determine the location of an accident within 6 Nautical Miles accuracy. In addition, the minimum recording duration of Cockpit Voice Recorders installed on new large aeroplanes should be increased to 20 hours from two 2 hours today. Patrick Ky, EASA Executive Director said: \u201cThe tragic flight of Malaysia Airlines MH370 demonstrates that safety can never be taken for granted.

Further information on the toolkit can be found here. The EHEST is the European branch of the International Helicopter Safety Team (IHST) and the helicopter component of the European Strategic Safety Initiative (ESSI). The EHEST is a voluntary safety partnership co-chaired by EASA, Eurocopter and the European Helicopter Operators Committee (EHOC).

The RTC is a major milestone towards the award of a full EASA civil type certification which is expected in mid-2012 after a dedicated function and reliability flight test campaign will have been completed. The A400M is a medium range large aeroplane with four turboprop engine, eight blades propellers, a maximum take-off weight of 137,5 Tons and a maximum ferry range of 4700 Nautical miles. This A400M civil aircraft configuration and EASA certification will be the baseline for a subsequent recommendation for the military version of the A400M aircraft to be certified by the respective Military Airworthiness National Authorities, in accordance with their particular military certification and qualification requirements. In addition to the aircraft RTC issued today, EASA previously issued the type certificates for the turboprop engine TP400-D6 granted to Europrop International on 6 May 2011 and for the propellers granted to Ratier-Figeac on 22 March 2012.
