Countries that had already started investing heavily online and blended education were better positioned to cope with the sudden shift off-campus, says Julian Stanley, a European Training Foundation expert in teaching and teacher training. As this week's ETF focus on teacher training gets underway with a raft of online events, including a webinar on Wednesday November 18 on 'Exploring distance and online AREAS PleRaArCnTinICgE iAnRCEeAnStraPl RAOsiJaE'CaTnSd&aCsAeMssPiAoInGNonS FrRidEaGyIO, NNoSv&eCmObUeNrTRIES 20 'Should we change our approach to summative NaEsWseSsRsmOOeMnt&?',EhVeENdTeStailAsBthOeUTwork the ETF had been doing to support the continuous professional development of teachers in this most challenging of years. ""At a high level, we've been doing an international survey of teachers, their views and their working conditions, called 'Listening to Teachers'"", Mr Stanley said. Part of a two year pilot project with teachers in countries including Algeria, Tunisia, Albania, North Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, Belarus and Turkey, the survey is designed to provide policymakers, authorities and vocational schools with a better understanding of the training and professional support needs teachers and skills trainers require today. There has also been a scheme to support teachers and those involved in teacher training policy to better understanding how teachers can be supported through networks and peer-to-peer learning at a time of rapid change in the demands facing the profession. ""We've addressed such issues as how to do distance teacher training, teacher welfare, the opening and closure of schools during lockdowns - a raft of things to find out where teachers are now and to explore through international webinars different approaches and practices."" A pilot project in the Western Balkans involving Albania, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia has also begun to develop a methodology to more accurately map the training needs of teachers as digital competencies and familiarity with a range of software and online teaching platforms becomes increasingly important. ""The pandemic has clearly demonstrated that the old model of initial teacher training - something seen as giving a skill for life - is inadequate to today's needs,"" Mr Stanley adds. ""It is not even that there is now a need for incremental top ups, we need to address a need for teachers to learn entirely new skills - online skills."" It is not all-bleak news. The pandemic had demonstrated the resilience and fexibility of teachers, he said. PUBLICATIONS & RESOURCES P""WRAeC'vTeIClEeaArRnEeAdSthaPtRtOeJaEcChTeSr&s' CsuAMppPoArIGt NisSenoRrEmGIoOuNsSly& COUNTRIES important - not just for their training, but in their capacity NtoEWsuSpRpOoOrMt e&aEcVhEoNtThSer.""ABOUT The pilot had also demonstrated that the individual school system of teacher training and support was often key to determining just how successfully teachers were able to transfer to a new skills set and new way of delivering education. ""It varies from school to school and country to country - perhaps only 50% of teachers were able to take this on and a certain percentage of students - usually lower - were able to participate; in many countries keeping education going has been dependent on broadcasting both traditional - via TV -and online. That is wonderful as a stop gap measure to ensure that learning continues, but where there is no interaction between students and teachers then the quality of learning and motivation of learners is much lower and it is often difficult to gauge what progress is being made."" One key take away has been that even when the pandemic is over and all the emergency measures and lockdowns are history, teaching will never be the same again. ""Online will become a routine part of teaching, along with face-to-face when a return to that is possible,"" Mr Stanley adds. ""The positive thing is that we now have the models - many teachers have mastered key technologies and the accompanying pedagogy, they understand how to sustain the attention of learners and all the data protection issues."" In a nutshell, the future of teaching is likely to be far more blended and fexible than before the pandemic with practical skills taught face-to-face when possible and theory or video-based practical training used fexibly as necessary. Learning in different places and the way online and practical is combined over time may not just give us a short term solution - but a longer term framework for coping with the challenges of a world still struggling with a pandemic.""

A cost-sharing mechanism between government and employers ensures that learners are compensated for their work in all three years. “The project has really come to life,” explains Duško Rajković, Director of the VET Centre. “Enterprises want to participate to create a quality work force”, he adds.

Social partners are represented on its Governing Board. The Chamber of Economy works to involve companies in the education system. “The implementation of the dual education system is proof of their engagement”, says Mladen Perazić, Director of the Sector for Education and Quality from the Chamber of Economy. “Companies participating in the dual system see it as the best way to recruit employees, meeting their needs and national labour market needs. They avoid recruitment expenses and the risk of not selecting the right person for the job”, adds Perazić. The dual education programme is implemented in Montenegro in line with the Law on Vocational Education. The rights and obligations of both students and employers are deined by the individual education contract, signed by students’ parents, employers and school. The VET Centre is also responsible for accrediting companies planning to assume students for dual education. A portfolio for each employer has been created containing data on material and human resources at the enterprise as well as standard information. “We ensure our students are in good and safe hands,” conirms Rajković.

Skills mismatch is recognised as a major challenge by policy makers, practitioners and social partners. It is not only due to low-quality education, but also demographic change, rapid technological development, new sources of job creation and new forms of work organisation. It can negatively affect labour market outcomes, workers’ productivity, competitiveness and economic growth contributing to high and persistent levels of unemployment, and unfulfilled job vacancies. What is the ETF doing about skills mismatch? In 2020, the ETF is launching a new ‘skills initiative’ including a review of matching and anticipation methodologies, compilation of case studies on evolving skills needs in traditional sectors, and big data analysis exploration for skills intelligence to better equip education and training systems in our partner countries response to labour markets’ fast changing needs. The ETF has also undertaken studies and developed a training course, the Skills Anticipation and Matching e-toolkit, to enable policy makers and practitioners to spot trends and drivers for current and future skills requirements, which lie at the heart of a successful strategy to make education and training responsive to labour market needs. More information on the trends and drivers for skills needs and matching and skills supply and demand in ETF partner countries– Egypt, Georgia, Moldova, Montenegro , Morocco, North Macedonia and Serbia – is available from the ETF project in 2017- 2018 which sought to better understand the nature and incidence of the complex phenomenon of skills matching at national level.

His main task is to promote apprenticeships and other forms of work-based learning.

PUBLICATIONS & RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT A lot has changed since then. I think that today, our stakeholders are aware of our joint efforts and good work. Increasingly, we get invitations from our members to organize meetings in their region or their city to show their efforts in a company or training institution. The mind-set of companies has changed as well. Initially, we had to contact businesses to convince them to join the EAfA, but now often they contact us and ask how they could contribute to the work of the European Alliance. What is the future of apprenticeships and work-based learning? Although important reforms have taken place in almost all countries, apprenticeships remain a relevant topic in the years to come. Since March 2018, we have a European Framework on Quality and Effective Apprenticeships and at a global level, the International Labour Organisation has started to work on international standards for apprenticeships. A lot has been done, but there is still a lot to be done. There is huge potential for further improvements. For instance, we need to address issues like digital apprenticeships, the role of regions and cities in apprenticeships, and also how to contribute to a circular economy. Additionally, we need to empower apprentices to contribute with their ideas. How can SMEs offer more opportunities for apprentices? Unlike big companies, SMEs often face some difficulties to train apprentices, particularly in countries where this is not part of their culture. Therefore, intermediary bodies, such as chambers of commerce, industry and crafts can play a crucial role in supporting SMEs. They can also work together, e.g. by creating a joint training centre. However, this arrangement often needs financial support from the public sector. Generally, SMEs need financial, and even more importantly non-financial support, e.g. through technical assistance. How can we make apprenticeships more attractive?

We should also think about finding attractive locations for the school-based learning part. Why not in the heart of our cities? We always talk about dual education, but it can be “triple” education, e.g. in the school, the company and the training centre, or even “quadruple” education, adding an ‘online’ dimension, taking place anywhere. We are currently meeting outside the EU, in North Macedonia. What are the plans of the Alliance for candidate countries? All candidate countries are already members of the EAfA. So far, we have been quite successful in organising exchanges between the candidate countries and the members of the European Alliance for Apprenticeships. We could not have done it without the valuable support of the European Training Foundation, which assists candidate countries in their reform processes. Next year, we will review the work done so far and draw some conclusions upon how the cooperation can be strengthened in view of better training for young people and adults.

Carried out as part of the Torino Process – a periodic appraisal of the state of development of each country’s skills development and labour market systems – the ETF assessment recommends, amongst other things, involving employers more in developing VET policy, standards and curricula, enhancing the conditions and status of vocational teachers, improving career guidance, and expanding adult education. In line with the recommendations for other countries, the report stresses the importance of having reliable data and using it to inform the policy cycle. Azerbaijan’s employers regularly report that a shortage of skilled staff hinders business growth. The government is seeking to leverage skills development as a means of diversifying the economy away from over-reliance on the oil and gas sector and enhancing economic resilience. Yet Azerbaijan has the lowest participation in VET of the Eastern Partnership , and 37% of young workers are in jobs not matching their qualifications. Boosting enrolment in VET is therefore a priority for Azerbaijan, as well as for EU support to the country. The EU is investing €13.5 million in vocational education and training through the Education for Employment programme, designed and implemented with support from the ETF. Published following an extensive process of data collection and consultation with a wide range of stakeholders in the country, the report provides an external, forward-looking analysis of Azerbaijan’s human capital issues and vocational education and training policies from a lifelong learning perspective. It identifies challenges related to education and training policy and practices that hinder the development and use of human capital.

The European Union is working to overcome the challenges of disinformation through a multifaceted approach including projects and actions to increase media literacy, as in the digital education action plan for example, which will be updated within the coming month, and within Horizon Europe, the EU's next research and innovation framework programme.

Background Fighting misinformation, which is the unintentional spread of falsehoods, and disinformation, which is intentional and coordinated manipulation, creates many challenges in the era of social media and online platforms. Efforts need to be coordinated with all relevant actors, from institutions to social platforms, from news media to single users. Researchers, independent journalists, and fact-checkers have been at the forefront of monitoring, analysing, and reporting about disinformation. Disinformation erodes trust in institutions and in digital and traditional media and harms our democracies by hampering the ability of citizens to take informed decisions. It can polarise debates, create or deepen tensions in society and undermine electoral systems, and have a wider impact on European security. It impairs freedom of opinion and expression, a fundamental right enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

The situation on the ground is captured along with the challenges being faced by the VET system within the fragile political context. The report has just been updated in 2020 as part of the ETF Torino Process with additional information on the organisations and donors working on VET in Libya. RELATED CONTENT RELATED PRACTICE AREAS Governing vocational training Policy analysis and progress monitoring RELATED COUNTRIES PCRhAaCllTeICnEgAesREAS PROJECTS & CAMPAIGNS REGIONS & COUNTRIES Inconsistencies in the governance and responsibilities for PUBLICATIONS & RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT VET need to be addressed. This is also due in part to the split responsibility for VET. The Ministry of Education is responsible for putting in place initial training and supervises technical and vocational education institutions, and the Ministry of Labour and Rehabilitation supervises continuing training. Governance issues exacerbate problems such as a shortage of instructors and trainers in Libya and obsolete teaching methods which mean students gain limited exposure to practice and face substandard learning environments. Partnerships need to be developed between the public and the private sector to contribute to the overall enhancement of VET and the local economy. Libya’s challenge and opportunity lies in being able to diversify and grow its untapped private sector, such as the agro- food industry, or, when the confict ceases, tourism. Libya must match the skills needed for its labour market but the ongoing confict has led to an economic downturn making it difficult for the government to make comprehensive reforms. The Libyan economy still depends on oil, and now gas, as its main sources of revenue. Progress On a positive note, progress over the past six years includes the creation of 16 higher technical institutions, and five higher technical institutions have been turned into colleges; there are also plans to launch a number of technical health institutions in several regions in Libya. In support of reform, six organisations and donors are currently operating in Libya.

Since then, the years have been defined by violence, war, and migration in a country that has relied solely on oil as a source of income, and with most of its population employed in the public sector. Before 2011, Libya’s labour force - out of a population of six million people - included 2.6 million workers, but close to 50% of them were foreign. During the uprising, one million of these workers left the country. According to statistics from 2012, Libya’s current labour force is around 1.9 million. The majority are still active in the public sector, while workers in the oil sector and in agriculture represent up to 10% of the labour force. Employers turned to the local market to replace foreign labourers, but workers often lack essential skills, highlighting the urgency of developing vocational education and training which has spearheaded ongoing initiatives.  Did you like this article?

EVENTS ABOUT Stembridge School is the irst in Belarus to switch to online learning in the face of the Coronavirus Pandemic. What drove that decision? Is the fact that you are a private school a key factor that enabled you to act independently and swiftly? On Friday March 13 we had nearly a third of students absent - and only half because they were sick. The next day, we received a lot of messages from parents asking if they could keep their children at home. Families were concerned about the news on the COVID-19 outbreak albeit Belarus had not closed the schools or introduced any strict measures in education. With just two weeks to go before the end of term, this was a pretty important period for the school. But we understood that even more children would be kept home from the Monday and during a scheduled teacher- training day on the Saturday - where we had planned to discuss general issues - we understood we would have to make a decision on how to proceed. After conducting a survey of parents via Viber on the Sunday morning - about whether to use distance learning in the circumstances or not - the decision became clear and we swiftly moved classes online. Is the fact that you are a private school a key factor that enabled you to act independently and swiftly? A quick transition was made possible thanks to foundations we laid down almost a year ago. Last year we received the official education package from Google - G- Suite . Since September, we began to work with it and brought all students and teachers into the system, creating a 'corporate' email for everyone, and some teachers started using the Google classroom platform in their lessons. We also ensured that every child had a device that they could use to access the system. So, children have already been taught to enter these platforms, complete tasks, take tests, and use tablets and laptops for educational purposes. This experiment was simply extended to all children, teachers, and subjects. PSRuAcChTaICbEaAsRisEiAsSnotPcRoOmJEmCToSn&foCrAsMtaPtAeIGBNeSlaruRsEiGanIOsNcSh&ooClOsU–NTRIES this is the big barrier for a quick shift from offine to online PleUaBrLnIiCnAgT.IONS & RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT Are all subjects now being taught online? Do you have any vocational training courses or practical lessons that are a challenge to teach online? Yes, for now we have all subjects online – even physical education, music and arts. But of course, not all are equally effective. Let’s say, it’s pretty easy to do some physical exercises through online instructions but you can’t play football or sing in a choir via distance learning. Same with vocational training, which requires specific equipment. But we can switch to other curriculum – for example, do some cooking lessons instead of carpentry. How important are parents in the process? And staff? Are they now a team that works together to ensure the education of your students is not interrupted? Before asking parents, it was crucial to test the mood of the teachers - as they are key to the process. They gifted their day off on Sunday to go online to create virtual classes, upload material and prepare for the new format. Those who already had experience in blended learning and used google classroom since September became our internal experts. They shared experience, gave instruction and produced video-guides. Of course, for those teachers who had never used technical tools before it was a huge challenge, but they succeeded due to teamwork, commitment and help from colleagues. As for parents - we provided instructions we created ourselves on what they need to do to help their kids prepare for the new format . We also provided technical support with logins, passwords, etc - this was almost round the clock on the first few days. Within a week or so everybody was on board and we were surprised how constructive and supportive the feedback has been! As a team we also emphasised communication, with daily meetings during the first week, sharing good practice and challenges, and devising rules for online lessons. By PthRAeCsTeIcCoEnAdRwEAeSek tPhReOnJEeCeTdSf&orCsAuMcPhAmIGeNeStinRgEsGwIOaNs Sm&uCcOhUNTRIES reduced and now we have weekly meetings - and these PtoUoBLaIrCeAoTInOliNnSe&. RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT Of course, cooperation of the parents and the Stembridge team has been one of the key elements in making our distance learning work. This is particularly important for the younger children who need a lot of help. Naturally there is both opportunity and risk here, that is why trust, openness and the ability to ask and give constructive feedback is so important. The belief in future results becomes the glue between teachers and parents, which is necessary for success. Do you think other schools could copy your example? We are often asked whether it is possible to switch to distance learning - the good news is that there is a way and temporary distance education is possible. How? The answer is simple: everybody has Viber or some other instant messenger. Once you agree on a common platform you can create a group chat. Then tasks can be sent out to children. They do the assigned work, take a photo and send it back to the teacher. We are not talking about complex technologies. In cases where children are being assigned new, difficult material, one can first prepare them by using platforms with training materials - most of which have now opened their material up for free access, such as SkyEng, Infourok, Foxford, KhanAcademy, Courcera, Epforlearning… A lot of useful material can also be found on YouTube. In these cases, it is important that the teacher switches from the role of translator of knowledge to that of navigator, finding the necessary material, filtering it and providing students with links. Once students have had a chance to look at the material, a group call can be arranged to clarify any questions - just as one would do in class. Teachers can always go live - may instant messenger services have this option - and conduct a lesson in that way. How are you organising teaching?

Regarding hours – yes, we keep the schedule as it was offine. Even music, arts and physical education lessons. But now we are reconsidering the schedule for the next term – to provide longer breaks and more effective lessons. What are the key challenges - and opportunities - you have met so far? The challenges I can give are: Lack of digital competence of teachers may slow down the education process as well as a lack on the student side. Short and very clear instructions and supervision of more competent colleagues may be of a great help during the beginning. Screen time increase together with decrease of physical activity – it requires special attention to energizers during lessons and restructuring the lesson itself for the blended format where a big part of study should be done offine by the students themselves Concentration depends on the format and the task. Group discussion requires new rules and takes additional time. So teachers needed to rethink the whole curriculum and to find new formats which better suit online. Test in online format should be different so that students can not Google the answers easily. It requires more conscious and creative preparation from the teacher’s side. Technical issues may appear suddenly – such as electricity outages or password loses or problems on the side of internet-provider or another service- provider. To ensure catching up in such situations, all the instructions should be also written at a decent place to be available at any time. Students are missing their friends and live interaction of teachers. And teachers are missing that too. such as: PUBLICATIONS & RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT It’s a rapid educational process for the teachers themselves – they’ve dived into the world of technology which is so normal for kids. And they have no other choice rather than to swim forward if they want to help kids develop. A lot of educational activity in front of the computer during the day often means that kids do not want to use their devices after the lessons for playing games or surfing social media. Quick and diverse development of digital competence– how to find the required info, how to open the proper web-site, how to attach the homework to the task, how to share your screen, how to convey the idea if you see just icons on the screen instead of eyes, etc. – students learn a lot of this in parallel with the standard curriculum Many students admitted that it’s easier for them to concentrate while they are at home because there are no external interruptions and distractions What advice would you give to other schools that might wish to follow your example? Give a lot of support to your team-members: provide them with information, feedback, useful resources, guidelines, materials, positive emotions, etc. – share everything you can. Involve parents, you should become partners . Think about every minute of a kid in front of the screen: what he/she is doing right now? Is it adding value and development? Ensure they are not wasting their time – otherwise you’ll lose them. Create additional possibilities for kids to communicate and interact: they are missing each other and real communication. Take all this not as a temporary solution but as your new way of living. The world will never be the same again, nor will you. community.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the strengths and weakness of school systems in Europe and around the world. Vocational education now has an opportunity to lead the digital transition and develop tomorrow’s entrepreneurs. This is what drives Carlo Mazzone, an ICT teacher in a vocational high school in the Italian region of Campania, and one of the top ten inalists for the Global Teacher Prize 2020.

What does innovation mean for you and what is innovative about your way of teaching? Being innovative means changing the way things are and leading a major transformation that will bring about an overall improvement in the situation. In my case, innovation means approaching my work with a different way of teaching that makes the teacher a guide and a mentor for the students. To do that, you have to change your relationship with them. I have seen that an entrepreneurial approach goes in that direction. Students run their projects like a start-up. Working on a project is a way of making the students actors and leaders in their own learning process. Teachers interact with them and become guides rather than mere content providers. Students are encouraged to use their skills and knowledge to ind solutions to problems. When they miss information, they will ask the teacher to help them ind new knowledge and solutions. They come to see their teacher as a point of reference or a friend, rather than someone who just doles out marks. How have the students reacted to this new approach? How do you encourage and engage teenagers? What is your secret? I have been following this entrepreneurial approach since the day I started teaching. In fact, skills development is the ultimate and most important goal of my teaching method. For this reason, I have always used a model that I call “vivariumware”. It’s a new word I created by combining the Latin word ‘vivarium” meaning an enclosed space for raising plants and “ware” meaning products. So we’re talking about producing things in a protected environment: projects with concrete learning objectives, and not only technological ones, that can be the seed stock for real future developments that could become start-ups.

NTEhWerSeRiOs OalMso&aEpVEroNjTeSct leAaBdOeUrT who co-ordinates and manages the groups and relations between members. Each group gives itself a name, and operates like a mini-enterprise in realising the project The role of the teacher is to give support and general information on the technologies and tools to use. In fact, students are free to choose their projects and tools, because I believe that personal choice is key to keeping the students’ highly engaged and passionate about their projects. The projects can last a couple of months and at the end, there is a pitching session at which each group presents their project. The groups challenge each other and vote for the one they like best. Moreover, since the students are the evaluators too, they learn something through this participative activity. This method can be adapted to different subjects and different disciplines. In fact, it is based on the modern idea of personalised tasks that can’t be replicated Nowadays, thanks to the web, it is possible to get information about everything. To assign tasks based on mere knowledge is not useful anymore. What school can do instead is to train students to think critically about what they ind online by forcing them to be selective about information and careful about sources. I believe this practice is also useful to detect fake news and conspiracy theories. What has been your biggest success with students? In the last few years, I have mentored several classes in preparing for the Junior Achievement competition. Junior Achievement is the largest no-proit organisation in the world dedicated to business and entrepreneurial education in schools. For four years in a row, we won the Junior Achievement Company Program in Campania, our region of Italy. In 2019, my students presented a project called Farm Animal Trade, a platform designed to cut out the middleman on which farmers and farming businesses can trade livestock at a national scale. They managed to pass the selection for the national BIZ Factory competition in Milan and to jump to an international level at the JA Europe Company of the PYReAaCr TCIoCmE ApReEtAitSion P2R0O19JEinCTLSill&e.CATMhePAaIpGpNSis aiRmEGedIOtNoSb&riCnOgUNTRIES innovation to a sector that in Italy still operates along PtrUaBdLiItCioAnTaIOl NlinS e&sR.

How can we get the message across that digital is vital for schools? What are the challenges facing vocational education and how do you see the future of vocational education? Nowadays, everything is digital. Digital skills need to be part of education, especially vocational education. Our students will have to face more and more digital jobs. To be ready to adapt to future jobs is key. Big data and AI are just the beginning, and vocational education needs to have parity of esteem with the humanities and arts in terms of future opportunities for students. Did your school support you in putting your new approach into practice? What can the school system do to mainstream your teaching method? My school, the Lucarelli Vocational School in Benevento, has always supported my ideas, which come from my previous experience as an IT consultant. In general, I see a positive trend towards new methods based on know-how. The thing to do is to share this entrepreneurial approach as widely as possible among teachers through training courses. However, it should be stressed that the entrepreneurial approach is not only about developing business skills, it’s also about soft skills such as team- working and managing time and resources. What was the impact of Covid 19 on your teaching? How did your school cope with it and what is the best solution for you? Besides being the IT expert in my school, I have also overseen distance learning during Covid together with other schools as well. Fortunately, I was already conident with e-learning platforms and IT. After a few busy weeks, things went better. I also shared some manuals I developed with colleagues to solve problems. Most colleagues were not used to digital, but they made an effort to keep in contact with students. The problems now are not the technical use of digital tools, but rather, PhRoAwCTtoICaEpApRrEoAaSch wPRoOrkJEsChToSp&aCcAtiMviPtAieIGs NwShicRhEaGrIeOmNSo&reCOUNTRIES dificult to digitalise. PUBLICATIONS & RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT You need to bear in mind that digital tools are only instruments, and on the other end, there are always passionate teachers. In the light of this experience, what are your thoughts about digital teaching and how can we innovate? Before Covid, the use of digital in schools was only strongly recommended, now it is compulsory. But, we need to distinguish between using digital for teaching, and teaching digital and IT tools to create new applications and programs. One is when you use digital instruments to innovate your teaching methods towards an online presence and a more communicative approach. The other is about computer science and that will be the future for young people in the job market. What advice would you give your colleagues inside and outside the European Union that share challenges of teaching in vocational education institutions? First of all, I believe that teaching is what society and humanity is all about. It is part of what it means to be human. Whatever you teach, we work to help students to ind their place in society and to become conscious citizens. Real culture is not just about technical skills. At the same time, vocational education is a real and tangible way for young people to ind a job. To achieve this, teaching has to have a more pragmatic twist. There’s an old saying: “What I hear, I forget. What I see, I remember. What I do, I understand.” This is why an entrepreneurial approach and the use of Vivariumware is the right solution for me. In general, I recommend taking part in national and international competitions, such as the Junior Achievement one, because it is an opportunity for teachers to access useful materials and tools to prepare and engage students at their best. Created in 1919 in the United States, the organisation provides excellent teaching tools and materials in business and entrepreneurship.

Digital technologies can enhance fexibility and creativity, help to improve efficiency and learning outcomes. However, phenomena such as misinformation which was particularly evident during the COVID-19 outbreak earlier this year also threaten to undermine open, democratic societies and further marginalise vulnerable groups. To ensure that the new Digital Education Action Plan draws lessons from experience during COVID-19 crisis and supports education and training through the long-term digital transformation the European Commission is seeking the views of respondents on the overall impact of the COVID-19-provoked disruption on education and training systems, their expectations until the end of the crisis and in the recovery period.

Also present were representatives of the cities of Cork , Manizales , Qatar and Singapore, who shared their experiences of using lifelong learning to support sustainability, innovation and inclusion. “The World Economic Forum in Davos has conirmed that the future of work is uncertain and that the work of the future has still to be created. In this crucial moment of economic and social transition, the experts stress the importance of focusing on the new skills to be created. These are the skills and competences that, together with individual talent, give local job markets a global edge."" said Chiara Appendino, Mayor of Torino. “In this context, the path that our city is taking with international organizations such as the ETF and the ITC ILO is particularly important, bringing dozens of experts in training and innovation from around the world around the same table. The role of the city is central in this process as an actor, an enabler, a facilitator and an accelerator. It can brings the new needs of citizens and businesses together with innovative models of skills development and attraction. We hope that this work will make Torino Skills City an international hub for new skills"".

In particular, we believe that the spirit of cooperation that has been created must continue. All actors, whether institutional or private sector, must play an active part in a network that promotes excellence, increases talent and makes the region more competitive. Torino Skills City can and must be an important part of a development strategy. We are here to do our bit.” The solutions that emerged from the three-day brainstorming focused attention on the need to create a vision for lifelong learning and to activate agents of transformation - which can include all citizens - outside the existing innovation hubs. Among the ideas that emerged were: investing in technology to digitise education provision, and facilitate the matching of supply and demand, for example by creating 'digital badges’ to recognise lifelong and informal training; ‘reverse mentoring’, i.e. activating young people as mentors for the rest of the population in digital skills; and 'championship support ', i.e. including the city in a network of successful international experiences.

The Agenda supports the objectives of the 2020 Economic and Investment Plan for the Western Balkans to enhance human capital development for a knowledge- based society, innovation ecosystem and sustainable economy in the region. ‘Human capital development must be at the centre of policy decisions with targeted innovative efforts for the upskilling and reskilling of the workforce' said the ETF Director, Cesare Onestini, in his keynote address. 'Education, particularly vocational education and training, is fundamental to ensure all citizens have access to skills development opportunities as they need to adapt to a changing socioeconomic environment and labour market conditions' continued Mr Onestini. The signing up of the Western Balkans Six to the EU digital and green agenda has heightened the level of awareness on the skills issue and its impact. The urgency of the skills supply in the Western Balkans region, as highlighted by the ETF's Torino Process, has been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. ‘The acceleration in the shift towards digital and online solutions has been a positive factor during the pandemic but social inequalities have nevertheless been deepening due to issues of access, quality and labour market relevance of education and training’, said Onestini. 'Lessons must be learnt from what did not work during the pandemic' he added. The pandemic created distinct problems for the organisation of practical training in vocational education and training which needs overcoming to ensure young people in particular are prepared for the transition to the green and digital economy. Moreover, reforms of VET such as the participation of adults in continuous VET programmes have been delayed due to the pandemic.

In response to the challenges, the European Commission has set out a vision of the European Education Area to be achieved by 2025 which was announced on 30 September 2020. The European Education Area is underpinned by six dimensions: quality, inclusion and gender equality, green and digital transitions, teachers, higher education, and a stronger Europe in the world. The Commission’s Communication sets out the means and milestones to achieve the European Education Area by 2025 and is supported by Europe's Recovery Plan and the Erasmus+ Programme as well as working in synergy with the European Skills Agenda, the renewed Vocational Education and Training policy and the European Research Area. Within this context a new Digital Education Action Plan has also been adopted which refects lessons learned from the coronavirus crisis and aims for a high- performing digital education ecosystem with enhanced digital competences for the digital transformation. A European Digital Education Hub will be created to support these endeavours. The European Education Area and the Digital Education Action Plan will feed into the third European Education Summit, which the European Commission will host online on 10 December to bring Ministers and key stakeholders together to discuss how to make education and training it for the digital era. The ETF provides support to the partner countries as part of the EU’s role in globally supporting education by sharing EU policies and practices within dedicated programmes and activities.

On the other hands, students can learn at their own pace and develop digital skills that can invest in their future jobs. Sharing best practice from the EU neighbourhood The school received the prize thanks to their innovative teaching methodologies which emerged after their decision to invest in acquiring multimedia tools for the school, and most of all, to train teachers to learn new digital skills and the online distance learning methodologies which has contributed in positioning the centre as a point of reference and example of best practice for all the European neighbouring countries. The prize was given by EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, Nicholas Schmit, on the occasion of an award ceremony taking place online on 13 November, during the European Vocational Skills Week.

And when we wanted something new, we must somehow convince them that this is all good. And I want to say when the first results came and when we did a survey of students, everyone was happy and showed that everything we do is for the better. And now I cannot imagine how can we organise our learning process without distance learning.” Digital and Innovation as guiding principle for the institution The digital shift it is the results of years of investments in several projects that permitted the school to be fully digitally equipped. Smart TVs and interactive whiteboards have been integrated in the school methodologies along with the continuous teachers training to permit them to fully master these tools. In addition, the school continues providing new training to its staff and external one at the sake to pursuing the leading role in the country as a point of reference in modern digital skills adapted to vocational education for the other centres of the country and beyond it.

Vast amounts of digital information are generated by people, organisations, satellites, the internet and countless other devices. Big Data analysis is about making sense and creating knowledge out of that data. Big Data for Labour Market Intelligence offers huge informative power for labour market intelligence systems.

What can I learn from the ETF publication? This introductory guide addresses key conceptual, methodological and organisational aspects in using Big Data for LMI. It explains how Big Data can be used to go beyond the frontiers of conventional approaches to labour market information systems and add value to established statistics. Traditional approaches to providing LMI, based essentially on surveys, have limitations in terms of cost, timeliness, accuracy, usage, integration and coverage. Technical aspects needed to incorporate Big Data analytics into LMI are reviewed together with issues concerning the quality of the data and data protection. Real-life projects and case studies, both within and outside the European Union, on the use of Big Data for LMI are presented and analysed according to their goals, data and sources used, results achieved, and challenges encountered. In conclusion, a set of recommendations and steps for the ETF and its partner countries and ideas for projects are considered that emerged from the ETF conference ‘ Skills for the future: Managing transition’ held in Turin in November 2018. Who can beneit? Statisticians, researchers, policy analysts and decision- makers in the European Training Foundation’s partner countries working in the area of labour market intelligence.

School closures, remote working, physical distancing amongst many. The closure of education institutions has meant that teachers and trainers have now had to move their classes online. But crossing this line is no easy task. It requires learning new skills and adopting a new approach. Sergio Banderas, winner of the 2019 Educa Abanca Award as best vocational teacher and P2R0A2C0TCICOEDAAREPAASclaPsRsOinJEnCoTvSa&tioCnAMwPiAnInGeNrS, offReErGsItOhNeS & COUNTRIES following ten ideas to help keep vocational education on PtrUaBcLkICinATtIhOeNtSra&nRsEitSiOonURtoCEoSnlinNeEWleaSrRnOinOgM. & EVENTS ABOUT Deliver Education bites Successfully shifting from classroom-based teaching to online teaching requires an engagement strategy. To help support your students to stay focused, it is a good practice to aim to deliver short and clear messages. Rethink how to break large topics down into smaller elements so you can communicate each of them in a concise way. Give a clear introduction to the topic you are discussing, and present the context and the objective of the session. This should help limit distractions and ensure a safe learning environment that provides equal opportunities for all to participate. Avoid Passive Learning You should seek to banish passive learning, instead incorporate interactive activities into your online classroom and look for ways to involve students. Encourage students to participate, to communicate between each other and work in focus groups. Teaching others is also a great technique for students to cement their learning. Presentations, pitches or peer reviews are activities that can help with this. Use ingenious online tools, such as digital mind maps, tools for visual thinking and infographics, to help students to structure content, improve the understanding of complex ideas, stimulate their creativity and drive collaboration. Online self-training “Learn to learn” Learning continues throughout life and not only through organised courses. Encourage learning to learn in your class with a fun-focused online teaching plan. Engagement turns into motivation and motivation soon turns into habit. Introduce different learning techniques and activities that can be adapted to your student's learning journey, such as learning how to make priority lists, forming chunks of PinRfAoCrmTICaEtiAonRE, bArSainPsRtoOrJmECinTgS &orCAcoMnPdAuIGcNtiSng RseElGf-IONS & COUNTRIES assessments. You can encourage your students to PinUtBroLIdCuAcTeIOtNhSis&inRtEoSOthUeRirCdESailyNroEWutSinReOsO, Msta&rtEiVnEgNwTSith A15BOUT minutes a day. Soft skills in the digital sphere In the switch to online teaching, I have identified five soft skills developed by students; adaptability, the new reality has taught us all alternative ways of communicating; being proactive and responsible for our own learning process; time management, learning to prioritise and to avoid distractions especially those that are just a click away; and creativity. Embrace these soft skills and help your students to make the most of them in the classroom. Use visual content for digital Engagement also requires variety - make use of visuals to present and catch attention. When possible, show yourself on camera to humanise your voice. Make use of tone of voice and body language to engage with your audience. You may want to pre- record your sessions and edit them to add extra effects such as background music, visuals or moving images. Gamiication in vocational education Implement some game mechanics into your online classroom as an engagement tool. The main objective is to motivate and teach students through challenges, however, it is also an excellent tool for cementing complex theoretical knowledge. Scoring can keep students engaged in competition, which in turn can drive teamwork and synergies. Try to establish a reward system to incentivise their effort and work. Webinars with former students Keep your students motivated by reconnecting with former students and asking them to share their experience. Peer connections are often stronger than those between teachers and students. Invite your students to prepare a set of questions before the meeting PtoRAeCnTsIuCrEeAaRdEAynSamPiRcOeJnEvCiTroSn&mCeAnMtPaAnIGdNtSo keReEpGItOhNeSto&pCiOc UNTRIES focused on what they really truly want to learn more PaUbBoLuICt.ATIONS & RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT Embrace the benefits that technology and online meetings offer and record the sessions, which could be useful resources for future generations of students. Make use of social media as professional branding Creating a dedicated social media account may support your online teaching resources. Through different social media platforms you can follow different vocational education practitioners and stay connected beyond your school. You can also follow other VET projects, innovations and successes that you can bring into your classroom. It is important that your students understand the benefits of platforms for jobs. Show them how to create a profile and how to enhance their employment potential. Produce collaborative digital projects with younger generations of students Bringing different generations of students together encourages vocational professions at an early age. Use this as an example of an activity that can encourage engagement amongst students. Review different activity types and make a note of which ones really resonate with your class. An example in our school is this video game production which comes from a collaboration between a vocational informatics student with primary students https://fpvideojuegos.gamejolt.io/bamakquest Internationalisation of vocational education The digital sphere brings new challenges but also opportunities. Encourage the expansion of linguistic competences of teachers and students by reaching out to other international schools and organisations, participating in sessions and webinars with students abroad and aim for bilingual vocational education. PRACTICDEidAyRouEAlikSe thPisRaOrJtiEclCeT?SIf &yoCuAwMoPuAldIGlikNeSto bReEnGoItOiiNedS w&hCeOnUNTRIES new content like this is published, PUBLICAsuTbIOscNrSib&e tRoErSeOceUivReCoEuSr emNaEiWl aSleRrtOsO.

Analysis by the ETF country and sector experts had identified four key areas for EaP countries to focus on: support the strengthening and optimization of VET providers developing new roles for teachers and trainers increasing the stake of the private sector in life-long learning start monitoring and increase capacity of life-long learning ""We need now to focus on developing competence, rather than knowledge reproduction; we want students to be able to act, to deal with situations they have not faced during their training,"" Mr. Deij told the 75 participants, including observers from Central Asia. ""We also need to focus on young and older people and the needs of companies,"" he added. ""This means that vocational education and training providers need to tailor provision to the needs of learners and companies."" The shift to online learning experienced during the COVID pandemic had demonstrated the need to look more to modular, integrated learning: ""The real world is not divided into theory and practice. It is important to mix theory and practice - skills trainers and teachers could merge into new profiles."" More cooperation between companies - particularly SMEs that in the EaP represent the biggest number of employers, if not generators of GDP - in deciding training priorities and provision was also needed. And a shift to seeing education as a lifetime process where provision meets existing and emerging needs, and non-formal, informal and prior learning are considered, are necessary to meet the challenges faced by economies of rapid digital developments and 'green' demands.

While Georgia has enjoyed modest economic growth in recent years, employment has lagged behind, with particular challenges in creating high-skilled jobs. The country has high levels of educational attainment and a high proportion of graduates in its workforce. However it has very low participation in VET and suffers large skills mismatches.

NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT Boosting participation in and access to VET and improving the quality and relevance of VET provision are identified in the ETF assessment as key to addressing these issues. Carried out as part of the Torino Process – a periodic appraisal of the state of development of each country’s skills development and labour market systems – the ETF assessment recommends, amongst other things, creating a level playing field between the different VET providers ; harmonising funding mechanisms ; facilitating access for vulnerable groups; expanding tertiary level VET; boosting career guidance; embedding key competences; incentivising business involvement; increasing opportunities work experience; and improving the status and working conditions of VET teachers. Published following an extensive process of data collection and consultation with a wide range of stakeholders in the country, the assessment provides an external, forward-looking analysis of Georgia’s human capital issues and vocational education and training policies from a lifelong learning perspective. It identifies challenges related to education and training policy and practices that hinder the development and use of human capital. It takes stock of these challenges and offers recommendations for possible solutions. The ETF’s assessment of Georgia will be discussed, together with those of the other Eastern Partnership countries, at a regional event to he held online on 16 and 17 September 2020. These assessments are central to the Torino Process, an initiative launched by the ETF in 2010 with the aim of providing periodic reviews of VET practises in the wider context of human capital development and inclusive economic growth. In order to make a high-quality assessment of VET policy from a lifelong learning perspective, the process builds on four key principles: ownership, participation, holistic analysis, and evidence- based analysis.

What is RYCO? RYCO is an intergovernmental organization in the Western Balkans focused on youth mobility. Our purpose is to give opportunities to young people through mobility to learn about each other and gain transversal skills to enhance and further develop their intercultural competences and skills. It is so important for young people to have opportunities to travel and meet friends all over the Western Balkans and in Europe. We must remember that just two decades have passed since the trauma of war and divisions in our region. Why is mobility so important for young people? We want to transcend the narrative of our past so that we can create a common future together, also as future members of the European Union. We learnt a lot from Erasmus plus, which was available fully for some countries in our region, and supported by other donors and partners, in allowing young people to go beyond borders and histories to make connections with their peers. One of our biggest inspirations is the Franco-German Youth Office, established in 1963, to bring together young people from France and Germany who were still divided after the the second world war. Mobility can open peoples' worlds. Often, those with the most negative and conservative attitudes are those who don’t have the chance to participate in mobility programmes. RYCO is trying to reach out to them. How does RYCO complement the educational system’s support to young people? The educational system is important for preparing young people for life and work, allowing them to develop critical thinking, social awareness, and other skills needed for the PlaRbAoCuTrICmE aArRkEeAtS.

But it is not just about creating manpower. Civil society has an important complementary role working at various levels, helping young people to become active citizens of their respective countries. We connect with other stakeholders to inform government policies and at the same time seek to ensure that these policies reach grass roots' level. Some youth groups are very active, but others are yet to be engaged and we work to enable these young people from rural areas and minority or marginalised groups to participate and to be heard, for example, youth organisations representing the Roma community. How did RYCO get started? RYCO was established within the Berlin Process, which brought together governments and civil society from the Western Balkans to work together for this region. The European Commission was one of the main supporters of RYCO from the original idea, together with the German and French Governments. Pragmatic support provided through the Erasmus plus programme from the European Commission's Directorate of Education and Culture and follow up from the Directorate for Enlargement and Accession were essential to give us a solid grounding to launch our own programmes. How has the COVID-19 emergency changed priorities and needs? RYCO works to enable, promote and enhance youth mobility, so the outbreak had a huge impact on our work and the daily lives of young people. There has been a lot of fear in the air, borders were immediately closed, some restrictions are still existing. We had to put on hold all our projects and grants, particularly youth exchange programs and projects but they will be relaunched. Even so, there has been an impact on the overall culture of mobility, a general insecurity which needs to be faced.

What did you learn at school that inspires you in your current role? I had the privilege to have good teachers who inspired me to think for myself or “not to ask others for my own opinion”. They nurtured critical thinking on myself, my world, and my place in it. Critical thinking is necessary for the diplomacy needed to foster and contribute to regional reconciliation and its sustainability. But I am afraid that there is a lack of proper civic education in the region at the moment. What is ETF doing to help? The ETF supports our role as an important contributor to stakeholder engagement and partnership. It supports a multi-stakeholder approach in our region to human development. Young people must develop skills for the labour market but first they need to feel positive about themselves and their environment and that also requires developing their self-esteem and belief in their ability to change their world and where they come from. They need to feel there are opportunities for them in the Western Balkans.  Did you like this article?

The one-hour discussion could easily have extended to several, given the number of issues to be discussed and the enthusiastic audience participation from countries ranging from Egypt to Georgia. The event came ahead of the official launch in January 2021 of a report conducted jointly by the European Training Foundation and UNICEF entitled Preventing a ‘Lockdown Generation’ in Europe and Central Asia. Innovative teaching and learning PSRixAtCeTeInC-EyAeaRrE-AoSld sPtuRdOeJnECt TASn&daCAAMnPdAriIsGcNaSfroRmEGRIOomNSa&niCaOUNTRIES said online learning at first was very chaotic and in some PreUsBpLeICcAtsTIrOeNmSa&inRsEsSoO.UARsCaEnS acNtiEvWe tSeReOnOaMge&rEsVhEeNfToSundABitOUT very difficult to remain sitting inside although she appreciated being able to sleep a little later than usual in the morning. Both Nina Ferencic from UNICEF and Anastasia Fetsi from ETF who worked on the report said it had been decided from the start that researchers would not only look at statistics but engage young people. This resulted in the participation of 15,000 students who expressed their views on their own education and prospects, which will be refected in the report. This lockdown generation, said Nina Ferencic, “should be called the creative virtual generation. They will help the world reimagine education. They will guide us to come up with solutions that work.” Anastasia Fetsi underlined that ETF, which has been working for years on understanding the skills needed for the future, had already underlined the importance of soft skills besides technical skills, and the advent of the pandemic only confirmed the need for creativity and entrepreneurship alongside digital literacy. Covid-19 “made us confront our slow pace of change and created new momentum to move faster to integrate digital technology into the process. We have to build on this momentum.” Will education return to its traditional ways? While Anda Andrisca said she thought it would, she noted “I hope these months were ones of refection to think about problems in education and make the system more inclusive and more welcoming for everyone.” Inclusivity was an important topic, said Nina Ferencic— now is the time to rethink education. Young people revealed that digital learning had been an equalizer—they were able to access education in places they wouldn’t normally be able to. In particular, people with disabilities enjoyed being able to participate more often in online classes or events. However, even if the digital sphere is a natural environment for most young people, major inequities still exist and making sure everyone has access to digital learning is vital. PARkAeCyTIfiCnEdAiRnEgAoSf thPeROreJpEoCrTtSis& tChAaMt PteAaIGcNheSrs RanEGdIOthNoSs&e COUNTRIES involved in education must engage differently with young PpUeBoLpICleA, TuIsOiNnSg &crReEaStOivUeRmCEeSchaNnEisWmSsROfoOrMdi&alEoVgEuNeTtShatAaBrOeUT sustainable. Young people should be listened to and feel they have the ability to infuence decisions; a bridge between young people and governments needs to be created. Collaboration with young people is essential, working together and connecting the dots. “This will be a rite of passage in all societies. Covid has accelerated this in many positive ways,” said Nina Ferencic. Anda Andrisca also stressed the need for communication between students and adults. “Sometimes…it feels like it’s us versus the authorities even if we should be on the same side working to improve things…It feels like we’re talking, or protesting about climate change, or corruption, and our voices are heard but not listened to.” As far as helping people shift to a new way of learning, it has become evident that lifelong learning is another essential skill, that teachers will need as well. In the spirit of intergenerational cooperation and exchange, older teachers who may not have digital skills or may be used to a top-down culture will need new tools in order to engage with their students. It’s also necessary for governments and administrations to give value to teachers and see them as agents of change. Anda Andrisca added that she felt her relationship with her teachers evolved during the pandemic—they were more empathetic and tried to understand what their students were going through, and as a result, students felt closer to them. In closing, the participants came up with a few key words they felt were important for the future of education: perspective, collaboration, inclusion, empowerment and optimism.  Did you like this article?

Panellists from the opening session drew attention to the most pressing issues for skills development such as the need for continued commitment to investing in people in an inclusive manner, stimulating greater adult learning, and supporting teachers. The ETF’s Anastasia Fetsi started the opening session by giving an overview of the ETF's work with partner organisations to mitigate the impact of the first phase of the Covid-19 pandemic on skills development stressing the need 'not to step back' from the commitment and necessity for skills development. Indeed, Alison Crabb from the Employment Directorate of the European Commission continued by highlighting the key policy pillars of the EU’s skills agenda in which developing skills for employment must be supported by quality skills intelligence and tools for supporting individuals, such as individual learning accounts. “Stakeholders and partners need to join forces within the skills development field”, Crabb added. Biljana Radonjic Ker-Lindsay from the EBRD described her organisation's engagement with employers particularly at a sectoral level and the need to go ‘beyond survival’ in the short term and work towards medium and long term solutions with public sector planning and support including activation policies in the labour market. This point was a focus of discussion in a subsequent breakout session Sangheon Lee, Director of the Employment Policy Department from the ILO, spoke about the uneven recovery to the Covid-19 pandemic and how engagement with workers and social partners is essential to adopt measures needed to protect workers and ensure PcRoAnCtiTnICuEedAReEdAuScatPioRnOaJEnCdTtSra&inCiAnMgP, AesIGpNeScialRlyEgGiIvOeNnSt&hCeOUNTRIES shift to digitalisation and the greening of the economy PthUaBtLIrCisAkTsIOleNaSv&inRgEmSOaUnRyCbEeShinNdE.WSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT Lee’s view was strongly echoed by Susan Flocken, European Director of the European Trade Union Committee for Education who called for more relevant and sustainable professional development for teachers to ensure quality education and teaching. Moreover, Flocken called for recognition of the 'skills for life' component in skills development for enterprises in contributing to prosperity, well-being, democracy and solidarity in these challenging times. Participant discussions centred on ways to ensure the Covid-19 recovery is inclusive, innovative and green. In the breakout groups participants learnt about initiatives taking place in the EU’s neighbouring regions and Central Asia supported by the ETF and its partners.

The other invitees were Juan Menéndez-Valdés, Executive Director of the European Foundation for Living and Working Conditions, Christa Sedlatschek, Executive Director of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, Jürgen Siebel, Exective Director for the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training , and Jordi Curell Gotor, interim Executive Director of the European Labour Authority. The meeting was chaired by Dutch MEP Agnes Jongerius. In the coming years, the ETF will support countries to make their education and training dynamic, inclusive and responsive to the needs of individuals, businesses and society. This requires a holistic vision of human capital development aiming at joined-up lifelong learning systems that embrace general, vocational, higher and adult education and enable people to acquire relevant initial skills and build on them as they move through life. The growing prominence of human capital development in the EU’s external relations programmes and policies, also linked to the Sustainable Development Goals, means a growing demand for the ETF’s services.

Priority actions in this area include using regional resource centres to promote vocational excellence, modernising teacher training and optimising regional VET provider networks. Carried out as part of the Torino Process – a periodic appraisal of the state of development of each country’s skills development and labour market systems – the ETF assessment also recommends, amongst other things, addressing the skills needs of small and medium-sized Policy analysis and progress monitoring RELATED COUNTRIES PeRnAteCrTpICriEseAsRiEnAoSrdePrRtOoJEpCroTmS &otCeASMMPAEIGgNroSwthREaGnIOdNpSri&vaCtOeUNTRIES sector development; and addressing regional disparities PinUBcLoImCApTeIOtiNtiSve&nReEsSsOthUrRoCuEgSh eNnEtWreSpRreOnOeMur&sEhVipENeTdSucaAtBioOnUT and targeted support to regional economic ecosystems. These recommendations aim to support Belarus’ government in addressing a series of economic and social challenges including low private sector growth, regional disparities, low value added by the SME sector, a shrinking working age population and skills shortages and gaps. The negative image of vocational education and training means the supply of university graduates exceeds the number of graduate jobs in the economy. As a result, many graduates work in non-graduate positions, while employers report skills shortages in intermediate level occupations. Unemployment among university graduates is currently higher than among people with secondary level VET qualifications. Published following an extensive process of data collection and consultation with a wide range of stakeholders in the country, the report provides an external, forward-looking analysis of Belarus’ human capital issues and vocational education and training policies from a lifelong learning perspective. It identifies challenges related to education and training policy and practices that hinder the development and use of human capital. It takes stock of these challenges and offers recommendations for possible solutions. The ETF’s assessment of Belarus will be discussed, together with those of the other Eastern Partnership countries, at a regional event to be held online on 16 and 17 September 2020. These assessments are central to the Torino Process, an initiative launched by the ETF in 2010 with the aim of providing periodic reviews of VET practises in the wider context of human capital development and inclusive economic growth. In order to make a high-quality assessment of VET policy from a lifelong learning perspective, the process builds on four key principles: ownership, participation, holistic analysis, and evidence- based analysis.

Migration is an important topic worldwide. Keeping track of people's movements between countries is key to monitoring the evolution of labour markets and developing education and training policies that take the skills of migrants into account. To mark International Migrants Day the ETF would like to share some of the data we have collected from the EU's neighbouring regions. Top 5 neighbouring countries sending migrants to the European Union 2019 Skills and migration Many people have moved to work, study or join family members in the European Union from neighbouring countries. EU27 had more than 32 million migrants provided from the top 25 sending countries worldwide and over 10 million arrived from the top 5 neighbouring countries: Morocco, Turkey, Russian Federation, Algeria and Ukraine . Reasons for migrating to the EU from ETF Partner countries from 2010 to 2019 The total number of valid residence permits granted by EU member states to people coming from the 27 neighbouring countries with which ETF works, increased by over 1.3 million in the last decade. Focusing on the family, work and study reasons, in 2019 the total permits granted for family reasons was 4.1 million , for work reasons the number of permits was 1.8 million , and for study reasons the permits granted were 237.100 . via GIPHY Percentage studying abroad The high percentage of students from ETF partner countries in higher education abroad shows a tendency for young people to look for opportunities in other countries. In many of the neighbouring countries, the ‘ outbound mobility ratio’ i.e. the number of students from a given country studying abroad expressed as a percentage of total tertiary enrolment in that country, is over 5%, with peaks of over 20% in Moldova, Azerbaijan, Montenegro. . Background In line with its mission and strategy, the ETF contributes to addressing UN SGD 4 for inclusive and equitable education, with a key focus on migrants: “By 2030, substantially increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship”.  Did you like this article?

Firdovsi is from Azerbaijan and is now working in the Oman. We put a number of questions to Firdovsi, as part of our #learningconnects campaign, about his experience in distance learning to give some insight and support to all those learning at a distance, especially during the current coronavirus pandemic. PHRoAwCTiImCEpAoRrtEaAnSt isPiRt OtoJEdCeTvSe&loCpAMbePtAtIeGrNoSnlinReEGrIeOsNoSu&rcCeOsUNTRIES for students in VET now, particularly with so many PpUeBoLpICleATsIeOlfN-iSs&olRaEtiSnOgUdRuCeESto tNhEeWpSaRnOdOeMm&icE?VENTS ABOUT The United Nations says right now that one billion students are staying at home due to the pandemic; we do not have precise statistics on how vocational education and training students are included in this number. To be positive, education has always found a way to train students in any kind of situation. We can see that in secondary and Higher Education distance learning is already in place, but in VET it seems to be very challenging. There are a lot of platforms that are available in the market, but most are focused on theoretical knowledge. That is a challenge for VET, where practical training is a key component. What can be done to incorporate practical skills training in distance learning for VET students? There are basically two solutions to distance learning generally - synchronised and unsynchronised system. To be effective we need to use a combination of both systems. Unsynchronised - or stand alone lessons - are, to be honest, ineffective. Training providers are now trying to ensure there is a balance of both types and are using different platforms, such as WhatsApp and YouTube to support synchronised training. Assessing distance learning is particularly difficult in VET - you cannot track a student's performance, particularly in terms of practical lessons. Zoom is a platform that is now being increasingly used for distance learning because it allow multiple users to access it and interface with the teacher at the same time. But still, checking practical skills seems impossible at the moment. Online learning for Technical VET is more about supporting theory training and maintaining community - keeping students involved, giving them responsibility for their own learning. What is needed to maintain practical training for VET students via distance learning? PTRhAeCreTIaCrEeAaRlrEeAaSdy PsoRmOJeECviTdSe&osCAwMhPeAreIGsNtSudeRnEtGsIcOaNnSw&aCtOchUNTRIES some practical experience, a small tool or equipment that PisUeBaLsICyAtToIOoNbSse&rvReE;StOhUisRiCsEsStill nNoEtWhSaRnOdOsM-o&n EeVxEpNeTriSencAeB, ObUuTt it does allow something to sink in. The future of practical training in distance learning lies in using augmented or virtual reality . It sounds costly, but I have some 25 sources that have thousands of 3D virtual reality courses available. Of course, there are challenges in the curricula and language of presentations. And to fully engage a student needs a headset. We need a system that enables students to engage and the training provider to observe and engage with students with a focus on soft skills including communication. Azerbaijan launched a televised online resource for students on March 30. What are its key points and how does this represent good practice? Parents play an important role in education in Azerbaijan. Many are committed to working with teachers to monitor the online learning of their children. The online courses - which have launched on the Culture TV channel and other platforms - include 26 lessons across eight VET specialisations including electrical engineer, construction, mechanics, automobile and ICT. The videos are 7-15 minutes long and they try to divide teaching between theory and practice, showing how things work or how they look. This is difficult, because no one is sure that students are watching the videos - this comes down to parents to ensure that students work on the videos or upload the lessons to the particular platforms they use. Assessment is also a challenge, and relies on teachers getting in touch with students one by one via WhatsApp or other platforms to arrive at some kind of understanding. Zoom is popular right now, because all the students can be brought together with the teacher in one real-time session. Relevant authorities in Azerbaijan have decided that this year they will not assess those parts of courses that have been impossible to teach online since schools and VET have been closed since the 2nd of March. sustainable in the current form.

How was Azerbaijan in a position to swiftly launch such an online educational response to the pandemic? There has long been a strong focus on reforming VET in Azerbaijan - starting in 2003 and significantly boosted in 2016 when Road Maps for VET and ICT were launched. The new education law of 2009 foresaw distance learning as a key part of formal and informal learning. Under the Road Map five targets were launched to help achieve this. Recognition of prior learning is also quite advanced. There is a National Qualifications Framework, adopted in 2018, and an Employment Strategy for 2019-2030 has been approved. All these measures provide a legal basis for quickly launching these online tools. Firdovsi Mutallimov is a member of the ETF Open Space community.

Her association was founded in 1990 and is one of the three national parents associations in Algeria. During the coronavirus pandemic, the parents’ associations have been actively involved in organising distance learning for all students as well as expressing their concern and offering suggestions to the Ministry of National Education. On May 10, the Ministry announced that schools in Algeria, which closed on March 12, would not reopen until October 2020. This decision refects suggestions proposed by the parents associations, as well as teachers unions. The baccalaureate exams scheduled for June will take place in September 2020. As part of our #learningconnects campaign, Djamila Khiar spoke to us about the growing importance and acceptance of VET learning in Algeria and the challenges of distance learning during the coronavirus pandemic. Can you give a brief overview of the educational system in general in Algeria? LearningConnects , a certiicate of general education, and either continue in general education, go on to vocational training, or leave school. How important is vocational training in Algeria? VET is very important in Algeria. There’s been a rush towards VET and this is happening even with students who went to university, because they are not inding work, and they come to VET to reorient in order to align themselves with the needs of the market. It used to be that VET wasn’t accepted by parents. It was due to a certain mentality, that a family’s status was tied to the children getting their baccalaureate. All parents would push their children to study medicine or engineering. Today there’s a growing awareness that the market demand is what matters and that courses have become diversiied. There are also technical lycées and schools that specialise in maths and physics. There are four schools that specialise in maths and they consistently have the best results at the BEM exam. We are advocating to have these schools present in every region in Algeria. What has been the situation for students in Algeria since schools were closed? Did distance learning exist before the pandemic? Distance learning didn’t really exist, other than correspondence courses. There had been a few initiatives previously, there was a television station that had classes to help study for the baccalaureate. Twenty years ago, there was a TV station that focussed only on distance learning but during the “black decade” [the civil war during which 200,000 Algerians lost their lives] the station disappeared. Two years ago, some programs resumed, but not on one particular station. With the coronavirus we had to move quickly and implement distance learning. There are some courses online but not everyone is lucky enough to have a computer or an internet connection. We have a lot of large families and it’s dificult for the children to ind a quiet spot in the house. So in our situation distance learning with television is more democratic. It used to be that we always focused on the baccalaureate, but this time we saw that all classes were affected. It’s a good thing that we realized this, the coronavirus educated us and made us PUBLICATIONS & RESOURCES PreRaAlCisTeICtEhaAtRwEAeSneePdROtoJEtCraTSin&teCaAcMhPeArIsGiNnSdisRtaEnGcIOeNleSa&rnCiOnUgN, aTnRdIES how to be able to engage with children. There was great NsEoWlidSaRrOitOy Man&dEoVuErNtTeSachAeBrOs UtrTied their best, but they don’t have the methodology required for distance learning. But the classes that were organised ran on the six national television stations and we have asked for a special station that will run classes as long as the school are closed. Did you correspond frequently with the Ministry of Education during this period of time? We met with the Ministry on March 27. We suggested that the teachers get training as quickly as possible. We talked about reorganising the school year; this year we were lucky that the irst two trimesters were stable compared to other years when there were strikes, for example. The children completed 80% of the programme. Our lockdown began one week before the school holidays following the second trimester, which is the longest. We asked the Ministry to end the school year now. The Ministry consulted with 16 or 17 unions and the three parents associations and we all agreed that schools should not reopen. The third trimester is only three to four weeks long, sometimes there are more than 40 children per class so it’s impossible to put in place the necessary sanitary measures. We also proposed that the baccalaureate exam that usually takes place in June be postponed until September. We gave the Ministry a roadmap so that teachers can prepare and children can get back to learning without endangering their health and that of their families. The virus can contaminate many people in our way of life which includes many family members; aunts, uncles, and grandparents. * How are you planning to continue distance learning and implement a system for the future? In the years to come we’ll be better equipped; everyone agrees that there are many possibilities if we are able to have a special television station and train our teachers. We can get organised, but nothing replaces the classroom, even for a child psychologically, they have their friends, a place to be silly, an environment that is their own. At home things aren’t always easy. We know better what to expect now, and we’ve learned that families have an important role to play. Before, we relied entirely on the national education system and didn’t fully play our role. But the coronavirus showed us the importance of being present and following up on what the children are doing with distance learning. Children aren’t used to distance learning, on television they can’t react, or ask questions.

In questo cruciale momento di passaggio economico e sociale gli esperti dicono che è importante focalizzare le nuove skills da creare, ovvero quelle abilità e competenze che abbinate al talento di ciascuno formano un proilo interessante per il mercato del lavoro locale e globale. Che sappiano guardare anche alle emergenze attuali, come quella climatica e del divario sociale” ha dichiarato Chiara Appendino, Sindaca di Torino. “In questo contesto è particolarmente importante il percorso che la nostra città sta facendo con organizzazioni internazionali come ETF e ITC ILO, mettendo intorno allo stesso tavolo decine di esperti di formazione e innovazione da tutto il mondo. Rispetto a questo processo il ruolo della Città è centrale, attivo, abilitatore, agevolatore e acceleratore. È in grado di contribuire all'incontro tra i nuovi bisogni dei cittadini e delle imprese e i modelli innovativi di creazione e attrazione di abilità. Ci auspichiamo che questo lavoro faccia di Torino skills city un nodo internazionale delle nuove competenze”. “ETF, la Fondazione Europea per la Formazione, collabora a nome dell’Unione europea con quasi trenta paesi sul futuro delle competenze e del lavoro, e sulla creazione di sistemi di apprendimento lungo tutto l’arco PdReAllCaTvICitEaA.

Questo lavoro sinergico ha permesso di portare a Torino esperti di sviluppo di competenze da tutto il mondo per discutere e trovare soluzioni ai problemi identiicati dagli attori torinesi, le ‘Torino Challenges’”, ha dichiarato Snehal Soneji, Programme Director di ITC-ILO. “Lo sviluppo di competenze e l’apprendimento permanente hanno entrambi un peso fondamentale nella Dichiarazione del Centenario dell’Organizzazione Internazionale del Lavoro e i risultati prodotti dagli esperti in quest’evento sono stati in linea con queste due idee. Ci impegniamo a lavorare con gli stakeholders di Torino nell’implementazione delle soluzioni che gli esperti delle competenze hanno offerto alla città”. “Con i suoi 170 membri, il Global Network of Learning Cities dell’UNESCO condivide politiche e pratiche eccezionali che mostrano come l'apprendimento permanente può diventare una realtà a livello locale"", ha dichiarato Raul Valdés-Cotera, responsabile della rete presso l’Institute for Lifelong Learning UNESCO. “L'incontro di Torino ha offerto l'opportunità di mostrare esempi tangibili su come attivare iniziative di formazione permanente a livello locale e come ispirare nuove strade per gli esperti presenti. Mi auguro di continuare a collaborare con i partecipanti all'evento per espandere ulteriormente i sistemi di formazione permanente di qualità a livello globale”. “Come ente camerale offriamo formazione continua ai nostri imprenditori, alle prese con la dinamicità dei mercati e la trasformazione digitale: nel 2019 abbiamo offerto occasioni gratuite di apprendimento a quasi 5mila PpRaArCteTcICipEaAnRtEi AaSd olPtRreO1J0E0CTaSp&pCuAnMtaPmAIeGnNtSi”, hRaEcGoIOmNmS &enCtOaUtoNTRIES Vincenzo Ilotte, Presidente della Camera di commercio di PTUoBriLnIoC.A“TTIuOtNtaS v&iaREèSsOeUmRpCrEeS piùNEimWpSRoOrtOaMnt&e EcVolElaNbTSoraAreBOUT anche con le realtà internazionali presenti in questo territorio, per allargare lo sguardo e contribuire a fare della nostra città un centro di rilievo globale per l’alta formazione”. “Siamo molto onorati di aver potuto collaborare al progetto insieme con ETF e ILO. La tre giorni di meeting è stata sicuramente interessante e proicua”, ha dichiarato Barbara Grafino. “Siamo convinti che Torino possa essere la città delle competenze, consapevoli che si tratta di una visione che andrà sostanziata da azioni e risultati concreti. In particolare crediamo che la logica di collaborazione che si è creata debba continuare: ogni attore, da quelli istituzionali a quelli privati devono essere parte attiva di una rete che promuove l'eccellenza, fa crescere talenti e rende il territorio più competitivo. Torino Skills City può e deve essere un tassello importante di una strategia di sviluppo. Siamo qui per fare la nostra parte”. Le soluzioni emerse dall’hackathon di tre giorni hanno puntato l’attenzione sulla necessità di creare una visione speciica dedicata alla formazione permanente, per attivare leve di trasformazione che possano comprendere tutti i cittadini, al di là delle ‘bolle di innovazione’. Tra le opportunità in cui investire: sfruttare la tecnologia per digitalizzare l’offerta formativa, e favorire l’incontro tra domanda e offerta – ad esempio attraverso la creazione di ‘digital badges’ per il riconoscimento della formazione permanente e informale. Inoltre, il ‘reverse mentoring’, ovvero la formazione attivata dai giovani al resto della popolazione in materia di competenze digitali, e il ‘championship support’, l’inserimento della città in una rete di esperienze internazionali di successo.

The network - founded in February and now boasting more than 90 members and associate members - is designed to encourage the sharing of experience and peer-to-peer learning by centres of excellence throughout ETF partner countries. Similar centres in the EU and institutions interested in promoting excellence in skills training are also welcome as associate members.

PUBLICATIONS & RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT There are also eight themes, designed to improve the work of the centres of excellence and encourage others with ambitions to expand their vision for education and training: Lifelong learning in VET - from initial to continuing training and adult education Education-business collaboration and cooperation Pedagogy and professional development Smart specialisation - mobilising innovation, ecosystems and SMEs Autonomy and institutional development Going green - supporting sustainable goals Social inclusion Georgios Zisimos, Senior Expert on EU Policies on Education and Training at the ETF, and a former advisor to the EC Commissioner for Education, says the time has come for such a network. ""Excellence in VET is no longer a one-man show - it is not something that can be done by one body or organisation. Traditionally, VET schools provide skills - provide learners with new skills to go out into the market. But now, VET schools are not only providers of skills, but also centres of innovation. They contribute to social needs - training migrants - they support industries to improve productivity, they upskill for employers, they train not only young learners but adults learners too."" It is to support this expanded vision - this more holistic vision for the best providers in VET - that the ETF created the network in order to support the development of partnerships, to help grow and expand centres of excellence, he adds. Enthusiasm for such a network is evidence in the number of members and associate members that have already joined: initially the ETF set a target for 2020 of 50 members, but there are already now 93 members.

""Preliminary indings from these groups will be presented at the December 3 event - which is an important milestone as this will be the irst time we have all come together to discuss progress so far."" The network - inspired by the EU's existing network - should also act to encourage others to aim higher for what is, Georgios says, a continuous process of improvement. ""There are different perceptions of excellence; for us it mean a process of continuous development, a commitment to keep improving. There is no deinitive target - you cannot reach a certain point and rest on your laurels; it is an endless process because the challenges are endless."" The ETF began to build the network by reaching out to ministers of education in partner countries, he adds - though he stresses that a ministerial stamp of approval is not a precondition for a school or cluster of schools and businesses being considered a centre of excellence. Having a vision and being committed to it is a key foundation for any school aspiring to become a centre of excellence, Georgios says, although there is also a lot of hard work needed too.

The Project’s goal is to translate the school time of children into better learning so that they grow to be productive adults. Gaps in human capital investments need to be overcome, for which awareness raising on the costs of inaction is necessary. Country engagement is crucial in the Human Capital Project’s assessment and analytical work using Human Capital Index assessments results. “Increased learning is needed for greater growth, and this must be inclusive learning for inclusive growth” according to Mr Patrinos. He highlighted four global trends infuencing education: use of neuroscience for better understanding of learners to improve learning design; MOOCs – massive online learning opportunities – for greater learner outreach; use of technology, such as blockchain, allowing people to build and document their skills; and multilingual learning, which can widen access to quality education. The next phase of the Human Capital Project is to work with countries to develop their human capital development plans, to assist implementation, and to identify opportunities for further research. The European Training Foundation and the World Bank cooperate on Human Capital Development through country level knowledge sharing and exchange.  Did you like this article?

This seems to be the dominant narrative coming out of public discourse around the growing convergence of technologies, the exponential growth of computing power and the emergence of universal real-time connectivity. Surely, this is not the irst time that technology has been framed as a threat to jobs and lifestyles. In spite of this, from the printing press to the production lines of the industrial revolution or the growth of the digital service PeRcAoCnToImCEyA, tRhEeAoSverPaRllOiJmECpTaSct&oCfAtMecPhAnIGoNloSgicRaEl GcIhOaNnSg&e CoOnUNTRIES jobs and quality of life has been positive for a vast majority PoUf BcLoIuCnAtTrIiOeNs San&dREpSeOoUpRleC.ES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT So, the question therefore is: will things be different this time? Will the scope, scale and pace of technological change lead to disruption beyond the capacity of societies to adapt? And if there are fewer jobs in the future, will this consign workers to inactivity, or could it actually liberate them to cultivate their personal interests free from the ‘nine-to-ive’ constraints? When formulating policy, it is crucial to examine all global drivers of change, beyond just technology Policymakers need to keep their feet on the ground, and work with what they know to craft feasible solutions. They must bear in mind the limitations on the capacity of large complex systems, like education and training, to change quickly. Over the past 25 years, the European Training Foundation has been working on future skills needs in the wider neighbourhood of the European Union, spanning the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean, the Western Balkans, Turkey, Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The ETF is unique in terms of its mandate, its expertise and the ways in which it gathers evidence to support policy reforms of education and training systems. When formulating policy, it is crucial to examine all global drivers of change, beyond just technology. Global supply chains, demographic trends, migration lows, climate change, new models of employment, changing social attitudes and consumer preferences also inluence the supply and demand for skills in labour markets worldwide. Moreover, technological change impacts traditional sectors, such as agriculture, tourism and manufacturing, as much as it does the world of high tech. In the end, few of today’s predictions will stand the test of time. We cannot predict the precise effect of global changes on the skills needs of a country’s economy in 10, 15, 20 years’ time. There is no way of ensuring that a cohort of children starting school today will have the exact right mix of skills when they leave education 12-15 years hence. What we do know is that the pace of change PwRiAllCcToICnEtinAuReE,AtShe PleRvOeJl EoCf TsSki&llsCAreMqPuAirIGedNSin aRllEoGcIOcuNpSa&tiCoOnUsNTRIES will rise, digital technology will become ubiquitous, and as PthUeByLImCAoTvIOeNthSr&ouRgEShOtUhReCirElSivesN, EpWeoSpRlOeOwMill&hEaVvEeNtToS ABOUT transition between occupations, between work and learning, between different modalities of work and potentially between work and unemployment or inactivity. The top priority for the decade to come should be to support integrated, inclusive, quality lifelong learning systems The success of humanity lies in our ingenuity and adaptability. In the face of uncertainty and unpredictability, policymakers need to reinforce these positive qualities. Education and training systems need to increase focus on supporting individuals in making the best choices for their development and for the transitions they will encounter in their lives. To achieve this, education policies need to be lexible to adapt to the changing needs of people at different stages of their lives, and to integrate formal learning with skills people acquire through life and work. This is the value of exchanging experiences and best practices from one another across Europe and beyond. As a centre of expertise in the modernisation of education, training and employment systems, the ETF draws on different approaches and practices from the European Union, its partners and internationally to support countries in developing homegrown solutions to the challenges of the future. Policymakers cannot forget that people are at the heart of change. The best policies will endow people with the tools of change and empower them to shape their futures. The top priority for the decade to come should be to support integrated, inclusive, quality lifelong learning systems to guarantee people the best possible start in life. Such policies will need to create an environment conducive to further learning, upskilling and reskilling. Lifelong learning is a shared vision, but the challenge – across Europe and beyond – will be the question of implementation.

BOUT In the joint report Cedefop and ETF have overseen the monitoring and analysis of how national VET policies have incorporated the Riga recommendations. The report fags common trends across countries and aims to support their cooperation towards a common ambition for VET. Despite differences across countries, VET systems have moved forward so that VET can be a credible first choice. Taking stock of changes, analysing what has worked and what needs to be improved, is an important piece of evidence to help shape the way forward for the new cycle of EU cooperation in VET and related priorities for the post-2020 period. Key points to emerge include: Steps have been taken to develop and expand apprenticeship and dual systems, systematise school- business cooperation, and establish wide-scale graduate tracking and training needs anticipation. The retraining of individuals has grown, especially those from a growing number of vulnerable communities, and awareness of the need to develop key competences has been raised. Considerable attention is now given to teaching in vocational education and training within efforts to boost the attractiveness of VET and strengthen teacher and trainer professional development. Overall, the findings show that the progress achieved towards reaching the medium term-deliverables has reinforced the 2020 vision for VET. The ETF’s information and refections on freeing VET from many restrictions in its partner countries provides input to the international dimension of future EU policies and the framework of cooperation for the period after 2020.

The country spends relatively little on education and employment programmes . Published following an extensive process of data collection and consultation with a wide range of stakeholders in the country, the report provides an external, forward-looking analysis of Armenia’s human capital issues and vocational education and training policies from a lifelong learning perspective. It identiies challenges related to education and training policy and practices that hinder the development and use of human capital. It takes stock of these challenges and offers recommendations for possible solutions. The ETF’s assessment of Armenia will be discussed, together with those of the other Eastern Partnership countries, at a regional event to he held online on 16 and 17 September 2020. These assessments are central to the Torino Process, an initiative launched by the ETF in 2010 with the aim of providing periodic reviews of VET practises in the wider context of human capital development and inclusive economic growth. In order to make a high-quality assessment of VET policy from a lifelong learning perspective, the process builds on four key principles: ownership, participation, holistic analysis, and evidence- based analysis. As part of this process, Armenia produced its own national report, which is available on the Open Space knowledge sharing platform.  Did you like this article?

Distance and online education began in our country as well as in the world with the closure of the schools. I have experience in distance and online education because of my previous studies and projects. I did not have any problems in this regard, but it took time for students and parents to learn about the web tools and digital technology that they use now in online education. One of the most important concerns at my school is the issue of equality. At the beginning of the global pandemic, we had problems with access to the internet and devices. But then the school provided students with some financial resources. I tried to reduce the inequality by donating the tablets from the ICT classroom. As my students are very young, I shared the weekly educational activities that I prepared via WhatsApp and Zoom platforms. Since my students have a very limited attention span, I tried to support their development through fairy tale activities, drama workshops, and experiments that will hold their attention. Could you give some practical tips for the teachers reading this interview on how to overcome the unprecedented challenges they face in 2020? Challenges are part of our lives and we will always have them. What matters is how we act and the decisions we make in these moments. You have to deal with these challenges and overcome obstacles. They always say, “To believe in something, to intend and to begin is half the work.” Everything will be easier if you believe you can do it. I started to work as a teacher at Menekşe-Ahmet Yalçınkaya Kindergarten in 2015. It is located in a disadvantaged area where families struggle with poverty and where the majority of families are refugees. Since refugee families did not want to send their children to school, I made home visits and made sure that children attend the educational institutions.

By providing equal opportunities to disabled pupils, we could help them to benefit from education. We help the most vulnerable families to reintegrate and struggle against poverty. And that is why I strongly recommended that these families send their children to the school. Another challenge was the lack of educational materials for autistic students in my class. Therefore I started the “My special friend, this workshop is for you” project and established a working group in my school to develop materials suitable for by pupils with autism. Apart from the regular classes, I’ve also produced educational materials for the linguistic, mental and psychomotor development of such students. At the start, my students could not speak, did not want to communicate, and had not developed any skills. Thanks to these materials, their rate of acquisition of knowledge and skills increased from 20% to 90%, behavioural challenges decreased and participation in social events increased by 95%. Five of my students started primary school and learned to read and write like their peers. This activity was the first example in Turkey and since then I made a great effort to distribute these materials to schools that work with autistic students. How did it all start for you in the teaching profession? When I started working at my school in 2015, there was only one old computer. So I decided to do a project “Think creatively, realise your dreams” in order to improve the digital skills of my students, stimulate their imaginations PaRnAdCsTtIrCeEnAgRthEAeSn thPeRirOcJrEeCaTtSiv&itCy.AWMPitAhIGgNraSnt RsuEGpIpOoNrSt, &a COUNTRIES Robotics-Coding and Mind Games class was established PinUB3LvICillAaTgIOeNsSch&oRoElsSOinUdRiCsEaSdvaNnEtaWgSeRdOrOeMgi&onEsVElikNeTSourAsB, iOnUT order to make the lessons more attractive and to benefit from digital tools. In addition to that, my aim was to help teachers get used to digital processes and to develop their knowledge and skills, which would ultimately benefit their students. The difficulties at my school have never discouraged me. There was a problem with the reading skills of the pupils. The overall reading rate in Turkey is very low. So I started the initiative “Little Ahiler, learn their values” in order to increase the number of quality of story books for students aged 5-10. I wrote 10 storybooks on the topics of love, respect, responsibility, cooperation, sharing and empathy with the families. I tried to contribute to the increase of reading habits. In 2018 and 2019 I was nominated Teacher of the Year by the Turkish Ministry of National Education. And in 2020, I was selected among the top 50 best teachers in the world by the Varkey Foundation. What advice to you have for your colleagues around the world to encourage and support them in this dificult year? I have been a teacher for 20 years and have never given up learning. The most important philosophy of my professional life has been always ""A teacher is always a student ready to learn"". I have always been ready to learn in order to equip my students with 21st century skills and to acquire the knowledge and experience required in this age. This knowledge and experience helped me during the pandemic and I did not panic. I have always worked in schools with disadvantaged pupils and I have always managed to turn their disadvantage into an advantage. Success is not a coincidence, and the only pathway to it is hard work.  Did you like this article?

In opening remarks, Joost Korte, Director General at the EC's DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, noted that the coronavirus pandemic had increased the urgency of structural changes long needed in education and training, particularly those of the digital and green skills agenda. ""There is an increasing risk of a double dip recession as the second wave of Covid continues to spread across Europe, with this year's unemployment across the EU of 7.4% likely to rise to 8.6% next year,"" Mr Korte said. GDP was likely to shrink by 7.4% in 2020 - the biggest dip ever since the creation of the EU. The challenges - even without the pandemic - of tackling climate change to become the first carbon neutral continent by 2050, an ageing society and pressure from problems with social inclusion, all put education and training at the forefront of vital reforms. ""We are working very hard at the EU member states level to address these challenges; jobs will disappear but new jobs will come. For new jobs new skills are needed. They are now more important than ever before,"" he added. To aid the transition the EU is making ""very substantial funding for the necessary investment in skills"" with a budget of €1.8 trillion - 13% of EU GDP available during the Bloc's next budgetary period for reskilling and upskilling as emphasized under current recovery and resilience plan, he said - urging member states to apply for funding under the scheme.

""VET and academic [training] can work very well together. I am an example of this and it is still benefitting my life"", she said, adding September's Osnabrück Declaration, on lexible education and continuous training throughout life supported the overall EU strategy on digital and green skills. Keynote speaker, Prof. Dr Gunther Olesch, a lauded HR expert and chief representative of Germany's Phoenix Contact industrial automation company, noted that although many people feared they would lose their jobs to new technologies in the coming years, the shift to a more digital and greener world would, in fact, create jobs. They key to transition will be keeping people engaged in training - for example, those who came from a mechanical background may need to shift to an IT function. ""Over a hundred years ago, Henry Ford presented his Model T Ford and all the coachmen said - we don’t want to see this car, we shall lose our jobs! But they did not, they became taxi or truck drivers The key thing was to get the qualification needed for this transition,"" he said. The pandemic had forced the pace of change with regards to working at home/online and the office, but although the vast majority of office workers would go back to the officer, a degree of online and home working would become part of the new normal, with ramifications for transport, pollution, travel planning and work/life balance - all of which were likely to give rise to new qualification demands. Larger companies should be encouraged to open up their training opportunities to smaller businesses to help meet the challenges of a fast developing labour market, he added.

The online conference wrapped with words of encouragement from Margaritis Schinas, vice-president of the EC's Promoting our European Way of Life. ""We need to look at vocational education and training with a fresh eye; it has been particularly hard hit by the pandemic - transport, agriculture, transport and healthcare are all key VET sectors that have been at the frontline of the response to the pandemic,"" he said. ""Having enough skilled workers in these sector in the EU means we must enhance our VET skills in the future particularly for the green and digital transition, which will be both transformative and the drivers of our recovery.""  Did you like this article?

Moreover, a persistent occurrence of underachievement in key competences across different regions is found.

The indicators are compiled annually for all ETF partner countries and are used in various ETF documents and publications.

His dream is to “enable access to high quality education to everyone globally”, because, he believes, this is “the easiest way we can have a better society”. In Märt’s view, we already have the necessary means to make this happen – it’s all down to creating the proper structures for coordinated action.

In his Teacher Booster video, Märt challenges the status quo of existing education systems, “designed in the 1850s” – a time when workers put in long, routine hours, and were not expected to think creatively, build team synergies or solve complex global problems. Märt invites us to consider two questions. The irst is whether our education systems are up to date with the requirements of the twenty-irst century, with reference to the top ten skills identiied by the World Economic Forum. The second question is even less straightforward. Märt suggests we should be asking it yearly, in fora specially dedicated to it, and in contexts where the answers are translated into someone’s formal responsibilities. “What is the purpose of education in the twenty-irst century?” asks Märt. Education technology is not an end in itself, nor can it provide an answer to Märt’s questions. However, it may hold some of the answers to how learners and educators can become better equipped to solve the global challenges we are facing. Märt mentions digital learning assistants, fow theory and Virtual and Augmented Reality as possible tools for educators and learners.

EWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT This edition includes recent information on STEM graduates, digital skills, engagement in and determinants of lifelong learning, qualifications mismatch, and labour market outcomes of senior workers. Skills Supply Evidence shows movement towards increasing the supply of skills available to employers. This growth has been mainly due to a higher participation of women in education, especially at tertiary level, who are outperforming men. Nevertheless, although today one in four graduates major in STEM, women remain largely under-represented. Moreover, despite shifts in the skills profile of the workforce and the efforts of most countries working to increase the supply of high-skilled workers the occupational distribution has remained almost unchanged in the past decade. Labour market mismatches Labour markets are affected by several imbalances including various types of mismatches. ETF evidence shows that up to one in three workers can be mismatched, holding jobs requiring lower levels of formal qualifications. Labour market outcomes also continue to vary largely by age, educational attainment or gender, with young people, the lower-qualified and women very often penalised. The gender gap has not narrowed down in the past decade. Vocational education and training For vocational education and training graduates there has been a good progress over the past decade, and they can now enjoy similar employment patterns to their counterparts in higher education pathways. VET programmes remain effective in developing skills and ensuring a smooth and successful transition to the labour market. PURnAdCeTrIaCEchAiRevEeAmS enPtROJECTS & CAMPAIGNS REGIONS & COUNTRIES Schooling and learning don’t always go hand in hand and PUBLICATIONS & RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT the time spent in school may translate unevenly into learning. In one third of the partner countries, the gap can be as high as four years , suggesting a loss in human capital. At the end of compulsory schooling, in two-thirds of the partner countries, at least one in two students aged 15 lack the foundations skills with progress in tackling underachievement in key competences limited in most countries. Age, education and working status are all determinants of engagement in lifelong learning. Adults are most often unlikely to participate in further training, with negative consequences for their careers. Data availability and reliability Data availability is the most significant challenge for this compilation exercise which varies greatly among and within regions, for example in South Eastern Europe and Turkey there is high availability, yet quality varies between countries, and in Central Asia it is generally poorer than in other regions. The KIESE findings are limited only to countries where data is available, and this affects the overall analysis. Although the coverage of labour market indicators is generally satisfactory across the regions, the availability of other indicators, particularly education and training, remains limited.

At EU level adaption and delivery are key issues for Active Labour Market Policies with some countries using counselling measures to enable quicker job uptake. Examples were given of innovative ALMPs in response to COVID-19 challenges in the EU Neighbourhood and Central Asia countries. Raisa Dogaru, Director, Employment Agency of the Republic of Moldova, outlined how her country adapted to the COVID crisis by providing support to employers, boosting worker and unemployed protections and monitoring labour market trends. In the second session on skills and labour market transition focus was given to ways to respond to the needs of young people, and how to build resilience, skills and employment. Afshan Khan, Director, UNICEF Europe and Central Asia Regional Ofice, drew attention to the speciic challenges of young people as students in this COVID era. Moreover, the ETF Director, Cesare Onestini, noted how young people are at the fringe of social dialogue and have little representation at policy level which can reinforce existing vulnerabilities. ‘ETF together with UNICEF and other partners are working to make sure their voices are heard by policy makers’, said Onestini. Within this context the indings of the UNICEF-ETF study ‘Preventing a ‘Lockdown Generation’ in Europe and Central Asia: Building Resilient Societies with Young People in the Era of COVID-19’ were presented.

Jeroen Willems, Deputy Head of Unit in the Directorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations , European Commission, introduced the goals of the New Deal for Youth in the Eastern Partnership region and expected beneits for youth employability. To set the context of the second day of the event about managing the impact of the health crisis and the digital and green transitions, the results of a global survey undertaken by ETF and UNIDO in 2020 on the impact of COVID on industrial irms were presented. Some 42% of those surveyed expect to need different kinds of skills in the future, particularly ICT and soft skills, and the results demonstrated that the pandemic is accelerating already existing trends. Biljana Radonjic Ker-Lindsay, Associate Director, Access to Skills and Employment - Gender and Economic Inclusion, EBRD, in her presentation highlighted the disproportionate effect on women of the COVID crisis and lockdowns, partly because they tend to take greater responsibility for taking care of children and the elderly. Women are also at higher risk of replacement by digitalisation and automation. “Skills development programmes need to concentrate on gender equality measures,” Radonjic Ker-Lindsay concluded. Turning to the development of green skills, Riccardo Savigliano, Chief of Agro-industries and Skills Development, UNIDO, urged attention to ensure education and training are seen as investments and not costs, which is sometimes dificult for cash-strapped SMEs. The green approach should also adopt the old adage, “think globally but act locally.” Savigliano highlighted how once again the COVID crisis has accelerated already existing trends. Xavier Matheu de Cortada, head of Policy Unit, ETF, concluded the session and event by announcing the ETF’s new programme 'Skills for Enterprise Development' which will be launched in 2021 to support enterprises in ETF’s partner countries with skilling and reskilling.

The COVID-19 pandemic is forcing country after country to enact stringent social distancing measures to interrupt the chain of contagion and save lives. This is disrupting social and economic life on an unparalleled scale. As governments struggle to deal with the medical emergency, communities, families and individuals strive to maintain a semblance of ordinary life amidst the threat of sickness and death. Sadly, far too many of us have had to deal with the reality of illness and bereavement, and my deepest sympathies go out to them. From our base in Italy, I would like to send a message of solidarity to all the countries where we work in the EU neighbourhood, and beyond. We will do everything in our PpRoAwCeTrICwEitAhRiEnAtShe sPcRoOpJeECoTfSo&urCmAMaPnAdIaGtNeSto sRuEpGpIOoNrtSy&oCuOUNTRIES through these dificult times. And I would also like to send PaUmBLeIsCsAaTgIOeNoSf &hoRpEeS.OWUReCcEaSn gNeEt WthSrRoOuOghM t&hEisVtEoNgTeStheArB. WOUeT need to start looking ahead at how we can support each other, at what we can learn for education and training systems and at how we can mobilise the power of our community of ideas and dedicated professionals. Learning will keep connecting us Social distancing measures to combat COVID-19 have had a massive impact on education and training in Italy and elsewhere. Schools and training centres have had to close from one day to the next. Students, apprentices and trainees have had to stay home. We are witnessing a universal, system-wide - and in many cases improvised - experiment in distance and online learning. It is happening now, and it is happening here all around us. Schools, teachers, students and their families are all struggling to adapt, and inventing and innovating as they go along. Our campaign #LearningConnects To help all the countries where we work deal with this unprecedented challenge and ensure that learning continues to connect individuals and institutions, we are launching a new initiative focusing on how education and training systems, businesses, schools, teachers, students and their families can adapt to the challenges of teaching and learning at a distance, often using unfamiliar and untried technology and imperfect systems and infrastructure. Our campaign is mutually reinforcing with the UNESCO Global Education Coalition. Over the coming weeks through our social media channels we will be collecting your stories in our partner countries and around the world with a view to understanding the challenges being faced, the successes and inspirational stories emerging, so that we can promote the exchange of practice, tools and materials, and provide targeted expertise to see us through this crisis. So join us on our communication platform, Open Space , and share your personal stories on how you are coping in your country, in your town, in your school, your class, your family and even with yourself.

The ETF has closed its headquarters and its entire staff is now working from home using online communication tools and teamworking technology. We are reviewing our work programme and accelerating plans already under way to digitalise our working methods and replace as far as possible physical interactions with virtual ones.

PWRAhCyTaICnEEATRFEiAnSnovPaRtOioJnECaTnSd&sCkAilMlsPAAIwGaNrSd? REGIONS & COUNTRIES In a world of constantly changing labour market demands, NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT people are having to learn new skills, change jobs and take up new occupations throughout their careers. This is due to a combination of different factors, such as accelerating technological advances, digitalisation of economies, globalisation, demography, migration and climate change. While the full magnitude and ultimate effects of these changes are not yet fully known and their impact will vary from country to country, education and training systems need the capacity to develop services and tools that support teachers, providers and learners and that provide the right skills that are needed by labour markets. More learner-centred approaches are gaining ground globally. Active learning is vital to develop the competences of citizens and achieve better learning outcomes for successful careers and lives. Roles and functions of educators are evolving, as they become learning facilitators who share responsibility for results with the learner. PUBLICATIONS & RESOURCES Lifelong learning is already a reality in people’s lives, but more investment is needed in continuing education and training, including non-formal and in-formal learning. Initial training and formal systems are of course important, but learners will ind they spend a greater and growing share of their learning informally or non-formally. Technology drives this trend forward. Indeed, these boundaries - between general and vocational streams and between formal and on-the-job learning - will continue to blur. Learning provision should evolve to address individual needs and be more widely available to everyone throughout their lives. Education and training systems will have to become more ambitious and innovative to cater to the reality of individualised pathways, and age-neutral institutions and systems to support individuals in their transitions between work and learning throughout their lives. What is the focus of the 2020 award? Digital technology is transforming our societies. Digital competence, as one of the EU key competences, is becoming increasingly instrumental in almost all aspects of our lives, but in employability and career development in particular. Digital transformation is, to varying degrees, PhRaApCpTeICnEinAgReEvAeSrywPhReOrJeE.CTThSe&ECTAFMisPAsuIGpNpSortiRnEgGiItOsNpSa&rtCnOeUr NTRIES countries to reap the opportunities it offers by addressing NdEigWitSaRlOcOhaMll&enEgVeEsNTinS thAeBcOoUnTtext of ongoing VET system reforms. In this context, the ETF is seeking examples of good practice in teaching and learning for digital competence [1] development. Learning design and new/innovative approaches to the development of digital competences are the key selection criteria. Examples of good practice will be chosen taking into consideration the national, regional or organisational context and the relevance of the example to this context. The examples selected will inform future ETF work and will provide teachers, curriculum specialists, training providers and policymakers with ideas and opportunities for their own work. What is the EU doing? The EU supports the development of digital competence by developing reference frameworks for citizens, educators and organisations , as well as a self-assessment tool for schools . They are inspiring sources for practitioners and policy makers, with examples of concrete learning outcomes and progression levels. A Digital Education Action Plan undertakes concrete actions and supports technology use and the development of digital competences in education. At policy level, digital competence has been one of the eight key competences for lifelong learning for EU citizens since 2006, building the basis for policy development for details).

ABOUT But providing a sustainable environment for the students who live, study, eat and socialise on campus is not the only remarkable thing about the Centre of Excellence. Investing in digital skills has long been a focus and the Centre has participated in a raft of digital competency projects that include the EU's eTWINNING project, a nationwide digital programme sponsored by the Liechtenstein Development Service. To further embedding digital learning - and distance learning made essential by the restrictions of the global COVID pandemic this year - the Centre has developed its own tailored digital training programme for staff as part of its commitment to continuous professional development. Under the guidance of Sergiu Coceas, Head of Continuous Training, it is this programme that makes the Centre for Excellence in Construction one of two nominees for the European Training Foundation's Innovation and Skills Award as part of the European Vocational Skills Week, November 9-13. Sergiu designed and implemented a course designed to help staff at the centre shift to distance learning for construction students. The course highlights the need for teaching methodology tailored to distance learning using digital tools with a particular focus on assisting students to create digital portfolios of their work and products. The course is also designed to help widen the Centre's approach to lifelong learning and blended adult training. Teachers are taught to understand how to facilitate individual and group training via digital means; designing distance learning courses; develop and direct their own training process; cooperate with other training and integrate new digital skills into their existing skills set.

T ""The pandemic period has shown that increasing awareness of the attitudes of people can serve as a strong booster for efforts in strengthening new learning opportunities,"" Sergiu says. Although many of the teachers had experienced steep learning curves, having mastered the new online approach, they had found a renewed conidence, he adds. ""The impact of the course is seen in better results for students, greater conidence in the teachers and visible improvements in the quality of distance studies."" The course has overcome the challenge of using distance learning to teach practical skills by developing speciic tasks for students who must develop portfolios that detail performance speciications, lists of tools, diagrams of workplace practices, lists of materials and quantities and other criteria. In this way a thorough understanding of the student's practical knowledge is obtained - and photographs of completed projects indicate quality, Sergiu says. ""I believe that distance learning will become the norm even after returning to traditional classes as it allows fexible access, repeated viewings, use by multiple teachers and eficiency: once developed material can be re-used and reined,"" he says. ""And teachers can free up time for more individual attention to student needs.""

It reviews policy reforms to manage the transition of education, training and lifelong learning systems across the four regions of the ETF’s partner countries: South Eastern Europe and Turkey , Eastern Partnership , Southern and Eastern Mediterranean and Central Asia. Although the paper was completed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic its analysis, discussion and recommendations are even more relevant at this time in planning for the future and to the ETF's #learningconnects campaign. What are the general trends? Skills for the future PGRloAbCTaIlCisEatAioRnEAisS imPpRaOcJtEinCgTSth&eCeAnMvPirAoIGnNmSentR, EcGuIlOtuNrSe&, COUNTRIES political systems, economic development and prosperity, PaUnBdLwICeAlTl-IbOeNiSng& RinESsOocUiReCtiEeSs wNorElWdwSRidOeO. MTh&e EimVEpNaTcSts oAfBOUT specific global trends vary by geographical, regional and socioeconomic contexts. Climate change A sustainable economy is one of the three pillars of the Europe 2020 Strategy with the aim of promoting the transformation towards an inclusive green economy that generates growth, creates jobs and helps reduce poverty through sustainable management of natural capital. Managing the life cycle of natural resources, moving to a circular economy where nothing is wasted, and the shift to renewable energy leads to many changes and requirements in jobs, skills and education. The renewable energy sector, for example, employs a higher share of skilled workers than most activities in primary fuels. Digitalisation/automation Among future drivers impacting work and skills are digitalisation, automation and robotics, especially in routine occupations. A blurring of sectors will also occur. Digital progress will not benefit everyone equally, and it could leave many workers behind through lack of access and skills. Preparation for the digital era and the impact of automation require proactive reforms in education, VET and lifelong learning systems as well as in labour and employment policies. What are the challenges faced by ETF partner countries? Specific challenges concern labour markets, especially youth and female unemployment and inequality; demographic challenges together with migration lows and ‘brain drain’; the impacts of climate change and diminishing natural resources; and increasing political instability. Demographic dynamics and migration lows ETF’s partner countries vary widely in terms of aging or large youth populations, and migration lows which may cause them to lose skilled people or experience inlows of unskilled migrants. Demographic ageing is relevant in the PSREAECTT GaIOnNdSE&aPCOUNTRIES regions, whereas the ‘youth bulge’ in the SEMED region P NisTlSikelAyBtOoUT be maintained for the next two decades at least. Opportunities exist in all scenarios, but workers need to have the right set of skills. In countries with an ageing population, for instance, there are growing demands on the education system to provide opportunities for adult reskilling and upskilling. And the challenge in countries with large youth populations is to offset early school leaving and those who are not in education, employment or training . What are the factors affecting ability to cope? Changes in labour markets and key factors include: relative size of the youth population, participation in tertiary education and public expenditure on education as a percentage of countries’ gross domestic product , and employment by broad economic sectors. What actions are proposed? Policy responses and strategic choices of the ETF’s partner countries are discussed and two actions are proposed to develop skills, education and learning systems. The first is to make a future-oriented projection of the key economic and technological sectors and their related skills needs in the future; the second is to make a future-oriented projection of the required education, VET and lifelong learning systems. What are the conditions? The development of labour markets, occupational compositions, and education, VET and lifelong learning systems require a well-planned and proactive long-term strategy, policy action plan and evidence-based monitoring system. The contextual socioeconomic and technological factors of work and skills strategies in the ETF’s partner countries are of crucial importance. Improving the economy and mitigating socioeconomic issues, such as corruption and inequality, are also considered key conditions for fostering sufficient investments.

PUBLICATIONS & RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT We strive to make vocational education and training more responsive to labour markets and to equip young people with the skills they need on the labour market. Education, especially vocational education and training is always an investment, for governments, for employers, for young people, and for parents, and it needs to be well informed and positioned. Young people have the right to training that is relevant and equips them with the skills that allow them to gain decent employment, that is not precarious, but gives them a long-term perspective, a career development perspective, so that they can build a livelihood for themselves. We promote employment, equality, social protection, social dialogue, and respect of labour rights. We promote decent work for all which includes young people, young women, young men, those living in rural areas, those with disabilities, migrants, those from minority communities in countries. Everyone should profit from vocational education and training and have access to decent work. What is the ILO doing in the region you are working in now? The ILO office in Budapest works in Central and Eastern Europe and we concentrate mainly on the six Balkan economies, Ukraine, and Moldova. We support member states to improve their skills system in all aspects, including vocational education and training. We work to promote work-based learning and development and the standards of vocational education and training institutes. We base our interventions on the needs and requests of our constituents: governments – the Ministries of Labour, and Ministries of Education, employer organisations and trade unions. Can you give us an example of a project? In Ukraine we are helping to modernise the curriculum of Technical Vocational Education and Training at local level.

The Ministry of Education accepted our recommendations. They are now included in the further development of dual education, including its corporation in higher education. Why is dual education and work-based learning important for young people? Work-based learning and dual education allow for systemic and tacit learning, which is only possible in the workplace, by working alongside others. Not everything can be learned at school or in a workshop. Trainees are exposed to business processes and technology, as well as day to day work. It is very important for young people to understand the dynamics of the workplace, how to work with people, liaise with clients, how to ask for help, and how to resolve problems. Dual education is also a match-making process. Many companies use dual training as a recruitment mechanism. It gives the trainee the chance to understand how they feel about the job and the company, to know if it is the right choice for them. What are the successful ingredients of policies to promote youth employment, particularly to support the transition to work? All stakeholders relevant to the world of work must be included, employers’ organisations, business associations, workers associations and representatives of workers to ensure their voices are heard. Young people and their parents, youth organisations or NGOs that represent specific groups or communities, for example persons with disabilities or migrants or certain minorities, also need to be on board. What is the ILO doing to promote social dialogue? In the Eastern European region, the ILO works closely with economic and social councils, these are tripartite councils with employers and workers’ representatives. This can PhRaApCpTeICnEaAt RnEaAtiSonaPlRleOvJeElC, TwSh&eCreAMsoPcAiaIGl NdSialoRgEuGeIOisNvSe&ryCOUNTRIES important for developing policies on wages, social PpUroBtLeICcAtiToInO,NaSn&dRcEruSOciUaRllCyEfoSr vNocEaWtiSoRnOaOl Med&uEcVaEtiNoTnSandABOUT training. It is basically any interaction between workers’ representatives, mainly trade unions, and employers’ representatives. It needs to be shaped to respond to the needs of people, including young people, in a way that is fair and inclusive. It needs to cope with disruptions and transitions, as we have just seen with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Social dialogue can also take place at local and sectoral level. Can you share an example? The ILO is involved in a development project in North Macedonia that supports social dialogue at the local level. We work with the local economic and social councils in different areas including employment promotion for young people, improving neighbourhood relationships, and training for the economic and social councils to engage in VET and identify the skills needed. This is a good example of multi-stakeholder engagement at local government level for finding local solutions to improve VET, industry productivity, and youth employability. Understanding what the local community level needs and feeding back into national policy making is one of most important ingredients of successful national policy making. Tell us about ILO’s work using the sectorial approach? Understanding the skills needs within a specific industry, region or company is necessary to ensure the curricula, teachers’ capacities, and TVET standards respond to the latest developments. Every sector is different, and every sub-sector is different, so we need to listen to the actors and understand the labour market needs to make TVET as relevant as possible. Skills development is complex and approaching this from the sector level allows it to be broken down and create an entry point. Different line ministries and businesses for the sector also need to be engaged. It is important to pay attention to growth sectors which, with the proper investment, provide high potential for creating jobs along the production chains and may bring quicker returns in job creation. PDRoACyoTIuCEhAavReEAaSny ePxRaOmJEpClTeSs&toCAshMaPrAeIGwNiSth uRsEiGnIOthNeS & COUNTRIES region? PUBLICATIONS & RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT The ILO has been working in Albania, based on a request from the employers’ organisations in the wine producing sector to increase skills matching with graduates. We targeted family businesses where there is a need to export and diversify their products. Skills needed to benefit the sector included production techniques, marketing, commerce and trade, and tourism. Developing the sector benefited young people by enhancing the economy in rural areas allowing them to remain where they grew up and build livelihoods. What for you are the key components for youth employability? Work-based learning and career guidance are fundamental. Young people need exposure to the workplace as early as possible so that they can develop realistic expectations of what the labour market looks like and explore their aspirations, understand themselves, and where their passions lie. Often, they must decide about their professional careers when very young, as early as 14. We have to help them to make the right decisions.  Did you like this article?

A series of detailed policy guidance notes on instruments such as formula funding, company incentives, and training levies complements this report. What is VET inancing? VET inancing is distinct from other VET-related policy domains in that it is both a general condition and a speciic area of VET reform. VET inance requires a larger set of dedicated governance tools.

Rather than merely a technical issue, inancing is considered as a tool for steering policies. What is an effective VET inancing system? An effective inancing system relies on governance principles, such as transparency, accountability and eficiency, translated into rules, procedures and mechanisms. It needs to be supported by robust data gathering, including information about costs, and a rigorous approach to budgeting. Its functions are fulilled by a range of stakeholders from the public and private sectors. It is anchored in national priorities and objectives. How can the ETF approach help? Using the VET Financing Prism encourages refection about speciic inancing measures seen from a policy perspective that take account of the key policy goals of the VET sector. It veriies whether and how a country’s VET strategy has been costed, if there is a clear and realistic identiication of resources to be mobilised to cover these costs, and if the inancing mechanisms in place can guarantee effective implementation. It can also be used to identify strengths, risks and areas for improvement in governance and inancing, as well as an input to policy dialogue between the EU and partner countries. Finally, it may be used as a method for measuring policy progress over time in these two areas. Who can beneit?

The e-toolkit was developed to reach a wider audience following the success of the training in a classroom format. Where can I ind the e-Toolkit? The course is available in the ETF Open Space. Users can self-train and learn at their own pace through a series of interactive modules to acquire an initial definition and concept of skills matching right through to understanding the phenomenon’s many elements and overall complexity. Why is it needed? Policy makers, practitioners and social partners recognise skills mismatch as a major challenge. Skills mismatch negatively affects labour market outcomes, workers’ productivity, economic growth contributing to unemployment, and unfulfilled job vacancies. Low-quality education, demographic change, rapid technological development, new sources of job creation and new forms of work organisation. The various forms of skills mismatch are very different in terms of how they manifest themselves, how they are measured, what causes them and their consequences, and the policy approaches required to respond to these challenges.  Did you like this article?

Most countries in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean have burgeoning youth populations and low jobs growth. Creating one’s own business is an important outlet for young people with ideas and energy and limited prospects of formal employment. And even if it does not lead to a start-up, entrepreneurial learning equips young people with soft skills and transversal competences, such as creativity, working with others, spotting opportunities and taking the initiative, that stand them in good stead in PcRhAaCllTeInCgEiAnRgElAabSouPrRmOaJErkCeTtSs&. TChAeMimPApIGoNrtSancReEoGfIONS & COUNTRIES entrepreneurship education is one conclusion of a EreScOeUnRtCEETSF sNtuEdWySoRnOOthMe&siEtuVaEtNioTSn ofABOUT young people in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean, entitled Youth in Transition: Proiles and characteristics to untap youth potential in the SEMED region. Among the countries of the region, Tunisia is in the forefront of developing an entrepreneurial culture among young people as part of its national entrepreneurship strategy. Supported by the European Union and other international donors, this strategy aims at embedding entrepreneurship at all levels of education, supporting young entrepreneurs through access to financing, support services and public contacts, and reducing administrative hurdles for start-ups. The European Training Foundation has been playing its part by supporting the Tunisian government in making entrepreneurial competences an integral part of vocational education and training in the country. Long- term cooperation on this between the ETF and the Tunisian Ministry for Vocational Training and Employment and latterly the Ministry of Youth, Sport and Occupational Integration started in 2015 following the assessment of the implementation of the Small Business Act for Europe in Tunisia, which recommended an action plan to develop entrepreneurial skills at all levels of education and training. Annual Forums on the development of the entrepreneurial spirit have served to discuss and disseminate the results of this ambitious project, which include the adoption of a national charter for the development of the entrepreneurial spirit at all levels of education; the creation of teaching materials based on the European reference framework for entrepreneurial competences ; the nationwide rollout of an entrepreneurial learning programme, backed by teacher training and coaching and sharing of good practices; and the development of an assessment framework inspired by EntreComp to measure students’ acquisition of entrepreneurial skills.

The sixth edition of the national ABOUT Forum on the development of the entrepreneurial spirit, held online on November 18, 2020, looked at the potential of entrepreneurship to transform vocational training centres themselves. “We’re talking about a global entrepreneurial approach,” said Riadh Chaoued, Chief of Staff of the Tunisian Ministry of Youth, Sport and Occupational Integration, “an approach embracing the entire training centre and involving its internal and external stakeholders. We’re talking about a proactive and dynamic centre with real leadership that identifies and seizes opportunities in its environment; a centre that motivates its staff and encourages them to take initiatives, to innovate and create value.” Bringing key actors and stakeholders in vocational training together with government representatives, and local, international and ETF experts, the Forum discussed the development of a quality label to embed the concept of the enterprising training centre, with a view to building a network of such centres in Tunisia. The Forum considered a conceptual framework for the enterprising training centre and a self-assessment tool to support training centres in measuring their progress towards this model. “Over six years of intensive cooperation with our Tunisian partners, we have moved from seeing the entrepreneurial mindset as something that vocational schools should teach to seeing it as something that should be part of their DNA”, said ETF expert and project leader Mariavittoria Garlappi. “Vocational schools have to respond to the needs of the communities and businesses they serve, and an enterprising outlook is vital to succeed in this.” This agenda will be taken forward as part of the ETF Network for Excellence, a new initiative aimed at promoting excellence in vocational education and training.

A team that works well together has become a priority goal for people managers and educators globally – yet remains dificult to achieve. True collaboration requires good relationships and a safe environment, which in turn are built on a foundation of self mastery, emotional intelligence and empathy and respect for others. These are the themes Kornélia touches on in the video below, in the context of collaborative learning. She approaches the EntreComp PlayBook, where collaboration is one of the nine principles that can guide the design and implementation of entrepreneurial learning. “No successful projects or ideas are just the result of one person,” Kornélia argues in the video introduction. She shares the experience of her irst failed project, her method of teaching students how to collaborate, project management techniques, and the tools for self- exploration and building relationships with which she empowers her students. In her own words, “I need to know my strengths. I need to know my emotions and how to manage my emotions. And then of course I can develop my empathy for others.” Kornélia teaches Hotel Management, Tourism Business and Economy at the Hotel Academy in Bratislava, Slovakia. She is an ambassador of eTwinning and a moderator of an eTwinning group, “Entrepreneurship in Education” with more than 5000 members. Kornélia has created an Entrepreneurial learning toolkit for teachers called “EntreLearn”.

Over the past three years a National Mobility Programme Training Worldwide - which covers all countries not eligible for Erasmus+ progammes - had involved 1,300 apprentices and trainers in 250 separate projects, often designed and implemented by companies themselves with the fund's backing. Mostly micro-programmes specifically tailored to a company's needs, the trainings were focused on key export partners - the US and China . Dita Traidas, president of WorldSkills Europe, spoke of the importance of celebrating international skills competitions as a driver for developing better qualifications networks and state of the art skills in young people. The international skills Olympics enabled industry to set new agendas for market relevant skills and for international benchmarking to be achieved, she said. Prof. Joachim James Calleja, President of European Forum for Vocational Education and head of a large technical college in Malta, agreed: ""The target with VET is to have a workforce prepared to hit the ground running; industry moves at a faster pace than VET. Enhanced skills and competencies is what we are aiming for through international cooperation in skills provision,"" he noted. Soo-Hyang Choi, Director, UNESCO-UNEVOC International Center for Technical and Vocational Education and Training sounded a warning bell, warning that the pandemic may produce ""in the short term a chilled appetite for international cooperation"" as politicians sought protectionist measures; but the modern economy was now so interconnected that it would actually drive a greater need for ""more cooperation, collaboration and harmonization of qualifications."" The ETF's experience in supporting the development of policies for the provision of better internationally integrated skills provision, demonstrated the demand PthRAatCTeIxCisEtAedREaAcSrossPREOUJEpCaTrtSn&erCAcoMuPnAtIrGieNsS, ETRFEGdIiOreNcSto&rCOUNTRIES Cesare Onestini said. PUBLICATIONS & RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT The key challenge in supporting international skills was in implementation - being clear about goals, understanding cultural and systemic differences and unleashing the energy of those committed to change, he said. ""We need clarity of goals - is this political or industry driven - to promote economic growth, sustainability, inclusiveness and the green agenda."" The ETF saw its role as bridge building and supporting the development of new qualification networks, he added. Tamar Kitiashvili, Georgia's deputy education minister, said as a new EU associate member, the country was prioritizing on raising qualifications to international standards. ""Although not yet a member of the European Qualification Network we target the benchmarking of our qualifications to those standards,"" she noted. Barbara Rambousek, Director, Gender and Economic Inclusion at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said that bank recognized the role skills training could play in building a green, digital, inclusive and sustainable economy. She noted that bank backing for raising qualification standards - for example in Georgia's healthcare professional training - could play an essential role in supporting economic development, particularly at a time of pandemic. ""Although VET internationalization is sometimes resisted - it is seen as encouraging brain drains - development benefits from VET systems that are tuned to international standards is a hallmark of a country's move towards a sustainable economy working within the international global economy,"" she added.  Did you like this article?

Changes ushered in to maintain learning have marked a turning point in the uptake of distance digital learning offering potential to enhance access and better respond to the needs of learners. Nevertheless, issues remain concerning the quality of the education and training provided, and equity in terms of who can benefit from which type of education and training, and who is excluded.

Ensuring adequate internet connection, equipment, and surroundings conducive to learning for everyone are critical issues causing concern. Moreover, vocational education and training has suffered from a shortage of digital content on technical and specialist subjects, and learners have missed out on the valuable practice-based components of their courses. The ETF’s events such as webinars and Facebook Live interviews, as part of our #learningconnects campaign, provided opportunities to exchange experience and practice amongst policy makers and practitioners throughout 2020. We conveyed perspectives from various stakeholders from the public, private and civic spheres at both national and international level who revealed, in spite of the difficulties, an explosion of creativity, innovation and ingenuity amongst education systems, schools, teachers and learners in response to the crisis. Preparations for the future In September 2020 the European Commission announced its vision of the European Education Area to be achieved by 2025 which consists of six dimensions: quality, inclusion and gender equality, green and digital transitions, teachers, higher education, and a stronger Europe in the world. Within this context a new Digital Education Action Plan was adopted which refects lessons learned from the coronavirus crisis and aims for a high-performing digital education ecosystem. Targeted actions and resources are foreseen for the EU’s neighbouring regions due to the exacerbated inequalities as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic as highlighted in the ETF’s mapping reports. The European Union adopted the Economic and Investment Plan for the Western Balkans in October 2020.

This is one of the indings of the “Key Indicators on Education, Skills and Employment” report, which has just been published by the European Training Foundation . Developing Skills for the Labour Market progress monitoring PYRoAuCthTICuEneAmREpAlSoymPeRnOtJEcoCnTSti&nuCeAsMtPoArIeGmNSainRhEigGhIOiNnSm&aCnOyUNTRIES EU neighbourhood countries. In 2018 it affected about half PoUf ByLoIuCnAgTIOpNeoSp&leREinSOKUoRsoCvEoS*, NNoErWthSMROaOceMd&onEViaE, NJoTSrdanABoOrUT Palestine** and about one in three in several other countries, including Albania, Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Montenegro and Serbia . Youth transition remains problematic in most EU neighbouring countries, with persistently high numbers who are not in employment, education or training . In 2018, one in three young people in Algeria, Kosovo* and Palestine** and one in four young people in most of the other countries for which there is data available were classiied as NEETs. Young girls are typically over- represented in this group, and in some countries the proportion of young girls who are NEETs is close to 40%. NEETs are at higher risk of being socially and economically excluded, and so are more likely to become vulnerable in the long term. However, vocational education can be effective in developing skills and ensuring a smooth and successful transition into the labour market. In nearly all countries for which there is data available, employment rates tend to be higher among young adults who graduated from vocational training than among those who pursued an upper secondary general programme. For example, in 2018 around half of recent graduates from vocational education and training programmes in Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Turkey were employed. This shows that vocational skills can fast track young adults from education to the world of work. Keeping Young People in Education Vocational programmes can be successful in preventing early leaving from education and training. The proportion of early leavers remains high in some countries, affecting one in three young people in Turkey and Palestine and two in ive young people in Albania and Moldova . PKReAeCpTinICgE yAoRuEnAgS pePoRpOleJEiCnTeSd&uCcAatMioPnAIwGNhSile uRpEsGkIOillNinSg&tChOemUNTRIES through vocational qualiications has proved to be a PsUuBccLIeCsAsTfuIOl NpSol&icRyEoSpOtUioRnCEfoSr soNmEWe ScRoOuOnMtri&esE. VFEeNwTeSr thAaBnOUT 10% of 18-24-year-olds dropped out of school in countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia and North Macedonia in 2018. All these countries are similar in that they have a very high proportion of upper secondary students enrolled in vocational programmes. Conversely, in Palestine, the incidence of early leaving remains higher while the number of vocational students is relatively lower. Reducing the incidence of early leaving is an important element in mitigating the risk of social exclusion. High-quality vocational education systems can help in this respect by providing second-chance education programmes for young people who have dropped out of school and are more at risk of having low skill levels and becoming unemployed. The Power of Skills “On the eve of a new decade it’s imperative to focus on relevant training and skills that will help young people enter the workforce and survive and thrive. As we face the challenges and opportunities of globalisation, digitisation, migration and the green transition head on, the power of skills should be recognised. It can help young people ind jobs or start their own business, underpin economic and social development and lay the foundation for stability and prosperity in the EU’s neighbouring countries”, said Cesare Onestini, Director of the ETF. ‘As we start the countdown to the deadline for the Sustainable Development Goals of 2030, without the clear engagement of all relevant actors the goals will not be achieved and we will miss the opportunity to provide better jobs for all’.

Each project was designed by local actors to initiate or refresh implementation of reforms in professional development, and to inform policy-making and wider implementation. The ETF supported the projects through funding and professional expertise. Learning arising from the ‘demonstration project’ approach Innovative teaching and learning Enter search t Targeted training needs analysis is fundamental to ensure training meets VET teachers needs.

Montenegro, for example, provided industrial placements for VET teachers thanks to the cooperation of the Chamber of the Economy, the Ministry of Education and the VET Centre. An explicit learning agenda allows other teacher trainers to understand the learning objectives, teaching methods, learning activities and desired learning outcomes. Follow-up mentoring of trainees is an important factor in the learning process, particularly in cases where training was cascaded to other teachers by participants, as in the case studies from Kosovo and Turkey. Monitoring and evaluation throughout the project cycle is essential, particularly when results inform decisions leading to wider implementation and the design of subsequent phases. Learning accrued from the project experience is also necessary when a pilot project is not immediately continued to inform future endeavours. A clear networking, communication and dissemination strategy should be established at the outset of demonstration projects. Cooperation amongst teachers and the exchange of best practices with policy makers and other key stakeholders and public proiling of experience are key components of successful programmes and ensuring sustainability.  Did you like this article?

The ETF Network for Excellence - which has been working since February and already has more than 90 members in EU neighbouring countries - recognises the growing strategic role vocational education and training has to play in skills development. The launch - celebrated with a round of prosecco by ETF staffers in Turin at the end of a four hour long online conference ""Centres of Vocational Excellence as Engines for vocational education and training Development"" Digital skills & learning P-RreAlCeTIcCtEs AthReEAinScrePaRsOinJgECimTSp&orCtAaMncPeAItGhNeSEURiEsGpIuOtNtiSn&gCoOnUNTRIES skills development as a key tool for economic PdUeBvLeIlCoApTmIOeNnSt,&soRcEiSaOl UinRcCluESsionNaEnWdSRsuOsOtaMin&aEbVilEitNyT. S ABOUT Promoting the development of networks of vocational excellence among EU neighbours is part of a broader strategy to increase the relevance and functionality of skills development within the context of innovation, business and stakeholder networks and promotion of green and digital agendas to help make Europe ""crisis proof"" as Manuela Geleng, director for Skills at the EC's DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, put it in opening remarks. ""Vocational excellence is at the core of our drive to modernise VET in Europe and it is a pleasure to see it is also being taken forward by ETF and its partner countries,"" Ms Geleng said. ""Our agenda is to achieve a sustainable, fair and crisis proof society in the EU. We aim to provide a resilient and excellent skill-set for every worker, including transversal skills and skills for life. ""Vocational education and training system need to be in the driving seat of change to successfully address challenges to skills development, digitalisation and climate change."" Cesare Onestini, ETF director, noted that the ENE network had grown quickly since it began working in February and now had more than 90 members in 35 countries. ""Excellence is the way the EU wants VET providers to position their offer,"" he said. ""Excellence is about many things and that is why the network has at its core internationalisation - which is where the ETF comes in, trying to build synergy and cooperation between international partners."" Clear goals and a solid understanding of why becoming part of a network had advantages were needed along with the necessary motivation to improve and develop, he added.

Both were exemplars for what networks of excellence could achieve, he said. Participants in the conference - followed by up to 200 people - noted that by working collaboratively and pooling resources and ideas, CoVE networks could become ""greater than the sum of their parts."" The ETF is offering the network guidance, feedback and monitoring via a system of self-assessment that is already being piloted in 11 countries and around 70 centres of excellence. The assessment will be repeated next year to give a baseline for reference as the network develops. Xavier Matheu de Cortada, Head of Policy Unit, at the ETF, in concluding remarks, said: ""Centres for excellence are a breeding ground for innovation; they support social needs and cooperate with enterprises and create research and development. To do all this is no longer a one man show."" A follow up conference is planned in Turin, March 11 and 12, 2021 - pandemic restrictions permitting.

The post-2020 European policy framework on vocational education and training was discussed at the high-level joint Cedefop/ETF virtual conference ‘Enhancing European cooperation in VET: looking back – planning ahead’ , on 30 June and 1 July. Over 190 experts, stakeholders, European Commission, government and social partner representatives joined forces to debate the role and future of VET at a time of unprecedented challenge due to the coronavirus pandemic. Among the speakers were European Commission Vice President Margaritis Schinas, European Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights Nicolas Schmit, the Croatian Minister for Science and Education Βlaženka Divjak, the German Federal Minister for Education and Research Anja Karliczek, and the Greek Minister for Education and Religious Affairs Niki Kerameus. LearningConnects is critical for upskilling and reskilling EU citizens and creating a dynamic workforce, ready to respond to the economic and societal challenges ahead, and allow a smooth transition to a digital and greener economy. Cedefop Executive Director Jürgen Siebel said: ‘While further developing initial VET should remain an essential aim, European policy needs to strengthen CVET to ensure that the new job opportunities created by the transformations of the economy will outstrip job displacement. […] Policy efforts and cooperation should continue toward a “European VET area”, adopting a forward-looking perspective and ensuring attractive, inclusive and relevant initial VET systems for both learners and companies.’ ETF Director Cesare Onestini said: ‘Our work with countries in the neighbourhood of the EU shows that they share the same aspirations as EU Members to put human capital development at the core of their growth and prosperity agendas. As a reaction to the pandemic crisis we see some promising responses but also challenging trends, and the need to focus further on promoting training for excellence and inclusion: a key leverage towards economic development.’ In his address at the conference, Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights Nicolas Schmit announced the European Commission’s new proposal for a Council recommendation on vocational education and training, including a package of initiatives to support youth employment and skills policies. He said that this recommendation ‘will go beyond supporting young people; it is also about encouraging adults in employment for 15 or 20 years to keep learning and change careers without necessarily following long degrees.’ He also complimented Cedefop and ETF on the quality of their work, which he described as ‘a real goldmine to tap into’. In the closing session, European Commission Vice President Margaritis Schinas said that the Commission’s new package of initiatives is novel, ambitious, measurable and inclusive, adding: ‘We all agree that this is a moment we can proclaim that Europe PUBLICATIONS & RESOURCES PbRaAdClyTInCeEeAdRsEaASskillPsRrOeJvEoCluTtSio&nC.

""In this context it is extremely important to see the links between what we are doing in terms of investment in people with overall education reforms,"" Mr. Maragos added. ""The EU is ready to partner and cooperate with all the key stakeholders in the process [of education and training reform] - but the main tasks ahead are with the national stakeholders and governments."" Picking up on his comments, ETF Director, Cesare Onestini, said the pandemic had accelerated processes that had already been put into motion, including widening attention to vocational training as ""part of the general challenge of raising educational standards"" and a greater focus on expert assessment of national reform proposals. ""There is a growing awareness as a result of pandemic that education and training are in need of reform and investment,"" Mr. Onestini said. ""Teaching and learning has moved to being a frontline area of the response to the pandemic to respond and upgrade the capacity of each country to meet the needs of citizens for training and retraining."" Armenian delegate, Armen Avagyan noted that among the key challenges revealed by the pandemic was the dificulty of making training and labour market forecasts.

The European Training Foundation has presented findings of a research mapping skills policy and support measures in Lebanon at a high-level workshop and learning programme in Beirut. The research, the first of its kind, shows that a national mobility strategy would help Lebanon better utilise the skills of refugees, foreign workers, migrants, expatriates and returnees. PBRuAilCdTiInCgE uApRoEAnSthePiRnOvJeEnCtToSry&oCfAMMiPgAraIGnNt SSupRpEoGrItOMNSea&sCuOreUsNTRIES from the Employment and Skills Perspective , PthUeBLEICTAFTrIeOsNeSar&chREidSOenUtRiCfiEeSs 17NmEWeaSsRuOreOsMin& LEeVbEaNnToSn tAhBaOt UT aim to support labour mobility, job and skills matching for expatriates and returnees, potential emigrants, foreign migrants, asylum seekers and refugees. Twelve MISMES focus on support for refugees, as well as ‘vulnerable’ Lebanese beneficiaries. Three focus on foreign migrant workers and two cater for Lebanese emigrants and expatriates. The majority of measures are financed by the international donor community, including the EU which is the world’s leading donor in the international crisis response in Syria. The research identifies several good practices, but shows overall that the number of beneficiaries remain very limited because MISMES are not part of a national system and continue to be externally funded. Overlap and duplication of services is also present. The situation According to the World Bank, in 2013 there were 810, 900 Lebanese living abroad, however more recent estimates by the General Directorate of Emigrants places that number as high as 10 million. Lebanon is also an immigration destination for low-skilled workers from the Middle East, Asia and Africa, with an estimated 1.6 million foreign workers in the country, employed primarily in construction, agriculture and domestic work. The country is also dealing with a massive infux of refugees, an estimated 1.6 million from Syria, which is putting increased pressure on the community of low skilled workforce. The ETF report calls for a national migration policy to increase employability of Lebanese emigrant workers wishing to return to Lebanon, foreign immigrant workers, and refugees. ‘Investing in promoting the employability of emigrants can positively impact on the development of both receiving countries and Lebanon, with economic returns PthRAatCTcIaCnE bAeREpAoStenPtiRaOllyJEmCTuSc&h ChAigMhPeArIGthNaSn thReEGinIOitNiaSl & COUNTRIES investment,’ the report says.

We can’t have the latest equipment in our workshops. We need to partner with businesses to provide our students with the practical part of their training,’ says Dumitru Lupei, Director of Nisporeni Vocational School, 70 kilometres north west of the Moldovan capital Chisinau. The school, which trains some 400 young people in agriculture, winemaking, ICT, catering and industrial trades, has two ways of providing its students with real-life work practice. Under agreements with local companies, the school offers one-year programmes where students divide their time each week between theoretical training and general education in the school, and hands-on practical training under the supervision of a tutor in the workplace. At the end of their training, students obtain a state-recognised qualification opening the door to employment with local footwear and garment producers. The school is negotiating a similar agreement with berry producers, a growing industry in the region. The school also has its own winery where students on a three-year oenology course get hands-on experience of every stage in the wine-making process from growing and harvesting the grapes to bottling and marketing the wine, which is sold commercially under the Crescendo label and has won three gold and two silver medals in national wine competitions. The school has plans to expand its winery in the near future. ‘For a country at our stage of development, work-based learning is a good way to equip young people with real- life work skills and provide employers with the labour force they need,’ says Dumitru Lupei. Alongside training for employment, all students receive entrepreneurship education to prepare them for the possibility of self- employment or starting their own business. The visit to Nisporeni Vocational School was part of a conference organised by the ETF in Chisinau on September 19-21 to mark the end of the first phase of the PthRAreCeT-IyCeEaAr RSEkAilSls CPoRnOnJeExCioTnS &prCoAjeMcPtAaIiGmNeSd aRtEhGeIOlpNinSg& tChOeUNTRIES countries of Eastern Europe and Kazakhstan embed work PbUaBsLeIdCAleTaIOrnNiSng& iRnEtShOeUirRCvoEcSatiNoEnWalSeRdOuOcMat&ioEnVsEyNsTteSmsA. BOUT Work-based learning - ranging from apprenticeships to internships to in-school workplace simulation – is not a new phenomenon in these countries, but the transition from the Soviet model has left them with predominantly school-based systems. Working together with key stakeholders from government and business, the ETF has supported countries in assessing the state of play of work- based learning, defining options to expand it, and supporting them in doing so through capacity building, including a distance learning tool. ‘All countries have made measurable progress over the course of the project. There are many examples of good practice, but they still have some way to go before work- based learning becomes fully integrated in their systems,’ says ETF project coordinator, Didier Gélibert. ‘This is not the end of our support for work-based learning in our partner countries, but the end of the beginning.’ One objective of the meeting in Chisinau is to take stock of what has been achieved, look at what needs to be done next, and consider how the ETF can continue to support developments.  Did you like this article?

The ETF works with partner countries to improve VET systems and outcomes. Progress, updates and results are tracked through the Torino Process - a participatory analytical review involving a wide range of stakeholders. Participating countries acquire up-to-date knowledge about VET policies and results against a social and economic backdrop. Reporting provides a unique snapshot of the state-of-play of VET reform, employment and labour market systems, contributing to the evidence-based policymaking process and future action setting.

Story-telling was an important feature at the laboratory held on 21-23 March, where women from Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine underlined the many barriers to women’s businesses. Cultural mores, policy gaps and weak institutional support for areas such as training were key factors identified in undermining the potential of women’s entrepreneurship. The laboratory also allowed for an interim review of progress on recommendations on women’s entrepreneurship following the 2016 assessment of each country’s performance on Small Business Act for Europe . More effort in connecting the range of policies supporting women’s entrepreneurship is required in the run-up to the next SBA assessment that kicks off in 2017. Local partners in Kyiv have established a dedicated webpage and intelligence platform to support the assessment. The platform interfaces with a wider on-line area to support women’s entrepreneurship in the&n bsp;European Union. This laboratory built on the first, highly successful women’s entrepreneurship laboratory held in Rome in 2014 and brought new energy to the women’s entrepreneurship drive in the EU Eastern Partnership region. ‘We’re keen to ensure that our policy events are engaging and that there is clear learning value for participants,’ says ETF’s Olena Bekh who facilitated the laboratory. Through SBA assessments, the ETF supports partner countries to promote women’s entrepreneurship, improve access to training, finance, and develop policy support tools.

Early identification of the qualifications and skills of migrants and displaced people supports their labour market integration and social inclusion. The ETF’s qualifications team has developed a fow chart that visualises routes towards labour market integration, designed to help coordinate activities in this field. Available in English, Turkish and Russian, the tool, is being shared stakeholders working in the field in the Eastern Partnership region - Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Republic of Moldova and Ukraine. ETF expert Mirjam de Jong explains in this special Q&A PYRoAuCrTtIeCaEmARhEaAsSbePeRnOwJEoCrTkSin&gCoAnMaPAtoIGoNl Sto hReElGpIOsNupS p&oCrOt UthNiTsRwIEoSrk. It is visualised in the lowchart in the Infographics attached to this page. How does it work? Can you walk us PtUhBroLuICgAhTIiOt?NS & RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT The process starts when migrants and displaced people such as refugees arrive. The first phase, the bright blue box, is the registration and social support. Preferably, this first phase already includes a fast screening of these people’s skills and qualifications. This is very important, because as research shows, the earlier the person enters the labour market the better it is for their integration. The new EU Skills Proile Tool for third country nationals is highlighted at the irst step, how does it it into the picture? Launched by the European Commission in June, as part of the new Skills Agenda for Europe, the skills profile tool supports the early identification of skills of migrants and refugees. The tool can be used at reception desks or by public employment services in an interview setting to get to know the person, their skills, qualifications, background education, work experience, aspirations, and to provide them with clear recommendations on the next steps. It is an extensive and fexible tool, in many languages, and it can be combined with existing procedures. We think this tool, which is now available as a beta version for testing, could be ideal for fast screening at the first stage. Moving down the lowchart, can you explain the three different routes? Thematically, let’s say, you have three types of people of working age. This is represented on the fowchart by three routes. The first category, the dark blue box, is for people who already have qualifications, either higher education or vocational. The best option and first step for them is to have that qualification recognised. The second route, the pink box, is for people, who don’t have a qualification, or perhaps it is very outdated, but they do have skills and work experience. They can go through a process of validation of non-formal or informal learning, where they get a certificate based on the skills they have acquired. The third route, the purple box, is for people who don’t have qualifications or work experience and should go into a dedicated training programme. What we often see happening, however, is that refugees are going into training programmes without a proper selection process. You have people with skills and qualifications that don’t end up working in their field. This mismatch is a waste for both the refugee and the country. What happens after one of the three routes is taken? The ultimate aim is labour market integration and social inclusion, but that’s not an automatic outcome. After the recognition process, validation or training, other support is needed. This could be an internship, work-based learning, language training, social-cultural induction or entrepreneurship programmes followed by job support and guidance. How will this tool be used in the field? The tool is already available in Turkish, Russian and English. We have introduced it in Turkey, and we are taking it to the Eastern Partnership region in October. It is for all stakeholders working on qualifications and skills recognition PaRnAdCvTaICliEdaAtRioEnA,SfroPmROpJuEbClTicS e&mCApMloPyAmIGeNnSt seRrvEiGcIeOpNrSo&viCdOeUrsN, TreRfIuESgee support groups, municipalities, universities and policymakers!

Last year one third of vocational teachers in Serbia followed digital training – an initiative bringing good results, with most of the participants praising the positive impact on their teaching. More is to come, and the way forward on the table at the ‘Digital and online skills for vocational teachers in Serbia’ event, taking place on 13 December in Belgrade. The meeting focuses on the measures that Serbia is taking to improve the volume, relevance and effectiveness of continuous professional development for digital skills and competences – particularly for vocational teachers and teacher trainers. Everyone agrees digital is a key skill nowadays: employment opportunities and Serbian economic performance depend on the digital skills and competences of the Serbian people. Serbia's IT employers are looking forward to hiring competent youngsters: 85% of IT companies in Vojvodina, for example, reported dificulties in illing job vacancies in 2016. And more than half of Serbian vocational teachers identify digital skills as a priority for their own professional development. Over the last two years the ETF has supported Serbia with demonstration projects to ind out how best to support teachers to design digital instructional materials and to make use of e-portol ios. The ETF has also endorsed Serbia to participate in the development of the European Framework for Digitally Ready Schools.

Today, 28 February, the European Commission hosts its first ever EU Industry Day. Business, government and civic interest groups have gathered in Brussels to take stock of what measures are already contributing to the EU’s drive for improved competitiveness and to determine what more can be done. Ensuring industry has the right skills and competences to innovate and deliver quality products and services is a central pillar in the day’s proceedings. There will be policy lessons for ETF partner countries to draw from today’s conference. But a quick glance at European Commissioner Bieńkowska’s opening speech < /a>pinpoints a number of areas where the ETF is already making headway with its partner countries. Serbia PFRirAsCtlTyI,CbEuAsRinEeAsSsesPiRnOEJTEFCTpSar&tnCeArMcPoAuIGnNtrSies RnEeGeIdONtoS b&eCtOteUrNTRIES anticipate skills for their evolving economies. More PdUeBvLeIlCoApTeIdONdSat&aRaEnSdOUwRidCeErSintNeEllWigSeRnOcOe Mon&sEkVilElsN is critical to ensure policy and resources are correctly targeted. Through its assessments of how partner countries are accommodating the provisions of the Small Business Act for Europe and the New Skills Agend a , the ETF tracks how countries are building skills intelligence and supports them in improving this intelligence and making good policy value from it. Secondly, forward-looking industrial developments in the EU, as much as in the ETF partner countries, require not only technical skills but a wider set of competences, including entrepreneurship competence. These competences ensure the lexibility that the future workforce and businesses need to adapt to technological change and as well as to upturns and downturns in the economy. The ETF’s promotion of policy, curriculum reform and teacher training for entrepreneurship as a key competence tackles this issue head on. Finally, with high stakes particularly for businesses in partner countries planning to join the European Union, the ETF is giving more concentrated industrial policy support to governments and training communities in the pre-accession region. Coordinated by the Regional Cooperation Council, a multi-country industrial policy blueprint underlines the importance of good practice exchange. ETF’s good practice drive on SME skills supports this effort. A next call for good practice call will be launched on 15 March. Those interested in this call should register on the ETF’s good practice platform.< /p>  Did you like this article?

Albania, which is on the point of putting its national qualifications framework into law, will bring together over 150 people from all over the country tomorrow to tackle just this issue. Business leaders, school teachers, ministers, university staff, trade union representatives and others will meet in the capital to build a common national understanding on the NQF and strengthen partnerships across the country. Although the NQF has been on the agenda in Albania since 2010, ‘repetition is the mother of knowledge’ says Ejvis Gishti, Head of Department at the National VET and Qualifications Agency stressing the importance of communicating such policies so that they are actually taken up by those who benefit. The conference will be opened by the Minister of Education and Sport and the Minister of Social Welfare and Youth.

Supporting teachers so that they are up-to-date with the latest professional developments, guaranteeing students the appropriate facilities and tools to get ready for the labour market, maintaining close cooperation with entrepreneurs to assess the companies’ needs – all this is key to making vocational training a real fast-track from school to work. In order to make high-quality standard in the EU neighbouring countries, the European Training Foundation today launched the irst ETF Forum for quality assurance in vocational education and training. The Forum is all about bringing national institutions together with ETF, EU and international experts to improve quality assurance in vocational education and training. The countries involved so far range from Serbia to Turkey, from Algeria to Jordan. As the ETF Director, Cesare Onestini, said: “Everyone should have the opportunity to develop their skills to their full potential. That’s why access to high-quality training options is essential. Ensuring quality is a task that requires constant efforts in particular to modernise vocational education and keeping up with fast-changing labour markets. Transnational cooperation can help in this process by providing a forum to exchange ideas, get inspiration and speed up reforms. The ETF is happy to support these efforts in our partner countries.” Deining ‘quality’ and making it concrete is not easy: it requires a strong methodology and shared standards, to make sure that every citizen in every country can develop their potential and succeed in the labour market. The members of the Forum will engage in a wide range of activities to make this happen – from information gathering and analyses to vocational education and training system monitoring and evaluation. Besides face-to-face contacts, a dedicated e-platform is there to foster on-line collaboration. “This Forum is a great opportunity to share experience and learn from each other”, said Samer Hussein, Ministry of Education and Higher Education, Palestine [2]. The launch of the Forum is part of the EU Vocational Skills Week, a series of event organised all over Europe to improve the attractiveness and image of vocational education and training. Background The Forum for quality assurance in vocational education and training is attended by representatives from Ministries and major National institutions from Albania, Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Egypt, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Israel, Jordan, Kosovo[1], Lebanon, Montenegro, Palestine[2], Serbia and Turkey. For some of these countries, this is the irst opportunity to collaborate transnationally on the modernisation of their quality assurance in vocational education policies.

The ETF research, the irst of its kind, shows that a national mobility strategy would help Lebanon better utilise the skills of refugees, foreign workers, migrants, expatriates and returnees. Building upon the inventory of Migrant Support Measures from the Employment and Skills Perspective , the ETF research identiies 17 measures in Lebanon that aim to support labour mobility, job and skills matching for expatriates and returnees, potential emigrants, foreign migrants, asylum seekers and refugees. Twelve MISMES focus on support for refugees, as well as ‘vulnerable’ Lebanese beneiciaries. Three focus on foreign migrant workers and two cater for Lebanese emigrants and expatriates. The majority of measures are inanced by the international donor community, including the EU which is the world’s leading donor in the international crisis response in Syria. The research identiies several good practices, but shows overall that the number of beneiciaries remain very limited because MISMES are not part of a national system and continue to be externally funded. Overlap and duplication of services is also present. Being a country of departure as well as arrival as regards migration, Lebanon does not have a targeted strategy or policy framework. Situation According to the World Bank, in 2013 there were 810, 900 Lebanese living abroad, however more recent estimates by the General Directorate of Emigrants places that number as high as 10 million.

The country is also dealing with a massive infux of refugees, an estimated 1.6 million from Syria, which is putting increased pressure on the community of low skilled workforce. The ETF report calls for a national migration policy to increase employability of Lebanese emigrant workers wishing to return to Lebanon, foreign immigrant workers, and refugees. ‘Investing in promoting the employability of emigrants can positively impact on the development of both receiving countries and Lebanon, with economic returns that can be potentially much higher than the initial investment,’ the report says. ‘In order to embed migration policy interventions into national policies a large policy dialogue on migration and mobilityshould be launched.’ The European Training Foundation The ETF is a specialised EU agency, working with 29 partner countries bordering Europe.

Diversiication - ensuring that VET provision is diversiied to reach more users in better, more customised ways, and diversifying programmes and methods of delivery.

Cooperation - promoting the idea that cooperation is something that needs to take place not only nationally, but throughout levels of governance in the country - local, vocational institutions and communities.

They joined key stakeholders at a high-level policy forum looking at how VET and skills can contribute to socio-economic and regional development. The programme was organised by the European Training Foundation together with the Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Federation of Employers. Ambassador Mingarelli praised the adoption of a three- year national action plan placing human resources, education and training among its top priorities. ‘You can rely on us,’ he said, in remarks directed to the prime minister and minister. ‘We are here to help you, and you can be sure that if there is the political will on your side, we will mobilise all our resources to support you. It is reassuring to know that we are investing our time and resources in an area that is a priority for the Ukrainian government. VET reform has ‘reached a crucial phase’ and it is vital vocational education finds its place within the system of developing the country's human resources.' Stimulating Economic and Regional Growth through VET Responsibility for VET is being devolved to Ukraine's 25 regions meaning day-to-day management and control of the system's 787 training schools and 285,000 students will rest with regional authorities within a national framework of qualifications and professional profiles. The ambassador said reform is timely, noting that the EU Delegation was finalising assistance programmes for 2018-2020. ‘It is very important for us to be able to regard training and education as key sectors.’ The EU's priority in Ukraine is to implement its Association Agreement and Deep and Comprehensive Trade Agreement, and to gradually absorb its economy into the single market; education and training are key elements to both agreements, Mr Mingarelli said.

This is a good opportunity to identify what are common trends, best practices and to learn from one another.’ Anticipating likely future needs and the specific challenges individual countries in a region that includes five EU accession candidates - Albania, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey - was essential. ‘The picture on growth around the region is diverse,’ Mr Davenport said. ‘When you look at the prospects for growth, one of the main drivers of that growth is always going to be human capital, its state and dynamics. 'The development of links between education and the needs of the labour market and business and the improvement of labour force skills is one of the key factors in ensuring that prospects for economic recovery are maxmised.’ There were signs across the region this message was being taken seriously, he said, pointing to the recent introduction of new laws in Serbia that improve labour market lexibilty and free up investment. As a result, he added, ‘we are seeing unemployment coming down.’ Effective and targeted skills development was necessary to prevent shortages in economically significant areas. He added that in Serbia alone, the EU had invested €25 million over the last 15 years to support the modernisation of VET curricula, update teaching methods and re-equip schools ‘to provide students with the tools to help them acquire the right skills from the outset.’ ‘In today's more knowledge-based economy, the demand for skills needs to be seen in the same bracket as the supply of skills,’ Mr Davenport stressed.

Built in 1923 - and arguably made world famous when its rooftop testing track featured speeding Minis in the iconic British movie of 1969 starring Michael Caine - the Lingotto now houses cinemas, shops, university facilities and hotels. It was a fitting venue for a conference looking forward to the key role skills training has to play in addressing the economic and social challenges of a fast changing world. Opening the conference, Madlen Serban, who is stepping down as head of the ETF, introduced her successor Cesare Onestini, until recently the deputy head of the EU Delegation in Delhi. Ms Serban underlined the importance of widening the scope of the ETF's work with partner countries to meet and embrace change. ""Do we want to make progress in perpetuating in what does not work or to make progress in changing the world? 'The ETF wants to give a purpose not only through work but coming together creating communities,' Ms Serban said. The evolving nature of the Torino Process - from an analytical tool that, when it launched in 2010, focused on assessing the existing state of VET in partner countries, to a multi-purpose policy lever that is increasingly used to effect change and implement reform - was vividly put into context by contributions from two expert panels during the conference opening afternoon. Arman Toskanbaev, a 26 year old businessman and entrepreneur from Kazakhstan told a panel on 'Setting the Context' that although he had not benefitted from a Higher Education, by the time he was 17, taking note of inspirational teachers, he already understood that he could teach himself all that he needed to be capable in any field he chose to put his mind to. Now with ten years' experience in business to his credit, ranging from dealing in computers to high-end watches - and a published author of a book entitled 'From Idea to Business'- Mr Toskanbaev told delegates that education was failing to produce young people with transferable, entrepreneurial skills. James Calleja, director of the ETF's affiliated organisation CEDEFOP - which works with VET issues within the EU - said that its latest survey showed that large numbers of workers are rarely offered the opportunity to upgrade their skills in the worksplace and much skills training takes place informally, peer-to- peer or through their own efforts.

Through initiatives coordinated by the EU and the action of the European Training Foundation , it is developing better systems to match the demand and supply for jobs, and the integration between the needs of the labour market and education and training provision. This means better opportunities for building careers and getting jobs at home. Throughout the exchange, participants agreed that having an impact is not an easy story. “Italy has made a true cultural change in its approach to unemployment: it has switched from traditionally passive approaches to actively engaging employees in job search and skills creation projects” said Lara Raimondo, Expert in Labor Policies and Monitoring from the Agenzia Piemonte Lavoro, the employment agency of Italy’s Piemonte Region. If public backing is key, it cannot succeed alone: the unemployed are expected to remain active and take responsibility, and public services cannot be effective without the private sector. “In schools teachers have to teach to female pupils that they can really create their own enterprises”, added Mladen Perazić, Head of the Education Department of the Chamber of Economy of Montenegro. The participants also attended “Io Lavoro”, the biggest Italian job fair taking place in Torino on 4-5 October 2017. The visit was an opportunity to explore ways to support the demand and supply of jobs, namely initiatives like the WorldSkills Championship: a competition for young talents who will compete in crafts such as hairdressing, waitering, cooking, and bricklaying. In its 2016 spring edition, one in three participants at the fair found a job. The visit of Montenegrin representatives refects the EU’s active commitment to creating better lives. Indeed, Europe’s number one priority is boosting jobs and growth: through its investment plans the EU supports Member States as well as its neighbouring countries in promoting inclusive growth, job creation and sustainable development. As part of the external action of the Union, the European Training Foundation is the EU agency that supports 29 countries in developing such opportunities for all citizens via education, training and labour market. PRACTICDEidAyRouEAlikSe thPisRaOrJtiEclCeT?SIf &yoCuAwMoPuAldIGlikNeSto bReEnGoItOiiNedS w&hCeOnUnNewTRIES PUBLICATIONS & RESOURCES content like this is published, NEWSROsuObMsc&ribEeVtEoNreTcSeiveAoBuOrUeTmail alerts.

Apprenticeships are the 'Gold Standard' in vocational education and training. Two out of three apprentices move straight into jobs after finishing their education. With today's new framework, we define what makes apprenticeships shine. Once adopted, the framework will ensure that both learners and employers benefit from quality apprenticeships.' ETF Director, Cesare Onestini, said: 'Countries that have a strong tradition of apprenticeship have lower youth unemployment. Building bridges between theory and practice, and between education and the labour market, is key in promoting employability as well as a fairer and more inclusive society in Europe and its neighbourhood. By investing in quality apprenticeships, the Balkan countries and Turkey are putting young people on a fast track to employment and success in life.' The European Alliance for Apprenticeships regional seminar is part of the European Vocational Skills Week, a series of event organised all over Europe to improve the attractiveness and image of vocational education and training. Dr Damir Sehovic, Minister of Education of Montenegro will open the two-day event in Montenegro on Thursday 26 October. Background Improving the quality of apprenticeships contributes to the EU's priority on jobs, growth and investment. Last 5 October the EC has proposed a European Framework for Quality and Effective Apprenticeships. This is part of the New Skills Agenda for Europe and is in line with the European Pillar of Social Rights, which defends a right to quality and inclusive education, training and life-long learning. By helping its neighbouring countries to improve the quality of apprenticeships, the EU is supporting the development of human capital opportunities for growth. As part of the external action policy of the EU, the European Alliance for Apprenticeships is the platform which brings together governments with other key stakeholders from the EU and the candidate countries. In this area of work, the European Commission relies on the expertise of theETF - the only EU agency working for political stability and opportunities for growth through learning in 29 EU’s candidate and neighbouring countries.

When implementing a national qualiications framework , moving from theory to practice is a challenge for any country and Ukraine is no exception.

But we’ll do a better job if we can insight from people on the ground.’ Common standards and curricula that deliver people with skills that correspond to standards are essential for effective qualiications. Reaching a common understanding was one reason to bring people together. As there is little opportunity for different branches of education to work together, standards and curricula can be developed in isolation. Bringing stakeholders together offers the chance for them to create a common understanding of the current situation and to see how their own work its with the bigger picture. This is particularly important in Ukraine, where decentralisation means that decision making will take place at regional level. Creating a common understanding starts with the basics, including agreed deinitions for common terminology, such as competences, curricula and standards. At the start of the conference, although there may only have been little awareness over how curricula and standards worked in different branches of education, it became clear that there was consensus on the importance of standards. And, by the end of the conference, there were a number of suggestions from stakeholders on how to move forward. One priority is better matching education to labour market needs through improved forecasting. Involving employers is central to success. All concluded that continued cooperation is also essential. Proposals on how to do this ranged from working together to create a common glossary, creating a central online repository for all relevant information, and creating a coordinating body.

The mapping identiies 35 MISMES that support skills development, job and skills matching for emigrants, foreign immigrant workers and refugees. The number of support measures is not exhaustive. The majority, 23, are aimed at refugees . Around half focus on soft skills, life skills and key competencies such as language, inancial and market literacy. These MISMES are mostly funded by the international donor community, including the EU which is the largest contributor to the Syrian crisis response. The research recommends better coordination and eficiency to help avoid overlap of services. Of the remaining MISMES, seven are targeted at foreign immigrant workers, with the aim to improve the working conditions of immigrant labour - a priority area identiied by the government to attract more low-skilled Jordanian workers into these sectors. Only ive MISMES exist for Jordanian emigrants, which ‘a strikingly low’ number given the contribution of skilled Jordanians who return after a period of circular migration.

The ETF, the Turkish national authorities, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , and the International Labour Organisation have joined forces to identify ways to better use the country’s validation of informal and non-formal learning system for refugees and hosting community. To help coordinate activities in this field, the ETF qualifications team has developed a fowchart to visualise the routes towards labour market integration. It has been adapted to the Turkish situation and was presented at a high-level conference in Adana on 21 September. The fowchart exemplifies the institutional roles and tasks of various actors and reveals possible overlaps and gaps in the process of refugees’ labour market integration. The conference brought together a wide range of stakeholders from 50 institutions working on the integration of Syrian refugees into the labour market in Turkey. In welcoming the participants, Mustafa Çolakoğlu, Ministry of National Education’s Deputy Undersecretary, claimed: ‘Turkey has a culture of immigrants. We see them as becoming part of the Turkish society.’ Michaela Šojdrová, Member of the European Parliament, added: ‘Turkey has taken the right path of integration of refugees into the labour market through work permits and validation and access to new skills and education.’ However, work remains to be done to enhance refugees’ skills. While referring to current progress in refugees’ employability in Turkey, the Vocational Qualifications Authority’s President, Adem Ceylan, claimed: ‘We do not fully benefit from refugees’ skills.’ The ETF fowchart may help identify new ways to make refugees’ skills better match the needs of the country’s labour market. The ETF believes that this easy-to-use tool can help coordinate joint efforts and enhance efficiency to improve the employability of Syrian refugees in Turkey. The fowchart is available in English and Turkish, see the attachments in the top right corner of the page.

Youth unemployment is high in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with around 7 in 10 young people out of work. Faced with an uncertain future, many graduates are leaving the country to ind work. For these young people, having their skills, competencies and qualiications easily recognised is essential.

Eldar, who aspires to become a doctor, is one of four young vocational students who joined ETF’s ‘Qualiications for the Future’ workshop in the coastal town of Neum. The students shared their voice, aspirations and ideas, with representatives from the government, the European Union, international organisations and ETF experts, gathering to discuss the indings of a new inventory of vocational qualiications. As an EU-accession country, Bosnia and Herzegovina is working to reference its system to the European Qualiications Framework to make qualiications more readable and understandable across countries. Like Eldar, Semir Omic, 18, is taking a medical technician course but aspires to continue his studies at university to become a doctor. ‘I wanted to study medicine because it gives you the opportunity to help people,’ says Semir, a student at a vocational school in Brčko in the country’s north. Semic is set to graduate from the four year course in 2018. He, just like the other students, is not very optimistic about his immediate job prospects. ‘We see medical technicians leaving Bosnia and Herzegovina to places like Germany and Austria to work.’ A high quality and internationally recognised qualiication is ‘very important,’ he says. ‘Especially in medicine, because it is a profession that is in need everywhere.’ Taking stock The medical technician qualiication is one of 16 that have been analysed in-depth in the new inventory, compiled by the ETF in cooperation with the Ministry of Civil Affairs and responsible educational authorities. The analysis covers two dimensions: content and quality. The latter looks at labour market relevance, learning processes, assessment and certiication, and qualiications standards and structure.

AENdTdSitioAnBalOUT efforts are needed to link qualiications to learning outcomes, and recognise skills obtained through non- formal trainings. The relevance of qualiications for the labour market should also be assessed, with tools such as regular employer surveys. Daria Duilovic from the Ministry of Civil Affairs says the state of qualiications can be discussed as a glass half-full or a glass half-empty.'Educational institutions are working together and we are moving to the right direction to improve qualiications for the future of education.' Mate Krizanac, Assistant Minister of Education of Canton 10 says employability is a problem. ‘The key issue is to address is the interaction between vocational education and training and the labour market.’ Forward looking The students want to see links with employers strengthened, with more opportunities for work experience. For Gabriela Coric, 17, who is studying economics at a vocational school in Posušje, in the country’s west, the only practical experience she has gained so far is working at her father’s small business. ‘I like economics, and the idea of working for a large company, in a bank for example. So I would like to have more practical experience working in big companies.’ Zorana Pelemis, 17, who is studying at a gymnasium school in Zvornik, in the country’s northeast, says work experience is also missing from the secondary education system. ‘We need more practical experience, and an ability to choose some elective subjects ourselves. For example, I like ecology, and I would like to take that.’ In addition to increased practical training, the students say more is needed to ensure that the voices of young people are heard throughout the education system. ETF Qualiications expert Carmo Gomes says we cannot talk about qualiications and qualiication systems without thinking about the inal beneiciaries: the future generation.

Over two-days at the ETF headquarters in Turin, they explored VET decentralisation, inance and innovation in the context of multi-level governance. Knowledge-sharing, good practice and lessons learned, featured. Decentralising VET Decentralisation refers to the transfer of power from state level to lower levels of governance. It affects VET governance arrangements, as regions play an increasingly pivotal role in connecting regional administrations, business and entrepreneurs. Decentralisation and regionalisation is becoming an important reform path in a number of ETF partner countries. Morocco’s new constitution has resulted in a more prominent role for the regions. Tunisia is taking a stronger regional approach, more responsive to citizen’s needs. Ukraine has moved towards substantive decentralisation of public policies, including VET and employment. While Bosnia and Herzegovina – a decentralised country – faces important challenges regarding governance, for which learning from others at the workshop could help to inspire. Wrapping up Participants drafted nine key messages on policy guidance, covering issues such as political will, public- private partnerships, capacity-building, communication and resourcing tools. They highlighted the need for new tools and the importance of quick wins to help keep the local stakeholders’ momentum. Looking forward, the ETF’s VET Governance team leader Siria Taurelli said ‘continuity, collective sharing and the cross-country validation of common ideas’ was key. ‘We PwRaAnCtTtICoEstArReEnAgSthePnRaOnJdECidTSen&tCifAyMoPpApIoGrNtuSnitRieEsGIaOnNdSt&o COUNTRIES learn from EU Member States, practical lessons, successes PaUnBdLfIaCiAluTIrOesN.’S & RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT The move to regional government gives more opportunity for innovative approaches, she added. ‘Innovation often happens outside of VET it is important to look outside for inspiration.’ Eva Jimeno Sicilia, the ETF’s head of Systems Policy and Country Analysis, remarked: Decentralisation is very context-based, so does it work bringing all the countries together? In response, Bojana Simeunovic, from the Serbian Ministry of Public Adminsitration and Local Self Government, said Serbia can beneit from this experience. ‘We are only at the beginning, but learning from different approaches and experiences at the local level is helpful.

The Regional Cooperation Council’s Secretary General, Goran Svilanovic, and newly appointed Director of the European Training Foundation , Cesare Onestini, signed an agreement on continuation of cooperation between the two organisations, in Brussels today. The two organisations expressed their satisfaction with their cooperation to date in the areas of skills and vocational education and training , and the employment agenda, and are looking to take it forward, particularly in the light of the RCC-developed Multi- annual Action Plan on a Regional Economic Area in the Western Balkans, endorsed at this year’s Western Balkans Summit in Trieste. “Development of a globally competitive skills base and research systems, which foster innovation are key factor for economic recovery and sustained growth in the Western Balkans. The region needs to develop measures to provide better quality education, strengthening the link with the needs of the private sector, and ensuring development of highly skilled labour force throughout the education systems”, said Svilanovic adding that only the digital skills development is an explicit measure in MAP, with clear emphasis on the development of research skills in particular of young researchers in the region. The ETF’s Cesare Onestini reiterated that the EU enlargement process and related policies explicitly and/or implicitly refer to the importance of skills and vocational education and training for economic development, stressing that the region’s efforts on this agenda should be supported by making skills more prominent in the implementation of the investment and trade agenda, including recognition of VET qualiications in the mobility agenda, and enhancing the digital skills agenda through ETF products and services. The cooperation agreement for period 2018-20 envisages widening the cooperation to include monitoring and collecting data on education indicators, quality of education, RCC’s Employment and Social Affairs Platform , and support to the MAP agenda in recognising qualiications and skills development in the region.

European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, Marianne Thyssen, presented the award at the closing ceremony of European Vocational Skills Week, November 24, in Brussels. The European Training Foundation award recognises outstanding initiatives promoting entrepreneurship as a key competence through education and training, inspired by the European Entrepreneurship Competence Framework . Unlike classic entrepreneurship courses, the focus on key competence aims to build the entrepreneurial spirit in young people. PPU’s Entrepreneurship and Innovation course beat dozens of entries from the ETF’s 29 partner countries neighbouring the European Union.

Working closely with local businesses, students develop ’can do’ conidence to consider business as a career option. Awarding good practice The European Commission’s EntreComp framework is a reference tool for developing entrepreneurship through education and training. ETF Director Cesare Onestini says the Torino Process Award will help to inspire educators, training providers and policymakers in Europe, and the neighbourhood, to promote entrepreneurship as a key competence in education. ‘The ETF congratulates Palestine Polytechnic University for its innovative teaching and learning approach that is helping to equip young people with competence and skills to build a brighter, more prosperous future.’ From job seekers to job creators More than 450 students have graduated from the programme, including many successful startups accepted into the university’s business incubator. Professor Wisam Shamroukh, who received the award in Brussels on behalf of the PPU, designed the course to ‘foster job creators, not jobseekers.’ ‘This is a deep change in the mentality of the graduates. From applying with a CV to a company to establishing the company themselves.’ Fadia Zahdeh, 31, a vocational graduate in multimedia and graphic design established Wonder Paper, a business that transforms and recycles paper to produce artistic objects for in-door decorations. She began the course as an artist but soon discovered her talents could turn to proit. ‘I started to ask more and more questions and now I have a business!’ ‘The teaching approach motivated me to continue the course and reach the expected outcomes. In fact, I exceeded this very quickly. I really received the right training and gained the skills to achieve my goals!’ Fayez Karakey, 21, a vocational graduate in photography and video production, established PalMotion, which produces 2D, 3D and stop-motion animation ilms, incorporating recycled materials. ‘I had the idea for my business before coming to the polytechnic, but I didn’t know I was an entrepreneur! I have used these new skills to transform my hobby as a designer into a proitable project.’ Business on side The Federation of Palestinian Chambers of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture is a close partner of PPU, working together to strengthen the links between education and business. For those young people who decide not to set up a business, the course ensures they are more attractive on the labour market, says the Federation’s Akram Hijazi underlining how PPU graduates are in high demand by companies because their skills match job market PdReAmCaTInCdEsA.

A vocational school in Turkey is leading the way in professional development for teachers. This autumn, Ҫetin Altan Vocational School in Izmir Province, Turkey, has hosted two week-long workshops for some 130 vocational teachers from the surrounding province. They were there to learn the theory and practice of using digital teaching methods using a learning management system called Sakai. After a brief introduction to the theory and techniques, mixed groups of teachers were challenged to PdReAsCigTnICaEnAdRbEAuSild tPhReOirJEfiCrsTtSd&igCiAtaMlPleAsIGsoNnS. “TRhEiGs IhOaNnSd&s-CoOnUNTRIES approach encourages teachers to support one another PaUnBdLmICAaTkIeOuNsSe&oRfEwShOaUtRtChEeSy leNaErnW”SsRaOidOMtra&inEeVrEYNaTsSin ABOUT Özarslan, Associate Professor of Media Technology at Yasar University. The training addresses one of Turkey’s educational priorities – up-skilling teachers to use new learning technologies effectively inside and outside the classroom. At the same time, this project offers a model for good practice in professional development. “The problem in the past was that teacher training was not designed to bring about real change in the way teachers taught”, said Tamer Bilgiç , principal of Ҫetin Altan Vocational School. “That’s why I agreed to let one of my teachers spend one day a week visiting teachers who have attended the training to mentor them and help them apply the new skills in their own schools.” The school cooperates with Izmir’s Yasar University to share expertise and experience in delivering and designing training. It is also working closely with the local department of the Ministry of Education, which has allowed teachers from across the province to follow the course and obtain a certificate for their participation. The Provincial office of Turkey’s EBA project, which supports the take up of educational technology all over the country, is another partner in the initiative. “The project is supporting the creation of digital materials that are being shared with teachers all over the province”, said Hulya Mahmutoglu, Manager of EBA in Izmir. The project is being supported by the ETF as one of 14 demonstration projects across South Eastern Europe and Turkey. The projects aim to show how in practice professional development can directly address teachers’ needs and how teachers can be supported, locally, to put new skills into practice in the classroom.

All leaders agreed on a joint declaration reconfirming their commitment and the high importance they attach to the Eastern Partnership. Among the points of relevance for education and training, the leaders agreed on the following: ""18. Investment in young people's skills, entrepreneurship and employability will be substantially strengthened, notably with a reinforced ""Youth Package"" presented by the EU under the EU4Youth initiative, which will include a new mobility scheme for young people and targeted actions through youth engagement roadmaps with a particular focus on leadership, mobility and quality of formal and non-formal education. Young people and youth workers will profit from increased opportunities of mobility under the Erasmus+ programme. The participation of partner countries to Erasmus+, Creative Europe, COSME and Horizon 2020 programs opens up new mobility opportunities for universities, administrations, businesses, professionals, cultural and audio-visual operators, young people students and researchers and contributes to developing cultural and creative industries. Reinforced cooperation in EU programmes will be supported where relevant and applicable. 19. An Eastern Partnership European School will be established, taking into consideration the activities of EU Member States, to provide high quality education to pupils from partner countries, increase their educational and employment opportunities, promote cooperation, multi-cultural understanding, tolerance, fundamental values, a better understanding of the European Union and its engagement in the region, as well as enhance language skills.

Knowledge hubs – platforms that bring together employers, educators and governments – are supporting skills development in Serbia’s fast-growing ICT sector. Senior ministers, EU oficials, business leaders, educators and ETF experts have been meeting in Belgrade to discuss how the success of the Vojvodina ICT Cluster can be replicated to address skills shortages in other sectors. The ETF’s roving reporter Nick Holdsworth explores the collaborative platform that is supporting Serbia’s digital skills drive. PNRoAvCiTSICaEd:ASReErAbSia’sPRhOotJbECeTdSo&f CICATMPAIGNS REGIONS & COUNTRIES Milan Solaja, chief executive of Serbia's Vojvodina ICT Cluster, speaks rapid, luent English PUBLICATIONS & RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT that he began learning informally as a boy desperate to understand the lyrics of songs by the Beatles. A tall, slender man who has to remember to duck to avoid hitting hit his on the wooden beams that support the ceiling of the offices of the Novi Sad-based software and computing industry support and training body, he is a passionate advocate for the role that IT businesses can play in supporting Serbia's economic - and educational - development. Putting IT and software at the heart of national development under the slogan Digital Serbia is Milan's vision and one that he is passionate about. The Vojvodina Cluster - which brings together around 35 companies employing 4,000 people and stakeholders from 11 governmental and educational institutions - aims to give ICT companies a regional, national and global platform; support training initiatives both at its centre and through in-house and dual education programmes; and lobby the government for better policies to support digital industry development. A not-for-profit business association, it raises around 10-12% of its annual budget through company subscriptions of €100 per month and the rest from projects. In 2016, its budget was around €250,000. Its regional role - in Serbia's largest province that occupies around a quarter of the former Yugoslav republic's territory, but accounts for a third of the country's GDP - is as important as its national and international position. ‘We've always had strong support from ICT companies - ever since we were set up in 2010, based on an industry initiative. They had seen similar organisations overseas and wanted something like that here,’ he says. ‘We saw the need to involve all stakeholders - the industry, government and education - that can contribute to taking advantage of opportunities to develop the digital process. ICT has been the nuclear fuel for everything that we do, but the role of training and policymakers is also essential: a triple helix must be there to achieve the best results.’ A collaborative approach to skills development Involving stakeholders, working with VET schools and other educational institutes is one of the keys to ensuring that enough software engineers are trained to sustain an industry that often loses its best skilled employees to international firms. Milan mentions a German company that skills tested a Serbian team of IT specialists to design a piece of software it had already had its HQ staff work on. The Serbs did a better job at a better price. Fortunately, in this case, the foreign company did not poach them, but invested in establishing a local office and creating new employment opportunities. ‘Often we have a lack of IT staff in the market and we have had to start pressure education institutions to deliver more.’ Building a creative, sustainable homegrown ICT industry is essential to the future of the sector: the basic model of IT, he says, boils down to outsourcing - where foreign companies sub-contract projects to local firms - or developing your own business models, software, PgRaAmCeTIsCaEnAdRoEAthSer PapROplJiEcCatTiSon&sC.OAMutPsAoIuGrNcSingRhEaGsIOaNloSw& cCeOiUlinNgTR-IEaScompany that has 10 engineers can charge a maximum of ten monthly engineer fees. Develop your own PsUoBftLwICaAreTIaOnNdS t&hReEsSkOyU'sRtChEeSlimNitE.WSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT ‘There were a couple of students here who dropped out of college to develop specialised project management software they could not find on the market,’ Milan says. ‘They put the resulting software on the Internet as open source with a licence priced at $300 - not much by western standards - with support and upgrades included and sold 40,000 copies, making $12 million over two years. Now their company employees a dozen staff.’ Another company that designs HOPA games has 450 employees, only a third of whom are engineers - the rest are creative game developers, designers, graphic artists, photographers, visual effects specialists and others, underscoring the importance of the educational component of the 'triple helix'. The ETF developed the education and training part of the Vojvodina ICT Cluster approach, through a needs analysis conducted in 2016. ‘Nobody knows exactly what profiles we need to develop for training and dual education programmes,’ Milan says. ‘Everybody thinks they know. The ETF helped us design a needs analysis and questionnaire that went out to 40 companies. Initial results confirm what we know - but it is useful now to have the facts to push an agenda for dual education in IT training.’ Apart from core engineering skills, the sector also needs to train people in business, marketing, communications and sales, the study found. Milan says many lessons have been learned since the ICT Cluster was set up in 2010.‘We've learned that it is better to give a general [skills] base for trainees, because later on they will specialise. We stopped offering entry level tests online as they are open to cheating.’ Through the Serbian Association of Business Clusters, the organization is also engaged in lobbying the government for better policies. The Torino Process, the ETF's lagship tool for providing evidence-based analysis of VET systems to support policy reform can help support this lobbying effort, Milan adds.A priority in that area, he concludes, is to encourage a more efficient approach to EU structural funds available so support digital training and reform in Serbia: currently only around 15% of which is being drawn down as too few people actually apply for the support.  Did you like this article?

There’s a lot of talk about innovation, but in some policy areas more action is needed to allow it to fourish. Let’s try a quick survey – do you think innovation is important? Does it make a difference to the future of your organisation? Do you think innovation should drive new products and services? As Eddie Obeng, professor of innovation at Henley Business School, points out, people think it’s obvious: ‘They say, of course innovation is important, yet the level of innovation in most organisations is low.’ The problem is not a shortage of ideas, but the means and, crucially, the sense of permission to act on ideas that create value. Some sectors have a better track record in enabling innovation, and digital technology is commonly cited. Companies like Apple and Google have built their reputations on the ability of their workers to innovate, and their products and services have made digitally-enabled workers in some places much less dependent on traditional work structures. PRReAsCeTaIrCcEhAbRyEMAScKinPRseOyJ’EsCGTlSob&aClAInMsPtAitIuGtNeSsugRgEeGsIOtsNtSh&atC’O20UNtoTR3I0E%S of the working age population in the US and the European Union is engaged in independent work.’ However, PthUiBsLdICoAeTsIOnNoSt g&uRaErSaOnUteReCEthSat NthEeWyS’rReObOuMsy&bEeVinENgTiSnnoAvBaOtoUrTs, nor that businesses get the skills and services they need. ‘Policymakers and innovators will need to grapple with solutions to these challenges,’ McKinsey’s report asserts. Call the VET Are policymakers even talking to innovators? Vocational education and training is a case in point. It’s a sector that tends to be tightly controlled by government, yet the people with the brightest ideas are usually furthest away from the policymaking process. Policymakers like to think of the sector as a lever to pull when the supply side of the skills equation is seen as deicient in some way. Often, they’re reacting to complaints from the demand side. But a triangulation of demand, policy and supply that prioritises deiciencies over innovation is not it for today’s economies. Nevertheless, VET is beginning to emerge as a leader in innovation. There are a growing number of enterprising learners and practitioners, often working in new kinds of partnerships involving local communities, training providers, local authorities, and employers. And there are also more entrepreneurial graduates coming out of VET schools. The European Training Foundation , an agency of the EU, uses its connections with policy makers in the countries neighbouring the EU, as well as EU member states and institutions, to create spaces where innovators and policy makers can meet and build a productive dialogue. For instance, the ETF’s biennial Torino Process helps governments to assess progress in VET system reform across a range of indicators, and this year’s reports identify innovation as a strategic theme in many neighbouring countries. Whilst one speaker at the recent Torino Process Conference claimed too many ministries still demand outcomes that inhibit innovation, another highlighted the role of government in empowering innovation in VET. Power to the people A possible answer to this apparent conundrum came from Georgian education and science minister Aleksandre Jejelava, who said, ‘Public policy has to follow life, not the other way around.’ In the life of VET providers, innovation is being supported by increasing use of experiential learning, participation in smart cities and regions, and following the logic of an entrepreneurial continuum that stretches from individuals and institutions to whole systems. The vital role of skills in economic development makes bridging the gap between those in government, who can effect large-scale change, and entrepreneurs and innovators on the ground, who are creating and testing new ideas, an urgent priority. Markku Markkula, president of the EU Committee of the Regions, summed it up in his challenge to Torino Process Conference delegates: ‘Instead of planning, planning, planning, why not experimenting, testing, and learning?’ This article was published in The Economist’s Intelligence Unit section, on July&nb sp;5 PRACTICE AREAS PROJECTS & CAMPAIGNS REGIONS & COUNTRIES PUBLICADTidIOyNouSli&keRtEhSisOaUrtRicCleE?SIf yoNuEwWoSuRldOliOkeMto&bEeVnEoNtiTiSed wAhBeOnUnTew content like this is published, subscribe to receive our email alerts.

The focus of the meeting was improving data collection and analysis, monitoring and evaluation of work-based learning. In the context of the Riga Conclusions, which frames VET development goals for EU and candidate countries, Turkey has nominated work-based learning as a development priority. Turkey is also working to improve the quality of teachers and trainers and modernise infrastructure. A pilot will see 30 new state-of-the-art VET schools set up in 30 provinces. And to promote entrepreneurship, learners can apply for a startup business grant of TL50,000 and a further 100,000 TL interest-free loan. ‘VET is an important area that we are enthusiastic about,’ Mr Demirci says, however developments and actions are not communicated through statistics, data gaps exist.‘The evaluation and monitoring of work-based learning is not being done as it should. We want to work together with the ETF, employers and civil society to improve this.’ ETF statistical expert Eva Jansova shared different approaches to data collection and analysis used to inform policy development in Europe, including enterprise and adult education surveys undertaken by Eurostat. Developing a quality assurance framework for work-based learning in-line with the Quality Framework for Traineeships and the European Quality Assurance in Vocational Education and Training is another policy option. Participants will meet again soon in Turkey to, with the support of the ETF, drive developments in data collection, monitoring and evaluation forward.  Did you like this article?

You, the Delegations are directly in contact with the realities of the countries – you help translate our messages into concrete actions.’ Tuning in via video link, Genoveva Ruiz-Calavera, Director for Western Balkans at DG NEAR, said labour market reform, private sector and skills development, labour mobility and free trade were all key development areas for region. ‘This is an extremely useful two days to contribute to strategy. We want to engage with the region and discuss how we can bring it closer to the EU.’ New ideas and areas of action Setting the tone of discussions, moderator Kiril Kiryakov, the ETF’s chief liaison with DG EMPL, challenged participants to identify practical ways to ‘further link the ETF’s expertise in skills, employment and vocational education through policy dialogue, inancial assistance and European Commission initiatives.’ ETF thematic experts also had an opportunity to present activities in the counties from the governance, entrepreneurship, quality assurance, employment, qualiications and work-based learning perspective.

He was keen to build cooperation with DG EMPL. ‘Of course you work together but it is an exchange of emails, this is a sort of team building. It raises the proile of the agency between colleagues and the Delegations.’ ‘Sometimes we are reselling the language of the ETF without necessarily fully understanding it. Here I had the opportunity to go deeper, to say: ‘what is this?’ to the experts.' Romain Boitard, Delegation to Montenegro, covers social policies, including human capital development, says it was useful to hear the experiences of the other Delegations to better understand common challenges and solutions. He also got a better understanding of the ETF – which he knew as ‘an agency in the north of Italy, very competent, but remote.’ ‘Now I understand the different roles of expertise and who to call according to my needs. Our collaboration will be more effective because it will be faster.’ ‘For other Delegations in the partner countries it would be really regrettable not to optimise this availability!’ He added. Irena Radinovic, Delegation to Serbia, who covers education, has been involved in the establishment of the national qualiications framework, work-based learning models and professional development of teachers and trainers. ‘I work very closely with the ETF and feel very secure because I know the expertise and the back-up I need in my daily work is there.

The indicator for NEETs was, he added, ‘more telling’ with one in three young people falling into this category in Egypt, Morocco, Palestine and Tunisia, and one in five in Lebanon.The OECD's Pisa survey - a global snapshot of educational progress at the age of 15 - showed figures of 60-80 percent underachievement across the region.

The number of support measures is not exhaustive. The majority of the MISMES, 23, are aimed at refugees . Around half focus on soft skills, life skills and key competencies such as language, inancial and market literacy. These MISMES are mostly funded by the international donor community, including the European Union which is the largest contributor to the Syrian crisis response. The research recommends better coordination and eficiency to help avoid overlap of services. Of the remaining MISMES, seven are targeted at foreign immigrant workers, with the aim to improve the working conditions of immigrant labour - a priority area identiied by the government to attract more low-skilled Jordanian workers into these sectors. Only ive MISMES exist for Jordanian emigrants, which ‘a strikingly low’ number given the contribution of skilled Jordanians who return after a period of circular migration. Good practice examples The research highlights many innovative examples of MISMES for refugees, including the Makani My Space Approach, led by local civil society groups, promoting soft skills for youths. The Wise Water Plumbers project is helping to save water, boost gender equality and socio- economic integration, while the Skills Exchange Programme between Syrians and Jordanians is providing a skills transfer platform for low and medium skilled workers. In another project, a private collage adjusted its vocational education programmes to refugees’ needs. And thousands of Syrian refugees and Jordanians are accessing short-term labour-intensive rural job opportunities through the established Employment PInRtAeCnTsIiCvEeAInRvEeAsStmPenROt PJErCoTgSra&mCmAMeP.

Looking forward ABOUT The research makes a number of recommendations to improve skills utilisation and overcome labour market integration problems and skills mismatch. These include embedding more MISMES into a national system, with a special focus on local authorities and building a common approach to emigration and immigration. Entrepreneurship initiatives are identiied as a development area with ‘high potential’ particularly for Jordanian returnees as well as refugees. More rigorous information collection, monitoring and evaluation of MISMES is needed to better plan and implement future measures. Next steps The ETF, in cooperation with the Jordanian Ministry of Labour and EU Delegation in Amman, will disseminate the research at a high-level workshop in Amman on July 10. Stakeholders include relevant public institutions, NGOs and other international donors working together in the ield.  Did you like this article?

Human capital development and the role of government as drivers of continued economic growth shape the findings of the latest Torino Process report. This is also refected in the latest World Economic Report, 2016, which highlights the need for investment in education and training. The higher education system, which is mostly government-supported, contributes to the success of Israel’s high-tech arena. However, the technical and vocational system is not keeping pace. In order to maintain its status as the ‘startup nation’ Israel must continue to promote TVET and incorporate innovation into the curriculum. Israel is working towards a National Qualification Framework inspired by the European Qualifications Framework. This will help to improve the readability and portability of competencies, skills, knowledge and attitudes. The government is working to reach out to Arabs and ultra- Orthodox communities, populations left on the side lines of the startup economy. Drawing more women into high TVET schools, universities, workplaces and high-level jobs is another top priority. The indings of the Torino Process report were discussed by the Israeli TVET Committee and its related institutional partners at a meeting in December, 2016. The ETF’s flagship programme helps partner countries to identify priority areas for reform of their VET systems. Participating countries will meet in Torino in June 2017 for the international conference.

And enhancing public-private partnerships in VET is an important driver of the current reform process. Modernising vocational education and training in Azerbaijan is high on the national agenda and helping to support the country’s economic growth. A new national agency for VET has been established, the first ever law for VET is being prepared, and the roadmap for development is being implemented, including ways to better integrate employers into the system. Representatives from government, business, VET institutions and international donor organisations met in the capital Baku, to look at ways of taking the agenda forward by strengthening public-private partnerships. PERuArCoTpIeCaEnAUREnAioSn AJEcCtiToSn&GCrAaMntPsAfIoGrNsSeleRcEteGdIOVNEST&sCchOoUoNlTsRaInESd centres in Gabala, Ismayilly, Gakh, Jalibad, Ganja and Barda are a particular focus of the two-day PwUoBrLkIsChAoTpIO, NjoSin&tlRyEoSrOgUaRnCisEeSd bNyEtWheSREOTOF,Mth&eEEVUENDTeSlegAaBtOioUnTto Azerbaijan and the Ministry of Education. The about-to-start Action Grants are part of the EU’s €19 million Education Support Programme in Azerbaijan. The aim is to increase the attractiveness and labour market relevance of VET through increased and diverse forms of cooperation between VET providers and the private sector. Famil Mustafayev, Director of the State Agency for Vocational Education, says the EU support coincides with efforts in VET reform, including preparation of the nation's first VET law. 'Implementation, however, remains a challenge particularly if the private sector involvement and social dialogue are not fostered. Many challenges need to be addressed, including school modernisation and a stronger involvement of the private sector to foster social dialogue for a smoother implementation of the VET roadmap.' Isa Habibbayli, Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Science and Education, says new VET schools and modernisation should ‘enhance attractiveness of VET.’ 'The draft VET law, together with the VET roadmap should provide support for the work of the VET national agency, he said, noting this progress had become a reality thanks to the support of the EU and the ETF. ‘Learning from each other and from experience abroad remains key during finalisation of the legal framework and implementation.’ Jeroen Willems, Head of Cooperation at the EU Delegation in Azerbaijan, said important steps in VET reform, including the national agency, roadmap and draft law demonstrate Azerbaijan’s commitment to this priority sector. 'The engagement towards reforming the VET system has also become clear with Azerbaijan taking the lead, for the first time, in the Torino Process,' he added. #EUVocationalSkillsWeek The event in Baku is part of European Vocational Skills Week – the European Commission’s initiative highlighting the benefits of better VET. The ETF is a partner in the initiative, and all of its 29 partner countries bordering Europe are encouraged to get on-board by hosting their own event. Running from September through to December, the #EUVocationalSkillsWeek campaign is helping to show how VET is a smart choice, fun, and leads to excellence in education, high-quality jobs and increased employability.

Everything looks better in a circle. This is a paradigm of data visualisation, the presentation of data made easier and understandable through the use of a pictorial or graphical format. With this assumption representatives from Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan gathered in Torino, at the ETF, to discuss how to use evidence to impact the policy-making in the fields of higher education and vocational education and training. Throughout the exchange, participants debated the feasibility of different strategies for evidence use and communication – with a particular focus on data analysis and visualisation, and concrete country projects. “In Kazakhstan we understood that in order to convince our audiences we need to use straightforward, compressed presentations. We need to stick to one phrase, use as little text as possible, and increase the visual production. But one thing is clear: the level and quality of data visualisation is directly connected to the level of the analytics, and this is why we need highly qualiied experts” said Alima Ibrasheva, expert from the Information-Analytical Centre under the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan. During the three days of exchange, one thing emerged as key: using facts to pressure for change is a lot easier through an effective data visualisation. “Collecting objective data is key to build sound policies in education, based on scientiic proofs”, added Evgeniya Boiko, Head of the Department for Monitoring, Strategic Development and Development and Information Assurance under the Ministry of Education and Science of the Kyrgyz Republic, “This is why in the Kyrgyz Republic we have developed a system that enables to automatically collect data about education quality at all levels. This allows each parent who want his kids to go to school to click on a map, and clearly see which professional trainings are being offered.” Data visualisation can be used to inform citizens, but it can be also addressed to decision- makers to help them grasp difficult concepts or identify new patterns, and make informed choices. Such pattern is not new to the EU, where “science and innovation matters, to make sure that Commission proposals and activities are based on sound scientiic evidence”, as European Commission’s President Jean-Claude Juncker said. Background The representatives of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan gathered in the framework of the ‘Evidence Based Policy Making in Vocational Education and Training and Higher Education’ working group – an initiative of the Central Asia Education Platform , the EU’s project to boost education sector reforms within the Central Asia region. Launched in February 2012, the Platform focuses on vocational education and training and higher education, and it is foreseen to run until March 2018.

The twice yearly meetings of the Advisory Committee on Vocational Training and the Directors General of Vocational Training are key pillars of European cooperation on skills and VET. They are fora for the exchange of experience and good practice and for shaping EU policy in this area. Since achieving candidate status, Albania, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey participate fully in discussions. “Being at the ACVT and DGVT gives us impact at EU level, and motivates us to implement the good practices that we hear about, embedding them in our national framework” said Serdar Sayan, Director of the Turkish Centre for Social Policy Research. From Copenhagen to Riga, via Bruges The ACVT and DGVT play an important role in the Copenhagen-Bruges-Riga process through which countries agree on common objectives and monitor progress towards them. Alongside the EU Member States and EEA countries, all ive candidate countries are working toward the Riga medium-term deliverables, with all focusing on strengthening apprenticeships and other forms of work-based learning. All countries are taking action to introduce - or reintroduce - formal apprenticeship schemes, or to enhance those already in place, and are at various stages of policy formulation from piloting, to legislation, to implementation. The countries took stock of their progress so far, exchanged experiences and discussed shared challenges, such as the capacity of institutions to implement reforms, developing sustainable partnerships with businesses and the attractiveness of VET and apprenticeships for young people. Future of VET They took time to look forward to the future of VET beyond 2020, an issue currently on the agenda of the ACVT and DGVT. How can VET adapt to technological change, globalisation and the advent of industry 4.0? VET systems will need to become more fexible and adaptable to the needs of fast- changing labour markets, as well as to the needs of diverse learners at different stages in their lives and careers. Close partnership between employers and VET providers will PbReAcCoTmICeEeAvReEnAmS orPeRiOmJpECoTrtSa&ntCAthMaPnAiItGiNsStodRaEyGtIoOeNnSs&uCreOaUNcTloRsIeESmatch between VET provision and the needs of industry. PUBLICATIONS & RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT People will need to be fexible and adaptable too, as they may need to change professions several times in their careers, perhaps towards jobs that don’t exist today. So it is important to balance job-speciic skills with basic skills and key competences, such as team-working, learning to learn, entrepreneurship and digital skills. The boundaries between initial and tertiary VET and general and higher education may become more blurred in order to provide the increasingly high-end skills that industry needs. “Countries can sometimes feel a bit isolated in the face of such challenges” said Georgios Zisimos, senior EU policies expert at the ETF. “They came away from the meeting with a better appreciation of the role of the different bodies in EU policy cooperation and how they can use them to drive change in their own countries.”  Did you like this article?

Representatives from Bosnia and Herzegovina visited Portugal to explore best-practices on how to tackle youth unemployment. Thanks to the ETF, Members of the Ministry of Civil Affairs , the employment service agencies , and the State Agency of Statistics, had the opportunity to get familiar with the Portuguese experience in setting integrated activation schemes for young people, jobseekers in general and vulnerable groups. Bosnia and Herzegovina is unfortunately hit by high joblessness among young people, with the unemployment rate reaching 54.3% in the 15-24 age group. On the other side, Portugal has shown a coherent policy planning and design of programmes towards employment raising, especially among young people, and consistent use of EU funds to implement deep reforms and support programmes in the areas of employment, education and training, social inclusion. The participants visited organisations active in training and education programmes aimed at improving young people’s competences and insertion into the job market: The Institute for Employment and Training in Portugal training centre of Setubal, which is offering 254 different courses in line with companies’ demands The Portuguese/German Chamber of Commerce, with its 1,000 member companies, that offers traineeship opportunities, including both theoretical and practical knowledge, to young people wishing to acquire vocational skills. The systems leads to 90% employment rate at the end of the training programme and no incentives are given to companies for hosting trainees. The YMCA headquarter in Setúbal, a municipality neighbouring Lisbon, where vulnerable youth struggle with poverty and social exclusion. YMCA manages to provide training courses to young people and success is quite high: 13-15 trainees out of 20 finalise a 3-year training course that stands for upper secondary attainment and vocational qualifications. The common pathway is involving companies in the design and implementation/delivery phases of the programmes addressed to young people seem key to ensure a successful transition to the job market. Background The visit of Bosnia and Herzegovina representatives to Portugal was part of the European Vocational Skills Week, a series of event organised all over Europe to improve the attractiveness and image of vocational education and training. The initiative is part of the ETF commitment to share country examples in order to tackle youth unemployment and raise employability among young people.

The next series of Small Business Act assessments has begun in Tunisia. The focus of the latest assessment round is threefold: how entrepreneurship is promoted in secondary-level education and training; women’s entrepreneurship; and skills to support SME internationalisation.

UT Partnerships that bring policymakers and education and training providers together to share intelligence, ideas and forward-looking perspectives, is a feature of the ETF’s approach to its work to support the SBA. ‘This helps both government and the training community determine how best to improve entrepreneurship,’ sayss Najmeddine Boukhari, Head of Department of Tunisia’s Agency for the Promotion of Industry and Innovation. On entrepreneurship in education and training, the focus group recognised the value of sharing experience between general and vocational education. ‘A key issue is promoting entrepreneurship as key competence’, says ETF’s Mariavittoria Garlappi who faciliated the workshop borrowing on the EU’s new entrepreneurship competence framework . ‘I was delighted to see EntreComp is action at the l’Aouina primary school where children are at the centre of the learning process and teachers act as facilitators and not as traditional content providers,’ she continues. While more concerted efforts are needed in training for women entrepreneurs this must be co-worked with a wider drive to empower women in businesses concluded one of the focus groups. This recommendation refects wider research that businesses with women in management positions tend to&n bsp;be better performers . While skills for SME internationalisation is considered important, particularly for Tunisia’s EU trade, the focus group confirmed skills for firms operating in the domestic market is crucial, underlining the importance of training development in the country.

PTUhBeLUICkArTaIiOnNiaSn&nRaEtiSoOnUaRl CpEaSrliamNEeWnSt,RtOhOeMVe&rkEhVEoNvnTSa RaAdBaO, UhTas adopted a new framework law on education, bringing the system closer to European standards. The new law, passed on September 5, ushers in a 12-year school system in place of the current 11 years, with compulsory education to age 18. It shifts the Ukrainian system away from the former Soviet model, in which the Ministry of Education determined the content of curricula, and closer to European models, in which the Government adopts educational standards, with educational institutions free to develop curricula, content and teaching methods in order to deliver them. The new law provides that Ukraine’s education will receive at least 7% of GDP from national, regional and local budgets and other sources of funding, and opens the door for limited self-funding of public educational institutions. 'This is a basic law. Its approval unlocks further education reforms and the adoption of laws on secondary education, vocational education and adult education…[It] is a chance for our education system to change."" announced Ukrainian Minister of Education and Science, Liliya Hrynevych. The ETF cooperated closely with the Ukrainian Government, together with experts mobilised by the EU TAIEX programme, in the development of the law, providing advice and support on key aspects such as lifelong learning, quality assurance and decentralisation. It was also involved in the drafting process, commenting on successive drafts of the law and participating in parliamentary hearings. 'This is a very modern law, refecting up-to-date ideas on education. The ETF has accompanied the Ukrainians throughout this process.' explained ETF Senior Expert Arjen Deij. 'It’s a good example of what we can achieve when the political will is there, by responding to needs, bringing the actors together and empowering them to develop home-grown solutions in line with European and international good practice.' The ETF continues to work closely with the Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Science on education and training policy. A jointly developed Green Paper on the decentralisation of vocational education and training was presented in Kiyv in April of this year in the presence of Ukrainian Prime Minister, Volodymyr Groysman, and EU Ambassador, Hugues Mingarelli. The results of this work will feed into a new law on VET that is expected to come before the Ukrainian Parliament later this year. The EU has pledged to support the Ukrainian Government in implementing it. “If there is the political will on your side, we will mobilise all our resources to support you.” declared Ambassador Mingarelli in April. The ETF is now working on two fronts: supporting the Ministry by providing expert advice and facilitating stakeholder dialogue on the forthcoming VET law, and supporting the EU Delegation in designing a major assistance programme for the VET sector. “In Ukraine, legislation drives strategic reforms.' said ETF Desk Oficer for Ukraine, Margareta Nikolovska. “The new VET Law is extremely important for skills development and economic PgRrAowCTtIhCEinAtRhEeAcSouPnRtrOyJ.

The future of vocational skills was centre stage at the 2017 World Skills conference in Abu Dhabi.

Elnur Suleymanov from Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Population, said the job market was not keeping pace with the high number of graduates making the transition into work. ‘The mobility of people is increasing. Borders of countries exist on political maps, but are not a real obstacle for labour mobility.’ ‘The key issue is not only about what skills need to be developed, but rather how is the education system operates. You have to keep people updated. This means you have to work on your skills continuously.’ Rodion Kolyshko, from the Confederation of Employers in Ukraine, said business needs to be the driver of change. ‘Education systems are conservative. We need to invent the future, ensure that our education systems provide basic skills and develop students for lifelong learning.’ Employers have been very active in the skills dialogue, particularly in the context of skilled migration,’ he said, noting that seven million Ukrainians are living abroad, a further 60,000 students study abroad and only 20% are likely to return. ‘Employers have taken a lead role in reviewing qualifications and developing occupational and educational standards.’ Osman Yildiz, General Secretary of Turkey’s HAK-Is Trade Union, discussed the important role of the Vocational Qualifications Authority in defining occupational standards and qualifications and in establishing vocational testing centres to validate skills obtained through non-formal and informal learning, such as on-the-job. The system has been developed with support of the European Union and in-line the European Qualifications Framework – which aims to make qualifications more readable and understandable across countries, he said. ‘We are very internationally oriented. It is important that qualifications are developed according to common rules and principles.’ Improving the World With the Power of Skills Skills to support youth employability and equality, and a global skills snapshot to shape vocational education provision, were other hot topics of the conference, held as part of WorldSkills, the largest and most prestigious international skills competition. Laurence Gates, Chair of the Conference Coalition, thanked the ETF and all partners for ‘leading the conversation and providing unique networking opportunities’ He paid special thanks to the 'amazing young WorldSkills Champions' who took part in the sessions.

The annual event will also contribute to preparations for the forthcoming peer visit in 2020. Participants will review Forum activities on quality indicators, and discuss and agree the Forum's strategy and action plan for 2020-2022. Background The European Training Foundation launched the Forum for Quality Assurance in Vocational Education and Training in November 2017. The Forum is a transnational collaboration initiative between national institutions with vocational education and training and/or vocational education and training quality assurance mandates in ETF’s partner countries. The aim of the Forum is to support member countries to modernise and improve quality assurance in VET by providing the context and means for peer learning through multinational co-operation. A peer visit is an opportunity for external feedback to the host, which can support Forum members in their quality assurance development efforts. The peer visit in Tunisia was an opportunity to pilot for the first time the ETF Quality Assurance Forum`s Peer Visit Methodology, which forms part of the ETF Peer Visit Guidance and Training Manual. The second peer visit will take place in March 2020, and a third visit will take place in the second half of 2020.

""Exploring the harmonization of continuous professional development offer with the actual needs of teachers"" brought together senior professionals from across South Eastern Europe to explore a key factor in vocational education and training reform. Striving to improve In-service training for teachers within vocational education systems can beneit from regional cooperation and peer review, delegates to the Podgorica one-day workshop heard. The third meeting of the Teacher Education and Training Network for South Eastern Europe , set up in June 2018, brought together senior professionals from economies that included Albania, Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Moldova and North Macedonia, to look at issues in continuous professional development . In a region where there are different levels and experience in VET system reform, the experience of Lower Austria's University College of Teacher Training - a three campus institution that offers over 60,000 training courses every year, in addition to under and post- graduate courses for hundreds of students - provided an insight into what an advanced, well-resourced, central- government backed system of European CPD looks like. ""We have very close cooperation with schools and INSET courses that are held in the schools,"" Michaela Tscherne, a professor of quality management at the University College, said. PTRraAiCnTinICgEwARasEA""pSlanPnReOdJEaCnTdSo&rgCAanMiPseAdIGbNyS thReEsGcIhOoNoSls&"" CshOeUNTRIES added - with all costs for approved courses covered by the PcUoBlleLIgCeATbIuOdNgSe&t,RnEeSgOoUtRiaCtEeSd wNitEhWtShReOMOiMni&stEryVEoNf TESducAaBtOioUnT every three years. Training for needs Julian Stanley, an ETF specialist on vocational teachers and trainers, emphasised that in a voluntary network it was up to stakeholders to concentrate on improving needs analysis to inform their own training systems and those of economies in the region. ""A network is a great opportunity for learning,"" Mr Stanley said. ""It is hard work setting up a national system [of CPD] and you want to get it right. One thing we can do together is to express our voice collectively to ind solutions."" Sharing experience CPD systems exist in all the member countries of the network, the conference heard, although the level of integration and communication between the national, regional and local levels of VET systems vary considerably. In Montenegro, where a system of licensed teachers was introduced in 2014, vocational school staff must pass legally deined training courses every ive years in order to remain in the profession. A network of school-based CPD coordinators is being set up to improve the system and a structured system of career advancement through grades based on completing professional training courses offers a speciic incentive structure apart from the legal minimum of licence renewal. Most countries require teachers to undergo professional evaluation every three to four years - such as North Macedonia, where although there is no licence system, teachers must complete 40 hours of accredited programmes every three years, including 20 hours of government-set ""priority training"". ""In most cases economies in the region have the systems [of CPD],"" Mr Stanley said. ""The challenge is to improve these systems to make them more responsive to needs.""

Background Now at its 5th edition , the ‘Torino Process’ is an initiative of the European Training Foundation. It is a periodical assessment tool used by countries bordering the EU to measure the effectiveness of reforms in countries' education and training systems, in a lifelong learning perspective. Armenia has been using the ‘Torino Process’ since 2010-2011 showing, despite relatively low expenditure on education, an overall high educational attainment. However, public spending is still low in vocational education – the pathway towards better employability. The EU-Armenia policy dialogue is an initiative of the European Union expected to allow the EU to follow closely the preparation of future reforms and strategies in the Education field.

On 9 May 1950, in a Europe still smarting from the scars of war, Robert Schuman, French Foreign Minister, called on the former combatant nations to pool their coal and steel production. Instead of competing, countries would henceforth cooperate in these strategic industrial sectors in the interest of peace. As Schuman declared: “Pooling coal and steel production... will change the destinies of those regions which have long been devoted to the manufacture of munitions of war, of which they have been the most constant victims."" Robert Schuman was himself a native of the French-German borderlands, a major centre of coal and steel production, and for centuries a theatre of European great power rivalry. Born in Luxembourg, by turns a German and a French citizen, speaking both languages fuently, with personal experience of war and occupation, Schuman was ideally placed to spearhead Franco-German reconciliation after two world wars.

Thanks to Robert Schuman, the European Union was conceived as a peace project. By building bridges of mutual interdependence, exchange and cooperation, confict between nations becomes unthinkable. Through its successive enlargements, and through its policies of partnership and cooperation policies towards neighbouring countries, the European Union is building a growing zone of peace and prosperity in Europe and beyond. The European Training Foundation, which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, has been working since 1994 in over 40 countries supporting the European Union’s peace project by helping countries make the most of their human capital through the modernisation of education, training, skills and labour market systems. Skills provide opportunities for people and contribute to economic growth and social cohesion. In commemorating 9 May 2019, the ETF looks forward to its next 25 years supporting the European Union in building peace and prosperity across the world through its high level expertise and long experience of human capital and skills in developing and transition countries. As Robert Schuman said in his Declaration: “World peace cannot be safeguarded without making creative efforts proportionate to the dangers which threaten it.”  Did you like this article?

RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT Simple aim, complex means Opening the European Training Foundation's second regional EaP forum on work-based learning in vocational education and training, in Lviv, Ukraine, Tuesday , Carmo Gomes, Head of the ETF's Country Intelligence Unit, noted that WBL was often the go-to term for politicians and policymakers keen to offer a panacea for all that is wrong with VET. But getting on-the- job training within a quality-assured framework of VET was not so simple. ""Is it easy to bring employers to the table to discuss with public providers the organisation and funding of students in their workplaces? No,"" she told delegates that included participants from Kazakhstan in addition to the EaP countries. ""And there is no European-wide model to export, but we do know that WBL graduates are more successful in getting a job."" Increased prestige, improved output Bringing the benefits of WBL to small and medium enterprises was a goal worth achieving, Kirsi Lindroos, Team Leader for the support group to Ukraine at the European Commission's Directorate-General for European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations , stressed. ""If well implemented, WBL can significantly increase the attractiveness of VET among young people. It can help students improve academically, increase motivation and the relationship of schools with the community."" She added: ""Employers are able to hire better employees and reduce their overall training costs."" Petro Korzhevskyi, Ukraine's Deputy Minister of Education and Science said that WBL supported creativity among young trainees.

RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT Models of success Didier Gelibert, the ETF's specialist on private sector engagement in VET, sketched out the figures demonstrating the importance of SME's to EaP economies, where they account for 95% of companies , and employ up to nearly half the workforce. In countries where most SMEs are in the service sector and account for around a third of GDP, formalising quality in-house training can have major economic benefits. Implementing that in companies employing only a few people can be a challenge. Nikoloz Meskhishvili, of the Georgian Farmers Association, which is piloting WBL in agricultural in a country where 15% of the population still farm, said that splitting VET programmes to 2 days at school/3 days at work, had not been easy - teachers resented losing part of their income and small farmers sometimes relied upon paying students in kind, for example with beehives for those working in beekeeping. Sophia Grunert, of the German Confederation of Skilled Crafts and Small Businesses, noted that even in an advanced economy like Germany's there are a million craft companies that employ an average of five or fewer people and 81 percent of apprentices are trained in SMEs. Like Alexandra Costa Artur, of Portuguese training consultancy Imanovation, who spoke about promoting skilled training in the industrial painting trade, Grunert emphasised the importance of pooling resources to support WBL in small companies. The Lviv conference continues Wednesday with visits to vocational schools before concluding Thursday.  Did you like this article?

The document presents the main indings from the 2018 collection of statistics that enables countries to evaluate and compare their progress in human capital development. Vocational education: an effective solution to be equally distributed Vocational training is proven to be a fast-track from school to work, with higher employment rates among young adults who graduated from vocational training in nearly all countries. Nevertheless, not all countries offer the same opportunities: while almost 100% of Uzbek upper-secondary students are enrolled in vocational programmes, only 10% of Georgian, Palestinian and Tunisian students follow vocational training. This has an impact on the dropout rate: in countries with many upper secondary students enrolled in vocational programmes – such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Israel, Montenegro, Serbia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – up to 10% of students leave their studies early. Tackling social exclusion with basic skills In most countries neighbouring the EU, students are aged 15 when they begin vocational education, and it is common that they lack basic skills, such as reading, mathematics and science. Vocational education programmes therefore have to complement the provision of skills for employment with basic competences. Succeeding in this has a positive inluence on persistently high youth unemployment rates – half of young people in Kosovo*, around 45% in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Palestine**, and about one in three in Albania, Montenegro and Serbia. Increasing knowledge: yes, and matching with job market needs PWRAhCilTeICinEsAoRmEAeScouPnRtOriJeEsC about two thirds of PaUdBuLltICsAaTtItOaNinSa&t RmEoSOstUlRoCwEeSr seNcEoWndSRaOryOeMd&ucEaVtEioNnT,Sin mABoOsUt T countries increasing numbers of better-educated young people are entering the labour force. Although in line with growing knowledge-based labour force demand, this does not always lead to better employment prospects. Indeed, school-to-work transition remains problematic in most areas surrounding the EU, and in some countries, holding a university degree does not always mean being able to get a job. Taking care of workers, throughout their lives Access to training remains rather unbalanced in most countries: men are more likely than women to attend continuing training and young adults and those who are better educated enjoy more training opportunities than older workers. Upskilling through training can have positive consequences and therefore ensuring equal access is a necessary step – but this should not be pursued in purely quantitative terms: the content and focus of skills should match future labour market contexts. Background The European Training Foundation is the EU agency which support countries surrounding the EU to reform their vocational education and labour policies, in line with the EU’s external relations policy. Annually, the ETF publishes the ‘Key Indicators on Education, Skills and Employment’ publication, which offers cross-nationally comparable statistics to assess developments in vocational education, skills and labour market topics.

In countries surrounding the EU patterns can be identiied, and despite national differences, one thing is sure: vocational education is proven to mitigate the risk of early leaving – an analysis of the European Training Foundation says. Spotlight on EU neighbouring countries North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Turkey and Tunisia are countries surrounding the European Union with substantial differences in their education systems, but all are responding to the challenge of students leaving school – although with significant dissimilarities. The European Training Foundation, the EU agency supporting countries PnReAigChTIbCoEuArRinEgASthePERUOtJoECreTSfo&rmCAeMdPuAcIaGtNioSn aRnEdGIlaObNoSu&r CmOaUrNkTeRt IsEySstems, has recently explored drop-out patterns in the countries to provide policy makers with evidence in PsUuBpLpIoCrAtToIOf NimS m& ReEdSiaOtUeRpCoElSicy rNeEsWpoSnROseO. M & EVENTS ABOUT The shorter the studies, the higher the drop-out Let’s start by focusing on vocational education: it might look counter-intuitive, but recent evidence shows that students are more likely to abandon studies when these are shorter. Indeed, for 3-years vocational programs there is one drop-out every four students in North Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, whereas only some 15% of students abandon studies before completion, in 4-years long programs. This is not the case for Turkey, where only 4- years vocational programs exist, and drop-out rate is about 30%. Boys, more likely to leaving school than girls Irrespective of the duration of studies, data highlight significant gender patterns, with young men being more likely to drop than women. For instance, in Montenegro one third of young men dropped from 3-years vocational education programs, and one fourth in Serbia and North Macedonia, whereas drop-out rate is lower for young women: only some 10% in Montenegro and Serbia. Similar gender patterns occur for 4-years vocational education programs, with young men being leaving earlier more often than women. This is also valid for Turkey, but not for Tunisia, where drop-out rate for women reaches 75% for some programs . The role of context in leaving school The reasons behind drop-out may vary a lot – from an individual’s story, to family reasons, to the community environment and the school context – but one thing is true: data show patterns at a national level, hence the need to provide country-specific responses. Expanding the focus from vocational education to all education paths, Tunisia is suffering from a very high drop-out rate: one every two students leave school before the completion of studies, and this trend is even worse for women – where only 25% complete the studies. In the country, there’s no difference between vocational education and other education paths. This trends improves in Turkey, where two every three students complete school, and Montenegro, with 95% of students completing education. Reacting to drop out School dropout in the education system requires strategic action by all those involved in it: politicians, decision makers, parents, teachers and students. In reacting to the problem, data can help in finding solutions. Although the relationship is not always a straightforward one, vocational education is proven to be a mitigating factor of the risk of early leaving. In Montenegro, Serbia and North Macedonia less than 10% of 18-24-year-olds dropped out of school in 2017. All countries have in common a very high proportion of upper secondary students enrolled in vocational programmes.

Subsequently, more efforts should be made towards better measuring and address in the policy actions. Background: How to measure drop-out Drop-out is typically difficult to measure and could be due to many factors. The European Training Foundation has analysed the issue by using national data collection and by measuring the incidence of drop-out is by using the completion rates. The completion rate describes the percentage of students who graduate from a programme a given number of years after they entered as a share of those who entered. Drop-out can be therefore estimated as the share of those failing to complete a programme.  Did you like this article?

Many of the vocational qualifications become obsolete because of the changes happening in the labour market. The qualifications systems have to react and adapt Assuring quality in vocational training RELATED COUNTRIES PqRuAicCkTlIyC.ETAhReEpAuSblicPRaOutJhECoTriSti&esCwAMouPAldIGnNeSed RtoEGshIOaNpSe& COUNTRIES policies in order to prepare the education system to the PnUeBwLIcChAaTlIlOeNnSge&sR. ESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT Usually the key ministries play the key role in the strategic decision-making process, but when it comes to the implementation of the reform of qualifications system, sometimes there is no clear division between roles and responsibilities. A specialized body with dedicated group of professionals working on qualifications could make a difference in the speed and sustainability of the reforms, but only if there will be a clear division of roles and responsibilities between main actors. Case of Ukraine - NAK Ukraine is working hard on the reform of the qualifications system. National Qualifications Framework has been adopted in 2011 and the new Law on Education endorsed in 2017. Many groups of stakeholders interact and several Ministries are involved in the skills development and lifelong-learning agenda. In 2018 the Cabinet of Ministers decided to create a single body, National Agency for Qualifications , that would make sure that the National Qualification System is in place and that different elements of it would work well together. The main functions of the NAK will include the supporting of the development of the national qualification system, the facilitation of the dialogue between different stakeholders and national social partners, the alignment of national qualifications with international qualifications framework and much more. In order to make sure that the Agency remains independent, its governing board is collegial and will include the representatives of the Ministries, employers association and trade unions. It will be co-founded by the government and the social partners that would make its decisions would bring benefit to the whole system. Currently the Agency is to be registered by the government of Ukraine and organizational set-up is to be defined. In order to assist Ukrainian stakeholders with the preparation of the work plan of the recently established NAK, the European Training Foundation has organized a 3 PdRaAyCsTtIrCaEinAinRgEAinSvitPinRgOJreEpCTreSs&enCtAaMtiPvAeIsGoNfStheRMEGinIOisNtSry&oCfOUNTRIES Education, Ministry of Social Policy, employers association PaUnBdLtICraAdTeIOuNnSio&nRsEoSfOUUkRrCaEinS e iNnEoWrdSeRrOtOoMdi&scEuVsEsNaTnSd dAeBfiOnUeT the NAK priorities for the upcoming years. During this event, that took place on 26-28 January, the stakeholders not only started to prepare actual strategy for the Agency’s work, but also have got the possibilities to learn how qualifications bodies work in different countries. The experts from Turkey, Portugal and Estonia have presented their national qualifications institutions and the impact such bodies have had on the reform of their education and training. In Turkey, the Vocational Qualification Authority , created in 2006, assisted in establishing the Turkish Qualifications Framework, developing occupational standards and establishing the independent assessment centres. «The involvement of the national key stakeholders is the most important part of the institutional side of VET reform» said Osman Seckin Akbiyik from VQA, «but don’t forget, the more duties are taken by the Agency, the more resources are needed, and if the institution is not successful enough in all those tasks, and then heavy criticism comes in». In Portugal, the National Agency for Qualification and Vocational Education and Training , established also in 2006, is a coordinating the implementation of policies in the file of vocational education and training of young people and adults. Another important role of ANQEP is to ensure the development of the procedures for recognition of prior learning. It is the example of efficient cooperation between different the ministries and social partners involved into the skills development agenda.

From Ukraine to Algeria: striking common trends The study – which focuses on countries such as Albania, Algeria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Kosovo, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Palestine, Serbia, Turkey, and Ukraine – highlights a striking trend: in all countries, women participate less than men in vocational education. Given the increase of employability that this type of education offers, the natural consequence is a lower level of job PoRpApCoTrItCuEnAitRieEsA/eSmpPlRoOyJmECeTnSt &prCoAsMpePcAtIsGNfoSr wRoEmGeIOnN.

A sorry state of affairs: women’s exclusion In 2017 the share of 15-24 year-old women not in employment, education nor training was much higher than that of men. In a large group of countries – including Georgia, Moldova, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina – one in four women is inactive; in Jordan and Algeria, this trend affects one in two young women. The gender gap is most evident in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean countries, where the female rate is sometimes double that of males. Women: more university-like A more positive trend emerges from the analysis of access to university: in most countries surrounding the European Union, women outperform men in tertiary attainment . But unfortunately, this does not always lead to appropriate skills matching: it is common that women find jobs which are way below their educational level. As an example, in North Macedonia and Montenegro one in ten women having studied hard to finish high-school, end up in jobs that require only basic skills. Finding a job: a male prerogative In most countries bordering the EU, women are more likely to be jobless. However, this fact is even more pronounced in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean: every other Palestinian woman is unemployed compared to one in four men; and in Algeria, the gender gap is even worse - the female unemployment rate is 20.7% against a male rate of 9.4%. Among other factors, this is also linked to imbalances in access to lifelong learning: PwRiAthCTtIhCeE eAxRcEeApStionPRoOf JUEkCrTaSin&eCaAnMdPSAeIGrbNiSa, wRoEmGIeOnNpS a&rtCiOciUpNaTteRIlEeSss than men in adult training. In countries like Albania, Georgia and Jordan, only 1% of women aged 25-64 took PpUaBrtLIiCnAaTdIOuNltSt&raRinEiSnOgUpRrCoEgSramNmEWeSsRinOO20M17&. EVENTS ABOUT Facts matter, but quality is key Data show that imbalances are still high in the EU’s neighbouring countries, and result from many factors: socio-cultural norms, less favourable working environments or family duties. Raising education opportunities can increase women’s opportunities to access jobs, and better ones, with positive consequences for their lives. However, access to training should not be pursued in purely quantitative terms: the content and focus of skills should also match future labour market contexts.

ABOUT The decentralisation process has many challenges, but one simple goal – to unveil the potential and benefits of vocational education at the regional level. The EU has launched a budget support project to assist the on-going reforms. It will consolidate efforts and mobilise public resources to modernise vocational education providers in Ukraine. Activities will start before the end of 2019, but in the meantime and in order to prepare the ground, the ETF, in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and Science and the EU Delegation, has helped start a process of establishing Centres of Excellence and Innovation in vocational education and training in the country. These Centres will support the reform of vocational education and increase the efficiency of the skills development at the regional level. The way forward for Ukraine Ukrainian stakeholders met at a seminar on “Setting up VET Centres of Excellence and Innovation in Ukraine: learning practices for policy implementation” organised by the ETF on 5-6 March 2019 in Kyiv. They agreed on a finalised concept and roadmap for the Centres of Excellence initiative. Officials from the Ministry of Education and Science presented a proposal on how to move forward with the implementation of the project by identifying priority economic sectors, such as agriculture, industry, mechanical engineering and transport, which will pilot the initiative. The development of these Centres of Excellence is co- financed from the EU project and national funds. Centre of Excellence candidates are selected through an open and transparent competition with an evaluation committee made up of representatives from social partners, public authorities and civil society. The selection criteria include the extent of the regional dimension as well as the focus on economic development, PdReAmCoTIgCrEaApRhEicAsSituPaRtiOonJE, CthTSe &stCaAtuMsPoAfIGthNeS regREioGnIOalNS & COUNTRIES vocational education system, previous experience with PpUroBjLeICctAsTrIOelNaSte&dRtEoSlOifUelRoCnEgS leaNrEnWinSgRaOnOdMt&heEVeEffiNcTiSencAyBoOfUT stakeholder cooperation. Background information What is a Centre of Excellence and Innovation? According to the ETF and based on international experience and best practice, Centres of Excellence: Are networks of organisations that bring together different education providers in a public-private partnership. Refect national priorities in terms of industrial and economic development. Have a strong orientation towards technological and innovative sectors. Provide high quality qualifications and may facilitate the link to tertiary education. Have the potential to play a strategic role in increasing the reputation and popularity of vocational education and training Could rationalise the network of education providers, e.g by closing/merging institutions. Require high-level investment and capacities, both human and inancial. The term “Centres of Excellence” may be referred to differently depending on the context of different countries, which can create confusion. They are sometimes known as industrial training institutes, industrial training centres, resource centres, regional centres, industry skills centres or multi-functional centres.

This coincided with a new policy on devolved inancial and management responsibility for VET. Cesare Onestini, Director of the European Training Foundation, underlined how the Torino Process is well- connected to the on-going reform process in the country and supports the new EU project on Skills for Ukraine. ‘Ukraine’s involvement in the Torino Process is unique’, said Viktoria Karbysheva, National Coordinator of Torino Process in Ukraine. ‘In the last round we decided to take it nationwide into all the regions. The results were incredible because of the regional input and we are going to repeat the process this time’.

With a new €58 million programme ‘EU4Skills: Better Skills for Better Jobs in Modern Ukraine 2018-2020, launched at the beginning of this year, it is also in the limelight in terms of EU support. Stefan Schleuning from the EU Delegation in Ukraine says ‘it is time to step-up for improvement in education and we are here to help together with the ETF.’ Summing up the opening session, Margareta Nikolovska, the ETF’s country coordinator for Ukraine explained what would be the key outcomes of this round of the Torino Process which will be completed in 2020. With all regions on-board, Ukraine is teaching us about participation – the founding principle of the Torino Process, she said. The next steps will be the preparation of all 25 regional reports, plus a national report and an ETF assessment.

Focusing on its member countries – Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia – the partnership will contribute to facilitating cooperation in the region. While taking into account international developments in education, the focus will remain on national context and priorities: the way towards sustainable economic developments and sustainable education reforms. Regional cooperation: key to education developments ERISEE is a Western Balkans organisation which supports sustainable education reforms at national level through regional and international cooperation. It was created in 2003 to boost strategic cooperation in the area of education and training, to increase the stability of the region in its EU accession process. The EU Strategy for the Western Balkans reinforced this approach in its fagship initiative P‘RReAcCoTnICcEiliAaRtiEoAnS, goPoRdOnJEeCigThSb&oCuArMlyPrAeIlGatNioSnsRaEnGdIOreNgSi&onCaOlUcNoToRpIeErSation’, where regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations are considered key to progress in the PcUoBuLnItCrAieTsIO' rNeSsp&eRcEtiSvOeUERuCrEoSpeaNnEpWaStRhOs.O‘TMh&e EeVxEisNtiTnSg reAgBiOoUnTal initiatives need to be further exploited in order to continue contributing to political stabilisation and to create economic opportunities’, the document says, adding that ‘good neighbourly relations should continue to be reinforced through regional cooperation initiatives’ . Education: a strategic priority in the Western Balkans In such a process, education plays a key role. As mentioned in its Strategy for the Western Balkans, the EU adds that ‘the role of education must be given a higher priority especially in terms of fostering greater tolerance, promoting European values and strengthening the cohesion of society’. More speciically, the EU identiies as priorities the reduction of early leavers from education and training and the increase in tertiary educational attainment. In this regard, the EU advises to strengthen links between education and labour market systems, in particular through work-based learning, the standardisation of qualiications and lifelong training of teachers. Background Together with the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research, European Training Foundation advises ERISEE’s governing board members in shaping sustainable education reforms in South Eastern Europe. ERISEE's governing board consists of representatives appointed by ministries in charge of education from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia – as well as a representative of the KulturKontakt Austria as donor, and the Regional Cooperation Council.  Did you like this article?

In a meeting attended by ETF director Cesare Onestini, the country launched the 5th cycle of the Torino Process, a periodical assessment for education reforms. The Palestinian Minister of Education and Higher Education, H.E. Dr Sabri Saidam, said that “the Torino Process can support exploring ways of making vocational education and training more attractive, including trough integrating vocational and training subjects in general education. Attractiveness”, he added, “also implies a change of mindset in the way vocational education is perceived in society”. The Deputy Minister of Labour od Palestine, Dr Samer Salameh, said that “in the next ten years the Palestinian labour market will need more technicians, and this is why vocational education and training is a profitable investment. The Torino Process”, he added, “offers opportunities to learn also from other countries’ similar challenges”.

Compared to the past, more focus should be put on solutions with the purpose of sharing them with others, to make the most of new ideas and innovative ways of addressing problems“. What’s the Torino Process Evidence is key to implementing education and training policies, and the ‘Torino Process’ is a way to make this happen in countries around the EU. The work starts with the involvement of each country’s most relevant authorities and stakeholders active in in education, training and employment – state authorities, public administration bodies, international organisations, employers and representatives of companies/private sector, and other relevant civil society actors. Through their commitment and active engagement, countries can succeed in activities such as: Analysing the skills needed by adults all over their life to remain active in the labour market; Checking if the offer of vocational education satisfies the skills needed by enterprises; Verifying the quality of schools against minimum standards. Changing in times of changes Launched eight years by the ETF, the Torino Process has faced global trends consistently impacting the labour market and education systems – demographic shift, migration, digitalisation, climate change – and it has adapted to make sure that learning processes and employment opportunities throughout life are adaptive, too. Compared to previous years, the revised assessment tool focuses on skills provision in a life- long learning perspective including all types of and processes of learning at all ages or moments of life cycle. Moreover, the Torino Process will aslo include a component of external assessment of the key-challenges the national education and training systems are facing in order to identify entry-points for systemic reforms. What’s next After the launch of the new 2019-20 cycle, countries will undertake participatory dialogues with all concerned parties, and steer the collection of evidence needed to have a clear view on the countries. Moreover, countries will dialogue with others at a regional level, offering important opportunity for peer learning and sharing of experience and best practice. To conclude the exercise, the ETF will use findings to produce an assessment report, which will presented to countries for discussion. Through policy recommendations, countries will proceed nationally with follow-up actions and contribute to a valuable international community, discussing how to provide training responsive to trends and the future of skills – to the benefit of people.

Future ETF activities were also in focus in Manila. Two important tools, developed at EU level, will feature in ETF partner country activities – the Digital Competence Framework and the Entrepreneurship Competence Framework to support new learning and teaching methods, assessing schools’ ability to integrate digital learning and design a development plan supporting teachers and trainers through change. More detailed discussion at the Manila forum on the value of the ETF demonstration project experience in Montenegro, highlighted the necessity of partnership between national education and business organisations to update teachers' professional knowledge and skills through placements in industry, which have since been scaled up to national level. In addition, great value was gained from the example in Turkey, where a single teacher led a high-quality teaching development programme on digital instructional materials, rolled out at regional level, thanks to the support of the school director, peers and local authority. Identifying teacher development needs, ensuring institutional support, networking amongst peers and multi-stakeholder engagement within a national policy context are key elements in innovative models addressing challenges facing teachers. Upgrading pedagogical and technical skills refecting labour market demand and exploiting digital media to ensure learner oriented programmes are crucial.

Tamsin Rose, Senior Fellow at Friends of Europe moderated the event called The Power of Skills in EU Relations, and introduced ETF director, Cesare Onestini, who said the evening was an opportunity to share the ETF’s story and to talk about its strategy for the future.

Recently, the European Commission invited the ETF to provide support for the development of a qualiications framework for the whole of the African continent. The ETF is the only EU agency that receives funding to operate in the external relations ield. The power of skills and the empowerment of human capital supported by the ETF lays the foundation for sustainable and inclusive economic and social development, leading to stability and prosperity in the EU’s partner countries. This is “something that is in our interests as much as it is in the interests of citizens of the countries beyond our borders,” Onestini said. The evening’s keynote speaker, Ayla Göksel, Chief Executive Oficer of the Turkish Non-Governmental Organisation Özyegin Social Investments, which focuses on education, early childhood, parenting, and empowerment for women, spoke about her work and her conclusions after 25 years in the ield. Although the ETF’s scope is vocational training, said Göksel, studies have shown that the early years are the most formative, which is why, in her view, “a conversation on future skills must include young children and their mothers and fathers.” A panel and open discussion followed, which included David O’Sullivan, former Commission Secretary General and recent EU Ambassador in Washington, Portuguese MEP Margarida Marques, Vice-Chair of the Committee on Budgets, and Manuela Geleng, European Commission Director for Skills. “Skills mean power”, said Margarida Marques. She stressed the importance of skills in cooperation between the EU and Africa on the subject of migration. Manuela Geleng said vocational training must be modernised and new jobs must be adapted to new tasks. “We will have to change jobs many times in our lives but we have to continue learning throughout.” Turning towards the future of the ETF, Mika Saarinen, with the Finnish National Agency for Education asked Cesare Onestini how he saw the ETF entering the discussion of continuing education and how it can grow with evolving skills and competencies.

Below the impact of dimensions of PPPs from diverse countries are set out in broad categories: Vocational Education and Training Governance PPPs for skills development can contribute to better system-level governance in VET. Built against the background of the multilevel governance approach to VET, PPPs help to better align VET to market needs creating governance mechanisms that bring effectiveness and efficiency to VET policy making. Governing vocational training PRACTICE AREAS PROJECTS & CAMPAIGNS REGIONS & COUNTRIES Innovation in VET PUBLICATIONS & RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT PPPs for skills development can also contribute to innovation in VET policy and delivery. We rely on OECD’s definition of educational innovation as a change in educational context introduced to improve the operation of education systems, their performance, stakeholder satisfaction or all of these together. Considering this, we can establish innovative: -Forms of collaboration -Financial arrangements -Governance arrangements -Content Accessibility to VET PPPs for skills development can contribute to ensuring increased access to training opportunities for all. There are two aspects. First, cost-sharing between public and private partners helps to increase the provision of skills. This is particularly important given constraints in the public funding of VET experienced in many countries. Second, certain PPPs also have the potential to enhance social inclusion in VET as they target students who academically excluded. In fact, a number of PPPs identified within this study helped to increase the reach of VET provision, thanks to complementary private funding, which is one of the key elements defining PPPs. Quality of VET PPPs can play a role in shifting VET provision from supply to demand-driven, which can increase the attractiveness and quality of VET. Although VET quality can be understood in different terms, we put an emphasis on PPPs’ contribution to anticipating and developing skills for future needs as well as building bridges between the world of work and training providers. PRACTICE AREAS PROJECTS & CAMPAIGNS REGIONS & COUNTRIES Youth employment and economic growth PUBLICATIONS & RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT Successful PPPs can eventually contribute to higher employment rates of young people as well as economic growth. Effective collaboration between the public and private sectors can particularly increase the employability of VET school graduates/young job seekers and boost the job placement rate of VET degree holders. When VET is aligned with labour market needs, employers are more willing and able to hire young graduates as they require less mentoring and training and become productive sooner.  Did you like this article?

The panel projected on the direction skills’ policies will take in the coming years, taking inspiration from the event, which will see the EU’s skills agenda and implementation updated in view of occupational trends, qualifications, lifelong learning and giving more power to the learner. After 10 years the Eastern Partnership is being refected upon at the EU’s headquarters, reported Jeroen Willems. Its focus will shift beyond basic policy reforms to implementation, for which teachers will be supported with an emphasis on mobility. Attention to curricula, enhancing fexibility and including green skills, digital innovation, and artificial intelligence will also be needed to respond to labour market needs in the face of global opportunities and challenges. From an employment perspective, Jean-Paul Heerschap stressed the importance of vocational education and training linking to employment and business, trade and regional cooperation, in particular through national qualification systems. ‘Skills must be co-created from the bottom-up’. The ETF’s Skills and Qualifications Toolkit presented at the conference was designed to support this bottom-up process. Moreover, the ETF’s new strategy 2021-2027 will focus on the generation of new knowledge to enable skills development by launching three new activities on skills demand, the creation of new learning, and vocational centres of excellence respectively.

They stressed the need to focus further on concrete priorities, such as supporting decent job creation and entrepreneurship, mobilising public and private stakeholders to create partnerships and synergies, building inclusive Labour markets to integrate potentially vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, investing in quality education and training for skills and employability in a changing world of work. Ministers also invited the European Commission and, in particular the European Training Foundation, to provide relevant expertise to support their work. As part of the ministerial policy conference, ‘Jobs, Skills and Opportunities for All’ were discussions on the most pressing labour market issues. Reporting back from the workshop on ‘More and better jobs: Employment creation and entrepreneurship’, ETF Director Cesare Onestini, advocated a comprehensive approach to job creation PinRcAlCuTdIiCnEgAaRcEtAioSns PtoROinJcErCeTaSse& lCaAbMoPuAr IdGeNmS anRdE,GeInOhNaSn&ceCOthUeNTRIES quality of labour supply and employability and improve PmUaBtLcIChAinTgIObNeStw& eReEnSOjoUbRsCEaSnd sNkEiWllsS.

VoNcEaWtioSnRaOlOteMa&chEeVrEsNpTlSay aABOUT critical role in the successful implementation of education reforms, including changes in organisations, transforming curricula, and developing work-based learning, technology and pedagogy. In 2018, the ETF carried out a survey to gather data on vocational teachers in Albania and the role of continuing professional development in their work. The purpose of the study was to inform national policymakers about teachers’ needs first of all and, secondly, to help them to improve the effectiveness of their professional development. The survey revealed that the major challenge is the lack of commitment at national level in terms of a proper allocation of resources, action plan preparations and clear division of roles and responsibilities for coordination. Who are the vocational education teachers/trainers? The average age of teachers in vocational schools is 41.7, with majority of women . Two thirds have worked in the teaching profession for less than 15 years and for 17% of respondents teaching is not their first job. High-level degrees, but limited training in pedagogy Most vocational school teachers report that they have a master’s degree , while only 7% of them hold a qualification lower than a bachelor degree. In terms of the initial pedagogical training, 41% of teachers did not have any initial pedagogical training before they started teaching. More than 80% of vocational teachers have industry experience in the profession and only about half of teachers seldom visit workplaces or regularly have contact with employers seeking to recruit students. Teachers’ working conditions are good, but the reputation of teachers’ profession is considered to be an issue PTReAaCchTIeCrEs AhRaEvAeShigPhRjOobJEsCtTaSb&iliCtyAiMnPtAhIeGNsuSrveRyEeGdIOsNchS o&oClsO: UNTRIES 54% of teachers have more than 5 years teaching PeUxBpLeIrCieAnTIcOeNiSn &thReEiSr OcuUrRrCeEnSt scNhEoWolS. RFOurOtMhe&r EaVnEaNlyTsSis reAvBeOaUlsT that about 67% of teachers who have spent their entire teaching career at only one school. Moreover, 83% of them have permanent employment contracts. Therefore, teachers report to be very satisfied generally with their profession but one third of them believe that teaching profession is not valued in Albania. Two biggest challenges of continuing professional development: the incentives and the relevancy Almost all teachers and instructors report that continuing professional development had a high impact on their teaching . In addition, nearly all of them said that they would be interested in it. The two major barriers are the lack of incentives for participating and no offer of relevant professional development. More than 50% of teachers reported a need to learn more about new technologies in the workplace , on teaching students with special needs and on teaching in a multicultural or multilingual setting . Teachers in rural areas and small towns have fewer possibilities to participate in the professional development The possibilities for accessing continuing professional development vary depending on the urban/rural area. The largest cities have the biggest frequency of teachers who received in-service training , while only 47% of teachers from small towns get this opportunity and the volume of training courses is lower. PRACTICE AREAS PROJECTS & CAMPAIGNS REGIONS & COUNTRIES PUBLICATIONS & RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT First results of the study On 29 January 2019, the European Training Foundation organised a workshop at the Ministry of Finance and Economy in Albania to present the first results of the research into vocational teachers and trainers in the country.

The recommendations will feed into a new National Strategic Plan for Skills and Employment.

The event marked two key steps towards progress of the EU and Armenia cooperation in the field of education and training systems reforms: RELATED COUNTRIES PRATChTeICEEuAroRpEeAaSn UPnRiOoJnEDCTeSle&gCaAtiMonPAtoIGANrSmeRnEiaGIlOauNnS c&hCeOdUNTRIES the EU-Armenia policy dialogue on education in the PUBfrLaICmAeTwIOoNrSk&CRoEmSpOrUeRhCeEnSsiveNEaWndSREOnOhMan&ceEdVEPNaTrStneArsBhOipUT Agreement and the Five Year Government Programme and the Education development strategy for Armenia. The European Training Foundation launched the new cycle of the ‘Torino Process’ , a periodic assessment of progress in modernising skills development in EU neighbouring countries. Commenting on the event, Cesare Onestini, ETF Director, said: ‘As a new industrial revolution unfolds globally, education and training systems face a common challenge: how to equip citizens with the skills needed to be resilient and fulfil their potential. In such challenge, collecting data is key to determine the needs of the future job markets, and launch appropriate education reforms. Through the new ‘Torino Process’, the EU and Armenia unfold their cooperation to prepare the next generation to raise above the challenges of the present, and harness their potential to contribute to inclusive growth and stability’. Background Now at its 5th edition , the ‘Torino Process’ is an initiative of the European Training Foundation. It is a periodical assessment tool used by countries bordering the EU to measure the effectiveness of reforms in countries' education and training systems, in a lifelong learning perspective. Armenia has been using the ‘Torino Process’ since 2010-2011 showing, despite relatively low expenditure on education, an overall high educational attainment. However, public spending is still low in vocational education – the pathway towards better employability. The EU-Armenia policy dialogue is an initiative of the European Union expected to allow the EU to follow closely the preparation of future reforms and strategies in the Education field.  Did you like this article?

PUBLICATIONS & RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT Strength and weaknesses The national report on the ifth round of the ETF's fagship evidence-based tool for assessing policy progress in VET reform demonstrated strengths and weaknesses, said Ummuhan Bardak, the ETF's senior specialist in Labour Market and Migration. Couching her remarks as ""a humble outsider's impressions of your VET system"" she pointed to wide access to general education, near universal literacy and the adoption of ""milestone legislation"" that include the new VET law of 2018, the Uniied Strategy for Education and Science 2017-2021, and the Georgia 2020 Strategy. But close attention was needed to implement the country's ambitious reforms in skills training, she told the Torino Process dissemination meeting in Tbilisi, Wednesday. Educational imbalances Although more than 85 percent of Georgians complete upper secondary education, access to VET was low compared to those attending tertiary education - 57.5 percent, Ms Bardak said, noting that ""given Georgia's VET policies"" the igure for VET was ""not as wide as one could expect. PISA scores from 2015 - the last available year - also showed that more than half of school pupils scored the lowest levels in reading , science and maths . The igures were ""a cause for concern"" and the ""shortcomings will follow them into their further education"" Ms Bardak added. Five key characteristics There were ive characteristics that were shaping Georgian education and training today, she said.

Implementing change VET could be part of a broader solution to Georgia's challenges, together with other social and economic polices, but a closer focus on implementing reforms was needed. VET policy in Georgia refected a considerable maturity, Ms Bardak said, but added: ""I do not see enough attention to budgeting and stafing implications of the ambitions of what you want to achieve."" Irina Tserodze, deputy head of TVET at Georgia's Ministry of Education, who was among the delegates at the meeting, said that vocational teacher salaries had been increased by 30 percent this year and there was a fresh focus on recruiting younger qualiied staff. A 3 million GEL career guidance programme over the past three years had given 10,000 school students the opportunity to sample trades and professions before deciding on their future work and training progress. And from 2020 general secondary schools would be required to offer some VET training to bolster efforts to spread VET provision beyond the 37 of 65 municipalities across the country where it currently exists.  Did you like this article?

What’s the Torino Process Evidence is key to implementing education and training policies, and the Torino Process is a way to make this happen in countries around the EU. The work starts with the involvement of each country’s most relevant authorities and stakeholders active in in education, training and employment – state authorities, public administration bodies, international organisations, employers and representatives of companies/private sector, and other relevant civil society actors. Through their commitment and active engagement, countries can succeed in activities such as: Analysing the skills needed by adults all over their life to remain active in the labour market; Checking if the offer of vocational education satisies the skills needed by enterprises; Verifying the quality of schools against minimum standards; and much more. Changing in times of changes Launched eight years ago by the ETF, the Torino Process has faced global trends consistently impacting the labour market and education systems – demographic shift, migration, digitalisation, climate change – and it has adapted to make sure that learning processes and employment opportunities throughout life are adaptive, too.

What’s next After the launch of the Torino Process 2019-20 cycle, countries will undertake participatory dialogues with all concerned parties, and steer the collection of evidence needed to have a clearer view. Moreover, countries will dialogue with others at a regional level, offering important opportunity for peer learning and sharing of experiences and best practices. To conclude the exercise, the ETF will use indings to produce an assessment report, which will presented to countries for discussion. Through policy recommendations, countries will proceed nationally with follow-up actions and contribute to a valuable international community, discussing how to provide training responsive to trends and the future of skills – to the beneit of people.  Did you like this article?

P“RWAeCTcIaCnE sAhRaEpAeSanPdRrOeJsEhCaTpSe&thCeAmMP, AbIuGtNtSheyRaErGeIOthNeS & COUNTRIES international currency that allows us to talk the same PlaUnBgLuICaAgTeIOinNSth&eRwESoOrlUdRoCfEeSduNcaEtWioSnRaOnOdMt&raEinViEnNgT.”S ABOUT Qualification frameworks have become mainstream in record time. The European Commission’s Alison Crabb reminded the audience that just ten years ago, at the establishment of the European Qualifications Framework, only three EU countries had a national qualifications framework. And change is not slowing down. How to respond to the tremendous changes in skills needs has been the million-dollar question in education and training in the last decades. Today, one of the people who took a shot at providing a simple answer was Mika Saarinen of the National Agency for Educationin, where else, Finland. Mr Saarinen explained how, in 2016, Finland had a vocational education system that was quite universally considered to be near-perfect. Then they launched a reform. The Finns recognised that, if they wanted to continue to build on the success of gradual change, they need to keep changing even though all seemed good for the moment. The essence of this message reverberated through much of the remainder of the day. Many presenters of good practice from partner countries and later participants in the working groups agreed that adaptability and enterprise are key requirements for qualifications to continue to be the currency of skills in the labour market. The conference continues tomorrow morning with reports back from today’s working groups and a subsequent effort to translate words into action, connecting policy to practice in a two-hour ‘City of Practice’ and a closing session guided by the same theme.  Did you like this article?

Being able to interpret and assess these descriptions is a skill that is becoming ever more important as people increasingly bring their skills from country to country - as workers, as migrants, as refugees or in other ways. In fact, so great is the need now to be able to reference in one part of the world what people have learned in another part of the world that there is an international expert group exploring ways to make this work easier and fairer.

The group met for the ninth time in PTUuBriLnICoAnTI7OaNnSd&8RENSoOvUeRmCbEeSr. NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT The meeting brought UNESCO’s Borhene Chakroun, a former ETF staff member, back to Turin to chair the sessions. We asked him to explain the work of the group. “We are trying to do three things,” Mr Chakroun said. “First, we are trying to develop a [universal and digital] tool that can improve the common understanding of skills and qualifications and help people get their skills recognised across borders and across contexts.” “Second the group is a platform involving and connecting regional organisations that deal with the recognition of qualifications across different continents.” “And third, we are acting as a laboratory of ideas. We are exploring things such as digital credentials, the use of learning outcomes and how countries are reforming their qualification systems.” For the ETF, hosting the meeting brings valuable expertise to Turin. But the ETF itself also brings important expertise to the group. “The ETF contributes a lot with, for example, its analyses of partner country organisations. But its analytical work also contributes to the laboratory function of the group.” Topics discussed in Turin included the first results of piloting an online world reference levels tool, the preparation of the next edition of the Global Inventory of National Qualiications Frameworks and the publication of an international handbook on defining, writing and using learning outcomes. Work on the development of the handbook should be concluded by mid-2021 based on extensive evidence gathering through regional meetings.  Did you like this article?

The global forum aimed at recognising occupational needs and skills gaps in the context of the future of work, green technologies and climate action; highlighting environmental challenges, effective skills response strategies, and good practice for a just transition for all. Discussions on potential international collaboration to make progress on human capital to support decent work and to strengthen climate action were also part of the event. ETF Director, Cesare Onestini’s contribution to the event centred on skills development and lifelong learning for future green economies, “Lifelong learning means taking into account all pathways that help people develop or update their knowledge and skills, so that countries can maintain and grow their human capital. When talking about greener economies, initial training for young people, continuing training for employees or the self- employed, and training for unemployed people are all essential”, he said.

Data shows that around 65% of vocational education teachers in the country expressed the need for training in ICT methodologies for teaching. Also, three out of four teachers claimed that professional development in new technologies has a moderate, or even a high, high impact on their teaching.

An analysis of the European training Foundation on Eurostat’s data highlights patterns and trends of an intangible, yet key process for people in South Eastern Europe and Turkey: learning throughout their life. Starting with the basics: what is lifelong learning? When we talk about lifelong learning we mean all levels of education and learning activities undertaken throughout life within all contexts, such as formal , non-formal and informal . Whatever the training, there is one goal: improving knowledge, skills and competences within a personal, civic, social or employment-related perspective. In other words, it means shifting from traditional education institutions to diverse learning opportunities that an individual can face throughout his life, that are more process and outcome oriented. A relevance hard to measure PTRhAeCETuICrEopAeRaEnASTraiPnRinOgJEFCoTuSn&dCaAtiMonPAisIGaNnSEURaEgGeIOnNcSy &suCpOpUoNrTtiRnIgEScountries surrounding the EU to reform their education and labour policies. This includes lifelong learning, so as to PaUssBeLsICsAtThIeONevSo&luRtEioSnOUinRCcoEuS ntNrieEWs, SbReOinOgMa&blEeVtEoNcToSmpAaBrOeUdTata is key. But measuring is not an easy job. Since lifelong learning is meant to happen continuously throughout life, analysing data about participation in the past 4 weeks before a survey will only show a limited picture of training. More precise and relevant measures, also covering duration, costs and obstacles – comes at a cost: data are usually available every five years through tailor-made surveys such as Adult Education Survey or Continuing Vocational Training Survey. Rethinking the over 25 workforce around the EU Recent data from the Eurostat’s Adult Education Survey analysed by the ETF has explored patterns in EU countries, as well as in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Northern Macedonia, Serbia and Turkey. Data covers participation in formal/non-formal/informal learning for adults aged 25-64. The ETF findings shows that adult learning is mostly informal, going from one third of adults in Turkey to 90% in Serbia. Most frequently, adults engage in informal learning with friends/colleagues and by using printed material and computers. What’s interesting is that younger adults participate more in training compared to older people: for those aged 25-34, the figures goes from 17% in Albania to 29% in Serbia, whereas for adults aged 55-64 participation is less than 7% in all countries. In all countries, the lower-educated adults engage less with learning , whereas tertiary graduates are most likely to learn throughout their life . Lifelong learning shows imbalances as far as social inclusion is concerned. Unemployed and inactive adults engage much less than employed adults with learning . Moreover, adult learning is mostly offered to highly-skilled workers, whereas participation of the medium- and low-skilled workers is much lower. At last, people living in cities are more engaged with learning compared to those living in the rural areas. Background Continuing vocational education and training and adult learning allows people to develop skills that promote their employability, mobility and productivity, contributing to societal competitiveness and growth. The ETF promotes the continuity of lifelong learning and work-based learning throughout different levels of vocational education provision. While vocational education and training policy tends to emphasise the preparation of young people, there is a growing awareness to improve access to adult skills development. The ETF facilitates the sharing of EU best practice and peer learning exchanges among policymakers, and promotes quality assurance mechanisms in line with the European Quality Assurance in Vocational Education and Training .

Background The Western Balkans 6 Chamber Investment Forum is a professional association of chambers of commerce and industry from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, established and headquartered in Trieste in 2017. The aim of this platform, which plays an import role in the context of the Enlargement Agenda and more precisely the Berlin Process, is to provide a joint voice to the business community in the region and to facilitate inter-business contacts and promote the region as one investment destination. An important part of this agenda is enhancing connectivity among people and businesses in the region and with the EU as well as providing the right skills for the labour market. The Forum is active in the area of vocational educational training, work-based learning, qualification development and its use, development of entrepreneurial and digital skills – all with reference to partnership between education and the business community. PRACTICDEidAyRouEAlikSe thPisRaOrJtiEclCeT?SIf &yoCuAwMoPuAldIGlikNeSto bReEnGoItOiiNedS w&hCeOnUNTRIES new content like this is published, PUBLICAsuTbIOscNrSib&e tRoErSeOceUivReCoEuSr emNaEiWl aSleRrtOsO.

She was named by Forbes for the 2019 30 Under 30 Europe list. Her success is also a success for EU support to young women worldwide. 'Winemaking had always been our family business, but we used to make it for ourselves and not for commercial purposes,' says Baia Abuladze, who comes from Obcha village in the Bagdati Municipality. 'Then it became an interesting job for the younger members of the family and we took steps to turn our family’s tradition into a business.' That business was Baia’s Wine. Launched in 2015, Baia’s products are already being sold not only in Georgia, but also in the EU. She runs the company with her sister Gvantsa, and the products they manufacture are famous wine brands in Imereti region: 'Tsolikouri', P'TRsAitCsTkIaC',E'KArRaEkAhSunaP'R, 'OOJtEsCkThSan&uCrAi MSaPpAeIGreN.S' BaRiaE’sGIpOlaNnSs&tCoOaUlsNoTrReIvEiSve the production from a ‘lost’ vine that is not used in agriculture any more and has only been preserved in vitro. PUBLICATIONS & RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT Baia has received entrepreneurial support from the EU in the areas of informal education, the improvement of contacts, sales and the promotion of products. 'I gave a presentation at the EU-supported conference for women-entrepreneurs and established some interesting contacts. The event was organised in Brussels by the WEgate platform supported by the European Commission,' she explains. Baia also took part in the Women's Entrepreneurship Laboratory in Ukraine, organised by the European Training Foundation, where she learned about the types of assistance offered to women in different countries and the ways they succeed in enhancing their business. While Baia has been with the company since its inception, Gvantsa joined later and brought a wealth of new experience thanks to the year she spent with the European Voluntary Service programme in Sweden. 'Gvantsa has joined us with new and innovative ideas,' Baia says. 'She not only manages our wine production, but is also involved in tourism development. She registered us on TripAdvisor, Booking.com and Airbnb. My sister has introduced the European experience and knowledge she gained into our environment.' Gender equality is a necessity to achieve peace and economic prosperity around the world. The EU supports initiatives that promote gender equality, access to opportunity and education throughout the neighbourhood. ✅ More on EU support to Baia ✅ More on Baia  Did you like this article?

A major obstacle in achieving this is the high level of mismatch between the needs of employers and the skills people acquire through education and training. Employers regularly report that people entering the labour market lack technical and professional competences, as well as the soft skills they look for in their recruits. Policy analysis and progress monitoring Skills intelligence RELATED COUNTRIES PTRhAeCETuICrEopAeRaEnASTraiPnRinOgJEFCoTuSn&dCaAtiMonPA’sIG eRfEfoGrItOsN-Sin& COUNTRIES cooperation with the EU Delegation and other PinUtBeLrInCaAtTioIOnNaSl d&oRnEoSrOsU-RtoCEsSuppNoErWt tShReOcOoMun&tErVyEinNTS ABOUT addressing this challenge have borne fruit with the recent Government decree instituting a labour market observatory. Tasked with making analyses and forecasts to guide decision-making, the observatory will make an important contribution to adapting education and training provision to the needs of businesses. The need to reinforce the country’s mechanisms for matching the supply and demand for skills in the labour market emerged from national consultations in the course of the ETF’s periodic assessment of the state of human capital development in its partner countries, known as the Torino Process. The ETF provided expert support on skills matching to the Azerbaijani Labour Ministry as part of the Make it Match project that it leads under the EU’s Eastern Partnership Platform 4 “Contacts between People” . A series of workshops with ministry officials led to the development of a concept of a labour market observatory in November 2017. Work continued throughout 2018 on the structure, functions and mandate of the new body. The legislative process culminated with the signature in July 2019 by Azerbaijan’s President, Ilham Aliyev, of a decree instituting a National Observatory on Labour Market and Social Protection. In parallel, the ETF has been working closely with the EU Delegation to Azerbaijan on the design of a €1.2 million EU project on skills matching to reinforce labour market information systems and support the roll-out of the observatory. This project is expected to start in the coming months. Margareta Nikolovska, ETF country coordinator for Azerbaijan, said “This shows how the ETF works successfully at both technical and policy level and cooperates closely with the EU Delegations to support its partner countries in moving forward and improving opportunities for their citizens.” PInRAACzTeIrCbEaAijRanEA, tShe PERTOFJiEsCaTlsSo&pCrAoMviPdAinIGgNsSuppRoErGtIOinNtSh&e COUNTRIES form of content monitoring and advice on PimUBpLleICmATeInOtNaSti&onREfoSrOtUhReCEEUS ’s €NE19WmSRilOlioOnME&dEuVcEaNtiToSn ABOUT Support Programme 2017-2019.

CONTRIBUTIONS The ETF is seeking, in particular, country examples with case studies, backed up with research, including data analysis, which document changes in the labour markets in transition and developing countries.[1] These might include job creation and destruction in sectors, employment shifts, emerging occupations and skills needs, and new working patterns/relations. Changes in the labour market could be analysed through empirical case studies, qualitative and/or quantitative research techniques or other interdisciplinary approaches. Examples that focus on the ETF’s partner countries are particularly welcome. Further details of speciic topics can be found below. The deadline for the submission of abstracts is 30 September 2019. Abstracts of around 500 words should be in English, include a preliminary title and the full names and titles of the authors. Three criteria to be used in the selection of abstracts are given at the end of this document. The ETF’s decision on the selection will be communicated by 31 October 2019 and inal draft papers should be submitted by 31 March 2020. CONTACT Abstract proposals can be directly sent to the following address: call_for_papers@etf.europa.eu. ETF expert, Ummuhan Bardak is in the lead on this activity. If you have questions or need further information, please contact her via email at ummuhan.bardak@etf.europa.eu or by phone on +390116302222 or +390116302450 . BACKGROUND The ETF launched a irst debate in 2018 to identify future skills trends and needs in its partner countries.[2] The preliminary analysis, which was presented at the ETF PinRtAeCrTnIaCtEioAnRaElAcSonfPeRreOnJcEeCT‘SSk&illCsAfoMrPtAhIGeNFSutuRreE:GMIOaNnSa&giCnOgUNTRIES Transition’ in November 2018, showed the need to further PdUoBcLuImCAeTnIOt NaSnd& RmEoSnOiUtoRrCtEhSe cNhEaWngSiRnOgOsMkil&lsEdVeEmNTaSndAaBnOdUT go further than macro analyses on the topic[3]. To continue to contribute to the debate, the ETF plans to produce a fagship publication on understanding skills demand in transition and developing countries against the background of signiicant global transformation. The publication will collect papers with evidence on the changes occurring in jobs, occupational and skills demand, and employment patterns/relations in transition and developing countries from interested authors. We live in a rapidly changing and uncertain world, but the impacts of these changes on labour markets, jobs and skills are far from clear. Studies from advanced economies highlight the automation of routine tasks, job polarisation between low and high-skilled jobs, and rising demand for cognitive skills. Digitalisation impacts all skills levels by changing the composition of occupations; reshaping, replacing or displacing existing jobs or creating new ones. As new labour markets reward different skills sets and worker attitudes, there is a growing mismatch reported everywhere between the skills of workers and the needs of employers. Labour markets are becoming more segmented and less stable with a widening range of non- standard forms of employment. Global transformations also impact the labour markets of transition and developing countries, but we have very little information and evidence on the direction of these changes in those parts of world. This publication is planned as one of the irst steps to ill in these information gaps. Better documenting changes and skills demands of labour markets in developing countries will lead to the design of better skills development systems for the future of individuals, companies and countries. SPECIFIC TOPICS Interested authors may propose papers which fall under one of three speciic thematic areas: Changing jobs, occupations and economic sectors : Papers on job creation and job destruction trends in economic sectors, shifts in the employment share of sectors over time, PcRhAaCnTgICeEs wARitEhAinS suPbR-OseJEcCtoTrSs&asCAaMrePsAuIGltNoSf glRoEbGaIlOdNrSiv&erCsOUNTRIES ,Se&mRpElSoOymUReCnEtStreNnEdWs iSnRdOiOgMita&lisEeVdENlaTbSouAr BOUT markets and the platform economy, risks posed by automation to human labour in certain occupations, concrete examples of emerging occupations, changing content of occupations, high-demand occupations, declining occupations, etc. Changing demand for different skills sets and qualiications : Papers on examples of skills need analyses, growing/declining demand for certain skill-sets, results of skills need analyses using traditional labour market data and anticipation tools and/or new and innovative methods such as Big Data and other digital technologies, analysis of ‘skills-biased’ changes such as higher demand for high-skills or job polarisation trends, skill proiles of online workers , new skills-sets required in the platform economy and digitalised labour markets. Changing employment relations and working conditions : Papers on new types of employment that have emerged as a result of changes, such as online work, own-account workers, self-employment and entrepreneurship, diversiied employment contracts , empirical studies on the impact of platform economy on informality. Other examples could be blurred lines between private and working life, lack of clarity on employment status, regulation loopholes, erosion of traditional employer-employee relationship and social security beneits, new winners or losers of labour market. Criteria for the selection of abstracts: 1. Geographical relevance: The papers should include concrete examples from transition and developing countries. Examples that focus on the ETF’s partner countries are particularly welcome. Examples from advanced economies can be included exceptionally, but only if they are compared with examples of developing countries in the same paper. P2R.

Labour market changes might include shifts in sectors and jobs, emerging tasks and occupations, identiied skills needs , and declining occupations, new forms and patterns of employment and evolving employment relations and working conditions, due to the impact of technological changes and other change drivers. 3. Abstract quality in terms of structure, methodology and language: The abstracts should give clear information on the content structure and research methodology to be used in the paper, and demonstrate a high level of English. Although different terms and deinitions can be used regarding the development phase of countries, e.g. ‘transition countries’, ‘developing countries’ or ‘emerging economies’, the publication will focus on the countries with low middle-income and high middle-income, as well as low-income countries.

At the workshop, the Ministry announced its prioritisation of tracer study implementation in the vocational education and training system as a key instrument for assessing education performance and enhancing the quality and relevance of programmes to the labour market. Vocational education and training school representatives agreed the tracer study should be rolled-out across programmes noting, however, that this would require capacity building of vocational education providers supported by specialised staff. Schools are committed to raising awareness and incentivising students and graduates to participate.

Soft skills are core to the new educational model. Having worked for many years as a top manager in a multi-national company, Natalia Iskortseva, the headmaster and the founder of STEMBridge, encountered plenty of difficulties finding graduates equipped with relevant skills. “During job interviews I asked standard questions but many candidates could not reply. I realized that most of them lack basic soft skills, such as expressing their opinion and presenting themselves,” she said. When is the right moment to start developing these skills? “We believe that it is too late to develop them in university, we need to start before,” said Irina Vdovina, the co-founder of the school. Professional guidance The second pillar of this educational concept, new to Belarus, is the professional guidance that starts from the beginning of the primary school education. The teachers are encouraged to incorporate career content into the curriculum bringing the learning process closer to life. For example, robotics and coding are the lessons, where the kids learn about IT technologies and tools. The adoption of digital technologies is placing new demands in terms of skills on the labour market. Learning to learn The third pillar of the model is enjoyment. The motivation of the learners is in the very centre of the school’s priorities. “Our first victory is that children come here with joy,” said Ms Iskortseva.

Policy makers and social partners, including training school staff, employer representatives and senior ministry and agency officials, will look at how to bring firms on board for quality training. Building on solid foundations As a tool for helping embed lexible, responsive, and up- to-date training in the workplace, work-based learning is a key priority in vocational education and training policies across the European Union. The European Training Foundation efforts in the ield, including a successful three-year regional project on WBL for Eastern Europe and Kazakhstan , have demonstrated the high value EU partner countries put on developing better models for improving youth employment opportunities through on-the-job training. Annual regional forums between 2018 and 2020 are designed to bring the latest tools and shared experiences to key figures in the VET systems and labour markets of partner countries. The Lviv conference - which includes two days of training for policy makers and social partners on implementing successful WBL programmes for small company capacity building, followed by a day of sharing experiences and knowledge - is designed to boost potential in their countries. Didier Gelibert, ETF specialist on private sector engagement in VET, said that the relationship between small companies and employment was a key issue. ""By and large 99% of companies are small companies, 93% of these are micro companies - less than 10 employees; this represents two thirds of employment. We are preparing people in vocational training to work in all fields, public and private companies. Small SMEs are where most employment is. This is where demand is”.

By looking at how those involved in the training and labour markets can work to involve companies, and to relect on current practices, needs and tools for strengthening stakeholder capabilities in the area, the forum aims to increase the spread of combined work and skills training. Encouraging firms to take up on the job training involves stressing the benefits to both employees and employers. Companies that offer WBL are able to attract the best workers and benefit from having a workforce with the most up to date skills. Forum participants will be able to see how Ukrainian vocational schools and small companies are working together to implement WBL and share experiences from their own countries. There will be sessions on ensuring quality in WBL - and why it is key to the successful implementation of such schemes - and the latest developments in WBL in partner countries. ""The ETF set up a project to support and improve WBL four years ago and the annual regional forums are part of this,"" Mr Gelibert said. ""At this meeting we would like to engage more small companies, and to identify what the stakeholders have to do to involve these companies more. I am expecting to identify some key issues that stakeholders will take home to improve engagement and quality assurance."" He added that the opportunity to share experience was a key part of enabling participants to overcome challenges they face to bringing WBL to more companies.  Did you like this article?

The workshop had been requested by national authorities and social partners to help strengthen technical capacities and build on the progress of national and local institutions undertaking occupational and school-to work surveys and analysis, supported by the ILO, and skills’ needs identification exercises supported by the ETF. Local Economic and Social Councils are the main beneficiaries of the EU supported project Strengthening Social Dialogue. The training objectives are to contribute to the mapping of institutions and approaches, give input towards inter-institutional collaboration mechanisms, policy proposals and a road map towards an effective and coordinated institutional framework for identifying current and future skills needs. In the long term, LESCs will be charged with setting priorities at local and regional level for economic and human resources development. The workshop brings together representatives from various institutions including the LESCs, policymakers and technical experts from the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of the Economy. Background Key components of developing an effective and comprehensive system include identifying institutional roles, responsibilities, resources and procedures.

VThENesTeS arAeBjuOsUtT some of the key issues emerging from a joint ETF and IIAS event on 4-5 December 2019 in Brussels. Participants included policy makers and practitioners from the European Union and neighbouring countries. “Public private partnership is at the forefront of the European Commission’s employment policy implementation” said Mr Sekmokas from the European Commission’s Directorate for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion. Meanwhile, Mr Masson from the Commission’s Directorate for Neighbourhood and Enlargement negotiations characterised such partnerships as necessary for the delivery of the European Union’s external programmes for the neighbourhood and enlargement regions. The event was organised around several topics, including the contribution of public private partnerships to innovation in skills development and their beneit compared to other forms of cooperation in skills development. Beneits of successful public private partnerships for skills development include increased accessibility to training, demand-driven vocational education and training provision, employment and economic growth. An ETF study presenting 23 successful case studies from 14 countries provided critical input for discussions. Public private partnerships for skills development differ from other policy areas in that a stronger role and commitment from the public sector is needed together with private sector engagement focused on business sustainability rather than immediate investment returns. The ETF is working in cooperation with the IIAS creating a knowledge base on public private partnerships so that existing practices and success stories may be learnt from and built upon in the ETF’s partner countries and beyond. PRACTICDEidAyRouEAlikSe thPisRaOrJtiEclCeT?SIf &yoCuAwMoPuAldIGlikNeSto bReEnGoItOiiNedS w&hCeOnUNTRIES new content like this is published, PUBLICAsuTbIOscNrSib&e tRoErSeOceUivReCoEuSr emNaEiWl aSleRrtOsO.

Tools for improvement Montenegro has long been an enthusiastic participant of the Torino Process - the ETF's lagship evidence-based tool for evaluating progress in implementing policy reform in vocational education and training. With the 5th round report coming at a time when public and private sector stakeholders in vocational training are beginning to plan for a new national VET strategy 2021-24 and just ahead of the EU's post-2020 planning, reviewing priority areas in the sector comes at a crucial juncture. Eva Jimeno Sicilia, the ETF's Head of Analysis and Coordination, the unit that runs the Torino Process, said: ""The EU is already thinking about post-2020. The Torino Process is ideally positioned to work with this; this is a prime opportunity for Montenegro,"" she told participants that included officials from the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Labour and stakeholders from employers and industrial associations, VET organisations and employment agencies. Strategic approaches The Torino Process could be of wider benefit, Romain Boitard, from the EU Delegation to Montenegro said. ""Education is one of the sectors where EU collaboration in Montenegro has shown great potential.

Sectors in focus Zora Bogicevic, of the Ministry of Education who is Montenegro's national Torino Process coordinator said that although take up of VET in Montenegro was high by regional standards - 19,000 out of 28,000 students in secondary education attended technical training courses – higher education remained the preferred choice for tertiary options, even though labour market opportunities were stronger for technical, rather than academic graduates, she noted. The government has been succeeding in tackling high levels of unemployment with the figure down from just over 20% in 2017 to 18.4% in 2018, but ""key questions relating to links between VET and the labour market and progress on entrepreneurial training"" remain. More work needs to be done on improving key competencies in VET and improving the validation of prior, non-formal and informal learning as well as lifelong learning and attention to the needs of minorities, Ms Bogicevic said. Improving the roll out of dual education - introduced two years ago - remains a priority, with more cooperation and coordination needed between VET and employers, she added. Ways forward Marie Dorleans, for the ETF, said it was clear that in the wider scope Montenegro had three main challenges for its VET strategy. Skills mismatch and the school to work transition, plus the validation of non-formal learning A need for a greater focus on adult education and retraining, with access to upskilling for the workforce Better cooperation and coordination between public and private stakeholders and inter-ministerial PRAcCoToIpCeErAaRtiEoAnS.

Small companies do not always have human resources departments or experience in training apprentices and often lack resources for sophisticated monitoring. But by applying simple tools for understanding and applying quality control and assurance, impressive results can be achieved, Erwin Seyfried, a Berlin School of Economics and Law professor and international expert on quality assurance in vocational training, told delegates at the Lviv, Ukraine-based conference. ""A very simple deinition of quality is - getting it for purpose,"" Prof. Seyfried said. ""Meeting given standards that correspond with the needs of stakeholders and make optimum use of resources."" Quality assurance boils down to paying attention to details - perhaps as simple as starting and inishing training sessions on time and sticking to the agreed curriculum. Assessing whether training meets company and vocational school needs and complies with accreditation targets build from such foundations. Building blocks for quality Standard tools for applying quality control - these days more a case of continuous self-assessment than cycles of external validation, Prof. Seyield noted - can help keep reforms on track. The Deming Cycle - also known as the PDCA cycle - is a method for ensuring process matches quality, results are assessed and improvements and corrections made by reference to agreed quality standards. P""CRAoCoTkIiCnEgAaRmEAeSal foPrRyOoJuECr TfaSm& iClyA?MPPlAaInGNboSrscRhEtG?IOCNooSk&. COUNTRIES Check taste. Need salt? Act.

Lively discussion The relative importance of quality assurance as an internal process and accreditation as an external check sparked lively discussion among delegates, with stakeholders arguing that self-assessment offered speed and fexibility that could meet the needs of fast changing labour markets. Policy makers and ministerial representatives tended towards putting a higher value on accreditation, arguing that student output was a self-evident mark of quality assurance. Often industry wanted to have faster, more adaptable courses to deliver qualiied students and therefore supported quality assurance over accreditation, which takes a long time to bring forward, Olena Kolesnikova of the Ukrainian Federation of Metallurgists, argued. Margareta Nikolovska, the ETF's country manager for Ukraine, agreed, noting: ""Accreditation is only supported in reforms where internal quality assurance is a feature of that reform."" Prof. Seyield also stressed the key role quality assurance plays in delivering WBL: ""Don’t start with accreditation - allow people to start to ensure that they are applying standards and improvement. Perhaps after ive years [partners] should ask for accreditation"". ""Putting accreditation at the beginning is the wrong starting point."" The Forum concludes on Thursday, 24 October, following site visits on Wednesday to Ukrainian vocational schools to see work-based learning in action.  Did you like this article?

A two- day conference in Podgorica, supported by the ETF, showcased advances made since the introduction of a licensed teachers law of 2014. Motivation for professionalism Montenegro, with a population of 615,000, has probably the smallest network of national vocational schools in Europe - around 40. But the enthusiasm of vocational teachers for improving their professional qualiications and approaches refects a country punching well above its weight in continuous professional development . A new initiative to create a network of school-based CPD coordinators in the country brought together around three-quarters of representatives from Montenegro's vocational schools on Monday for two days of workshops and brainstorming. Introducing the workshop, Svetlana Čabarkapa a senior advisor at the Ministry of Education, emphasised the importance of the adoption ive years ago of the licensed teacher law. Licensed to train ""Continuous professional training is designed to support teachers throughout their career,"" Ms. Čabarkapa said. ""The licensed teacher law of 2014 grants licences valid for ive years - during which time a certain number of training courses must be undertaken.""

""The post-2020 strategy is looking at this very area; for example the ETF has already done pilots where teachers take part in company exchanges to improve vocational training. It is very important to continue to have a dialogue with the world of work."" Upgrading teacher skills also needed to take note of the needs of the wider population beyond younger students into account, she added. ""We also have an ageing population - they need skills and lifelong learning in the workplace. Here the teacher is also important."" Going back to basics Marko Vukašinović, head of department for international cooperation and European integration at the Ministry of Education, told participants that grassroots coordination and activity was at the core of reforms in vocational training delivery. ""This event matches perfectly well all the things we have also identiied as international priorities,"" he said.

The EU's Member States are also working on reforming their education systems, following a set of common objectives and benchmarks. The EU framework, which is based on the lifelong learning approach, provides opportunities to gather and share knowledge, and seeks to implement and advance educational policy reforms at national level. It addresses outcomes from early childhood to adult vocational and higher education, and is designed to cover learning in all contexts: formal, non-formal and informal. Background The ETF has been supporting Turkey in developing education and training to boost employability, increase access to opportunity and promote social cohesion since 2005.

""We would like to have as many school leavers as possible opting for high quality VET in Ukraine. The current situation - in which over 75 percent of school leavers reject VET and opt for university degrees has a negative impact on our economy,"" she said. The EU-funded grant for the development of Centres of Excellence refects the government's commitment to increase levels of VET school graduation from 20 percent to 45 percent of the cohort in the coming years, with a broad promotional campaign that emphasises the beneits of skills training scheduled to roll out in 2020, the minister added. Evidence for change Statistics show that Ukraine has a declining population down by three million from just over 45 million since 2013, and a drop in the percentage of 16-24 years from 16 percent to 13 percent of the population. Nevertheless, imbalances in the provision of qualiied workers with skills that match labour market demand continue to be problematic for the economy. Ivan Sobko, deputy head of the Lviv regional administration, highlighted that ""investors come to the Lviv region and offer to invest and ask what pools of skilled labour we have; whether we can fulil their needs.

Emerging Technology Breakthroughs: How this will affect EU policy? 04 APR 2018 The 4th industrial revolution is transforming and disrupting almost every human sphere of operation and inluence. From a policy perspective, what impact is this having on skills and lifelong learning? Professor Juan Carlos De Martin explored these questions and much more during a recent visit to the ETF. The fourth industrial digital revolution or ‘second machine age’ is both transforming and disrupting almost every human sphere of operation and inluence. How will these new digital competences transform the ETF’s approach to lifelong learning? How can the EU create far-reaching policies to form a European Ideology on the Digital Revolution and ensure digital equality for transitioning countries? PTRhAeCsTeICwEeAreREaAmSonPgRmOJaEnCyTiSss&uCeAsMdPisAcIuGsNsSed RwEhGeIOnNPSro&feCsOsUoNr TJRuIaEnS Carlos De Martin, co- director of the interdisciplinary think tank, the NEXA Center for Internet&Societyvisited the PEUTBFL. IPCrAoTfIeOsNsSor&DReESMOaUrRtiCnE, Sa leNcEtuWreSrROinOcMom& EpVuEtNerTSengAinBeOeUrTing at the Politecnico di Torino, argued how we might address this seismic shift by equipping young people with the knowledge and skills to understand these new waters in which we are swimming. Negotiating a change of this magnitude does not simply require technical know-how, but a sense of history, of social consequence and a measure of critical thinking. As with the printing press, the TV and the telephone, history has taught us that all new technologies are met with doubt, skepticism and even panic; what is needed is to ‘empower the teachers’ to encourage students to recognize that technology is man-made and thus controllable. Citing Marvin Kranzberg’s irst law of technology, that ‘technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral,’ Professor De Martin invited the audience to consider the questions we might reasonably ask of technology and how we might subject it to ethical scrutiny – it is clear that technology constitutes both solutions and threats to sustainability but, what will prevail? New policies and reforms should address why 'computers are special machines' in education and training, without which technology will remain frail and techno- determinism will be steadfast. Education needs to cover the conceptual and factual basis to the digital revolution and institutions have to address how to manage these enormous resources responsibly. The skills of responsible use of technology are key to the formation of a ‘irst-class’ citizen and thus a good worker; in Professor De Martin's words ‘to use the Internet responsibly is to not just consume but to produce and communicate.’ Thanking Professor De Martin for his presentation, ETF Director Cesare Onestini said: The challenge of the fourth industrial digital revolution is to look at how the issues translate into policy and reforms. Mr Onestini will continue the discussion on the digital revolution and the future of education and training on April 11 when he is a guest speaker at the Nexa Center for Internet & Society.

UT Now, he drives a taxi – a job he hopes will provide security in retirement. With debate about policies to support a more age diverse workforce on the agenda in Brussels , we revisit Velimir’s story, and ask – what can be done to tap into this underultilised workforce? New Tricks Macedonia has rolled out various initiatives to boost people’s job prospects – small-business training, grants, retraining for skilled professions – but has failed to achieve the desired take-up. For older job-seekers, who make up a growing share of the country’s unemployed, learning a new skill or starting a business can be daunting. When his textile mill closed in 2011, Velimir could have taken advantage of a programme that trains and provides grants to entrepreneurs. But at 60, he was four years away from receiving a pension. ‘It didn’t pay for me to start my own business. It takes at least three years to really get a company working. By the time that happened, I would probably have retired.’ What’s more, the country’s economic prospects didn’t prove tempting. ‘Now would be a bad time for me to open a factory,’ Velimir affirms. ‘Who knows if I would sell anything?’ Empty seats While it’s especially challenging to get older workers into training, the country’s recent efforts to attract adults of any age have fallen fat. Macedonians participating in adult education is a third of the EU average. Older workers are not taking up training programmes because, with a few exceptions, they cost money. Tuition fees for courses at the Open Civic University in Skopje, for example, range from US$280 for typing, to more than twice that to train as a beautician. FYR Macedonia’s average monthly salary was around US$550 in February 2015.

It has reached only around 10 percent for unemployed people between the ages of 40 and 50 years. Above 50 years old, this drops to 4 percent. ‘There’s a stigma surrounding education and taking new classes.’ But he points out that gaining new skills during the latter stages of working life opens opportunities, as companies are now waking up to the value of older workers. ‘Companies have already started to look beyond the usual age limit, because they see people over 35 as being more serious about work obligations. In the future, we expect [age] prejudices to disappear, because across Europe, older workers are in demand.’ Article by Zaklina Hadzi-Zairova .  Did you like this article?

The law recognises the important role of Sector Committees - led by employers, business associations, trade unions and other social partners – through a more enhanced role in Moldovan vocational training and education landscape. Anticipating and addressing skills mismatch, enhancing social dialogue and supporting qualiication-system reform are among the tasks of SCs. The new law also secures operational funding for the SCs to develop. PTRhAeCETuICrEopAeRaEnASUniPoRnOhJaEsCTbSe&enCAsuMpPpAoIGrtNinSg tRhEisGItOhNroSu&gChOtUhNeTfRraIEmS ework of Budget Support .

The SCs take the lead in 2018, preparing reports for the agriculture and food, IT and communication, transport and road infrastructure and trade sectors. The labour market information is welcomed by vocational education providers, using it to develop Centres of Excellence – sector-speciic vocational courses. The National Employment Service are another key partner and beneiciary of the SCs’ work. National Qualiications Framework In 2017, Moldova adopted a new law to establish the National Qualiications Framework. With the ongoing support of the ETF, qualiications will placed in a new National Register, expected to be operational by mid-2018. The new law also foresees the design of a comprehensive methodology for designing and approval of new qualiications to be included in the register. Next steps Taking advantage of the new laws will be discussed when Sectorial Committee members join ETF experts, policymakers, vocational education providers, labour market experts, public employment representatives, international organisations, and other social partners, in Chisinau on 6 February. The meeting is also an opportunity to present an overview of ETF activities in Moldova, including the labour market observatory, tracer studies, teachers’ survey, work-based learning and national qualiications.

It is the first time Mr Onestini took part in the 'Exchange of Views' session with the Employment and Social Affairs Committee as Director of the ETF, a position he took up on September 1, 2017. He joins directors of the EU Agencies: European Centre for the PDReAvCeTloICpEmAeRnEtAoSf VPoRcOatJiEoCnTaSl &TrCaAinMinPgAI &thCeOEUuNrToRpIEeSan Agency for Safety and Health at Work and the European Foundation for the Improvement PoUf BLLivICinAgTIaOnNdS W& RoErkSiOnUgR .TS ABOUT Looking forward Responding to changing skills needs, adapting to digital change, making the most of migrants’ skills through better qualifications systems, entrepreneurship and providing expertise and assistance to the EU Delegations are among the ETF’s priorities for 2018. The corporate conference 21-22 November looks at the future of skills and jobs and policies to assist the transformation. Mr Onestini said helping countries provide their citizens with skills for employability contributes to stability and prosperity, benefiting both the EU and its neighbourhood. ‘The ETF is contributing to the EU’s role as a global actor by ensuring the external dimension of its skills and employment policies, including the New Skills Agenda and Pillar of Social Rights.’ 'How do we translate this priority into reform and action in countries that are undergoing political transition, demographic change and difficult economic situations? That is the challenge for the ETF.' The regions The ETF accompanies the new dynamic in the Western Balkans, where regional partnerships will help acceleration of reforms. In the Southern Neighbourhood the Union for the Mediterranean is an important platform.The ETF continues bilateral engagement with countries, including Libya. In the Eastern Partnership, employment, education, training and youth employability are a focus. In Central Asia, the ETF continues to find synergies with international partners such as the Asian Development Bank. Spotlight on 2017 Large-scale labour migration is a fact of life for many ETF partner countries. In Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, which have been particularly affected by the Syrian refugee crisis, the early recognition and validation of qualifications is helping to support the integration of migrants and refugees into the labour market. EU candidate countries have lagged work-based learning as a priority. A key action has been facilitating their participation in the European Alliance for Apprenticeships. Managed by the European Commission, the alliance brings together governments, business, educators, and other social partners, working together to promote the quality, supply, image and mobility of apprenticeship and workplace learning.

To help explore best-practice, challenges, opportunities and policy actions the European Training Foundation together with the Council of Europe, both working on qualifications reform in the EU neighbourhood, hosted the ‘Shaping Level 5’ conference in Turin, 7-8 June. More than 60 policymakers, employers, educators, experts, EU officials and social partners from across Europe and 14 of the ETF’s partner countries took part. Opening the conference, the ETF’s Xavier Matheu de Cortada said National Qualification Frameworks, where qualification levels are defined are the perfect tool to provide quality assured, recognisable skills for the labour market. ‘They can equip citizens for lifelong learning, recognition and mobility within and across countries.’ Jean-Phillipe Restoueix, from the Council of Europe’s Higher Education Unit, says a common obstacle for Level 5 however, is the ‘complicated’ relationship between higher and vocational education. ‘Building trust is key. You need to make the bridge more obvious.’ The sweet spot Like dessert and cheese, vocational education and higher education go together, says Jean-Louis Gouju, an advisor with France’s Higher Education Ministry. ‘Just ask any Frenchman!’ Sharing the EU best-practice approach, Mr Gouju highlighted the country’s integrated approach that harmonises Level 5 diplomas from vocational and higher education with labour market needs, a process that is enhanced through the multi-stakeholder dialogue. French employers are particularly happy with the ‘employability’ of Level 5, he says. ‘We continue to try to reduce the gap between higher education and vocational competences, because the cross-cutting competences are absolutely necessary for employers: languages, IT, teamwork, etc. Morocco Serbia North Macedonia Tunisia Turkey Ukraine P‘BRuAtCwTICeEcAanRnEAoSt kePeRpOuJsEiCnTgSa&cCaAdMemPAicIGlNanS guRaEgGeIOoNnSo&nCeOUNTRIES hand, and VET on the other.

The ratio between the qualification offered through higher education and vocational education is 1:5, he said, speaking in the context of Ukraine’s recent educational reform. ‘Many young people use the vocational Level 5 as a bypass to higher education, he said. We are not securing the number of professionals with vocational qualifications and we need to change the situation.’ The two-day workshop provided a forum for participants from all countries to share their experience, challenges and opportunities to leverage better policy and practice outcomes.

The Kosovo Education Strategic Plan 2011-2017 aims to improve the quality of vocational education by 2021. A framework on Visions for Skills 2020, backed by the European Training Foundation, envisages Kosovo as a ""globally competitive knowledge society"" by 2020 with a workforce equipped with adaptable skills. It is a laudable vision, Prof. Gashi says, ""if proper education policies are put in place and if implemented consistently."" However, she adds: ""So far, Kosovo's attempts have been mainly positioned to meet actual labour market needs, with little emphasis to prepare the workforce for the changing demands of the future."" Serbia In Serbia, where dual college/workplace education is being introduced, the focus is more on current labour market demands than anticipating skills for the future. Around 4,500 trainees - less than two percent of Serbia's a 186,000 vocational students - are currently enrolled in dual education courses, says Lara Lebedinski, a research fellow at Belgrade's Institute of Economic Sciences. ""Reforms in the educational sector are politically not so popular, because changes and improvements can be at best seen after the election cycle,"" Ms Lebedinski says. ""Governments need incentives to pursue these reforms more firmly.""< Turkey More than 40 percent of Turkey's 80 million people are under 25, and skills-training has long been a government priority.

The European Commission-backed initiative includes the European Training Foundation's major conference Skills for the Future: Managing Transition, scheduled to take place in Turin, November 21-22, 2018. The need to raise awareness of the importance of skills training is key policy objective for the EU. ""Technology and globalisation are driving change all around us and challenge education systems to innovate and adapt,"" Cesare Onestini, director of the European Training Foundation says. ""This is why as part of the EU Vocational Skills Week, we are encouraging events in all EU neighbourhood countries with a focus on promoting skills acquisition for people of all ages."" Skills Week in the EU neighbourhood More than a dozen events in countries surrounding the EU have been tagged to the EU Skills Week throughout the autumn, with several during the week itself.

Every Monday after breakfast he goes to Auto Service Šahović, to do practical training. With the support of the employer he gets acquainted with the business and how to deal with customers. ‘Initially, everything was new and unknown to me because I learned at school and the bench. Now I spend my entire day at a service station. The master already gives me small tasks and auxiliary jobs. I get a lot better at the service and I like the carmaker's work’, says Dado. This is the first year that the Ivan Uskoković school is exploring dual education, following an initiative of the Ministry of Education implementing the amendment of the Law on Vocational education, in 2017. The students spend one day per week at the workplace in their first year, two in the second and three in the third. The Ministry of Education subsidises the pay of students in dual education to the extent of 10% in the first grade, and 15% of average net salary in the second grade. Montenegro is not the only country investing in more training at work. Four Western Balkan countries and Turkey joined forces in Budva on 26-27 October 2017 to strengthen the quality of apprenticeships and increase the employability of young people. The event was organised by the European Commission in cooperation with the European Training Foundation , in the framework of the European Alliance for Apprenticeships – a platform bringing together governments and key stakeholders to strengthen the quality, supply and image of apprenticeships in Europe. With Serbia joining in 2017, all five candidate countries are now part of the Alliance. The European Alliance for Apprenticeships regional seminar was part of the European Vocational Skills Week, a series of events organised all over Europe to improve the attractiveness and image of vocational education and training. By helping its neighbouring countries to improve the quality of apprenticeships, the EU is supporting the development of human capital opportunities for growth. In this area of work, it relies on the expertise of the ETF - the only EU agency working for political stability and opportunities for growth through learning in the EU’s candidate and neighbouring countries. Improving the quality of apprenticeships contributes to the EU's priority on jobs, growth and investment. Last 5 October the EC has proposed a European Framework for Quality and Effective Apprenticeships. This is part of the New Skills Agenda for Europe and is in line with the European Pillar of Social Rights, which defends a right to quality and inclusive education, training and life-long learning.

NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT The two-day event in Ireland's capital, 27-28 September, on ""skills anticipation and matching "" was the seventh in a series of specialised workshops organised over the past five years under the EaP's Platform 4. The workshop's participants were members of the ETF’s ""Make it Match"" experts network. Irish experience and the development of novel approaches in this field provided a rich source of examples that could be adapted for use by the 37 delegates from Armenia, Azerbajan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. ""Irish experience in linking insights and signals from labour market intelligence with the national skills strategy and education and training policies at all levels,"" was an example of how joined-up thinking and policies could create practices suited to the era of big data, Eduarda Castel-Branco, the ETF's Senior Specialist on VET systems and policies and coordinator of the Make it Match Network, said. The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs presented the findings of a new report on the impact of the digital economy on jobs and skills, noting that ""in Ireland the biggest impact of digitalisation on jobs, employment and skills is expected to occur in 2023-2030 and low-skilled jobs are those most at risk."" Solutions to minimise the negative impact of this looming employment crisis included ""training/retraining, better skills utilization by companies [and] support to traditional sectors and regions, and social protection,"" the study found. A newly established element in skills anticipation that proved a bit hit at the workshop was Ireland's Regional Skills Forum. Nine regional forums are already operational and their work includes liaising with very small and medium-sized companies to gather information on human resources challenges and demands; implementing innovative digital PsRkAillCsTtIrCaEinAiRnEgAtShatPtRaOrgJEeCt ToSld&eCr,AloMwPAsIkGiNlleSd eRmEGpIlOoNyeSe&s;CaOnUdNTRIES contributing to a continuous exchange of information on PsUkBillLsICaAnTdIOjoNbSs&bReEtwSOeUeRnCtEhSe nNatEiWonSaRlOaOnMd &reEgVioEnNaTlSlevAeBlsO. UT Workshop participants recognised that ""the digital era changes ways of producing and managing data on labour market and social issues, and of visualising and disseminating insights. This means combining sources of data, exploring the potential of administrative data and encouraging dialogue with SMEs to get a sense of their skills challenges. Research and data analysis are enriched by the perceptions and aspirations of all labour market players. It is prize participants said was worth striving for: Nikoloz Chanadiri, head of department at Georgia's Social Service Agency, said: ""I am impressed by the lean, effective and modern automated matching system of the JobsIreland.ie website…This workshop [was] indeed a unique and enriching opportunity to improve our know-how."" Ana Indoitu, General Secretary of the National Youth Council of Moldova and member of the Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum, said: ""Skills anticipation and matching is a complex theme and we know that governments tend to have insufficient resources to do it well. Our countries need to delegate this function to a well-resourced institution, promote the involvement of stakeholders and use proper research tools."" She added: ""We were impressed by the Irish experience of the Regional Skills Forums - it is a great democratic way to identify needs and design policies.""  Did you like this article?

SROOM & EVENTS ABOUT Ukraine’s Minister of Education Lilia Hrynevych and the EU Delegation’s Head of Cooperation Berend de Groot joined ETF experts, parliamentarians and stakeholders from the worlds of work and education to discuss the future of vocational education and training on 22 February in Kyiv. More than 90 participants took part in the workshop, organised together with the ETF. Lifelong learning, decentralisation, innovation, migration of young people, were among the topics. EU best practice from Finland and Ireland was also shared. The outcomes will help shape the future vision, which will be further developed and refined when key stakeholders meet in April. Opening the workshop, Minister Hrynevych said the vision should be clear and understandable to all involved. ‘It’s obvious that we can succeed only through joint efforts.’ The EU Delegation’s Berend de Groot reaffirmed the EU’s commitment to boost skills and education. ‘We want to see economic growth in the country and for this we need skills. We should build the vision.’ The ETF will lead in advising the design of the EU-intervention in 2018. Future focused The ETF has been working closely with Ukraine as drives its education and skills agenda forward, bringing the system closer to European standards. The responsibility for vocational education is being devolved to the 25 regions – a major challenge for a country of 45 million people. The ETF has supported the Ukraine’s Ministry of Education and Science along the way, analysing the practical measures needed to make this a success. The joint project led to a Green Paper, the blueprint for reform. Minister Hrynevych said this forms the basis of the future VET vision, expected in June 2018. ‘The key ideas of this paper can form the foundations of the vision.’ PDReAcCeTnICtrEaAlisRaEtAioSn isPRaOcJoEmCTpSli&caCtAeMd PpAroIGcNeSss, dRuEeGItOoNtSh&e COUNTRIES ‘completely new system of governance,’ she said.

The financing of vocational education is another focus area. Action areas Vocational education enrolments are falling in Ukraine, with many young people moving abroad for work. Minister Hrynevych said the establishment of multi- functional VET centres will help to meet the skills gap. The centres take a holistic approach, offering different levels of vocational education, including adult learning. Ukraine is working together with employers to promote work-based learning and apprenticeship. It is modernising occupational and educational standards, in line with labour market needs, and updating school equipment and infrastructure, with the financial support of EU and international partners. Dmytro Oliynyk, President of the Federation of Employers in Ukraine, says people are less likely to move abroad for work if they are trained in-companies. ‘The key to success of companies is the people who work for them. We dream of an integrated vocational education and training, system closely linked to companies. We need to unite our efforts.’ The ETF’s Country Manager for Ukraine, Margareta Nikolovska, says the shared future vision presents great opportunities for Ukraine. ‘The vision contributes significantly to public policy debate. It puts education, training, lifelong learning, entrepreneurship, employment and the labour market, i.e. the entire skills system, at the centre of economic reform.’ More info Read: Skills and training stands on the threshold of historic change in Ukraine on the blog.

PTUhBeLcICoAuTnIOtrNy,Sb&eRnEeSfiOttUinRgCEfSromNEstWroSnRgOOinMve&stEmVEeNnTtSby AthBeOUMTinistry of Economy, recently received three ‘Good practice’ awards from the European Training Foundation for the best SME internationalisation projects. With 75% of their costs covered by the Ministry, the Istanbul Lingerie Cluster, the Footwear Design Workshop and the Ex-Point Expo Mentoring Program ranked among the top seven projects awarded in May in Turin, Italy. The reason for Turkey investing so much in this area, and achieving so much success, is not a coincidence. Small and medium-sized enterprises make up 99.8% of the total number of registered businesses in Turkey and account for over 55% of exports and more than 73% of employment. In a strategy launched in 2009, Turkey established an export strategy with a goal of increasing exports by 12% annually, in order to eventually become one of the top ten economies in the world. By bringing together competing companies with no knowledge of each other, the Istanbul Apparel Exporters’ Association turned the lingerie businesses into a network. With a combination of theoretical and applied learning, mentoring, and trade visits to the International lingerie fair in Paris, the Istanbul Lingerie Cluster achieved a total of €1.7m of export orders for the companies. “Our scope was to change the vision and to expand to the EU market” said the organisers, who carried out a training needs analysis before launching the project. The footwear sector, 80% of which exports to Iraq, Russia and Germany, was addressed by the Izmir Chamber of Commerce through a Footwear Design Workshop – a three-week training course for SMEs implemented by the Istanbul Fashion Academy. The course, focusing on the importance of design in adding value to manufacturing, culminated in the foundation of the Faculty of Footwear Design and Manufacturing at Izmir University of Economics. “Before starting the training course, we made an on-site visit to every company”, said the training organisers, who invested significant energy in the training needs assessment. With a focus on key decision-makers within SMEs in the automotive, maritime, plastics, and heating, ventilation and air-conditioning sectors, Ex-Point is the third award winner: a training programme which helps companies to develop their export strategies and promotion. Organised by Zobu, a consulting firm based in Izmir, the course consists of six to 12 months of mentoring of 1-2 key staff per company. In this way, participants learn from mentors, and can apply their learning to their daily work. “Our goal is to prepare non-exporters for export”, said an organiser, “Moreover, we want to increase the export volume of companies already exporting, but in a more sustainable way”.

He made the comments following a recent meeting with European Training Foundation Director Cesare Onestini in Belgrade. Serbia’s hotbed of ICT The city of Novi Sad is Serbia’s hotbed of ICT. The Vojvodina ICT cluster brings together 35 companies, 4000 employees and 10+ governmental and educational institutions. It aims to give ICT companies a regional, national and global platform, support training initiatives, and lobby for better policies to support digital industry development. Inspired by the successful ecosystem, the ETF, together with the ICT cluster and ministry overseeing vocational education, analysed future skills demands for the sector and links to the education system. Plans are now moving forward to replicate the success through ‘knowledge hubs’ – platforms to bring together employers, educators and government in different sectors. READ about the initiative here and WATCH the ilm here. Boosting digital key competences The European Commission’s unveiled a new Digital Education Action Plan in January to boost digital skills and e-learning. It builds upon the EU key competence framework, a guide to curriculum reform, which covers eight key competences including digital and entrepreneurship.

At the EU Western Balkans Media Days organized by the European Commission on 17-18 September, 2018, skills emerged as a key issue. For an environment in which quality journalism can thrive, skilled news producers and knowledgeable consumers are vital. Journalists need PgRoAoCdTIfCoErmARalEaAnSd iPnRfoOrJmECaTl Str&aiCnAinMgPtAoIGpNroSduRcEeGqIOuNalSit&y COUNTRIES content, and citizens need to be educated to distinguish PreUaBlLfIrCoAmTIOfaNkSe&nReEwSsO. URCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT As the EU Commissioner for the European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations, Johannes Hahn, said: “Education, training are key to enhancing media freedom, and thus enhance democracy in accession countries. Pointing out that democracies need citizens that can distinguish quality content from the spreading fake news, he added that “training and education in the region must include media literacy, and this is a top priority for the EU”. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’s Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, highlighted the fragility in the region. “Fake news influences the fragile reality in the Western Balkans region. Sometimes they instill extremism, and it is a civil right to remove them. “We believe that citizens have the right to transparency, on the basis of verified information, and not speculation’ added Genevieva Calavera Ruiz, Director in charge of the Western Balkans at the European Commission. Journalists from Western Balkan countries shared their concerns and forward-looking ideas about how to improve the quality of journalism through formal education, on-the-job training in the newsroom and lifelong learning. “We need to train the future generation of professional journalists, and we need to train them in the newsroom,” said Investigative Reporting Lab reporter Saska Cvetkovska. “The most important part of my learning was when I could learn from the most experienced colleagues” added Pavle Zlatić, digital media expert at IREX Serbia, highlighting the key role of mentoring. Milica Stojanovic from the Centre for Investigative Journalism pointed out that “journalistic skills include not only subjects like financial literacy or how to use social media, but also how to stay safe, even in the digital world”. In his concluding remarks, Commissioner Hahn added “I am glad that education was at the core. But I would like to add that this does not start with education or training of journalists. It starts in schools, way before journalists training”.

PUBLICATIONS & RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT The European Training Foundation took part in the meeting, together with the European Commission and Cedefop, to provide expertise on monitoring and comparing systems. Among the highlights, data collection emerged as a key factor in ensuring better quality of vocational education, and making it relevant to social and economic demands. According to ETF Director, Cesare Onestini, ‘Vocational education is a proven way of raising employment prospects for all and bridging the gap between the supply and demand for skills. To make this work, policy makers need to track vocational education graduates. This information is extremely relevant to monitor success rates on the labour market, strengthening counselling services, adapting courses to the changing demand. This will allow for more strategic choices and increase resilience in the transition from school to work.’ At EU level, in November, the Education Council adopted a new recommendation on tracking vocational and higher education graduates. Among the candidate countries, Turkey was the irst to start tracking the performance of its vocational graduates in the labour market, with the introduction of an e-graduate system in 2007. Albania, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia made steps towards establishing mechanisms for systematic collection of such data only recently. The Director of the European Training Foundation also chaired a working group on the Future of vocational education and training, as well as a peer review workshop on graduate tracking.  Did you like this article?

Ukraine's Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman, who had talks with Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, during Monday's meeting, welcomed the deal. Association Agreement Signed at Monday's wide-ranging fifth meeting of the EU-Ukraine Association Council, which took place after the first full year since the entry into force of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement on September 1, 2017, the EU4Skills deal is part of what the EC says is a ""positive development in bilateral trade and reform progress"" between the two parties.

RWCEhSatevNeErWoSuRrOjoOuMrn&eEyV, wENeTaSll mAoBvOeUwT ith one valuable currency in our luggage: our skills. Recognising and rewarding skills is a long-term investment for origin and destination countries as well as for migrants to ensure inclusive growth that benefits everyone. When people move, taking risks and facing change become daily needs. In this context, being able to rely on one’s professional or personal skills is a precondition for a new start. Slava and Marva have benefitted from inclusive systems that recognised their prior skills, gave them access to further training and prepared them for the needs of their new societies. Their story is the story of thousands of people on the move across borders. Skills are valuable tools, and yet data show that they are underused. The EU’s 2020 Entrepreneurship Action Plan highlighted that migrants’ skills are under- exploited in the EU labour market, and that migrants are under-represented within the entrepreneurial population. Yet in many secotors in the EU, labour demand exceeds available supply: it is in the common interest to open more paths to leverage the potential for creative and new solution linked to cross-border migration. In the first instance, formal mechanismis are needed to grant recognition - or partial recognition - to skills obtained through formal education. Use of skills should be enabled through access to necessary complementary courses related to local job market requirements, including language. In parallel, skills acquired through informal learning should be validated by authorised bodies in line with relevant standards. Secondly, skills offered should to be matched to skills needed, in order to maximise employability. Data collection is key to this, and policy makers need to track qualifications and monitor success rates on the labour market to strengthen counselling services and adapt policies. Finally, strategies should be developed to facilitate the socio-economic integration of third-country nationals in host communities, to maximise the economic potential of migrants to the economy. The EU is fully committed to this process: it supports skills assessment and access to training through the EU Action Plan on the Integration of Immigrants in the EU; it assists Member States to verify qualifications of new arrivals through the Skills Profile Tool for non- EU nationals; and it facilitates socio-economic inclusion through the EU’s 2020 Entrepreneurship Action Plan. The EU is working with neighbouring countries to boost domestic job markets and strengthen the vocational training and education systems. As the only EU agency active in the area of external relations through education, at the European Training Foundation we are fully committed to make this happen. In almost 30 countries – from Belarus, to Azerbaijan, to Tunisia – the ETF provides advice and guidance to enable validation and recognition of skills, in line with best practice in the EU. In all its partner countries, the ETF promotes the development of occupational standards, to ensure that a functioning comparative system is set up.

While opening the event, the EESC President, Luca Jahier, highlighted the key role of social partners in setting up the proposals which should go to policy makers – and highlighting the central role of vocational education. “The EU is an inspiration”, added the ETF Director, Cesare Onestini, “but there’s a lot of inspiration that comes from the EuroMed region, and we’re there to help countries identify lines for action”. Being aware of data is key for countries to design policies. With one third of the population aged under 15, and youth unemployment reaching up to 30%, countries from the Southern Mediterranean are facing challenges in offering youngsters opportunities for a better future. Vocational education is still negatively perceived, and is not considered a first choice by families. As Cinzia Del Rio, EESC Rapporteur said, “a shortage of funding is preventing countries from planning long term education and economic social measures, which has a consistent impact on future opportunities for citizens”. The Euro-Mediterranean Summit of Economic and Social Councils and Similar Institutions continues until Tuesday, 18 December and will conclude with the adoption of recommendations that will be sent to the political authorities of the countries involved in the UFM Ministerial Summits and disseminated widely among civil society organisations in the region. The event is co-financed by the European Commission. More here  Did you like this article?

Besides enabling people to take control of their lives, find or create the jobs they want, and make the most of their talents, education is crucial to boosting innovation and creativity. ""Education, training, lifelong learning, mobility and transnational cooperation are critical in boosting resilience today and will be even more so in the future: providing basic and high-level skills and competences, reducing inequalities, promoting entrepreneurial mindsets, fostering inclusive, stable and democratic societies, and making a success of migration and globalisation”, write Vice-President Katainen and Commissioner Navracsics. Better skills for a fairer society If the EU is to achieve the ambitious new targets set at the Social Summit in Gothenburg on 17 November, education systems must be inclusive, efficient and effective. They “must equip people with the competences and attitudes they need to keep adapting to change throughout their lives and seize new opportunities. They must offer equal opportunities to all so that we can build a fairer society”. Lifelong learning Highlighting the need to acquire skills and competences throughout life, Vice-President Katainen and Commissioner Navracsics stress Europe’s determination to raise the bar for participation in lifelong learning to 25% by 2025. The role of teachers “No real change can happen without teachers”, they write. “The quality of education is strongly linked to the knowledge, skills and abilities of Europe’s six million teachers. They play a key role in equipping young people with the right competences and in modernising education. That is why we have to do better in supporting them”.

How do global forces interact with local realities and how does this affect the need for skills? How should governments, businesses, social partners, civil society, research institutions, communities and education and training providers work together to manage change? What skills policies work in different contexts? Indeed, the fourth industrial revolution is upon us. Driven by new technologies that blend the physical, digital and biological worlds, it is transforming industries, economies and societies around the world. Other global trends such as shifting demographics, migration and climate change are intensifying this process. Old jobs are changing, relocating or disappearing, while new ones are emerging. As work becomes increasingly automated, jobs become polarised and non-routine cognitive and social skills become vital assets. The fast pace of change leads to a growing mismatch between the skills workers have and those employers need. Societies need people with new skillsets lexible enough to cope with the demands of a constantly changing economic environment. This challenges societies worldwide to rethink how they equip and re-equip people with the knowledge and skills they need for life and work in the world of tomorrow. Different national and regional contexts require different solutions and alternative pathways. Their impact and how they are managed varies from place to place. Participants of the Skills for the future: ma naging transition conference will identify ways to develop forward-looking training and labour policies in their countries, and will have the opportunity to share their views and work together to identify how the EU can support this transition through the work of the ETF.

OOM & EVENTS ABOUT What do we know about the future of work? Besides seminal research papers published by the academics, the International Labour Organisation, OECD, CEDEFOP, European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions and the European Commission all have a common aim: to map the shifting demands of the 21st century world of work. Ranging from focused studies of sectors and fields, such as vocational education and training, to broad sweep analysis of 'big data', the statistics and analyses will provide essential tools for guiding job seekers in the EU and partner countries. ‘It is about anticipating future needs so that education and training systems can respond to the changes. A number of tools are available to anticipate future needs, but one needs to use different tools at the same time. In addition to traditional sources of labour market information, ‘big data’ can be another source. For example, the analysis of job portals provides a wide view of real time labour market data’, says Ummuhan Bardak, the ETF's Senior Specialist in Labour Market and Migration. The EU Skills Panorama the single web portal created by the European Commission to integrate data and information on skills needs in occupations and sectors, is already contributing to skills intelligence at the European level. One of the things you can find in the portal is the European Skills Index, a composite indicators measuring the performance of EU skills systems. By using 15 individual indicators, the index assesses three dimensions of a skills system - skills development, activation and matching – capturing three stages of route from learning to skills utilisation in the labour market and at work in Europe.

Meanwhile between the 1990s and 2000s many countries had a greater focus on ‘boosting participation in higher education’. To ensure VET provision is in line with genuine economic demands, it is important to understand the reason behind these shifts in public policy.

The company, Tomato AL, soon began exporting to neighbouring Kosovo* and Serbia. Fast-forward to 2018 and the company has grown to 60 employees, doing business with 500 Albanian farmers, exporting to 22 markets, including the European Union. ‘We are using many tactics to continue expanding our exports,’ the 27 year-old says, ‘and we PcRoAnCtiTnICuEe AtoREsAeeS exPpRaOnJsEioCnTS, p&aCrtAicMuPlAaIrGlyNtSowaRrEdGsIOthNeS E&UCOeUveNrTyRyIEeSar.’ Laurat is one of 40 participants who took part in the 2018 Summer Academy for SMEs, PUBLICATIONS & RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT June 25-29 in Tirana. Aimed at small businesses, startups and students in international trade and export markets, the one-week boot camp began in 2017 as a joint initiative between the not-for-profit SME Albania and Austria’s Köstinger Consulting. Recognised as a good entry point for SMEs looking to internationalise and for its low-cost budget of just €2,500, the Academy received the ETF Good Practice in Training and the ETF Policymakers Choice Award at the recent policy-practice forum . Based on survey feedback from companies, SME Albania focussed the 2018 programme on export management, covering access to financing, marketing, customs and regulations and social media strategy. Academy Director, Daniel Guçe says SME Albania are 'one team, with one goal, and one mission: to support Albanian SMEs to be competitive.' ‘That’s why we are listening to them, helping define their needs and designing a programme that helps to solve their problems.’ Laurat is satisfied with the approach, saying he learned new skills in marketing, how to get closer to clients and make faster sales. ‘In practice, my business has been very professional but I needed refine and reinforce my work and this is where the Academy has helped fill knowledge gaps,’ he says. Business consultant and certified trainer Eneriko Hajdaraj was part of the 2017 Academy where he ran practical exercises on business planning, marketing production and negotiation. ‘This type of training is very effective and we see the results immediately,’ he says. ‘This year I was involved as a guest speaker because I want to give space to the new trainers, new methods and knowledge-sharing.’ The policy perspective and the path towards EU integration Just like Laurat’s business, the Academy is growing fast. In the first two years, 75 participants have graduated. In 2018, the Embassies of the Netherlands and China and the Italian-Albanian Programme for the Development of SMEs partnered up. Mr. Guce says in 2019 the aim is to take the Academy to 12 locations nation-wide. ‘We will go door-to-door, to the places where the SMEs are doing business. We will go to them!’ Migena Muslli from the Albanian Investment Development Agency welcomes a broader reach. ‘By going to a wider number of companies we can understand what their needs are. We support these initiatives because we want to be closer to the SMEs to know what they need to improve their business, and to be able to address this to policymakers.’ The European Commission’s renewed strategy to support Albania’s path towards EU integration includes initiatives to boost private investment, trade and SME development .

In this regard, the SME Academy could benefit from taking a regional dimension across the Western Balkan countries to share experience, know-how and good practice’, says Kopliku. ’I am sure we have a lot to learn from each other,’ she adds. Background SMEs make up 99% of companies in Albania. In 2017, the total value of Albania’s exports to the EU was €1.5 million, up 60% from 2007. The EU accounts for more than 60% of export trade. Turkey, China and the Western Balkan region are important markets. Key sectors include textiles, footwear, manufactured goods, minerals and food products. The ETF supports the European Commission with assessments of the Small Business Act in the EU’s pre-accession region, Eastern Partnership and Southern Neighbourhood regions.

Public-private partnerships was the focus of the irst-ever ETF event held exclusively on the topic. Members of international organisations – including the OECD and ILO – and representatives from countries neighbouring Europe – Serbia, Ukraine, Jordan and Kazakhstan – gathered to develop a common deinition and explore methodologies for action. EU relevant employers’ organisations and the agency Eurofound contributed expertise too. « What do you think is the deinition of public-private partnerships in vocational education and training for skills development? What is your assessment of the methodology? What do you think about modalities for implementation?» These questions drove the discussions and inspired debate, during which participants shared their own best practices. Participants agreed that partnering among public and private actors improves effectiveness, eficiency and innovation provided that roles and accountability are well deined. Public-private partnerships need checks and reviews on a regular basis, to draw lessons and adjust what’s not meeting quality standards. Further, it can address subsidiarity in the design and delivery of skills in a lifelong learning perspective. International attendees agreed to be members of a new Advisory Committee, whereas partner countries will set up National Tripartite committee for the purpose of this new ETF study. « Agreeing on a common deinition is key, but what is at stake here is that the concepts are applicable in the countries where we work », concluded ETF Director, Cesare Onestini. Next steps Research and in-depth assessment of practices in participating countries will be carried out to identify factors behind successful partnerships and in different contexts.  Did you like this article?

As the EU agency working in external relations through education reforms, we are keen in supporting Ministries and teacher development agencies from South East Europe to improve the quality of teaching for the beneit of citizens across the region"". As a recent ETF report on the continuous professional development of teachers highlights, countries differ in terms of quantity and quality of the training offers and this sets a benchmark for improvement. More specifically: an effective and competent public authority should set a realistic strategy to drive professional development; stakeholders and social partners should be more widely involved in policy-making; quality of training is to be ensured by relevant accreditation bodies; incentives such as funding and reduced bureaucracy costs should be in place to increase the quantity and quality of training providers. Moreover, the continuous professional development needs to be closer to the daily practice of teaching in schools. During the Network launch, representatives from Ministries of education and teacher training agencies and vocational education centres explored common challenges and discussed how collaboration could help to generate solutions. Among the key areas for joint action, participants identified the following: Sharing updates on recent developments; Exchanging expertise and good practices; Sharing resources and training or study visits. Background The Network launch is supported by the European Training Foundation, the only EU agency working in external relations through the reform education and training systems in the EU neighbourhood.

All are committed to developing the entrepreneurial skills of young people, the entrepreneurship potential of women and the skills base of small and medium enterprises. This is one finding emerging from the assessment of the implementation of the Small Business Act presented at a meeting of the Working Group on SME and Entrepreneurship Policy held on 10-11 July 2018 in Tunis as part of OECD-MENA Competitiveness programme.

While policy momentum is developing on women’s entrepreneurship, the assessment underlines that education, employment and economic policies need to be joined up for better impact. Finally, the development of vocational training needs to be boosted in all counties particularly in sectors with export potential. The assessment involved Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine and Tunisia. “I congratulate all countries for their signiicant steps forward in policy development”, said Cesare Onestini, ETF Director. “A robust policy framework is key to promote youth employability and a competitive economy where women have an important role. Now more needs to be done on the implementation of the policies through partnerships between education, business and civic interest groups.” The report of the assessment, “SME and entrepreneurship development in the Mediterranean Middle East and North Africa” will be published in English, French and Arabic on the ETF and OECD websites in September.  Did you like this article?

RELATED CONTENT RELATED PRACTICE AREAS Entrepreneurship RELATED COUNTRIES Where next for youth entrepreneurship in the Mediterranean region? 19 OCT 2018 Youth entrepreneurship must be recognised as a key factor in economic development in the Mediterranean region and a means of improving wellbeing, preventing brain drain and tackling unemployment. This is the headline recommendation of a draft report of the PERuArCoT-MICeEdAiRteErAraSnePaRnORJeEgCiToSn&alCaAnMdPLAoIGcNaSl AsRseEmGIOblNyS & COUNTRIES PpUreBpLIaCrAeTdIObNySD&oRmEeSnOiUcRoCGEaSmbNaErWcoSrRtaO,OPMre&siEdVeEnNtToSf thAeBOUT Italian Province of Avellino. With 60% of the population are under 30 years of age, and one of the highest youth unemployment rates in the world, providing young people with sustainable employment opportunities is a major challenge in the southern Mediterranean. Youth entrepreneurship is seen as vital to promote economic growth and employment and combat radicalisation linked to the economic and social exclusion of young people. The draft report calls on central, regional and local governments, with the support of the EU and other donors, to boost entrepreneurship among young people through education and training and inancial support. The draft report was presented on 11 October in Brussels at a meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Regional and Local Assembly , which brings together members of the European Union’s Committee for the Regions with counterparts from the Southern Mediterranean. While more needs to be done to support for young people’s start-ups, rapporteur Domenico Gambacorta argued that training programmes should also address business failure. Good practice exchange between countries on youth entrepreneurship promotion was one way to build know- how, he said. In response, ETF expert Anthony Gribben stressed the importance of local experience in shaping national policies to support youth entrepreneurship and recommended that exchange of experience between local and regional authorities be based on pre-deined good practice criteria. He argued that the region’s entrepreneurship drive should include consideration of entrepreneurship as a key competence. The inal report will be considered for adoption at the next meeting of the Assembly in February 2019.

The evolution of the European Training Foundation's fagship programme, the Torino Process, is in the spotlight as delegates from 31 regions and cities meet in Turin to discuss progress over two days of focus group meetings, 27-28 February. Opening the Regions and Cities for VET and Skills Development conference, ETF Director Cesare Onestini said the event offered an opportunity to refect on how to make the next round of the Torino Process even more useful, exciting and further into the reform process. 'The Torino Process is like a tree - as Manuela likes to say,' Mr Onestini said, paying tribute to Manuela Prina, the ETF's outgoing Torino Process coordinator. 'A seed was planted and now we have many branches.' PTRhAoCsTeICreEgAioRnEAalSbraPnRcOhJeEsCTwSe&reCnAoMwPA'gIGroNwS inRgEsGtrIOonNgS &anCdOUfNowTReIrEiSng' and should soon produce fruit, he added.

The ETF's Abdelaziz Jaouani, who is taking over as Torino Process coordinator, said the regional dimension was growing fast, which was 'a good thing in terms of ownership and multi-level governance.' In the programme's next round - which is due to launch in 2019 - there are likely to be as many as 50 or more regions involved, he added. The expansion of the Torino Process - the ETF's evidence-based skills training policy monitoring and support system - to the sub-national level during its last two-year round, 2016-17, is the latest development in a programme rst launched eight years ago. In the last round, 25 of the ETF's 29 partner countries produced national reports presenting the detailed results of intensive monitoring and evaluation of progress over the previous two years in the development of their vocational education and training systems. In parallel to that, 31 regions from four of those countries replicated that analysis at the local level. The shift from national, top-down analysis to a more collegial approach at the regional level that brings the analysis of VET systems much closer to the chalk-face, refects a growing understanding of the need for deeper policy analysis and the added value it brings to those involved in the nitty-gritty of implementing skills training. By involving regional administrators, social partners, VET providers, business and civil society and other stakeholders in such policy analysis and monitoring, a greater understanding of the needs and potential for skills development and job creation appropriate to the local level can be built. Participants represent Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kazakhstan, Morocco, Russia, Tajikistan, Tunisia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.  Did you like this article?

The workshop, organised jointly by the European Training Foundation and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , brings together all the parties who contribute to the national qualification system – VQA, ACBs, employers, training providers, NGOs – together with experts from the ETF, the European Union Delegation to Turkey, EBRD and ILO. It builds on the ongoing work for strengthening and extending the network of VocTest Centers, focusing on the experience gained and challenges ahead. The strong commitment of employers is one strength of the Turkish system. “Employers should put more effort on training their workers.” said Sabahattin Gücin, Manager of the Vocational Training Academy owned by Ford Otosan, a major automotive manufacturer in Turkey. “Companies should pay attention and take advantage of the qualifications of their workers.” The challenge of Industry 4.0 and how the qualification system will need to adapt to emerging skills needs was also evoked in discussions. “The needs of sectors are changing.” said Mr Gücin. “Qualifications will be a hot topic in the future, much attention must be paid to the design of qualifications to meet new needs of the private sector.” The action plan agreed at the end of the workshop will be adopted at a national conference of the ACBs organised by VQA in December 2018. Both events will provide input for an EU-funded IPA II project to support the VocTest Centers that will start in 2019. “EU support is available to improve the system.” said Mustafa Balci, Education and Training Expert at the EU Delegation to Turkey. “If there are problems we will come together to solve them.” The impact of technological progress and other drivers of change on the supply and demand for skills and how developing and transition countries can respond to them PwRiAllCbTeICtEhAeRfoEcAuSs oPf RaOmJEaCjoTSr i&ntCeArMnaPtAioIGnNaSl coRnEfeGrIOenNcSe& COUNTRIES “Skills for the Future – Managing Transition” organised by PthUeBLEICTAFTiInOTNuSr&inRoEnSO2U1-R2C2ENSoveNmEWbeSrRO20O1M8.& EVENTS ABOUT  Did you like this article?

Speaking at the launch, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker declared, ‘with the European Pillar of Social Rights, the EU stands up for the rights of its citizens in a fast-changing world.’ Stepping into the spacious, contemporary surroundings of the Eriksbergshallen conference centre in Gothenburg, Sweden, you could be forgiven for overlooking the building’s history as a hub of the ship-building and metal-working industries that once provided the core of PthRAeCcTitICy’Es AeRmEpAlSoymPReOntJ.ETCoTdSa&y,CEArMikPsAbIeGrNgSshaRllEeGnIOstNaSn&dsCOamUNidTsRtIEaSregenerated waterfront district that boasts technology start-up companies, high-concept apartments, artisan bars PaUnBdLrICeAstTaIOuNraSn&tsR, EpSrOimUaRrCyEaSndNsEeWcoSnRdOaOrMy s&cEhVoEoNlsT, Sa voAcBaOtUioTnal college, and the Lindholmen Knowledge Centre – a former warehouse converted into a high-tech learning centre. Suring the wave of change It is the embodiment of a successful transformation from industrial to the knowledge economy, built on the principles of lifelong learning and social cohesion. It offers a glimpse of what is possible when the rapid pace of social and economic change is seen more for its potential than its threat. Nowhere is the pace of that change more keenly felt than in the interface between the labour market and education and training systems. New modes of employment, disruptive business models, rapidly increasing automation, and the emergence of novel industrial sectors all demand new skills and ever-greater fexibility from those seeking to enter or re- enter the labour market. While many education and training systems struggle to keep pace, the evidence, from Gothenburg and elsewhere, shows that innovative practices, modernised infrastructure, and enabling policies can inspire and empower national and regional systems, as well as individuals, to turn uncertainty into opportunity. People irst This message came through clearly in the 2016-2017 round of the ETF’s Torino Process. The conclusions of Changing Skills for a Changing World, the Torino Process international conference held in June 2017, highlighted system change, expanding access to skills, promoting innovation, and building trust to increase efficiency and effectiveness as key areas, along with ‘focusing on people, people, and people.’ Failure to do so attracts considerable dangers. There is a growing feeling, around the world, that people’s basic rights have been sidelined in the focus on economic growth following the financial crash of 2008. Maintaining the balance of human and economistic development is vital for the success of the social market economy on which European integration is based. Meanwhile, a political narrative developed in which ‘global elites’ were portrayed as having captured most of the benefits of globalisation and digitalisation. The resentment generated by this narrative provides fertile ground for extremist elements to exploit. A response to this was the Social Summit for Fair Jobs and Growth, held in the Eriksbergshallen, at which the European Pillar of Social Rights was unveiled. Introducing the Summit, the host of the event, Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven, announced: ‘We are here to put people first for a social Europe.’ A solid foundation The European Pillar of Social Rights enshrines 20 principles and rights covering equal opportunities and access to the labour market, fair working conditions, and social protection and inclusion. It is significant that its very first principle is: P‘ERvAeCrTyIoCEneARhEaAsSthePrRiOgJhEtCtToSq&uCaAliMtyPAaInGdNSinclRuEsGivIOeNeSd&ucCaOtUioNnT,RtIrEaSining and life-long learning in order to maintain and acquire skills that enable them to participate fully in PsUoBcLieICtyATaInOdNSm&aRnEaSgOeUsRuCcEcSessNfuEWllySRtrOaOnMsit&ioEnVsENinTStheAlaBbOoUuTr market.’ The ability to ‘participate fully in society’ comes first, and necessarily includes access to meaningful and productive work – whether that comes through employment, self- employment, entrepreneurship, volunteering, or other forms of value creation. Successfully managing transitions in the labour market covers everything from school leavers seeking a start in the world of work, to people returning from caring responsibilities, and the potential for older workers to find new roles. Playing catch-up is not an option for policymakers. A proactive approach is vital, if the benefits of fair employment and equitable education and training opportunities are to be shared across populations. With the European Pillar of Social Rights, the EU Member States demonstrate their commitment to fairer labour markets, sustainable social protection systems, and well- functioning social dialogue. The ETF’s partner countries share these aims, and the ETF is determined to do its best to support them. As Marianne Thyssen, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility put it, the Social Summit sent ‘a strong message of unity, hope and action to European citizens.’ Together, we will spread this message to citizens throughout the EU neighbourhood, and beyond.

Skills are required for specific jobs. The EU key competence framework defines eight key competences including maths, science and technology as well as entrepreneurship and digital competences. Those individuals with good key competences are more fexible in the labour market and more likely to meet employers’ demands for creativity and innovation. In its work with partner countries, ETF is giving particular attention to both entrepreneurship and digital key competences. With EU candidate countries, through the ‘Riga’ process, ETF tracks policy and practice developments in both competence areas. For each candidate country, a factsheet on progress on digital competence and skills for students and teachers are in the pipeline. The factsheets for Montenegro and Serbia are already online. In 2018, specific actions in the two competence areas are being supported in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Tunisia and Ukraine. ‘Co-working developments of both competences will be important’, says ETF’s Anthony Gribben, ‘and should build on existing areas of the curriculum which already refect the two EU competence areas’. The EU key competence framework already has a head- start with support tools to guide curriculum reform. An entrepreneurship competence framework provide s examples of learning outcomes for each level of education. Likewise, an EU digital competence framework provides examples of learning outcomes with guidance for teachers. The 2018 EU key competence framework builds on an earlier instrument agreed in 2006.  Did you like this article?

Vocational education and training may be the best game in town when it comes to economic growth and social inclusion, but, as everyone knows, you have to pay to play. Vocational education and training continues to gain momentum as a driving force for employment, productivity, and international competitiveness across the diverse contexts of ETF partner countries. But as its importance for economic growth and security grows, so do questions about how to organise its financing. A technical approach, based on monetary and resourcing aspects, is unlikely to be as successful as a strategic approach PbRaAsCeTdICoEnAaRhEoAlSisticP,RpOoJlEicCyT-Sor&ieCnAtMedPAvIiGsiNoSn. ARnEdG,IaOsNmS &orCeOpUaNrTtRnIeErScountries move from policy analysis to implementation, there will be greater demand for strategic insights in the area PoUf BfiLnICaAnTcIiOnNgS. & RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT At the same time, the rise of systemic approaches relects increasing participation by employers and other social partners in VET reforms. In turn, this highlights VET’s complex, multi-stakeholder environment, which contributes to it being relatively expensive compared to other parts of the education system. In an economic climate still dominated by budget cuts, particularly for social policy areas like education and training, policy makers urgently need to change the view that VET is a cost borne by the State. Instead, policy makers responsible for VET are urged to make a robust business case for VET as a shared investment in human capital development – with all its potential economic and social benefits – is the first step towards more integrated and robust policy choices. This in turn will open a fundamental discussion about the role of the state in VET. The ETF has been studying the funding and financing of VET systems over the past few years, in order to respond to the range of challenges partner countries have identified. A powerful new set of concepts and tools aimed at helping partner countries explore VET financing is being developed. The ETF has now developed a working definition of the term ‘financing’, and proposed an innovative methodology to support policy dialogue. The overarching aim is to help partner countries change the way they address VET financing, and start to make the move from a technical to a systemic approach. Through its position within the European Commission and wider international networks, the ETF is also well-placed to share case studies which illustrate the structure, implementation, and impact of different methods of raising funds and managing finances. The Torino Process analytical framework has included VET financing as an area for progress monitoring since 2012, and in 2015 the ETF published Cost and Financing Analysis in VET, a guidance note to identify the financial aspects of different reform scenarios and to inform the policy-making process. This has been followed by a formal Position Paper, The Financing of VET and Skills&Development. The ETF can also facilitate national awareness-raising workshops on financing for partner countries. While there is no simple route to a holistic perspective, making good decisions on financing at the outset of the policy process will greatly enhance the resilience of the whole system. With its combination of up-to-date information, technical and methodological support, and exposure to international good practice, the ETF is here to help partner countries make those good decisions.

Stakeholders from 27 nations are meeting in Turin today to take stock of the latest developments in the Torino Process and discuss its implementation over the next two years. ""I have seen the Torino Process develop as an important instrument for cooperation.” said ETF Director Cesare Onestini opening the meeting. “Education and training is key to partner country relationships with the EU, and the Torino Process enables the mutual understanding of programme needs and reforms in VET systems."" The country-by-country and regional analyses resulting from past rounds of the Torino Process have been put to a variety of uses including policy dialogue, interinstitutional cooperation, policy and strategy development and monitoring, project and programme design and donor cooperation and joint programming. ""I'm a user rather than a producer of Torino Process reports” said Romain Boitard, of the EU Delegation to Montenegro. “No other sector has such readable and intelligible material with which to attract attention from donors. When I share Torino Process documents at donor platforms people are amazed by the structure, accuracy and regularity of the evidence base."" The ETF’s partner countries are increasingly appreciative of the Torino Process as a tool for steering the development of their vocational education and training and skills development systems. ""We were one of the pioneers of the Torino Process in 2010” said Viktoria Karbysheva, Torino Process national coordinator for Ukraine and Deputy Director at the Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Science. “For the future, my objective…is to demonstrate the importance of quality in the reports. These are not reports for the sake of doing reports, but as an important tool for national and regional planning and development."" Ukraine is one of four countries neighbouring the EU that are implementing the Torino Process at regional as well as national level.

New features of Torino Process 5.0 are a broader focus on human capital development, including all levels of education, rather than only vocational education and training; an increased focus on policy-relevant conclusions; and a more open and lexible analysis and reporting framework. An important new aspect is that each country’s national report will be enhanced by a concise and analytical external assessment carried out by the ETF. ""There is no single solution that is transportable to every country” said ETF Director Cesare Onestini. “But by sharing and learning from each other's experience we can find solutions that work. That's why we're building on the success of the existing Torino Process format, and introducing innovations that will create a new strategic orientation to help our partner countries make the most of the opportunities and challenges of the future."" The fifth round of the Torino process will be carried out over 2018-20, with the results being presented at an international conference in 2021.  Did you like this article?

The pace at which some jobs and skills are becoming obsolete, the policymakers and educators are under unprecedented pressure. At a time when the future of work is a hot political topic in the EU, making it more prominent in the agenda of countries in the EU neighbourhood is essential, says Francesca Rosso, the ETF's team leader on employment issues. ""In many of our partner countries there is limited discussion about the implications for the future of work - and most strategies covering skills and education end in 2020, meaning that after that date countries will need to launch new strategic approaches."" Future perspectives The conference - Skills for the Future: Managing Transition - is organised around four main topics: mastering global trends; tackling country specific challenges; addressing the future of skills, education and training; and supporting the transition toward the future. ""The conference aims to contribute to this debate, helping policymakers start relecting on the risks and opportunities the future will bring, and integrate these into their policy perspectives post-2020,"" Ms. Rosso adds. The first two sessions of the conference will be open to the press and public, with around 150 participants expected from ""different types of stakeholders"" in education and training in the Turin and its Piedmont region, including students, training providers, employers representatives, researchers and local institutions. ""It is quite an innovative initiative.

There will also be an innovative 'Experience Path' - with a range of institutions, agencies and companies demonstrating what they are doing to adapt to the future world of work: for example, a local foundation that shows how traditional crafts can still have a place in the world of work of tomorrow, also by benefitting from modern technology. ""We really want to inspire participants and have them become vectors of the conference message in their countries,"" concludes Ms. Rosso. Background The European Training Foundation , the EU Agency in charge of supporting countries in the EU neighbourhood to undertake reforms in education, training and labour policies, is organising the ‘Skills for the Future: Managing transition’ conference.

Mr Cavalli is Executive Co- director and General-Director of the Cologni Foundation for the Metiers d'Art, a Geneva-based organisation dedicated to promoting the skills of master craftsmen and women in an age where automation is stripping away the human touch. What skills do the artisans of the 21st century need? PTRhAeCyTnICeEedARtoEAleSarnPRhOoJwECtoTSb&e CreAaMl P'iAnItGeNrpSretReErsG' I-ONS & COUNTRIES interpretation is one of the key elements that, for us, PdUisBtLinICgAuTiIsOhNrSea&lRmESaOstUeRrCcEraSftsNpEeWopSlReO. TOhMe &diEfVfeErNeTnSce ABOUT between an executor and an interpreter is obvious if you think about music: both a beginner and a maestro can play the same score, but what you hear are two very different things. The same is true for artisans: only great Masters have the culture, wisdom and competence to interpret the project of a designer, for instance, and transform it into a beautiful object. Interpreting means understanding: fundamental to turning talent into a profession. What can we learn from past Masters? If we consider the magnificent objects crafted in the past, we can understand how the artisans were in dialogue with their commissioners or clients. There was mutual understanding. Artisans were pioneers, always trying to invent something new or bring a technique to perfection to fulfil their own wishes, but also to surprise their clients. This is a very human and precious heritage that we have to learn and treasure: to listen, to understand, to respect, to invest in something awesome that will break new ground. In a world of swiftly changing demands and rapid obsolescence, how can 'traditional' crafts survive? The real enemy of crafts is not technology. Technology is an instrument. It can help artisans communicate in a more efficient way. The real threat is represented by ignorance. This is why we have to work on the cultural aspect of artisanship. There will always be, the desire for something that will last, something that human hands can do better than any machine. Fine craftsmanship certainly represents a competitive advantage for many economies: master craftsmen are rare and precious. We have to invest in skills that automation cannot substitute, and crafts are a perfect representation of these skills. We have to make sure that artisans are always visible, understood, represented. What role can training providers and policymakers play in supporting traditional crafts?

Led by employers, business associations, trade unions and other social partners, it is one of eight sector-speciic committees in the Netherlands, working to anticipate skills needs and align education and training. With more than 17 million mouths to feed in the Netherlands, food is big business. The 4,300+ food retailers are turning over €36 billion a year, says Jules, who has more than 20 years’ sector experience. And there’s a new trend emerging - online shopping. In order to bring shoppers back through the doors, retailers are reinventing the in-store experience, combining hospitality and ine-dining dining with a workforce of increasingly specialised foodies. CBL’s own member-led Educational Committee, helps to feed suggestions for curricular improvements, aligned with their projections. But upskilling a future workforce means upskilling teachers too. CBL is addressing this through its network of Food Ambassadors – a coalition of teachers with a taste for new knowledge and insight which they receive through practical, innovative in-store experiences, shopping excursions and trend updates. Skills anticipating and matching – Dutch-style! The Sector Committees in the Netherlands work closely with the national public agency overseeing vocational education and training - SBB. Governed by social partners, the agency produces up-to-date labour market information, strengthens business-education links, standardises vocational qualiications, including emerging sectors, and in-line with the European Qualiications Framework, and accredits companies that offer quality work- based learning and apprenticeships. Discovering the SBB approach was part of a two-day peer-learning visit by a Moldovan Delegation working to develop Sectoral Skills Councils. The ETF has been assisting Moldova with labour market and skills’ trend analysis, preparing sectoral reports and the overall strengthening the capacity of committee members. This year the Moldovans are taking the lead, currently preparing reports for the agriculture and food, IT and communication, transport and road infrastructure and trade sectors. The study visit was an opportunity to share updates and approaches with the Dutch sectoral committees. Anna Gherganova from the Moldovan Ministry of Education, Culture and Research Development, says the peer-learning visit highlights the important role of employers in sectoral committees. ‘We want to have employers more involved and we are working towards this. We need companies to be part of these Sectoral Committees and to be a voice. Our goal, looking forward, is to have the six Sectoral Committees that function well, and for them to be a discussion platform in the sector involving many companies.’ PRACTICE AREAS PROJECTS & CAMPAIGNS REGIONS & COUNTRIES PUBLICATIONS & RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT  Did you like this article?

The two-day conference - which includes delegate visits to three vocational schools in Albania - is the third regional seminar of the European Alliance for Apprenticeships for EU candidate countries. It aims to support and encourage vocational training stakeholders to improve apprenticeships and work-based learning programmes as a key plank of skills training policy and provision. Opening the conference, Dajna Sorensen, deputy minister at Albania's Ministry of Finance and Economy, said her country was now seeing the results of ""two decades of working on the biggest challenge - the weak links between vocational training providers and the private sector."" Major reforms in education and training in Albania led to the adoption in 2014 of a National Employment and Skills Strategy, which was the main policy document guiding the development of the country's VET system. ""Ultimately the objective is to ensure a relevant and quality VET system,"" the deputy minister said. ""We want to motivate the private sector to become close partners with vocational training providers - this is a central goal of the reforms."" The policy was already bearing fruit, with ""relatively good momentum"" in vocational training provision in Albania and increased awareness of and interest in vocational training among young people, which demonstrated by an PinRcArCeTaIsCeE iAnReEnArSolmPeRnOtJiEnCVTSET&, CdAeMspPiAteIGdNeSclinRiEnGgIOnNuSm&bCeOrsUNTRIES of young people in the school age demographic, she PaUdBdLeIdCA. TIONS & RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT Cesare Onestini, the ETF's director, noted that the conference demonstrated an ""increased interest"" in work- based learning across EU member states and candidate countries. ""All five candidate countries have chosen work-based learning as a mid term deliverable,"" he said, referring to the 2015 Riga Declaration on mid-term aims for the development of education and training across the EU until 2020. The Riga Declaration emphasises the importance of apprenticeships in preparing young people for the labour market, stating that work-based learning should be promoted ""in all its forms, with special attention to apprenticeships, by involving social partners, companies, chambers and VET providers, as well as by stimulating innovation and entrepreneurship."" The ETF was, Mr Onestini added, ""fully committed to continue supporting EAfAnetworking in the candidate countries - there are already plans for future seminars."" Olga-Luisa Anghelakis, of the EU Delegation, Albania, noted that ""networking and exchange of best practices between member and candidate countries"" was an example of what the EU could build and foster. The EU had allocated more than €50 million to the Albanian skills and training sector over the past decade, she added. Ines Mucostepa, Secretary General of Albania's Union of Chambers of Commerce and Industry said that 36% of Albanian companies say they face difficulties recruiting because ""the workforce does not have the required skills."" These realities are refected in the government's focus on putting vocational education and training at the top of national education priorities, with a target of ensuring a quarter of all students are enrolled in VET by 2020.

To mark United Nation’s Micro-, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Day, 27 June, we revisit the ETF Award Winning 'Export Academy' in Lithuania, which is helping SMEs get the skills they need to go global. Economic reforms have helped make Lithuania an attractive place to do business and foster an innovative environment for start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises . Assisting businesses to reach new markets and boost exports, which account for one third of the country’s GDP, is the focus of the Export Academy, an initiative of the national business development agency, Enterprise Lithuania. The Export Academy training programme has been recognised by the European Training Foundation as an example of good practice in skills development to support the internationalisation of SMEs in its partner countries surrounding the European Union. This is a key pillar of the Small Business Act for Europe . Jurgita Butkeviciene, Director of Enterprise Lithuania, says learning and training is essential to support national export growth. ‘Companies should know how to meet partners, how to produce good products and set the right price.

Prakseda Balkeviciute, Head of Marketing at Pusku Pusku, a leading beanbag manufacturer, says she gained professional export management skills. ‘After the training I had a lot of job offers!’ Justinas Bielskis, Sales Manager at Stansefabrikken Automotive, which specialises in automatic welding, is more conident at business and sales meetings. ‘I was successful in closing a business deal worth €2 million, which is a pretty good result!’ Growing through good practice Identifying and recognising good practice helps policymakers, business and training providers share knowledge and know-how, prompting further development. To support this, the ETF launched two new good practice calls, covering training for the internationalisation of SMEs and entrepreneurial learning as a key competence. Along with women’s and youth entrepreneurship, these areas form the human capital dimension of the SBA. For more information, visit the ETF’s YouTube channel here.

The assessment was presented to representatives of government, VET providers, social partners, employment services and civil society in Podgorica, Montenegro, on 4 October, at an event co-organised by the European Union Delegation to Montenegro, the ETF and the Montenegrin Ministry of Education. National stakeholders, together with experts from the ETF, the EU and other donors, took stock of the findings and exchanged views on the strengths and areas for improvement of the country’s vocational education and training system. In response, national stakeholders committed to taking a more systematic and in-depth approach to VET governance and financing with a focus on moving towards a more holistic and result-oriented approach and enhancing private sector engagement. They also agreed to consider per capita funding as a more effective way of financing VET. The assessment of the governance and financing of the country’s VET strategy was based on a methodology developed by the ETF at the request of the European Commission. It was being trialled for the first time in Montenegro prior to its roll-out to other countries. Christophe Masson of the European Commission praised Montenegro for being a pioneer in successfully addressing the highly sensitive issues of governance and financing. “We could have failed“, he said, “but this did not happen. You can be proud”. While stakeholders take an active interest in VET policy from design to implementation, the assessment highlighted the need for better inter-ministerial coordination, more active participation of business and civil society, more school autonomy and new resource allocation mechanisms, such as per-capita funding. Better governance requires a shared monitoring and evaluation framework.

The EU has earmarked an additional €10.5 million in 2017/2018 for education, employment and other social sectors. While stressing the ETF’s commitment to support Montenegro’s policy response to the assessment findings, in cooperation with the EU Delegation, Ms Carmo Gomes, Head of the ETF’s Country Intelligence Unit, proposed to showcase the Montenegrin Government’s boldness in tackling the sensitive issue of governance and financing at the South Eastern Europe and Turkey Ministerial Meeting on VET.

But in a globalised world, we must work together to create solutions that are equitable, effective, and sustainable. The common thread for all countries is the crucial role of education and training in enabling them to develop and thrive.” More than 300 delegates from 50 countries heard from three European Commissioners, and speakers from the countries where the ETF works, as well as European Union member states, and international organisations. Nearly 5,000 unique viewers followed the proceedings via the ETF live stream and on Facebook. There was agreement that while we can’t predict the future, we can’t afford to wait for it to happen. Action is needed to realise the opportunities that transformation brings. Discussions focused on drivers of the rapid changes in the world of work, from identifying competitive skills and empowering teachers and trainers, to building meaningful public-private partnerships and harnessing emerging technologies. Conclusions included calls for bold leadership at all levels, more inclusive partnerships and a commitment to innovative policy making, so that countries can actively shape their futures.  Did you like this article?

Since then, ETF staff have been busy working with government oficials, the private sector and the education and training community to determine progress since the last assessment in 2014. Results will be published later in 2018. 3D-Perspective The focus of this round of the SBA assessments is threefold: how entrepreneurship is being promoted in secondary education ; and training for women’s entrepreneurship; and skills to support SME internationalisation. The ETF is actively promoting the new European Entrepreneurship Competence Framework which features in the assessment framework. EntreComp is a tool for policymakers, curriculum specialists and teachers to develop the entrepreneurial potential of children, students and adults through teaching and learning. Speaking at a workshop in Cairo, which closes the regional assessment drive on February 15, the ETF’s Anthony Gribben said the biggest challenge this round has been to determine progress on entrepreneurship as a key competence. ‘We are pleased to see strategic piloting of the key competence in Luxor region,’ says Gribben. ‘Road-test well before mainstreaming,' he advised. Meanwhile, the ETF has just kicked off the a next series of SBA assessments in the pre-accession region with results to be published late 2018. The end of year also sees the launch of the next SBA assessment cycle in the EU’s Eastern Partnership region, continuing into 2019. * This designation shall not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and is PwRAitChToICuEtApRErAeSjudPiRcOeJEtoCTtSh&eCiAnMdPiAvIiGdNuSalRpEoGsIOitNiSo&nCoOfUNTRIES the Member States on this issue.

For the first time ever in the Tunisian vocational education and training system, the Forum was live- streamed to a network of nine vocational centres as well as to the ETF’s headquarters to over 200 remote participants. In keeping with the future-looking spirit the forum, Mr Onestini delivered this message by video link. The web streaming is available here . The Forum, organised by the Tunisian Ministry of Vocational Training and Employment with the support of the ETF, brought together trainers, students and policy makers to share the results of an ongoing project aimed at promoting the entrepreneurial spirit among students in the country’s vocational schools. Initiated in 2015, and inspired by the European Union’s reference framework for entrepreneurial competences , the project is now in its fourth year. Following development and piloting phases, the challenge is now to scale up the achievements at national level. The highlight of the Forum was the presentation of a trainer-training toolkit developed by teachers and soon to be available on the ETF website. The toolkit helps trainers stimulate the entrepreneurial mind-set in students through innovative pedagogical approaches, which stimulate action, creativity and problem solving. As Mr Khaled Raouani, representing newly appointed Minister Ms Saida Ounissi, pointed out, this ETF supported initiative is part of the efforts of the Tunisian Ministry of Vocational Training and Employment to improve youth employability and active citizenship. Mr Onestini confirmed the continuing support of ETF for this activity and promised to bring the recommendations of the Forum to the attention of the European Commission and the EU Delegation in Tunis to inspire future support initiatives.

In March, the European Commission appointed Joost Korte as Director-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion. As part of his new role, Mr Korte is Chairing the ETF’s Governing Board. With a background in law, Mr Korte has occupied an impressive range of high level positions in the European Commission, covering agriculture, external relations, trade and institutional affairs. Live&Learn caught up with Mr Korte to learn more. Building a fairer and more social Europe is a strategic focus of the Juncker Commission. What does this mean concretely?

Building a fairer and more social Union is a priority for this Commission. This means delivering social rights for citizens. The European Social Model has been a success story, but this is not a given and requires reinforcement for today’s realities. We need to make sure economic and social progress continue to go hand in hand. The European Pillar of Social Rights is designed as a compass for renewed convergence towards better working and living conditions. The 20 principles and rights enshrined in the Pillar seek to ensure workers have the right to fair treatment and equal opportunities regarding access to labour market, working conditions and social protection. With the 4th industrial revolution underway, skills and education are at the forefront of political agendas around the globe. How can vocational education and training help to meet future skills demands? Rapid technological developments, globalisation, and new business models are disrupting traditional forms of work organisation and employer-employee relations in a fundamental way. Demographic ageing and migration also have an impact on skills and diversity. Education and training systems have been relatively slow in adapting. VET is the education sector closest to the labour market and is expected to respond to current and future skills demands. In order to do so, changes are required in how content is designed, delivered, and organised. In my view, VET curricula will need to address two objectives: first, to enable employability of graduates and, second, to equip people with the means for lifelong adaptability, meaning, a high-level of basic skills, including digital skills and transversal competences, including a career management competence and transitions. We may see a future shift from narrow occupation-specific curricula to broader qualifications corresponding to groups of occupations. We will probably experience even more vocational education at higher qualification levels as a response to growing skills requirements. Vocational education systems will be expected to shorten their reaction time in the face of a rapidly changing environment. This can be done for instance via modularisation or shorter just-in-time vocational programmes, very often targeting up-skilling and re-skilling of the adult population. Last but not least, we need to have solid skills anticipation and data systems in place analysing labour market outcomes for vocational graduates to order to make informed policy decisions. Often the strength of vocational education systems depends on the involvement and buy- in of employers. This is why the Commission remains engaged in efforts to improve the quality of social dialogue not only within the EU, but also in the countries with which the PERTAFCiTsICenE gAaRgEiAnSg. PROJECTS & CAMPAIGNS REGIONS & COUNTRIES How will the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights be put into action? PUBLICATIONS & RESOURCES NEWSROOM & EVENTS ABOUT Delivering the European Pillar of Social Rights is fundamentally a joint endeavour. EU institutions, Member States, public authorities, social partners and civil society organisations at all levels have a crucial role to play in line with their competences. More recently, the Social Fairness Package adopted by the Commission proposes concrete new initiatives to further deliver on the European Pillar of Social Rights. It includes a proposal for a European Labour Authority, to make sure that EU rules on cross-border labour mobility and social security coordination are enforced in an equitable, simple and effective way. You previously held the position of Deputy Director-General for enlargement when Croatia joined the EU. In your experience, what are the elements for a successful accession process? In the past year, in the EU we have really reaffirmed our commitment to a credible enlargement perspective for the Western Balkans. Now, it is important that the enlargement countries strengthen their efforts towards achieving real progress and carry out the necessary political and socio-economic reforms. It is important to progress with accession negotiations, but also to focus on structural reforms to improve the economic and social situation of the citizens of the region. Reforming national policies to support well-functioning and adaptable economies should not be seen as an external requirement, but a goal for improving people’s lives. A key element for success is also to make better use of available means of EU support. This includes financial means, but also technical assistance, learning exchanges and participation in available EU structures and programmes. Serbia and Montenegro could join the EU within a 2025 perspective. How do you see the role of the ETF in supporting this process? What can other candidate countries learn? The ETF has an extremely important and valuable role in supporting the enlargement process. One of the six fagship initiatives set out in the ‘Credible enlargement perspective for the Western Balkans,’ communication supports socio-economic development, including enhanced support for education, in particular VET and skills. Here, the ETF has a concrete role, including in establishing the pilot mobility scheme in vocational education and training. Also, in the context of the economic governance process with the enlargement countries, there is a persistent need to address the skills mismatch and align the provision of VET with the labour market. The ETF’s international conference in November will look at how transitioning countries are addressing the technological revolution from a skills perspective. How can the EU help to ensure these countries realise their potential and don’t get left behind?

The EU can help transitioning countries by being a vehicle for learning, sharing of information, and co-operation. It can help through projects that support links between education, training and work to create a labour market of people with the right skills, the necessary information, and the right opportunities. In the light of high youth unemployment rates in many transitioning countries, promoting the employability of young people is clearly a key priority. We are now embarking on projects to explore the digitalisation of qualification diplomas, and offering modern online career management tools like Europass. I hope that the EU can help transitioning countries by sharing and offering inspiration on how the technological revolution can be used to highlight and value skills more than ever.

Tatiana Gherstega leads the recently established NQF Department, which is tasked with developing the national qualifications framework in collaboration with social partners and other stakeholders. ‘The ETF has supported us from day 1! For example with the drafting of the legislation,' she says. ‘We have since approved the qualiications methodology and internal regulations for the functioning of the department, and we are now working on the concept of a national register for qualiications. We have had the expertise, opinions and consultancy of the ETF experts on all these issues along the way!’ Moldova is working to align its NQF with the EQF, the EU’s translation device to help make national qualifications more readable across borders. ‘The NQF and the EQF are perfectly compatible,' Tatiana says. ‘And we want to take the following two years to demonstrate this.’ Cristina Denita-Boto oversees the Lifelong Learning Department. ‘The NQF must provide qualiications achieved through non-formal and informal learning, and this is where we come in,’ she explains. ‘Because we have lacked a national approach, we didn’t have this type of opportunity to offer to the workers in the country. In particular, this development will help people who didn’t have the chance to go to school and those who worked abroad to certiicate their competences to go for a new job and a new start. The NQF will help us to provide better public services overall for people who really need it.’ Setting up Sectoral Councils was another topic covered during the three-day learning workshop. Led by employers, business associations, trade unions and other social partners, the councils are gathering sector-specific labour market information to better anticipate and PaRdAdCrTeIsCsEsAkRillEsAmS ismPRaOtcJhEC.

Vera Erhan leads the Institutional Management Department, which advises the ministry on financial issues. While not directly involved in the NQF development she says the training has been very useful. ‘I am sure that I can use the information, good practices and practical exercises in my work, including cross- collaboration with other departments to further develop policy.’ Tatiana Gherstega concurred saying the large and diverse amount of information has been ‘somewhat mind- blowing.’ ‘Everything we have heard is extremely important for our activities. This training has allowed us to better understand obstacles we have already encountered and to think of possible solutions to solve them!’ ETF expert Carmo Gomes said it was a pleasure to host the highly committed group working intensively through the comprehensive programme. ‘This is with any doubt a rewarding experience and a good example of how the ETF is working together with its partner countries.’ Next Steps Possible peer-learning and knowledge-sharing from neighbouring countries Ukraine and Georgia, which are facing similar implementation challenges.

The forum brought together representatives of education and business from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and experts from the ETF, the EU, the Member States and other partner countries to share knowledge and experience about how to implement the work-based learning in their vocational education and training systems. Integration of worked-based learning into vocational education Spurred by the well-documented advantages of work- based learning in improving employability, reducing youth unemployment and boosting productivity in enterprises, the seven countries have been working together for four years in this topic. The European Training Foundation has been supporting them though peer- learning and capacity building in moving from predominantly schools-based systems toward vocational education with workplace learning integrated. As Catalin Gherman, Deputy Head of Cooperation at the EU Delegation to Georgia, pointed out ‘Vocational education and training is a very complicated business by the nature of the topic and the variety of actions and actors that need to work together.’ The group looked in depth at the experience of several EU and non-EU countries in establishing development units in its vocational schools to network with business, organising work placements for students and in training and certifying in-company trainers.

The prize was awarded by ETF Director, Cesare Onestini, in the presence of the EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, Marianne Thyssen. Vienna, 8 November 2018 – In Subotica, a town in western Serbia, the students of the School of Chemical Technology acquire entrepreneurial competences by setting up real companies. Developing businesses from the initial idea right up to actually selling products in their local community at competitive prices, students work on a variety of topics ranging from chemicals, to textiles and baked goods. A best practice in the EU neighbourhood The school, which selected the production of liquid soap as a success story, was awarded by the European Training Foundation as an example of best practice in the development of entrepreneurship as a key competence. Emerging as best among candidates from 8 countries, the Serbian school proved outstanding in applying the EU’s Entrepreneurship competence framework , a tool which promotes the entrepreneurial mindset of students. The prize was given by ETF Director, Cesare Onestini in the presence of EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, Marianne Thyssen, on the occasion of an award ceremony taking place in Vienna on 8 November, during the European Vocational Skills Week. “This year’s European Vocational Skills Week shows again that bringing together the education and the employment sectors is the best way forward - not only within the EU but also in its neighbouring countries”, said Marianne Thyssen, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility. “I congratulate the School of Chemical Technology of Subotica for having succeeded in transforming the EU’s EntreComp model into outstanding learning paths focusing on entrepreneurial skills: preparing students through concrete experience is key to providing the right skills to match labour market needs, in the EU and beyond”. “To meet the demands of fast-changing economies and respond to the impact of technology on labour markets, education providers need to put key competences at the heart of training activities”, said Cesare Onestini, ETF Director. “This is true for the EU and just as relevant for transition and developing countries. Young people today are aware that they need to acquire a broad range of skills to build their own future, including adaptability and entrepreneurship. ETF supports reforms efforts and innovation in the education and training sector in the EU’s neighbouring countries. This award is one great example of what can be achieved with dedication and vision. ETF is proud to support the award, now in its third edition”.

As a consequence, beyond learning to become chemical lab technicians, they acquire entrepreneurial skills such as vision, planning, creativity and sustainable thinking. “We decided to invest in entrepreneurship as a key competence for our students to make them more competitive in the job market”, said school Director, Nikola Matković. “This method is about modernising the teaching process where students have an active and central role”, added Jadranka Vojnić Purčar, Practical learning coordinator in the school, “By taking responsibility, students develop competences such as identifying opportunities, taking initiative, integrity and ethics”. “When we sold the liquid soap in the local store I felt very proud because it was something that we had made”, said Milica, 16, student. A school inspired by the EU’s drive in entrepreneurial skills The school is inspired by EntreComp, an EU tool for building entrepreneurial mindsets. The school has set concrete learning outcomes in the field of entrepreneurial skills development. Moreover, as far as teaching methodologies are concerned, it has put strong emphasis on self-directed learning, learning-by-doing and acquiring entrepreneurial experience by working on a school-based business. Finally, it proved to be a leader in the field of local business eco-system integration, by putting strong emphasis on environmental protection. The discussion on competences will continue in Turin, Italy, on 21-22 November during the ‘Skills for the Future: Managing Transition’ conference – an event organized by the European Training Foundation which will put a spotlight on the skills needed to prepare people for the job market in a rapidly changing world.

Good governance in vocational education and training At the intersection of education, training, social, economic and labour-market policies, vocational education and skills is a complex policy area. There are a multiplicity of private and public sector stakeholders involved - from ministries and national agencies, to employers, unions, VET institutions, teachers and trainers and other non-state partners. The ETF works with its 29 partner countries to map the different actors, transparency and clarity of their respective roles and responsibilities, and how they coordinate and cooperate - the so-called institutional arrangements. Siria Taurelli says vocational education and skills reform provides an opening for reviewing governance arrangements. ‘A relevant lesson we have learned, from almost 25 years working with transitioning countries, is that the role of the actors, mandates and mechanisms should adjust to the new policy goals. Otherwise moving from the policy design to the implementation stage can prove difficult.’ More info The 2018 Congress of the International Institute of Administrative Sciences website here.  Did you like this article?
