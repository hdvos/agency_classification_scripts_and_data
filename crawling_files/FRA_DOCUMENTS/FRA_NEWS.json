This report underlines our joint commitment and showcases the practical steps we are taking to end this shameful and illegal practice.\u201d During the Eurojust Presidency of the JHAAN, for the first time, a compendium was made of all different actions taken by CEPOL, EASO, EIGE, eu-LISA, Eurojust, Europol, FRA and Frontex, to reach out to victims of human trafficking at all stages of prevention, investigations, operations and legal proceedings. The initiative is a concrete result following the Joint Statement of commitment to work together against trafficking in human beings , signed in 2018. The JHAAN report of today aims to make Member States more aware of the Agencies\u2019 potential in helping the early identification and protection of victims. Furthermore, it encourages them to cooperate closely with the Agencies involved in this area and to build on their expertise. The report responds to one of the key actions of the EU Strategy on Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings 2021-2025. The report is the result of a questionnaire sent to all agencies and the outcome of a meeting of JHAAN experts, hosted by Eurojust in June this year. It builds on two important strands in the process of investigating criminal networks involved in human trafficking, namely the early identification of victims and measures and actions for their protection. FRA supports EU\u00a0Member States respect the fundamental rights of all trafficked victims, including children. Based on information collected, it offers advice on how to improve the condition of victims. It also assesses and provides guidance on the early identification of trafficked victims at the EU borders. This includes training on victims\u2019 rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2021/eu-agencies-present-first-full-overview-actions-detect-and-protect-victims-human"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0002", "date": "2021-10-15", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "New Fundamental Rights Charter e-learning courses", "text": "This tool for judges offers step-by-step guidance on the scope of the Charter and key elements for judgements.

They were all united by one ambition \u2013 to build a vision of hope. And according to Michael O\u2019Flaherty, Director of the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights and Forum Chair, they delivered. \u201cThe human rights community is a strong community, it is a large passionate, committed and determined group of people across the world and together we can make a difference,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Flaherty in his closing speech. The many discussions and exchanges during the Forum have made him believe that there is a reason to remain hopeful. \u201cI have a sense that my hope for a future built on respect for human rights is entirely justified,\u201d he added. In his closing remarks, Director O\u2019Flaherty identified five main takeaways: WAKE UP \u2013 we need to wake up from our complacency and acknowledge that no system or organisation is permanent and infallible, guaranteed to live into the ever future. The eroding of the whole system of human rights protection can happen without us even noticing it. JOIN UP \u2013 we need to bring everybody who cares about human rights to engage and work with each other on our common concerns. And bring those who are normally excluded from decision making into the discussions. We have to develop a mutual literacy, a vocabulary to speak to each other. WISE UP \u2013 we have to acknowledge the skills of the adversary and be equally smart. We need to improve our tools, get better at data gathering and making a business case for our claims. Smart communication is about finding new and different voices to deliver the message, as do music and drama \u2013 highly effective in delivering human rights messages. CATCH UP \u2013 it is imperative that we meaningfully engage with the digital world and new technologies, especially artificial intelligence. We need to acknowledge the complexity at the technical levels, at the legal levels and the ethical levels. LISTEN UP \u2013 we need to listen and engage the voices of young people; they need to be at heart of our discussions. This requires that we stop working for people and that we always insist on working with people. They must be our partners in\u00a0our effort for the promotion and the protection of human rights. Building on these takeaways, we can chart a new way together towards a better protection of fundamental rights in Europe.

Doing so can have an invigorating effect, boosting confidence in local government and fostering public debates that ultimately help make fairer societies for all,\u201d said FRA Director Michael O\u2019Flaherty. Vienna, a city that has been a Human Rights City for six years, has helped to develop the new Framework. Allowing people to have their say about the city developments is high on their agenda. \u201cWe are a Human Rights City because we integrate human rights principles in our daily work. We want to make people\u2019s voices heard and get them involved in the life of our city,\u201d explains Christoph Wiederkehr, Deputy Mayor of Vienna, Austria. As part of this process, Vienna has also created a human rights office led by Shams Asadi, the Human Rights Commissioner. \u201cBeing a Human Rights City is also a bottom-up movement. We take opinions from the ground very seriously,\u201d explains Asadi. \u201cA lot of her work is about involving people in the city-decision making. Creating a culture of human rights is essential as well as involving all in the society, in particular the young people,\u201d says Asadi. The new Framework is designed to encourage others to follow the lead. It consists of three main elements: foundations, structures and tools. These elements formalise a city\u2019s commitment to fulfil human rights, provide for mechanisms and bodies that integrate this commitment into the city\u2019s work, and offer methods and resources that help implement a human-rights based approach in daily activities. Apart from that, it also aims to strengthen the links between cities and and facilitate peer exchange and learning. \u201cWorking with other Human Right Cities is a great source of inspiration. The new Framework for Human Rights Cities will help us strengthen our cooperation and encourage the exchange of best practices between cities. This will benefit our citizens and possibly inspire and encourage other cities to join,\u201d said Linda Voortman, Co-Mayor of Utrecht, the Netherlands.

EU countries need to take care no one is left behind by guaranteeing equitable access to vaccines throughout all stages of national campaigns.\u201d FRA\u2019s latest \u2018Coronavirus pandemic in the EU \u2013 fundamental rights implications\u2019 bulletin focuses on equal access to vaccines from planning to rollout. It reveals how countries used varied channels and media to reach diverse groups, including so-called \u2018hard-to-reach\u2019 groups. Vaccination registration was typically offered both online and offline to bridge digital divides and to make it easily accessible to all. Similarly, many countries established mobile vaccination services. This allowed older people, people in remote areas, the homeless or those with reduced mobility to get vaccinated. But the bulletin also identifies gaps in vaccine strategies and rollout that need addressing: Prioritisation \u2013 the focus on older people, those with medical conditions and key workers sometimes overlooked other at-risk groups. Only one third of EU countries class detainees as a priority group despite an increased risk of infection due to crowded living conditions. Not all EU countries adhere to international guidance on prioritising vulnerable groups, such as Roma and Travellers, homeless people, or those with drug dependencies. Queue jumping \u2013 allegations of non-priority people receiving vaccines in some Member States undermine trust in the fairness of national strategies. Access \u2013 prisoners, homeless people, asylum seekers and irregular migrants, who are often not covered by national health schemes, face difficulties accessing vaccines. But some countries waive the formal requirement of having a social security number to get vaccinated. Information \u2013 countries rarely provide accessible information for people with disabilities or in different languages for those who do not speak the national language well, like migrants or ethnic minorities. The bulletin highlights encouraging progress in vaccinating people across the EU. However, it also draws attention to challenges that remain to ensure there is fair and equal access to vaccines that respects international guidance. Vaccine equity will lessen the economic and social cost of the pandemic and protect the social rights of those most at need.

This year, in line with the IDAHOBIT theme, we stand \"Together: Resisting, Supporting, Healing!\u201d - a powerful message as we continue to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic, which has increased the vulnerability of LGBTIQ+ persons. COVID-19 has exposed existing gaps of equality and exacerbated existing vulnerabilities, including bias and social stigma, discrimination, economic impact, the risk of violence and domestic parental violence, and it has reduced access to gender-affirming health services. We will continue to shed light on these and other injustices, and will continue advocating for everyone, regardless of who they are or whom they love, to be protected and included in the global response to the pandemic. We hope that you will join our efforts, throughout the year, to make Vienna\u2019s diplomatic community a more inclusive community for all. We must stand united in celebrating diversity and the resilience of the LGBTQI+ community and in defending human rights, inclusiveness and justice. In many countries, LGBTIQ+ persons continue to suffer bullying, discrimination, and violence, often with deadly consequences. In 70 countries, there are laws that criminalise private, consensual\u00a0 relations between adults of the same sex. We remain alarmed at these severely inhumane measures. It is our belief that nobody should face discrimination because of who they are or who they love. \u00a0We all benefit from living in more tolerant and inclusive societies.. We are committed to promoting and protecting the rights of LGBTIQ+ persons. They must be accorded the same dignity, respect, and rights as all other citizens. We will continue to work through our Embassies and through International Organisations, including, where relevant, the UN, Council of Europe, European Institutions, the OSCE, the Organization of American States (OAS), Mercosur (Reunion de Altas Autoridades sobre Derechos Humanos) and the Commonwealth, to promote tolerance and non-discrimination against LGBTIQ+ persons and to address discriminatory laws, including those that criminalise homosexuality. We also wish to pay homage to the courageous advocacy efforts carried out by human rights defenders, activists, journalists, media workers and civil society organisations to raise awareness about the issues affecting LGBTIQ+ persons and human rights violations they may face. We invite you to support our goals, and to follow our social media coverage on Twitter and Instagram via #DiplomatsForEquality. \u00a0", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2021/diplomats-equality-support-idahobit-2021"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0068", "date": "2021-05-17", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "A Union of Equality for pride not prejudice", "text": "Last year, FRA published findings from the largest ever survey on hate crime and discrimination against LGBTI people. More LGBTI people are now open about who they are. But fear, violence and discrimination remain high. Two in five respondents say they were harassed the year before the survey. One in five feels discriminated against at work. In some countries, over 70% of respondents say society is more tolerant now than it was five years ago. But in others, up to 68% say it is less. And this was before the COVID-19 pandemic struck. Studies in Member States carried out during the pandemic show a higher negative impact on the mental health of LGBTI people than among the general population. There was also an increase in domestic violence, particularly against young LGBTI people in lockdown. Access to employment and healthcare became more difficult. A greater than average rate of LGBTI people are unemployed and in precarious jobs. Many experienced heightened stigma as a result of the virus and obstacles when seeking healthcare. In November 2020, the EU rolled out its first-ever Strategy for lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, non-binary, intersex and queer (LGBTIQ) equality. It aims to address the inequalities and challenges LGBTIQ people face through targeted actions for the next five years. The strategy particularly focuses on tackling discrimination, ensuring safety and building inclusive societies. This should enable the EU and its Member States to take the necessary steps to protect the fundamental rights of all LGBTIQ people. Only when Member States ensure equality and respect for fundamental rights, will LGBTIQ people be able to be themselves and live in dignity.\u00a0", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2021/union-equality-pride-not-prejudice"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0069", "date": "2021-05-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "CEPOL assesses training needs on IT system interoperability", "text": "FRA contributed with fundamental rights expertise in the discussions.

The EU adopted the two directives in 2000 for Member States to put into practice. Drawing on substantial FRA evidence into experiences of discrimination and victimisation, the Opinion points to persistent inequalities in all relevant areas of life \u2013 from employment to health and housing. Members of many population groups, protected by legislation, still too often fall victim to discrimination. They often do not report their experiences of discrimination. This includes members of ethnic and religious minorities, immigrants and their descendants, LGBTI people, and people with disabilities. Age and gender discrimination also remain an issue. In addition, gaps in collecting equality data persist. This hampers the effective monitoring of how Member States apply the equality directives. To better protect people against unequal treatment, the EU and its Member States need to: better enforce anti-discrimination legislation; take positive action to foster equal treatment; close gaps in protecting against discrimination on various grounds and in different areas of life; establish safeguards to protect against the potential discriminatory impact in the use of algorithms and artificial intelligence; tackle widescale under-reporting through helping victims to easily report discrimination to competent bodies and organisations, particularly national equality bodies; improve rights awareness among groups at risk of discrimination; provide equality bodies with the necessary human, technical and financial resources, and mandates to support victims of discrimination and promote equal treatment; systematically collect reliable, valid, and comparable equality data broken down by different grounds to guide non-discrimination policies; fully respect EU data protection rules in collecting equality data. The FRA\u00a0Opinion aims at assisting the EU and its Member States improve protection against discrimination and foster equal treatment. This includes implementing and monitoring EU strategies and action plans to build a Union of Equality. These cover such areas as anti-racism, gender equality, LGBTI equality, the rights of people with disabilities, as well as Roma equality, inclusion and participation.

In general, the longer the stay in such centres, the more difficult it becomes to uphold dignified reception conditions set out in EU law. Overcrowding is one of the key hurdle to dignified stays. In the meetings with the national and local stakeholders, he further pointed to persisting challenges in respecting fundamental rights of people arriving in the EU as well as local residents. While welcoming the establishment of a tracing and protection mechanism for unaccompanied children, he reiterated that the agency stands ready to support Greek authorities with its data and expertise in particular with regard to protection of vulnerable groups.

Already shoved to the margins of society they experienced still further deprivation, discrimination and harassment. \u201d said FRA Director Michael O\u2019Flaherty. \u201cOur governments must put Roma front and centre in efforts to build our \u2018new normal\u2019.\u201d The coronavirus pandemic further highlights how long-standing disparities have placed many Roma in an even more vulnerable position and increased prejudices. ODIHR\u2019s monitoring of the media portrayal of Roma in 2020 showed that hate speech increased sharply, with misinformation about Roma communities and their role during the pandemic also rising. \u201cThis is the time to pay more attention to vulnerable communities such as the\u00a0Roma and Sinti, whom\u00a0have\u00a0yet again been targeted and made\u00a0scapegoats for a situation\u00a0in which they have suffered\u00a0so much themselves,\u201d\u00a0said ODIHR Director Matteo Mecacci.\u00a0\u201cI call on governments to\u00a0increase efforts to counter prejudice against Roma and Sinti and support communities\u00a0that the pandemic continues to hit hard.\u201d Roma communities particularly suffered under the public health measures, as FRA\u2019s COVID-19 bulletins outline. In many countries, Roma children lack smart devices and internet access. This prevents them from participating in online learning and risks leaving them even further behind. Governments need to help Roma children to access remote learning and materials, as recommended by ODIHR in its report on the impact of COVID-19 on human rights. Even before the pandemic, many Roma and Travellers were without jobs or worked under precarious conditions. For example in 2019, 1 in 2 young Roma or Travellers aged 16\u201324 were not in employment, education or training in the six countries FRA surveyed. As governments restricted movement to stop the spread of the virus, many Roma, such as street vendors and travelling traders, could not work. In addition, working informally restricted access to social benefits. Successful engagement with Roma communities needs a twofold approach: on the one hand working to reduce poverty and combat racism and discrimination, while on the other hand supporting Roma empowerment and enabling members of the community to participate fully in public life. ODIHR\u2019s annual \u2018Nicolae Gheorghe\u2019 Roma Leadership Academy is one such initiative. It works closely with the Roma to increase their know-how and skills and maximise their policy and decision-making influence and impact. Nationally, governments need greater investments to address prejudices and antigypsyism, especially within public administrations. Countries need to engage directly and locally with Roma and Traveller communities making sure to also include Roma in elected positions as well as Roma civil society organisations. This would provide governments with reliable information, and enable the development of measures to end, or at least soften, the negative impact of lockdowns. The coronavirus pandemic placed many Roma in an even more vulnerable position than they were already in.

The Covid-19 pandemic not only cast a spotlight on the structural inequalities and discrimination in our societies, but has made them even worse, in Europe and beyond, as we see from this week\u2019s spate of shootings in the United States. We see new forms of inequality and discrimination, particularly in access to healthcare and vaccinations. There have been attacks against ethnic and religious minority groups, terrifying entire communities. Online hate speech spread widely and scapegoated specific groups such as migrants. The economic fallout of the pandemic has led to a rise in inequality, stigmatisation and hatred. To turn the tide on the vicious circle of racism, discrimination and poverty, greater efforts and closer cooperation are vital. \u201cLike the coronavirus, racism also mutated and new variants have developped during the pandemic. All political and other actors need a deep dive into current challenges in order to build a racism-free Europe and a racism-free world; they must address novel risks urgently,\u201d said ECRI\u2019s Chair Maria Marouda. \u201cMany believe that the current global health crisis provided them with a carte blanche for manifesting hostile attitudes towards specific groups and individuals on several grounds, which profoundly mirror the intersectional dimension of discrimination. This leads to greater social polarisation. We have to fight the battle by reaching out to victims of racism and racial discrimination and protecting those who are assisting them and by establishing solid legal and policy frameworks to make non-discrimination and inclusion a reality\u201d, she continued.\u00a0\u00a0 More than a year after its appearance, COVID-19 remains a serious global health and human rights challenge. It has touched all countries and, unfortunately, exacerbated the inequalities already faced by many minority and vulnerable groups, such as people of African descent, indigenous peoples, migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers. Indeed, its consequences have impacted the most vulnerable we should pay more attention to,\u201d said Yanduan Li, Chairperson of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD). \u201cStates should pursue their efforts to address the disparate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on minority and vulnerable groups with regard to access to education, health care services including to vaccines, employment, housing\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cEven before the pandemic, persistent racism and intolerance blighted the lives of many people across Europe. Covid-19 further exposed the divisions in our societies. Not one person is defined by a single trait; gender, age, economic and social standing all combine to multiply the impact of discrimination and exclusion,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Flaherty, Director of the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA). \u201cWe must work together with impacted people in building societies that strive to respect everyone\u2019s human rights in all their diversity. With targeted measures we can tackle racism in all its complexity.\u201d \u201cThe pandemic has had a particularly devastating impact on racial and ethnic minority communities, who have often met with prejudice and exclusion where they needed equal treatment and care,\u201d said ODIHR Director Matteo Mecacci. \u201cStates have a responsibility to protect vulnerable minorities by adopting policies that favour inclusion and counter discrimination at all levels, starting with public institutions and the education system. By both preventing and countering acts of racial discrimination and hate crimes societies become more inclusive and resilient in times of crisis.\u201d Since the beginning of the pandemic, FRA has regularly published bulletins on the fundamental rights implications of Covid-19 and the groups most at risk in the European Union. Its wide range of surveys regularly underscore widespread racial discrimination and intolerance that many people continue to face.

Young people and those with higher levels of education experienced more online fraud. This may be because they shop more frequently online. Online banking fraud\u00a0\u2013 nearly one in 10 (8%) experienced online banking or payment card fraud in the five years before the survey. Rates vary significantly between countries. This probably reflects national differences in the use of online banking and payment cards. Vulnerable groups \u2013 people with disabilities or serious health problems experience more fraud. Some 14% were victims of online banking or payment fraud compared with 6% of people without disabilities, in the five years before the survey. In addition, 36% of people with disabilities or serious health problems were victims of consumer fraud, compared with 23% without. Worry about fraud \u2013 around six in 10 people worry about online banking or payment card fraud (63%) or theft of personal items such as a mobile phone, wallet or purse (62%). Women, people with less education, the unemployed and those who struggle to make ends meet tend to worry more about crime. This can because crime affects these groups more, as it is more difficult for them to recover, financially and psychologically. FRA calls on EU countries to improve consumer protection and guarantee victims of fraud can access their rights. Countries should ensure that victims can report fraud easily, the police effectively investigate fraud, and vulnerable victims receive the support they need.

Too many experience harassment and violence. EU countries need to step up their efforts to better support women. We need to do much more to tackle violence against women and honour their rights. And we need to do it now,\u201d said FRA Director Michael O\u2019Flaherty. FRA\u2019s \u2018Crime, safety and victims\u2019 rights\u2019 report reveals that: Harassment - over one in four women (28%) were victims of harassment in the year before the survey. Women experience more sexual harassment than men and mostly in public. Violence \u2013 most often a family member or a relative (30%) attacks the woman, and in most cases in their home (35%). A high proportion of victims suffer from psychological after effects. Worry about crimes \u2013 to protect themselves, 83% of young women limit where they go or with whom they spend their time. Underreporting - over two out of three women (68%) did not report incidents of violence to the police. This confirms that official statistics on reported crime significantly underestimate the extent of violence against women. These figures corroborate the findings of FRA\u2019s 2012 violence against women survey. They also underpin why countries should offer better support to women. Such support should take into account the specific needs of women victims when it comes to legal sanctions against perpetrators, education and training for police officers as well as legal and healthcare professionals. Countries should also boost measures that seek to prevent violence against women. Campaigns that confront men\u2019s violence against women and educate men, who are mostly the perpetrators, are examples of how to provide preventative support. The EU Victims\u2019 Rights Directive and strategy offer a clear way forward to protect and empower victims. This ranges from training and guidance on how to identify and help victims to targeted support for women victims, including shelters and reporting mechanisms. The newly-established Victims\u2019 Rights Platform should further bolster efforts to guarantee the rights of women and better protect them from the widespread violence and harassment that continues to blight their lives.

It also looks at the situation of foreigners referred to by the EU as third-country nationals. Since the 2014 edition, EU law covering asylum, border management and immigration has changed significantly. This includes laws covering new large-scale EU IT systems to manage migration. This new version also contains developments in case law. The handbook will assist legal practitioners who are not specialists in asylum law to introduce them to the key issues. It will be useful for lawyers, judges, prosecutors, border guards, immigration officials, people who work with national authorities, non-governmental organisations and others who may deal with legal questions related to asylum. It seeks to raise awareness and improve knowledge of relevant standards set by the European Union and the Council of Europe, particularly through case law of the EU\u2019s Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights. Where relevant, it also refers to the European Social Charter, other Council of Europe instruments and international UN treaties related to asylum. The 10 chapters cover a range of issues. These include entering the EU, smart migration systems and their interoperability, detention, processing asylum claims, family life, forced returns, and meeting the specific needs of certain groups of people. The handbook is available in English and French as well as in German and Italian. Other language versions will follow in 2021. The first edition came out in 2013 followed by a second edition in 2014.

Many work in lower paid jobs, delivering food and parcels as people stay at home. Often they are in sectors at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19, providing care or sanitation. This can leave them more affected by and exposed to the virus. At the same time, forced displacement continues to rise. At the end of 2018, there were over 70\u00a0million forcibly displaced people worldwide, almost 26\u00a0million of them refugees. The pandemic made a difficult situation harder. It is not helped by geopolitical tensions and unease across Europe as most people suffer under the impact of the public health measures. There is also evidence of higher infection rates among migrants. Overcrowded accommodation with poor hygiene in reception centres, alongside limited access to healthcare, are likely to be contributing factors. It also makes it difficult to follow COVID-19 hygiene and physical distancing measures. Border restrictions resulted in difficulties to enter the EU. Reports of alleged pushbacks and violence at the borders rose. The fire in the Moria camp on the island of Lesvos in Greece exposed the difficulties the EU faces in accommodating thousands of asylum seekers and migrants. A new effort with strengthened collaboration between the EU and national authorities is underway to improve living conditions. Access to distance education for migrant children and employment support for migrant labourers working under unstable employment conditions are additional challenges. On 23 September, the European Commission published a new Pact on Migration and Asylum. It sets out a new approach to migration and asylum management in the EU. There is a stronger focus on border procedures, improved cooperation with the countries of origin and transit, migrant integration and return of those with no right to stay.\u00a0 Some countries also stepped up efforts with practical assistance. They committed to relocate unaccompanied children as thousands continue to live in unsuitable conditions after the Moria fire.

High rates of unemployment or poverty are common across Europe. Measures imposed to control the COVID-19 pandemic underlined many vulnerabilities. The vulnerability of national healthcare systems, and existing support for people with disabilities. COVID-19 measures affected many people with disabilities. They lost access to personal assistance due to restrictions of in-home services. Access to healthcare was also difficult. And physical distancing rules left many isolated as they could not receive visitors. We already have the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). The EU and all its Member States are parties to the Convention. They must thus honour the commitments made. It is proving to be a significant driver for change. A\u00a02015 FRA paper\u00a0underscored how it is a catalyst for wide-ranging legal and policy changes across the EU. It led to national disability action plans and strategies. It also drove some Member States to change their laws and policies to ensure people with disabilities had more autonomy choice and control over their own lives. At European level, we have also the\u00a0European Accessibility Act, the\u00a0Web Accessibility Directive. And next year should herald the new European Disability Strategy 2020-2030. This strategy should not only cover all provisions contained in the Convention. It should also mainstream disability rights across all relevant areas of EU law, policies and programmes. There are encouraging signs. The European Commission is involving organisations of people with disabilities as it shapes the new strategy. This ensures that issues that really matter to them are high on the EU's agenda. This should continue in the rollout of its implementation. The future will require significant change. Change to our infrastructure to ensure full accessibility to buildings, transport and digital services, for example. But also change to how we think and do things to take on board the perspectives of people with disabilities.

Loss of earnings and jobs are likely to provoke further harassment and violence. Economic dependency may lead some women to remain trapped in abusive relationships, unable to leave. FRA\u2019s EU-wide survey on violence against women shows that nearly 1 in 3 women who find it difficult to make ends meet experienced intimate partner violence. This compares with almost 1 in 5 women who do not struggle to make ends meet. Throughout the pandemic, many EU countries were quick to act. They established counselling support and sheltered victims in hotel rooms. At the same time, they launched awareness campaigns promoting hotline numbers. While this was welcomed, it also highlighted inadequacies that remain. The Council of Europe\u2019s landmark Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence is already in its sixth year. The EU said it will accede to it and 21\u00a0EU Member States have signed it. The others should follow suit. The Convention provides a clear roadmap on what the EU and its Member States need to do. It is a launchpad for further action to end this widespread human rights abuse. The European Commission\u2019s proposal to add violence against women on the list of EU crimes adds further weight to the drive to end such violence. It is now high time for governments to act. The police, justice and health sectors need to work together to prevent violence and support victims. This requires adequate resources and relevant training.

They continue to be vocal about today\u2019s issues from climate change to Black Lives Matter. Europe needs to channel this drive to improve our societies. It needs to ensure young people\u2019s right to be heard is adhered to and fully respected. Education can build on this. Education spreads tolerance and it feeds inclusion, as FRA\u2019s Fundamental Rights Survey shows. It reveals a direct link between education and tolerance: people who are more educated tend to be more tolerant of others.\u00a0 This underlines the importance of investing in education. The future of children is at stake. Educational inequalities already existed before the pandemic. Some disadvantaged groups had less access to quality education. With the pandemic, the divide is likely to grow as many children lack computers or good internet connections. Similarly, many schools and teachers lack the technical infrastructure to offer online teaching. In addition, even before the pandemic struck, 1 in 4 children across the EU was at risk of poverty. This figure masked higher poverty rates among children at risk. These include children with a migrant background, with less educated parents, or with single or low-income parents. Government measures to limit the virus\u2019 spread can exacerbate pre-existing risks among vulnerable groups. Parents find it harder to work or receive an income, distance education becomes challenging, and access to social and healthcare services is limited. These all affect children. Member States have an obligation to protect and ensure the rights of children. These rights are protected and granted by the United Nations\u2019 Child Rights Convention, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and by EU law. That legal framework was already important before the pandemic. Now it is even more so. The EU already had plans for a new child rights strategy. It promises to be a comprehensive strategy, pooling existing and future child right actions. The European Commission aims to release it early next year. Alongside this strategy, there is momentum to offer an EU child guarantee. It aims to oblige Member States to invest more in improving access to service to children who are at risk of poverty. This should allow all vulnerable children to participate equally and inclusively in society. Together, both developments offer hope to millions of children across Europe. They promise much needed support that will enable children and young people to shape a brighter and more secure future for themselves and for Europe.", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2020/pandemic-underscores-why-child-protection-critical-our-future"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0166", "date": "2020-11-09", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Removing the scars of antisemitism remains as relevant as ever", "text": "In\u00a0FRA\u2019s survey of Jews\u00a0in 12\u00a0EU\u00a0Member States, 85% believe that antisemitism has increased in their country over the last five years. Almost 40% have considered emigrating because they did not feel safe as Jews. In a separate\u00a0EU-wide Eurobarometer survey, half of the respondents say that antisemitism is a problem in their country. A further worry is how antisemitic conspiracy theories and disinformation surrounding the coronavirus pandemic are fuelling hate speech online. People are blaming Jews for creating and spreading the virus. Some even claim Jews use the pandemic for profit. This serves to underline the clear need to tackle hate speech and hate crime towards Jews. The EU, its Member States, educational practitioners and civil society organisations need to work together to combat the phenomenon. Fundamental rights promotion and wider educational efforts play a pivotal role in this. At a time when COVID-19 is robbing us\u00a0of many older people, including Holocaust survivors, we run the risk of accelerated memory loss about the Holocaust.

Most of them were transferred to an emergency site, which was later flooded. This prompted renewed calls for a dignified and long-term solution for people seeking asylum in Greece. During his visit to Moria in October, FRA\u2019s Director Michael O\u2019Flaherty offered the Agency\u2019s support to meet international human rights standards as new facilities are developed. Situation at the border Both at land and sea borders, the number of reported pushbacks is increasing. As the Coronavirus pandemic situation abated in summer, the number of migrants and refugees arriving to Europe increased again. Over 300 people have died or gone missing while trying to reach European shores. Moreover, authorities in many countries do not allow ships to land in their ports, leaving people stranded at sea. Many migrants are also attempting to cross the Channel. Asylum procedure The number of asylum applications is still significantly below pre-COVID-19 levels. Many national authorities managed to reduce the backlog of asylum applications despite the Coronavirus challenges, but applicants still face long waiting times. Access to the asylum procedures remains complicated \u2013 applicants lack information and legal support. Many family reunification procedures are on hold because of the pandemic. Reception centres Many centres remain overcrowded, making it difficult to follow COVID-19 hygiene and physical distancing measures. In some countries, arrivals are not promptly registered, which prevents access to accommodation and food. In others, migrants have to undergo a quarantine in undignified conditions. Child protection Thousands of unaccompanied children continue living in unsuitable conditions. After the fires in Moria, a number of countries \u2013 such as Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Slovenia \u2013 committed to relocate 400 unaccompanied children who had been living in the camp. Policy developments On 23 September, the European Commission published a new Pact on Migration and Asylum.

It is often where victims frequently come across racist, sexist and homophobic content. It is often where perpetrators feel free to vent and share their hate with impunity. But hate speech is not the only problem online. Children face bullying, and women have to deal with harassment and stalkers. For example, earlier FRA research already revealed how 1 in 5 women were victims of cyberharassment. As people spend more and more time online, such sentiments online can create a hostile environment where the recipients of hate feel increasingly victimised. This can affect how victims perceive the real world. Online victimisation also applies to the issue of cybercrime and consumer fraud, an area of growing concern for European consumers, as our recent Fundamental Rights Survey shows. Over 1 in 2 Europeans worry about fraudsters or criminals misusing their online data and nearly 1 in 4 worry about misuse of their online bank account or payment card details. To help victims have access to justice, Member States need to deliver on the rights of victims, as guaranteed under the Victims\u2019 Rights Directive. This includes providing online tools for victims to simply and quickly report incidents of cybercrime and hate speech to the police. Support organisations could also play a key role. They could provide easy online help to victims so that they can report incidents to the police. At the same time, Member States should create new or expanded specialist police units to tackle online hate and crime. They would be instrumental in carrying out effective investigations and cooperating across borders to seek out and punish offenders. They should also be readily reachable by victims to report incidents. Additionally, Member States should run rights awareness campaigns to inform consumers of their rights and what to do if they have become victim of abuse or fraud online. As people increasingly live their lives online, access to justice needs to keep pace to offer victims the same protection as they expect offline. \u00a0", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2020/justice-victims-and-online"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0180", "date": "2020-10-23", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Annual Meeting 2020 between the EEA and Norway Grants, and FRA", "text": "FRA provided the Donors and the Grants Financial Mechanism Office (FMO) with an overview of progress under the various EEA and Norway Grants Programmes and Projects in which FRA is involved.

Business-related human rights abuses may fall under civil, criminal or administrative proceedings. They differ, each with their own specific needs requiring victims to seek justice differently. To address the imbalance and allow victims have better access to effective remedies when harm occurs, FRA calls on the EU and Member States to: Shift the burden of proof to address inequalities between victims and business, and oblige companies to disclose the information victims need to establish a claim, as proving wrongdoing or liability is often a major obstacle for victims. Make it possible and simpler for individuals to use collective redress or representative action. This includes extending laws on collective action to cover business-related human rights abuse. Financially and legally support civil society organisations and court alternatives like national human rights institutions, Ombuds institutions and consumer organisations, so they can represent individual or groups of victims. Review legal aid rules so victims can afford to challenge businesses as cases can be costly and companies are richer. Clarifying legal responsibility in cross-border corporate rights abuse cases as companies and their subsidiaries operate across countries beyond the jurisdiction on national courts, which makes it difficult for victims to hold companies responsible. Require companies to assess the human rights impact of their activities to minimise the risk of abuse.

Facing stricter lockdown, poor welfare support and limited access to online learning, many Roma and Travellers communities have been ravaged by the pandemic. Member States need to tackle these challenges, strengthen social inclusion and involve Roma and Travellers themselves \u2013 both during the COVID-19 crisis and beyond,\" says FRA's Director Michael O'Flaherty. FRA\u2019s latest bulletin \u201cCoronavirus pandemic in the EU \u2013 Impact on Roma and Travellers\u201d documents the main challenges: Lockdown \u2013 entire Roma and Traveller communities faced stricter lockdown as precautionary measures, even before there were any confirmed infections. Housing \u2013 many live in overcrowded households with no access to running water. This makes physical distancing or washing hands very difficult, and put Roma and Travellers at higher risk of contracting the disease. Employment \u2013 lockdown left street vendors and those with precarious contracts unemployed. As many Roma and Travellers were not part of the formal economy before the pandemic, they cannot access support or claim welfare benefits. Poverty \u2013 the loss of jobs increased poverty and the risk of malnutrition, which was already high before the pandemic. Healthcare \u2013 in some countries, only half of Roma and Travellers have health insurance. Moreover, many face discrimination when accessing healthcare.\u00a0 Education \u2013 already before the pandemic, most Roma and Traveller children were early school leavers. Now, many do not have internet access nor computers, so they cannot take part in online learning when schools close. Hate speech \u2013 hate speech and discrimination against Roma and Travellers increased during the pandemic, as they were blamed for spreading the virus. FRA calls on Member States to implement inclusion measures recommended since 2013 by the Council of the European Union. In particular, FRA stresses that: Roma and Travellers must have equal access to all mainstream poverty reduction, employment generation and other social inclusion schemes. Health and education mediators, who provide basic services in Roma communities during the pandemic, need adequate resources and support to assist people in need, especially since the number of infections is rising again across the EU. Member States need to fight anti-Gypsyism and prejudice against Roma and Travellers. Their communities are often presented as a risk to the general population while in fact they are more at risk themselves because of the conditions they live in. Background: FRA\u2019s new Roma & Travellers survey shows that a quarter of Roma and Travellers in Western Europe could not afford basic items, such as heating or healthy food already before the pandemic. They also face rampant discrimination and harassment in their everyday lives. The EU will soon release its new \u2018EU Roma Strategic Framework for Equality, Inclusion and Participation\u2019. It aims to find a way forward and address the challenges Roma and Travellers face in the EU.\u00a0 This bulletin documents the situation of Roma and Travellers in 15\u00a0EU\u00a0Member States between 1\u00a0March to 30\u00a0June\u00a02020. \u00a0", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2020/pandemic-worsens-roma-and-travellers-poverty-and-discrimination"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0193", "date": "2020-09-30", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EASO network discusses asylum seekers\u2019 vulnerability", "text": "The annual conference allowed national authorities, civil society and European organisations to discuss ongoing challenges and good practices when it comes to the reception and asylum procedures of vulnerable people.\u00a0 They underlined worsening mental health, increasing domestic violence, missing children and the challenge conducting asylum interviews during the pandemic.\u00a0 The discussions identified priority areas, which EASO and the vulnerability network will incorporate into future work.", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2020/easo-network-discusses-asylum-seekers-vulnerability"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0194", "date": "2020-10-01", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Protecting human rights defenders", "text": "The meeting was at the joint initiative between ODIHR (Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights) and FRA.

But, as FRA\u2019s latest antisemitism overview reveals, large gaps in collecting data remain. This annual overview reveals hardly any change in the 16 years of monitoring such data collection. Some EU Member States do not collect any official data at all. For example, there is no official data on reported antisemitic incidents for Hungary and Portugal for 2019. Existing data are generally not comparable across EU Member States. This is because they use different methods to collect the data and draw data from different sources. In addition, official data collection systems do not always categorise incidents as antisemitic. These are some of the reasons why responses to antisemitism so often are ineffective. Again, as in previous years, the overview underlines the need for sustained efforts to improve data collection. This includes new methods, data sources and data processing techniques to better measure the incidence and effect of hatred against Jews. While the overview focuses on 2019, it also gives examples of how antisemitic conspiracy theories surrounding the coronavirus pandemic fuelled hate speech online. This only underlines the clear need to tackle hate speech and hate crime towards Jews. The overview draws attention to FRA\u2019s compendium of practices for combating hate crime. The compendium contains examples of how some Member States record hate crime, which others can draw from. The overview also reminds authorities that they have to do more to tackle under-reporting. They have to encourage victims and witnesses to come forward to report incidents. They also need the right systems to properly record antisemitic acts. FRA\u2019s antisemitism overview looks at data from international, governmental and non-governmental sources across all EU Member States, the UK, and for the first time, North Macedonia and Serbia. It compiles available data from 1 January 2009 until 31 December 2019. Also, for the first time, it contains information about national strategies, action plans or other instruments to protect Jewish communities. The annual update lists 20\u00a0EU\u00a0Member States plus North Macedonia and Serbia that adopted, endorsed or started using the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance\u2019s non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism. It further outlines how governments use or plan to use the definition.

But findings of FRA's recent Fundamental Rights Survey signal a lack of political participation among young people. They consistently attach a lower level of importance than older age groups to traditional forms of politics. For example, under 60% of young people aged 16-29 consider freedom of opposition parties to criticise the government of high importance compared with about 70% of people aged 54 or older. As one young German woman told FRA: \u201cEverybody always says that we can\u2019t change anything anyways, but it is at least a small start to go to vote, I mean how many youths don\u2019t go to vote at all anymore. And then they ultimately get upset about the ones who are still there.\u201d Such sentiment underlines the need to promote the full participation of young people in political, social and economic life. This is vital for a pluralistic, democratic and fundamental rights-based future of our societies. The EU Youth Strategy\u00a02019-2027, the framework for EU youth policy cooperation, already acknowledges this. It seeks to foster the participation of young people in democratic life while also supporting their social and civic engagement. One way to do this is to harmonising across the EU the minimum age to vote or stand as a candidate in elections, or to take part in youth councils \u2013 aligned with the principles set out in the EU Charter for Fundamental Rights concerning citizens\u2019 rights (Articles 39 and 40). Currently, for example, only three Member States give 16 or 17-year-olds the right to vote in any election. The youth-led #FridaysForFuture movement against climate change also offers hope. The EU and its Member States should build on such initiatives taking note of how political engagement among young is evolving. Europe needs new ways of engaging, involving and communicating effectively with its youth.

Courts, national human rights bodies and civil society organisations continue to question the legality of fundamental rights restrictions. Daily life: Although governments gradually eased restrictions, all EU governments maintain physical distancing measures. These include wearing of masks in some places and stay-at-home orders for COVID-19 sufferers. As Member States reopen schools and plan for the next school year, various assessments underline how children from disadvantaged backgrounds lack equipment and support for distance learning. With many people working again, studies point to the pandemic\u2019s disproportionate impact on women when it comes to work-life balance and caring responsibilities. Judicial systems also continue to return to normal. They tried to clear case backlogs through longer hours or more staff. Many still use video hearings for some cases. Member States continue to ease temporary controls at their internal borders and restrict travel to the EU in line with EU recommendations. Vulnerable groups: COVID-19 measures continue to affect some groups more. Restrictions eased for older people and people with disabilities in institutions. But sometimes visiting guidelines are too complex or restrictions are over-implemented or disproportionate leading to greater stress and loneliness. Some Member States run initiatives to counter the impact on Roma communities, such as educational programmes or access to information and healthcare. Some also support victims of rising domestic violence, by opening new shelters, support networks and more funding to better protect victims. Digital concerns: Many Member States work on contact-tracing apps and other technological tools, including the use of drones and other forms of surveillance to combat the pandemic. Data protection bodies continue to call for legal clarity on the use of such tools. Governments continue to fight disinformation by enhancing transparency on virus statistics, creating dedicated platforms and media funding. Racism: The pandemic is further stoking intolerance towards minorities. In several Member States, politicians reportedly used racist and xenophobic language. Some countries also reported racial profiling and disproportionate enforcement of COVID-19 related restrictions towards ethnic minority groups. This report covers measures in place in the 27\u00a0EU\u00a0Member States from 1\u00a0to\u00a030\u00a0June\u00a02020. \u00a0", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2020/covid-19-new-normal-should-also-safeguard-fundamental-rights"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0213", "date": "2020-07-31", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "FRA\u2019s second minorities and discrimination survey dataset now available", "text": "The dataset contains a wealth of information from over 25,000 respondents with different ethnic minority and immigrant backgrounds, including Roma, across all EU\u00a0Member States.

It shows the main obstacles they face in their work: Almost half of national and local civil society organisations say that the situation in their country has deteriorated. More than half say they faced verbal and online threats and attacks, including hate speech, as well as negative media reports about them. One in five say they experienced a physical attack, targeting either one of their employees/volunteers or their office building. The majority has difficulties accessing or participating in public consultations, mainly due to short deadlines or lack of feedback from the authorities. Many face challenges arising from regulatory frameworks, such as provisions on freedom of expression, assembly and data protection. Availability of, and access to funding is a problem for most civil society organisations. The proposed EU Justice, Rights and Values Fund could assist their finances. Civil society is an essential component of the democratic system. The quantity, quality and intensity of obstacles affecting civil society\u2019s ability to carry out their work provide an indication of a country\u2019s general state of fundamental rights, democracy and rule of law. This second annual consultation shows that many of the human rights organisations that FRA cooperates with continue to face challenges in their daily work. FRA started an annual consultation with organisations participating in its Fundamental Rights Platform in 2018, focusing on the challenges they experience in their daily work. The consultation followed the publication of FRA\u2019s 2018 report on \u2018Challenges facing civil society working on human rights in the EU\u2019, which highlighted different areas of concern.

It is a time to remember the 500,000 Roma \u2013 representing at least a quarter of their total population at that time \u2013 murdered in Nazi-occupied Europe. The Roma call this genocide Porajmos, the \u2018Devouring\u2019 in Romani. Roma are Europe\u2019s largest ethnic minority. But antigypsyism, hate crime, as well as hate-motivated harassment and discrimination, continue to plague many Roma across the EU, as FRA\u2019s work repeatedly shows. Around 4 in 10 Roma were victims of hate-motivated harassment or discrimination in the five years before FRA's survey of Roma across nine EU Member States. Research due out in September among six further countries will paint a similar picture. This is a wider societal issue: nearly 1 in 2 Europeans are uncomfortable with Roma as neighbours, according to FRA\u2019s Fundamental Rights Survey. The COVID-19 pandemic, and government measures to control it, further revealed how entrenched antigypsyism is. Some governments imposed disproportionate restrictive measures in response to identified infection cases. Prejudice further excluded many Roma. FRA\u2019s regular bulletins on the impact of coronavirus on fundamental rights repeatedly drew attention to such patterns. This will also be the focus of a thematic bulletin in September. The EU\u2019s next Framework on Roma equality, inclusion and participation, due out in the autumn, will give Member States a chance to do more to counter longstanding antigypsyism. The evidence collected before and during the pandemic point to the urgent need to eradicate today\u2019s prevalent prejudice, bias and intolerance towards Roma. This also involves raising general awareness of, and acknowledging the diversity and history of the Roma people. Honouring and respecting human rights law, and holding policymakers and governments accountable for the delivery of these legal obligations, can better protect Roma communities across the EU. This will also be an opportunity to improve the life chances and living standards for Roma, to fully include them in society and build from the past. \u00a0", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2020/roma-holocaust-remembrance-has-lessons-europe-today"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0216", "date": "2020-07-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Migration: COVID-19 continues to cause hardship for migrants and deprives children of access to education", "text": "Situation at the border Migrants and asylum seekers continue to face additional obstacles when trying to enter the EU. Ports in many countries remain closed, many restrictions are still in place and some countries require all third-country nationals to self-quarantine or provide a negative COVID-19 test upon arrival \u2013 a requirement many people seeking safety in the EU cannot fulfil. The number of allegations of pushbacks at borders, in contravention with the EU Schengen rules, have increased. \u00a0 A new Hungarian law provides for the immediate removal from the territory of any person who crosses the Hungarian border unlawfully and indicates an intent to seek asylum. Duly mandated international and regional bodies will determine the compatibility of these provisions with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, the EU asylum rules and international refugee law. Asylum procedure and residence permits Coronavirus measures led to a 90\u00a0% decline in asylum applications in April 2020, the lowest rate since 2008. Asylum procedures are gradually resuming in many countries but challenges persist. Access to information remains problematic in many countries. Several countries (e.g. Croatia, Greece, Italy France, Hungary) allow certain third-country nationals to remain legally in the country until the end of the pandemic. Some countries (Italy, Poland, Spain) introduce temporary work permits to third-country nationals working in agricultural, care or hospitality sectors. Situation in reception centres Restrictions and quarantines in receptions centres are often stricter than coronavirus restrictions for the general population.\u00a0\u00a0 Many new arrivals are not registered at all or with a delay. Access to legal help is limited. In many countries, people who were supposed to leave the reception centres can stay until the pandemic is over. In others, unsuccessful asylum applicants or even recognised refugees have become homeless. Child protection Because of the pandemic, many asylum-seeking children cannot access education. Many centres are missing online learning tools or stable WI-FI connection, which children could access. Detention and return Authorities in many countries released detainees from pre-removal detention. In addition, most removals are suspended due to the coronavirus travel restrictions.

Now is the moment for EU Agencies to work together in defence of fundamental rights and for the benefit of everyone in the EU,\u201d said FRA Director Michael O\u2019Flaherty. In the past months, all JHA agencies have taken the necessary measures to ensure business continuity and uninterrupted operational support. At the same time, the Justice and Home Affairs agencies' network (JHAAN), under the chairmanship of Eurojust, has initiated a dialogue to share their experiences in dealing with the pandemic and consider new avenues for closer cooperation among the agencies and with key stakeholders inside and outside the EU. The agencies\u2019 individual and joint efforts to deal with the impact of the pandemic have been captured in a Joint Paper on the COVID-19 response by the JHA agencies, which was formally endorsed by the heads of JHA agencies during a videoconference held on 9 July. During their meeting, the heads discussed the latest developments, including the fundamental rights implications of government COVID-19 measures, the quick adaptation of organised crime to the changing circumstances and the recent surge in drug use, domestic violence and child abuse. To tackle these and other issues more effectively related to the protection of citizens and freedoms, there is a need for increased interagency cooperation in the field of digitalisation and for sustainable financial resources in the coming years. The EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) has been issuing a regular bulletin on fundamental rights implications of government measures to fight the virus. The bulletins reveal the main fundamental rights concerns, such as data protection concerns surrounding the use of contact tracing apps, as well as the groups most affected by the pandemic, such as older people, migrants, victims of domestic violence or the homeless. The COVID-19 pandemic coincides with the 10th anniversary of the Justice and Home Affairs agencies' network. In the past decade, this family of JHA agencies joined forces as guardians of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. Together, they contributed to the implementation of EU\u2019s objectives in the fields of migration, asylum and external border management, the fight against serious organised crime, drug trafficking and terrorism, gender equality and respect for fundamental rights.", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2020/stronger-together-eu-agencies-join-forces-respond-covid-19"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0226", "date": "2020-07-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Elise Barb\u00e9 and Sunniva McDonagh take office as new Chair and Vice-Chair of FRA\u2019s Management Board", "text": "\u00a0 Elise Barb\u00e9, FRA Management Board Chairperson Respect for fundamental rights is essential to rule of law.

We clearly have to do more to stop labour exploitation, provide safe working conditions and ensure adequate pay. Member States need to step up their efforts to ensure the rights of exploited workers are respected. They cannot be the scapegoats of the Coronavirus pandemic.\u201d While the rights of all workers have to be respected, migrant or not, FRA has specifically looked into the exploitation of migrant workers. The 2019 report \u2018Protecting migrant workers from exploitation in the EU: workers\u2019 perspectives\u2019 shows illegal practices in many sectors including agriculture, construction, domestic work, hospitality, manufacturing and transport. Migrant workers in these sectors are often forced to work for endless hours with no or little pay, often in dangerous settings and without minimum safety equipment; sleep in fields or construction sites, without access to toilets or running water; and suffer humiliating sexual harassment. They endure \u2013 and rarely report \u2013 these violations out of fear of losing wages owed to them or, for those without a right to stay, of expulsion. As a result, labour inspectorates and law enforcement authorities uncover only few of these misdeeds, and offenders face little risk of being investigated or prosecuted. Impunity looms large. Even though the rules to protect workers are there, they need to be more strictly enforced and cross-border cooperation between EU countries needs to become stronger. FRA calls on the EU and its Member States to intensify their efforts to end labour exploitation in Europe \u2013 see our 13 calls for action. Background information: The \u2018Protecting migrant workers from exploitation in the EU: workers\u2019 perspectives\u2019 report draws on face-to-face and focus group interviews with 237 adult workers who have been victims of severe labour exploitation between 2013 and 2017.

This edition focuses on the impact on older people. While governments aim to protect the most vulnerable in our societies, some COVID-19 measures raise concerns about the rights of older people: Right to life \u2013 the death rate among older people was much higher than among other age groups \u2013 particularly in institutional settings, which serves to underline the vulnerability and need for close monitoring of older people in such settings. Access to healthcare \u2013 as national healthcare systems came under pressure, doctors were forced to decide who to treat. In some EU countries, authorities or healthcare bodies issued guidance suggesting a patient\u2019s age as a criterion for prioritising treatment. Lack of testing \u2013 testing of care home residents and staff was lacking. By the end of May, testing was planned or underway only in a third of EU countries. Stricter restrictions \u2013 many EU countries had stricter rules for older people than for the general population. At the same time, all countries introduced specific measures to help older people access services or use public transport. Isolation \u2013 lack of social contacts took a toll on the physical and mental well-being of older people. Many local initiatives supported people in care homes. Healthcare delays \u2013 many countries suspended non-urgent treatments, which affected many older people who have existing health conditions requiring treatment.\u00a0 EU countries need better data to understand how the pandemic affected older people to help them make evidence-based decisions for the future. As our societies reopen, governments should take care of the needs of older people as the passage to the \u2018new normal\u2019 will likely be slower and more difficult for them. The bulletin also looks at other fundamental rights implications of government measures to fight the pandemic: states of emergency; measures to contain the virus and mitigate its impact on social life, education, work, the justice system and travel to and within the EU; the impact of the virus on other vulnerable groups, such as people with disabilities, detainees, homeless people and victims of domestic violence. FRA will continue to monitor the situation and publish regular updates, drawing on evidence collected across all EU countries. \u00a0", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2020/respect-older-peoples-rights-when-exiting-covid-19-pandemic"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0235", "date": "2020-06-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "FRA joins Global Pride and calls on EU countries to create a \u2018new normal\u2019 where LGBTI people do not need to hide", "text": "\"There are so many LGBTI people who are not able to disclose who they really are, who still live in fear. Our survey of 140,000 LGBTI people points to persistent discrimination and intimidation of the LGBTI community across the EU. We should take this opportunity to come together and build a new normal after the pandemic, where no one needs to hide,\" said FRA's director Michael O'Flaherty. FRA has recently published the biggest ever survey on the experiences of LGBTI people. The results revealed that fear, violence and discrimination among LGBTI people are high. For example, 60% of LGBTI people avoid holding hands in public with their partners out of fear of being attacked. Almost 40% experienced harassment in the year before the survey. Most do not report incidents anywhere, because they think nothing would change.\u00a0\u00a0 During the Coronavirus pandemic, there have been reports about an outbreak of COVID-19 related homophobic hate speech. FRA data also show that LGBTI people are more likely to live in poverty with 1 in 3 saying they have difficulties to make ends meet. Their economic situation might have deteriorated even further because of the Coronavirus pandemic. Moreover, in the survey, many young LGBTI people also said they were living in an environment hostile to LGBTI. During lockdowns and quarantines, the situation might have worsened. Given these additional challenges, it is more important than ever to put in place lasting measures to protect and treat LGBTI people equally. As our societies transition towards the \u2018new normal\u2019, FRA calls on EU countries to promote full respect for rights of LGBTI people and create an environment\u00a0where no one needs to hide who they truly are.

It is testing the resilience of our societies as we respond to this global crisis and try to contain its consequences, both in the short and in the long run,\" added Wojciech Wiewi\u00f3rowski, the European Data Protection Supervisor. \u201cData protection is clearly not a problem, but part of the solution.\u201d Since the outbreak of COVID-19, both FRA and EDPS have been highlighting the importance of transparent, secure and voluntary use of technology to help curb the spread of the virus. FRA\u2019s Bulletin on fundamental rights implications of COVID-19 called for clear conditions for the roll-out of coronavirus contact-tracing apps, such as clear basis in law, voluntary use and no use of data for other purposes than those for which they were collected. The EDPS is responsible in the EU for ensuring that the fundamental right to data protection is respected. To this end, it advises EU institutions and collaborates with other EU bodies, including FRA. In the past weeks, contact tracing apps and data localisation have become a constant topic in the political agenda of the Union. Such technologies may have strong consequences on EU citizens\u2019 lives and lead to growing inequalities. In many countries, data protection authorities have been heavily involved in the design and development of contact-tracing apps, ensuring that the technology is rights-compliant. This is ever more important as new FRA data reveal that many Europeans are unwilling to share data about themselves with public and private bodies. Some 41% do not want to share any personal data with private companies and 55% fear criminals or fraudsters accessing their personal data.

Civil society tries to help save migrants in distress at sea. Often smugglers and traffickers sent these migrants to sea in overcrowded or unseaworthy boats. The latest FRA update identifies three additional rescue vessels and one reconnaissance aircraft supporting civil society efforts over the last year. However, overall rescue capacity has significantly reduced for various reasons. The update also points to around 10 new administrative and criminal proceedings by EU Member States against crew members or vessels since June 2019. This brings the total number of legal proceedings since 2017 to over 40. In some cases, EU Member States seized vessels. In other, they blocked rescue vessels in harbours due to flag or technical issues. The pandemic further restricted search and rescue work. Italian and Maltese ports closed to stop the virus\u2019 spread. As NGO vessels could not sail, state vessels and commercial ships intervened in rescue activities. Recently, some EU Member States quarantined migrants on tourist ships over a month, longer than the required 14 days. Since the start of June 2020, as COVID-19 restrictions ease, out of 15 boats and 2 reconnaissance planes, 3 are sailing again. The rest remain in ports.

There were also media reports of Cypriot authorities pushing back a boat with 175 Syrians, including 69 children. The duty of search and rescue and to allow disembarkation in a place of safety are imperatives of international law. Asylum procedure and residence permits Travel bans and other emergency measures led to a 43 % decline in asylum applications in March 2020. Due to the pandemic, many countries suspended asylum procedures. In Sweden, asylum application facilities remained open with measures taken to ensure health and safety. Denmark reintroduced the resettlement of refugees. Several countries (Croatia, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, North Macedonia and Poland) allowed certain third-country nationals whose residence permit expired to remain legally in the country until the end of the pandemic. Situation in reception centres Many organisations raised alarm about the deplorable conditions in reception centres, for example in Cyprus, Greece, Italy or Malta and in the informal camps in France, stressing that they make preventing the infection impossible. Lack of information on the COVID-19 measures in different languages has been a problem across the EU as well. For countries receiving high numbers of arrivals, relocation of refugees can be an important measure of European solidarity. Child protection Many children continued living in precarious and overcrowded conditions, making it difficult to properly implement COVID-19 measures. Detention and return Inadequate living conditions and overcrowding in detention and return centres raised serious concerns. In Italy, detainees started a hunger strike to protest against the risk of the virus spreading in the centre. In Belgium, some centres started releasing detainees, simply leaving them with no assistance and nowhere to go. In addition, numerous countries suspended Dublin transfers.

FRA\u2019s first COVID-19 bulletin looks at the fundamental rights implications of the coronavirus pandemic. It points to how the population\u2019s \u2018lockdown\u2019 has an immediate impact across most economic sectors as employers sent workers home. Some sectors like catering and tourism are particularly hard hit. Some workers could work remotely from home. However, many in lower paid jobs - factory-workers, waiters and receptionists, for example - could not. As many businesses, large and small, are likely to fail, experts fear unemployment to continue to rise sharply. \u00a0 Impact on rights Employers may also circumvent rights that protect workers from unjustified dismissal and offer social security and social assistance. Workers with informal employment agreements, and limited access to healthcare and social protection before the pandemic, are particularly at risk now. Without support, they face a strong chance of falling into poverty. In addition, finding work again may be harder once economies start to recover. Some workers\u2019 right to engage in work may disproportionately suffer due to the restrictions in place. These include parents of young children and single parent families, employees with health issues and disabilities, and migrant workers transported to work in agriculture or to provide social care. There is also concern about fair and just working conditions. Reports also arose of some employers not heeding government requirements to contain the virus and putting their workers at risk of infection by not respecting physical distancing rules. Some governments also relaxed or suspended rules on working time restrictions. This resulted from the additional pressure on sectors like health and social care, and food production and distribution, to tackle the pandemic. In the health sector and in supermarkets, this can affect women disproportionately. Concerted efforts By working together, policymakers can deliver immediate relief to workers and enterprises. This can support business through these difficult times so they can protect the rights of their workers and their ability to work. Ultimately, this would favour a faster and more sustainable recovery for everyone once the pandemic is under control. Some countries are starting to emerge from lockdown and are easing restrictions. Committed efforts The EU and national governments agreed on various economic stimulus packages to shore up business and workers\u2019 immediate needs. Most EU governments have committed to paying a proportion of employees\u2019 wages of those affected by the pandemic. They also offer additional financial support in the form of moratoriums on mortgage payments and support for renters.\u00a0 In addition, governments have put in place a range of different measures to support at risks groups and self-employed workers. The European Commission is working on a range of pan-European measures to support national governments respond to the needs of employers and workers after governments contain the outbreak. By working together, economies can restart and Europe can restart jobs and opportunities for its workers.

Governments need to make clear that violence is not a private matter and ensure the police, justice and health sectors are able to work together to help victims.\u201d \u201cEven without the coronavirus pandemic, one in five women in the EU have been a victim of domestic violence. Moreover, women in households that struggle to make ends meet are even at a higher risk,\u201d says FRA Director Michael O\u2019Flaherty pointing to earlier FRA survey. \u201cThe current spike in domestic abuses underlines that the EU and its Member States need to act to protect women during this crisis, and bolster their measures in the future to end violence against women once and for all.\u201d As lockdowns and quarantines continue in most of Europe, women face a higher risk of domestic violence. The danger is real. Globally, 64\u00a0% of women who are killed die at the hands of an intimate partner or family member, a study on homicides finds. Many EU countries reacted swiftly, putting in place counselling support, providing refuge for victims in hotel rooms, launching awareness campaigns or promoting hotline numbers. EIGE and FRA welcome these measures. Yet, the extent of action needed to safeguard victims has exposed how insufficient the support measures are even during normal times. For example, the number of beds in women\u2019s shelters is only about half that required under the Istanbul Convention, which 21 EU countries have signed and the EU has committed to accede to. \u00a0 The end of lockdowns will also bring new challenges. Financial insecurity in view of income and job losses, as well as a looming recession, can present additional triggers for violence and may make it more difficult for victims to leave an abusive relationship. FRA\u2019s earlier survey shows that 30% of women who find it difficult to make ends meet have experienced intimate partner violence, compared with 18% of women who do not struggle to get by. This underlines that the EU needs to put in place lasting structures to end violence against women. The COVID-19 crisis provides an opportunity to step up our efforts \u2013 we must seize it. EIGE and FRA call on the EU and its Member States to consider the following actions: EU countries that have not yet ratified the Istanbul Convention or not fully aligned their national laws with its requirements should do so swiftly. This would for example facilitate the use of emergency barring orders. In countries where legislation already provides for these orders, police should use them more often. The police, justice and health sectors in EU Member States should work together to manage the risk of violence against women. Professionals in these sectors should be properly resourced and trained to respond to such cases. Data collection on violence against women should be harmonised between EU member states to ensure the phenomenon can be adequately measured and addressed. In light of the many positive measures to eliminate violence against women at the national level, the EU should coordinate the exchange of good practices between member states. Many EU countries have legal definitions of hate crimes (against ethnic and sexual minorities for example). A workable legal definition of femicide to denote the killing of women and girls because of their gender should be considered. We support the European Commission\u2019s proposal to add violence against women on the list of EU crimes defined in the EU Treaty. This would recognise the structural nature of violence against women and propel joint efforts to eliminate it. \u00a0 As long as women face violence, gender equality will be impossible. And as long as we do not have gender equality, violence against women will continue. Let\u2019s work together to end violence against women once and for all.

However, washing is a challenge for 30% of Roma because they live in households with no tap water, as FRA reports. Up to 80% of Roma in some countries also live in cramped Roma neighbourhoods with overcrowded housing. This makes physical distancing, a key element of public health measures, close to impossible. At the same time, quarantine and physical distancing measures are likely to push many Roma further into poverty. Many work in low paid jobs often without social security that depend on contact with other people or involve travel such as collecting scrap material. \u201cBesides the pandemic and all the health problems it creates, governments are likely to find themselves facing a serious economic and social crisis,\u201d says ODIHR Director Ingibj\u00f6rg S\u00f3lr\u00fan G\u00edslad\u00f3ttir. \u201cRoma are particularly at risk, as well as others who are already vulnerable or are now in danger of slipping into poverty because of the current situation. Governments therefore have an important and urgent responsibility to develop comprehensive and inclusive plans of support \u2013 and make sure they are implemented.\u201d Amid media reports that the pandemic is worsening discrimination and anti-Gypsyism, ODIHR is systematically monitoring the effect of government emergency measures on Roma communities. This complements its work on assisting countries across the 57 countries of the OSCE region to increase the inclusion of Roma communities and combat racism and discrimination. Buying medication, facemasks and other forms of protective equipment is also a major challenge: within the EU alone, where most Roma live, 80% are at risk of poverty. This compares with the EU poverty average of 17%. Access to basic services, such as doctors or pharmacies, may also prove difficult because they are often scarce in Roma neighbourhoods. And in times of lockdown, visiting other areas may be discouraged. FRA research identifies local engagement practices with Roma communities that already exist. Health mediators can play a pivotal role in responding to this crisis. They are among the few who have trusted access to the most marginalised people. They build constructive dialogue with communities. As participation and empowerment are key ingredients to sustainable inclusion, such examples should be replicated, and be integral to any future strategy. To move forward, poverty reduction is key. This includes eliminating segregated housing, better access to public utilities like electricity and water as well as more social housing. The coronavirus pandemic underlines how persistent inequalities have left many Roma in an even more precarious situation than they usually face. Roma communities require urgent and immediate assistance so they can effectively protect themselves against the onslaught of the COVID-19 disease that is underway now, and its economic and social consequences. International Roma Day, established in 1990, marks the date of the first international meeting of Roma representatives across Europe, on 8 April 1971 in Chelsfield in the United Kingdom. \u00a0", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2020/persistent-roma-inequality-increases-covid-19-risk-human-rights-heads-say"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0282", "date": "2020-03-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Fundamental rights of refugees and migrants at European borders", "text": "States have a right to control the entry of non-nationals into their territory.

In 2019, Member States apprehended over 140,000 migrants entering the EU unauthorised. About 33,000 were children. Over 5,000 were unaccompanied. This exposes children to greater risk \u2013 the risk of violence, exploitation, trafficking and abuse. The latest FRA\u00a0report highlights the 10 main challenges migrant children face. These include: The risk of death or injury when trying to enter the EU by sea or land. Being stranded \u2013 In 2019, twice as many rescue vessels could not dock immediately compared to 2018. This left over 780 children stranded on board, often in bad weather and in poor health for over a week. Being pushed back, sometimes violently, at the border without assessing whether they are at risk of persecution or danger. This contravenes international and EU law. Non-governmental organisations\u00a0(NGOs) estimate that authorities pushed back at least 1,230 children on the Western Balkan route. Not enough space in reception centres for asylum-seeking children, particularly unaccompanied children with special protection needs. This applied to Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Malta and Spain. Deplorable hygiene and sanitation conditions in Greek migration hotspots. Standards were also poor in Belgium, Cyprus, Croatia, France, Italy, Malta, Hungary and Spain. Ineffective protection from sexual and labour exploitation due to shortcomings in national child-protection systems. Lengthy asylum procedures. This can be due to the long time it takes to assess age or appoint legal guardians. Guardians apply for asylum on behalf of children. Detention of migrant children to ensure their return. Detention conditions remained either poor or worsened in 2019. The forced return of unaccompanied children. Trauma following the handling of how authorities treat parents and their children as they are being returned.

From people dependent on care to those detained in overcrowded conditions with poor sanitation and healthcare. For some people it is simply more difficult to escape from it. As governments increasingly implement measures forcing people to stay at home, women in particular will feel the impact. Women find themselves on the front lines \u2013 as mothers, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, teachers, shop assistants. In addition, there are reports that quarantine and lockdowns may lead to an increase in domestic violence. Even without the pandemic, one in five women already suffered violence from their partner, according to an earlier FRA survey on gender-based violence. The lockdowns may hit women\u2019s escape routes and support networks, such as hotlines and shelters. Tackling the crisis will also require efforts to handle and support victims of domestic violence. The virus is also endangering people whose living conditions are already dire, lacking sanitation and hygiene \u2013 migrants, asylum seekers, exploited workers or Roma. Living in overcrowded camps, with limited access to healthcare and no possibility to practice physical and social distancing, migrants and asylum seekers are extremely vulnerable to the virus. Among them, thousands of unaccompanied children are exposed too. Migrant workers are also severely exploited across the EU. They are forced to work for endless hours with little or no pay, without safety equipment and no access to running water. With the outbreak, they face high risks of contracting the disease. FRA\u2019s report on severe labour exploitation shows that there is an urgent need for governments to do more to tackle such exploitation across the EU. The Roma community also faces an uphill battle. As FRA\u2019s research on Roma discrimination shows, 30% of Roma are in households with no tap water. Nearly 50% have no indoor toilet, shower or bathroom. As the coronavirus spreads, no access to running water becomes an even more pressing problem for staying healthy. Another worrying issue is the rise in discrimination. Discrimination, hate crime and hate speech is already a problem across large swathes of Europe, as FRA research shows.

We will overcome this difficult time as we have overcome many others, but only if we work with and for each other.\u201d Civil society and community organizations have an important role to play in combating prejudice. Nevertheless, it is governments who are primarily responsible for ensuring that victims of hatred are protected and can receive the support they need, particularly in this difficult period. \u201cWithout question, we need strong well informed public health responses right now. But equally, we have to ensure these responses respect everyone\u2019s human rights and do not disproprotionately affect certain groups in society,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Flaherty, FRA Director. \u201cWe are currently looking at the human rights impact of the public health measures countries are taking and will publish our findings soon. I remain confident we can deliver on both the human right to health of our people while also respecting everyone\u2019s human rights.\u201d Victims of hate crime often belong to groups that already face discrimination on a daily basis, both off- and online. At the same time, victims often feel misunderstood and marginalised by the criminal justice system. Police and prosecutors therefore need to ensure appropriate and sensitive treatment to ensure that victims neither feel ignored nor forced to re-live the experience of the crime itself. \u201cIn some respects, racism is like the coronavirus. It is a contageous disease which lurks unseen until it suddenly spreads and causes severe damage to individuals, families, communities, and the whole of society.\u00a0 In these difficult times, we need to join forces to build robust defences against racism and to curb its spread through strong legislation, effective equality bodies, ambitious action plans and inclusive education\u201d, said ECRI\u2019s Chair Maria Marouda. \u201cPoliticians and citizens need to speak out against hate speech that is triggered by today\u2019s pandemic. The authorities and equality bodies should reach out to help all the communities concerned.\u201d Recognising the importance of assistance to national authorities and civil society in order to deal with hatred and its consequences for victims, ODIHR has developed a number of practical guides for use by law enforcement agencies as well as also teachers and NGOs. At the same time, ECRI\u2019s country monitoring help countries to understand gaps in their laws and policies to combat hate crime and suggests ways forward. FRA\u2019s compendium of practices for combating hate crime collected from across the EU offers further guidance to governments as they seek more effective means of countering hatred. These solutions do not only offer hope to victims for a safer future, but also for more resilient societies based on inclusion, tolerance, and mutual understanding.

These inequalities are even more amplified when women are part of an ethnic minority or come from a migrant background. While both Roma women and Roma men face social exclusion, poverty and discrimination, Roma women are much more affected then men. Compared to Roma men, less Roma women finish high school and much less of them have a job. For example, FRA research shows that only 16% of Roma women have completed upper secondary education compared with 22% of Roma men. And, only 16% of Roma women are in employment compared with 34% of Roma men. To put this into perspective, 57% of general population women are employed compared with 71% of men. The same is true for migrant women. Although migrant women come from diverse backgrounds with different educational levels, they struggle much more to find a job. For example, as FRA research shows, only 52% of migrant women surveyed are in paid work compared to 73% of migrant men. And even though a third of migrant women have been to university, only around a third of working migrant women have highly skilled jobs. Women are also much more likely to experience physical violence, with one in three women in Europe being a victim of violence and over a half having experienced harassment. These findings underline the need for targeted, gender-sensitive measures to compensate for such inequalities. From supporting them in education, providing training and offering childcare, there is a lot to do to ensure women are treated equally and have equal opportunities to study, work and enjoy their lives.

Hotspots in Greece are completely overcrowded and living conditions there are dire. A baby died in the Moria camp in Greece from dehydration, which only highlights how serious the situation is. Cyprus saw a steep increase in arrivals, which led to poor reception conditions and significant delays in processing asylum applications. The number of arrivals surged in Spain as well, causing the reception system on the Canary Islands to collapse. Poor conditions also led to several riots in the Maltese reception centres. Mayors of the five Greek islands most affected condemned a government announcement about setting up closed reception centres. Many unaccompanied children have to stay in reception centres unsuitable for children or even at police stations. As of 31 December 2019, there were over 5,300 unaccompanied children in Greece, many of them living in unsuitable conditions. Facilities for unaccompanied children are lacking in the Italian hotspot in Lampedusa, so kids have to live together with adults. The lack of protection puts children at high risk of social exclusion, and sexual and labour exploitation. Police violence and pushbacks at the borders is an ever-growing problem as refugees continue to report violence and abuse. It has been escalating especially at the Croatian border after the Croatian police shot migrants in two incidents. At the same time, police in Greece, Hungary, Poland, Serbia and North Macedonia continue to refuse entry for asylum seekers. The access to asylum remains very difficult in most EU countries. Lack of information, problems accessing legal help and long waiting times are problematic in Cyprus, Finland, France, Greece, Malta, the Netherlands and Sweden. Many migrants, including children, are still placed in detention centres, sometimes under poor conditions.

It aims to identify potential pitfalls for policymakers as they seek ways to govern the use of such technologies. Facial recognition technology can be socially useful, but it has to be used properly. This means respecting fundamental rights, including data protection. As our\u00a0recent paper pointed out, when using facial recognition technology we need to consider whether there is a clear need for processing facial images.

Big data refers to new technological developments for collecting, storing, analysing and applying large volumes of data, often from various sources, including the internet. With more and more data available, new and improved technologies for analysis have also emerged. These include machine learning and AI. AI and machine learning are leading to automated decision making. This can speed up decisions, limit bureaucracy and deliver fasting results from insurance to job-hunting. In healthcare, there are even reports of AI outperforming radiologists. Globalised storage and processing of personal information and bulk access to data may infringe our data protection and privacy rights. Already the EU\u2019s new data protection rules provide a solid basis. They offer robust and forward-looking personal data safeguards, as technological frontiers expand.

It is when we honour and remember the millions of Jews, Roma, people with disabilities, gays and lesbians, and many others who were victims of the horrors of Nazi persecution. Tragically, 75 years on, Jews in Europe continue to face persistent and widespread antisemitism. FRA\u2019s survey findings reveal entrenched antisemitism across society, particularly online. It leaves many Jews feeling unsafe. Many avoid Jewish sites. And a high proportion consider emigrating because they do not feel safe as Jews in their own countries. Antisemitism is so deep-rooted in society that regular harassment is part of everyday life for many Jews. Antisemitism is commonplace, but many do not report incidents to the police or any other organisation. Why? Simply because they feel nothing will change. This sad but telling fact underlines the urgent need for policymakers at all levels to recommit to preventing and combating antisemitism. Member States also need to take urgent and immediate action to support Jewish communities, and tackle antisemitism effectively and lastingly. This has to involve a broad range of stakeholders, including Jewish communities and civil society. It involves strengthening Holocaust education, celebrating Jewish life, and awareness raising to create a better understanding of how intolerance affects people and society as a whole. Such education in schools is an important route to preventing antisemitism in the first place. Similarly, training public officials to enact and roll out prevention measures can help root out antisemitism. Safety is also paramount.

As the EU\u2019s unique and independent centre of human rights excellence, these are all areas FRA actively engages in. Worryingly, some governments across the EU are rolling back on their human rights commitments. This erodes public trust in the democratic institutions that are there to protect them. To capture the mood of the people and their experiences, FRA carried out a landmark survey right across the EU, its Fundamental Rights Survey. This general population survey focuses on situations that people in the EU face in their everyday lives \u2013 from a fundamental rights perspective \u2013ranging from data protection to equal treatment, access to justice, consumer rights and good administration. A staple of every year, FRA will draw attention to the various human rights achievements and challenges facing Europe in its annual Fundamental Rights Report 2020. This year, the focus will be on the national application of the EU\u2019s Fundamental Rights Charter. The European Commission could draw on this as it focuses on a new strategy to capitalise on the Charter\u2019s untapped potential, one decade after it came into force. Alongside the rights issues the general public experiences, FRA will also tell the story of specific groups that particularly face discrimination and inequalities. Our landmark EU-wide survey of lesbian, gay, trans, bisexual and intersex people builds on FRA\u2019s 2012 survey but this time it also captures the experiences of intersex people. It will reveal the everyday experiences of being LGBTI in Europe and the daily challenges they face from discrimination to harassment for simply being themselves. With over 140,000 respondents, it promises to provide rich input to the European Commission, as it reshapes its list of actions to advance the rights of LGBTI people across the EU. Roma, Europe\u2019s largest ethnic minority and often most socially excluded group, will also figure prominently in FRA\u2019s work. In particular, FRA will show what it is like to be Roma in Belgium, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

Many move by choice. But many others flee armed conflict, persecution, or serious human rights violations. In 2018, the number of forcibly displaced people broke 70 million for the first time ever. Many also suffer additional violence at the hands of people smugglers. Some turn to Europe, seeking safety in the EU. However, at the EU\u2019s external land borders, civil society and international organisations report people seeking protection being pushed back rather than channelled into asylum procedures. Migrants rescued at sea have also been caught by diplomatic wrangling over who will take them in. And once in the EU, reception centres in some migrant hotspots face chronic overcrowding. One area that the EU is looking at to help is smart border management using information technology. This entails large-scale databases housing personal information of people entering and leaving the EU. Three such systems are operational: the Visa Information System, Eurodac, and the Schengen Information System. In the future, there will be six different IT systems, which will be interlinked and speak to each other. Current systems also capture and store fingerprints. There are plans to process facial images, once the necessary legal and technical steps are completed. However, while the collection and use of such so-called biometric data can help establish a person\u2019s identity or track missing people, it is not without risks, as FRA research shows. These range from not respecting human dignity when taking fingerprints to difficulties in accessing, correcting or deleting inaccurate or unlawfully stored data. The EU strengthened safeguards in its IT systems by including fundamental rights by design and by minimising the risks of unlawful discrimination. This includes informing migrants when authorities collect their data and how they will use the data. Safeguards also incorporate strong levels of quality assurance such as being able to ask for inaccurate data to be corrected or removed. The EU now needs to ensure that such safeguards operate in practice as IT systems are rolled out. Only with such guarantees will these systems support migration management effectively and humanely. In finding solutions to migration, Europe must not lose sight that migration is about people, who are often vulnerable.", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2019/towards-humane-and-effective-migration"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0326", "date": "2019-12-11", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "From words to action against antisemitism", "text": "At the \u2018AFTER HALLE: from words to action against antisemitism\u2019 event, there were keynote speeches from the president of the European Commission, the president of the European Parliament, and the president of the European Jewish Congress.\u00a0", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2019/words-action-against-antisemitism"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0327", "date": "2019-12-11", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "European Commission\u2019s antisemitism working group holds second meeting", "text": "It brought together representatives of national ministries of education and national special envoys on antisemitism, representatives of national Jewish communities and Jewish umbrella organisations, as well as relevant international organisations.

Looking back, it took human rights from national arenas to the international stage. It also inspired the EU\u2019s very own bill of fundamental rights and freedoms \u2013 the Charter of Fundamental Rights. This year, the Charter also celebrates 10 years of being a legal tour de force. The Declaration also helped shape the nine core international human rights treaties that govern issues from children to disability, from civil and political rights to economic to social and cultural rights. It, together with the treaties and the EU Charter, created better access to justice, social protection, economic opportunities and political participation for millions of people across the EU. Today, all UN Member States subscribe to the Declaration. But even so, governments within and beyond the EU, often sidestep or roll back on their human rights commitments, undermining many decades of progress. Racism, discrimination and intolerance are common in many societies within the EU, as many FRA surveys show. Attacks on free speech continue and civil society face a range of difficulties trying to advance rights, as FRA work shows. These include threats, legal restrictions and being crowded out of policy discussions. To deliver our rights, we need to apply the Charter.

A 2015 FRA paper underscored how it is a catalyst for wide-ranging legal and policy changes across the EU. It led to national disability action plans and strategies. It also drove some Member States to change their laws and policies to grant people with disabilities more autonomy, as well as more choice and control over their lives. Now as the new European Parliament and Commission take shape, there is a fresh impetus to act similarly. There are encouraging signs from the new European Commission. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen instructed the Equality Commissioner, Helena Dalli, to lead on the EU\u2019s implementation of the Convention. Commissioner Dalli proposes to carefully review the evaluation of the EU\u2019s current disability strategy, and ensure all future EU laws and policies fully comply with the Convention and the needs of people with disabilities. She will also directly involve people with disabilities and their families to set priorities for advancing the rights of people with disabilities. She will also consult organisations and relevant stakeholders. The Convention, together with EU and national laws, provide a solid platform to make a tangible difference to the lives of people with disabilities. This includes, for example, moving towards community-based living and greater accessibility. But real change also requires Member States to effectively implement these laws and make them work.

It draws attention to how prosecutors and the police should not just view abuse as a single act in isolation. They need to look at the bigger picture; victims often endure coercive control and live in constant fear for a long time. Too often, judicial proceedings fail to take this into account when dealing with cases of partner violence. A fact FRA research underlines, following interviews with victims and frontline workers. FRA\u2019s findings point to the need for the police to act swiftly to guard against this undercurrent of fear, and the very real risk of repeat offences and further victimisation. In practice, this means immediate and robust protection measures, including emergency barring orders, whenever they learn that a woman is living under the threat of violence. In turn, this substantially lessens the risk the partner will harm her again. This also means training police officers so that they are more aware of partner violence and victims\u2019 needs. In addition, Member States should oblige perpetrators to attend training on how to avoid violence in relationships. They would also learn about the wider traumatic impact it has on partners. Such training could help change behaviour and prevent further violence. Measures to combat partner violence fall under the wider umbrella of the Council of Europe\u2019s Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence. The EU and its Member States have all signed the convention. It provides a comprehensive legal framework to help tackle violence against women and girls. It focuses on prevention, but also offers better protection for victims and ensures perpetrators are brought to justice. To date, it applies to 21 Member States but still seven Member States and the EU have yet to ratify it.

It identifies key aspects to consider before deploying this technology in real life: Legal framework \u2013 a clear and detailed legal framework is necessary to regulate the deployment and use of facial recognition technologies, determining when the processing of facial images is necessary and proportionate. Purpose \u2013 a distinction must be made between the processing of facial images for verification purposes and for identification purposes. In the case of identification, the risk of interferences with fundamental rights is higher. It thus requires stricter necessity and proportionality testing. Impact on behaviour \u2013 using \u201clive facial recognition technologies\u201d is particularly challenging because it can raise fears of a strong power imbalance of the state versus the individual. These technologies should only be used in exceptional cases, such as to combat terrorism or to detect missing people and victims of crime. Place of use \u2013 the use of facial recognition technologies during demonstrations may create a chilling effect, preventing people from exercising their freedom of assembly or association. Such use is therefore hardly proportionate or necessary. Margin of error \u2013 the algorithms never provide a definitive result, but only probabilities that two faces belong to the same person. It is therefore necessary to keep the risks of wrongly flagging people to a minimum. Moreover, anyone who is stopped as a result of using facial recognition technology must be treated in a dignified manner. Public procurement \u2013 when procuring facial recognition technologies, public authorities should build fundamental rights considerations, such as data protection or non-discrimination requirements, into technical specifications and contracts. Impact assessment \u2013 public authorities need to obtain all necessary information from the industry to carry out a fundamental rights impact assessment of the application of facial recognition technolo\u00adgies they aim to procure and use. Monitoring \u2013 as the technology is developing fast, close monitoring by independent super\u00advisory bodies is essential. Oversight authorities need to have sufficient powers, resources and expertise. Background information: Facial recognition technology can be used in many different ways, such as verifying the identity of a person, checking whether a person is among a list of people, and even to categorise people according to different characteristics. Live facial recognition technology detects all faces on video footage and then compares the faces against watch lists \u2013 potentially used at public spaces. Although the accuracy of these recognition technologies is improving, the risk of errors remains real \u2013 particularly for certain minority groups. Moreover, people whose images are captured and processed might not know this is happening \u2013 and so cannot challenge possible misuses. Public authorities planning to use the technology in real life need to take these fundamental rights concerns seriously.", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2019/facial-recognition-technology-fundamental-rights-considerations-law-enforcement"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0354", "date": "2019-11-28", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "FRA Director meets new EU Home Affairs Commissioner", "text": "The Commissioner took note of his offer of continued FRA engagement in the area of migration and security to support fundamental rights compliant policies and legislation.", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2019/fra-director-meets-new-eu-home-affairs-commissioner"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0355", "date": "2019-11-28", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "FRA joins Council of Europe cybercrime conference", "text": "It introduced its upcoming handbook on European Law relating to cybercrime and fundamental rights that will be co-edited by FRA and the Council of Europe.", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2019/fra-joins-council-europe-cybercrime-conference"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0356", "date": "2019-11-22", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "More cooperation and inclusion to better protect EU citizens", "text": "Europol hosted their annual meeting in the framework of its 2019 chair of the JHA agencies\u2019 network.

The time is ripe for a new EU-wide child rights strategy. Encouragingly, European Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen instructed the Commission to prepare a comprehensive child rights strategy. It should include actions to protect vulnerable children, protect their rights online, foster child-friendly justice, prevent and combat violence towards children and encourage children to take part in political processes. The European Commission also supports the European Parliament\u2019s initiative to establish a child guarantee scheme. This would ensure that Member States grant all children access to the services they need and support them through to adulthood.

The reception centres in Greece were completely overcrowded, with some camps hosting eight times as many people as is their capacity. The living conditions in these hotspots were dire, taking a toll on the mental and physical health of refugees. The situation at the border has been tense, with human rights organisations reporting continuous violations of refugees\u2019 rights. In Croatia, NGOs documented police violence against migrants and pushbacks from Croatia to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Pushbacks also continued to be reported from France (to Italy), Hungary, Poland, North Macedonia and Serbia. At sea, several people died after their boat sank. Italy continued to delay the disembarkation of migrants and refugees rescued by NGO vessels. However, small steps towards finding a solution to migrant distribution were made when France, Germany, Italy and Malta agreed on a transitional solution for migrants rescued from distress at sea. Unaccompanied children continued to face many challenges, especially in Greece, Hungary, Italy, Spain and Croatia. In most countries, there was no secure accommodation for these children and they were frequently becoming victims of trafficking for labour or sexual exploitation. For example, in Croatia, the Ombudsman for children reported about unaccompanied children living in juvenile centres for children with behavioural problems, which cannot provide for appropriate accommodation and care. The access to asylum systems remained very difficult in most EU countries. Access to legal advice and information was limited in Austria, Germany, Hungary and Poland. Many people continue to be placed in immigration detention, where the conditions are often grave. In Bulgaria, the facilities are not adequately heated, offer practically no privacy and access to healthcare remains very limited. In Spain, detainees were in some cases facing degrading and humiliating treatment, as well as disproportionate security measures. Hate crime incidents were commonplace in many countries, ranging from online hate speech to physical attacks. For example, in Germany, 330 politically motivated offences were directed against refugees or asylum seekers in the second quarter of 2019. In Hungary, foreigners were beaten up at a music festival, while a large group yelled \u201cfilthy migrants\u201d at them. And Italy recorded a number of violent attacks in the past four months, with attackers using racist language. Regarding legal developments, the European Commission referred Hungary to the European Court of Justice concerning the \u201cStop Soros\u201d legislation. The law criminalises activities in support of asylum applications and restricts the right to apply for asylum. In Switzerland, the Federal Administrative Court suspended the transfer of an asylum applicant to Croatia because it was not sufficiently determined whether he had been subjected to torture or inhuman treatment by Croatian border guards.

Meanwhile in a public survey last year across the EU, half of the respondents say that antisemitism is a problem in their country. Despite this, the antisemitism overview identifies six EU Member States that lack official data on reported antisemitic incidents for 2018. They are: Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Malta, Portugal and Sweden. As this overview indicates every year, limited data hinders the ability of policy- and lawmakers to formulate efficient targeted measures. It calls for new methods, data sources and data processing techniques to better measure the incidence and impact of antisemitism. Here FRA\u2019s compendium of practices for combating hate crime could help. It has examples of how some Member States record hate crime. It also draws attention to the problem of high-levels of under-reporting by victims. This can mask the true extent of antisemitism. It underlines the need for authorities to encourage victims to come forward and to be able to properly record antisemitic acts. Therefore, greater efforts to tackling under-reporting by encouraging victims and witnesses to report antisemitism is key. In addition, authorities need systems in place to record such incidents. The updated report compiles available data on antisemitic incidents collected by international, governmental and non-governmental sources, from 1 January 2008 until 31 December 2018.

But for people to believe and have faith in justice, they must also be able to see and trust that justice is done. This requires a strong and independent judiciary, whose rulings can be relied on to reflect nothing but the law. This also means without interference. For example, victims of violent crime need to believe that the police, prosecutors and criminal courts investigate, prosecute, convict and punish perpetrators accordingly. Victims should be able to form part of these proceedings, actively contributing. They need to see that justice is delivering for them. Too often, this is not the case, as FRA research shows. It shows how often legislation fails to recognise victims as parties to the criminal proceedings. This points to the need for more effective comprehensive support for victims, as well as judicial and police training so they are more in tune with victims\u2019 rights. Defendants too also often suffer from deficiencies in how their procedural rights are upheld in practice by all those involved throughout the judicial proceedings. This is true in pure domestic as well as cross-border criminal proceedings. Recent FRA findings underline how poor information and inadequate access to legal assistance can prevent defendants in criminal proceedings from full access to justice. Taken together, it shows how justice systems in practice across Member States need to step up in effectively and consistently applying the relevant standards that guarantee victims\u2019 and defendants\u2019 rights.

And preparation is underway. The European Commission is running a series of expert workshops, to which FRA contributes. They look into the feasibility and requirements for creating a child guarantee focusing at this stage on the EU\u2019s most disadvantaged children.

The Commission\u2019s preparatory work will also analyse how a child guarantee scheme could work for all children living at risk of poverty in the EU. Child poverty should also be considered throughout all phases of the EU\u2019s framework for coordinating its economic policies, as part of the so-called European Semester. This is where national spending and budgets, including the use of EU funds, are discussed. However, children in vulnerable situations are in special, and urgent need, for support. For example, a FRA survey revealed over 90% of Roma children in nine Member States experience poverty. They live in low-income households where living conditions are unacceptable and hunger is common. Inadequate education and healthcare threaten their fundamental rights and deprive them of opportunities to escape the poverty cycle, as a FRA study on child poverty shows.

By 2080, Eurostat estimates that the over 65s will make up nearly 30% of the EU\u2019s population \u2013 an issue that society cannot afford to ignore. But, despite this, nearly 60% of Europeans consider being old a disadvantage when looking for work. Too often, society views older people as a burden. It fails to recognise their contribution to families, communities and wider society, as carers for younger family members, as mentors, and as volunteers within our communities. Society seems to forget that everyone will eventually reach that age. EU institutions and Member States should act now to lay the groundwork for older people today and in the future. They need to change the prevailing mindset that views older people as a burden on society, and recognise the valuable contribution they make to society. By respecting their civil, political, social, economic and cultural rights, we ultimately support truly inclusive and sustainable societies. The incoming European Commission has signalled its aim to launch a wide debate on the long-term effects of ageing. It also promises to strengthen Europe\u2019s commitment to inclusion and equality in all of its senses, including age. Part of this involves raising awareness, promoting equality and fighting discrimination wherever it exists. The European Pillar of Social Rights is yet another milestone. The adoption of the EU\u2019s Work-Life Balance Directive earlier this year was another positive step. It should lead to more respectful tailor-made and home-centred care for older people. Such work should continue to further strengthen social rights protection across the EU. Unblocking the Equal Treatment Directive should be a priority. This would extend protection against discrimination based on various grounds, including age, to areas that particularly matter to older people - access to goods and services, social protection, healthcare and housing.

The paper underlines the importance of always considering the child\u2019s best interests when deciding what to do, in line with EU and international law. This applies to decisions granting the right to stay as well as obliging them to return. Child protection services should play a prominent role in procedures, from assessing what is best for the child through to determining guardianship arrangements. This includes continuous monitoring of the child\u2019s situation and development in cases where the child can stay. To help improve integration, authorities should also ensure children receive the appropriate documentation that allows them to legally stay and access services such as healthcare and schooling. In addition, Member States should counsel children that have to return to ensure they receive effective assistance. When Member States decide to return children, they should also inform them in a safe, child-and age-appropriate, and gender-sensitive manner. They should also ensure unaccompanied children are not part of chartered joint return operations.

For example, a third of migrant women have been to university and around a third of working migrant women have highly skilled jobs. The report also reveals wide variation across the EU Member States and minority groups surveyed. For example: There is not much difference between migrant women and men when it comes to proficiency in the host country language, an important prerequisite for finding work. But some notable exceptions exist, such as among North African men and women with good Dutch in the Netherlands (80% versus 65%), and Asian men and women in Italy (49% versus 29%). Overall, only 52% of migrant women surveyed are in paid work compared to 73% of migrant men. This is slightly higher than the general population\u2019s gender gap, where 63% of women and 71% of men work. In addition, there are large differences between countries. For example, Turkish women and men in Sweden have the same employment rate (70%), whereas in Austria there is a large gender gap (30% versus 81%). In Italy (37%), Spain (32%) and Austria (29%), there is a particularly high proportion of young migrant women (aged 16-24) who are not in work, education or training. Hate-motivated harassment and violence rates are similar between men and women. But for women the perpetrators more often involve someone they know (a neighbour, acquaintance, friend or relative). And twice as many women as men are worried about potential intimidation or retaliation by the perpetrator if they report the incident to the authorities. Such figures underline the need for gender-sensitive measures and support to increase societal participation and inclusion in society. These could range from offering childcare to targeted training opportunities for migrant women, including languages classes. The report also draws attention to the fact that twice as many women as men migrated for family reasons. This can make them dependent on their husbands for finding work or getting residency permits, for example. Member States should minimise this dependency in line with EU family reunification guidance and reduce administrative delays in processing permits. In addition, the findings challenge the popular perception that migrants are often socially segregated and hold traditional views. On average, over 80% of migrant men and women have friends without any minority background and favour gender equality.

It reveals the impact of the tough line some EU\u00a0Member States are taking towards asylum seekers and migrants. For example, authorities in Hungary are denying food to rejected asylum seekers waiting in transit zones. In France, authorities are removing irregular migrants without giving them prior notice, contrary to the law. In Croatia, the media reported on incidents of pushbacks and included testimonies from children of police threats and violence at the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina. In Greece, changes in who receives housing assistance has led to refugee evictions. The Italian government\u2019s hardline position on preventing NGO ships from disembarking migrants rescued at sea has led to the seizure of ships, and arrests of the crew and captain for docking with migrants in Italy. Italian courts later acquitted the captain citing UN\u00a0maritime law. Migrants crossing the sea to reach Spain also remains a concern. NGOs estimate that between 2018 and April 2019, around 70 ships carrying 1,020 migrants sank on their way to Spain, with over 1000 people either dead or disappeared. Immigration detention remains an issue in many places. For instance, among Germany\u2019s eight new migration laws, one concerns returns with provisions that risk leading to longer detention periods of up to 18 months. The national equality body and NGOs also point to the widespread use of immigration detention, including of children, in France. In Poland, many asylum seekers and other migrants continue to end up in immigration detention due to poorly functioning identification and referral mechanisms. Serbia is also struggling with procedural issues resulting from new asylum laws. This is leading to delays in asylum processing and poor reception conditions. Reception conditions of migrants remains a persistent problem. This is particularly acute in Greece, as recently highlighted by the Council of Europe\u2019s Parliamentary Assembly (PACE). For example, the reception and identification centre on the migration hotspot, Samos, continues to host five times as many people as its capacity. PACE has called on the Greek authorities to urgently improve conditions in reception and identification centres and offer better protection, particularly to women and children who are at greater risk of trafficking. The agency collects data about the fundamental rights situation of people arriving in Member States particularly affected by large migration movements. This report covers 15 EU Member States and the two candidate countries of North Macedonia and Serbia.

This largely forgotten side of the Holocaust has only been marked since 2009. Ten years on, Roma Holocaust Memorial Day, is a chance to recognise and commemorate the suffering of thousands of Roma and learn from the past to build a better future for today\u2019s Roma. Even though Roma are Europe\u2019s largest ethnic minority, antigypsyism, hate crime, as well as hate-motivated harassment and discrimination still plague many Roma across the EU. A FRA survey of Roma across nine EU Member States indicates that 36% were victims of hate-motivated harassment and 41% of discrimination in the five years before the survey. Clearly, Member States need to do more to counter antigypsyism, and improve the life chances and living standards for Roma. The past should be a constant reminder of the dangers of allowing hatred to go unpunished.

Upon arrival, many had to sleep rough, and children and young people often received no education. Nearly 2 million people have since received international protection, many of whom are young. As they are likely to stay and settle in the EU, successful integration and inclusion will ultimately benefit Europe and newly-arrived young people alike. FRA research, due to be released at the end of the year, focuses on young refugees aged 16-24. It highlights the various challenges they face and identifies promising practices that some countries are using to boost integration. These range from social services in Swedish municipalities guiding unaccompanied children turning 18 as they move to independent flats, an \u2018advice caf\u00e9\u2019 in Bremen, Germany, offering counselling and information to young refugees to an Austrian scheme providing tailored support to help young adults find appropriate training and internships. But Member States should do more. They need to provide support and opportunities that will enable young refugees to fully engage in society. This includes: improving access to education and employment; enabling family reunification; providing long-term housing solutions; offering social assistance as well as mental health support to cope with the trauma of having fled, travelled and arrived in a foreign country. In 2015 and 2016, countries were unprepared and not equipped to manage the sudden and large numbers of arrivals to the EU. Although numbers have fallen, migration still remains a contentious societal and political issue, and challenges remain. Refugee youth will only be able to fully take part in society, if Member States take the necessary steps to improve the integration and inclusion process.

EU\u00a0Member States are cracking down on civil society rescue vessels by launching criminal and administrative proceedings against NGOs or other private entities involved in search and rescue operations\u00a0(SAR) in the Mediterranean. Member States seized vessels and arrested crew members, initiating legal procedures against them. In some cases, they blocked rescue vessels in harbours due to flag issues. This led most NGOs to stop their search and rescue operations, as FRA already noted in 2018. Fresh research by FRA provides a snapshot on developments since August 2018 up until June 2019. The update gives an overview of all NGOs and their vessels and reconnaissance aircrafts involved in Mediterranean search and rescue operations since 2016. It also indicates whether they have been subject to legal proceedings. This reveals how only a few NGO rescue vessels were operational in June 2019 due to various reasons, including ship seizures or de-flagging ordered by Member States. It also points to ongoing or closed investigations and administrative or criminal proceedings against private entities involved in search and rescue as of June 2019. This shows that although more Member States opened such legal cases compared to last year, many opened cases ended with an acquittal or were discontinued due to the lack of evidence; others are still pending at the time of this update.

To understand the impact, FRA asked civil society organisations how the regulation affected them. The \u2018General Data Protection Regulation \u2013 one year on\u2019 focus paper shows that two-thirds of civil society organisations understand the GDPR requirements. Around a half also have designated data protection officers. However, even with this understanding, 77% face challenges in implementing the rules; 89% say it required effort to comply with the rules, as they understood them. This mostly relates to adopting or revising privacy policies, and obtaining consent from mailing list subscribers. Despite these challenges, 37% say the new rules made them more efficient in their daily work. That said, issues surrounding consent, the legal basis for processing personal data and granting access to personal data are cited as being particularly challenging in day-to-day operations. Most (67%) say that their national data protection supervisory authority did not proactively provide any assistance or advice. In addition, 72% indicate they did not have any direct contact with the relevant national authority. This underlines a lack of communication between the two. Several sought help from private companies that charged fees. Users rarely seem to use their rights to access, modify or erase their personal data held by civil society. When they do, it tends to be mostly about deleting their personal data. In addition, the paper shows that very few civil society organisations exercised their right to complain about data protection violations. The findings draw on responses from over 100\u00a0organisations.

The lure of easy access to such data, reduced costs and faster data processing is driving the increased use of automated decision-making across many sectors such as finance, recruitment and policing. Algorithms, used in machine learning and artificial intelligence, are responsible for analysing the data and making these decisions. But flaws in the data can undermine the legitimacy of any decisions taken, as FRA\u2019s focus paper on Data quality and artificial intelligence \u2013 mitigating bias and error in algorithms seeks to highlight. It raises awareness of the dangers of poor quality data as \u2018garbage in\u2019 can lead to \u2018garbage out\u2019 with a detrimental effect on people\u2019s fundamental rights. Algorithms based on poor data can negatively affect people\u2019s rights to privacy, data protection, non-discrimination, gender equality and to justice. This applies to both the data used for machine learning to train AI systems, as well as the data ultimately used when the systems go live. Already, problems are arising. For example, a hiring algorithm preferred men to women and a face recognition system worked well for white men but not for black women. Common forms of errors result from using data to make decisions about people that the data do not fully represent. Another common error is using data that do not fully measure what they are meant to. Drawing on data from internet and social media can be problematic, especially given the differences in rates of internet penetration in some countries and among some population groups. Across the EU, 11% of people overall, 27% of those aged 55+ and 30% of women with low formal education do not use the internet. This underlines how large volumes of low quality internet data cannot validate some measurements, when they do not represent some people and they do not measure what they are supposed to. Borrowing from long-established social sciences and survey practices of clearly stating the source of data and what is covered would help to trace errors. It would also allow corrective measures to be applied, if needed. Improving the understanding of the importance of high quality data can help policy-makers, business and developers address such issues and avoid potential problems. Ultimately, it will also lead to better artificial intelligence and better automated decision-making, as this paper shows.", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2019/quality-vital-data-driven-artificial-intelligence"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0449", "date": "2019-06-05", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Local practices on how to move from institutional care to community based support", "text": "On 27 May, the Disability confidence day 2019 celebrated 10 years of myAbility, an Austrian organisation that successfully works together with local and international businesses on improving accessibility and equal treatment of people with disabilities to the labour market.

Many recent votes have been marred by reports of deliberate efforts to manipulate voters with fake news. So how to respond? The first step is to inform ourselves. To seek out reliable information on the issues that matter to us. The second is to get involved, whether by voting or campaigning or encouraging others to vote. The European Parliament elections on 23-26 May provide a chance to do just that. Yet the right to participate in free elections is just one example of a right all too often taken for granted. Until, that is, it is under threat. That threat is also an opportunity to recommit to the values we hold dear, from fairness to respect and solidarity. Many of these values are also fundamental rights, legally protected by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, the EU\u2019s own bill of rights. And they are present in all areas of life, even if we do not always see straight away how they can help us solve the challenges we face. Take ageing, the topic of a recent paper by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA). Older people contribute to our families and communities in myriad ways, from sitting on schoolboards to volunteering at local projects and providing much-needed childcare. Still, across Europe older people have real worries about whether they will get the support they need to stay in their home as they age, or if they will be financially secure in retirement. This is a question of fundamental rights that everybody in the EU will face: the right to grow old with dignity. Or take the technology now ever present in our homes and workplaces. Almost half of Europeans use social media nearly every day. Algorithms sort through job applications, decide on insurance premiums and determine the information we see. This raises some old fundamental rights questions in new contexts. How can we preserve our privacy online? Who is accountable for making sure the decisions made by computers are fair? These challenges go beyond national borders. Solving them demands more of the sort of close cooperation that is the daily business of the EU. Look at any list of issues that matter to voters, and employment is likely to be near the top. But evidence shows that we are a long way from a labour market that is a level playing field for all. Many people face unfair treatment when looking for a job, whether because of their age, their gender or a foreign-sounding surname. Indeed, a recent FRA survey showed that nearly a third of respondents felt discriminated against based on their ethnic or immigrant background in the previous five years. This deprives the European economy of much-needed talent and individuals of the sense of belonging and contributing to society that comes from having a job. The next European Parliament will help to determine how Europe will address these issues. So with these elections , it is a good time to ask ourselves who we want to tackle them over the next five years. I hope the answer will include parliamentarians with a commitment to fundamental rights. Ensuring that means exercising the most basic of democratic rights: voting.

In 70 countries, there are laws that criminalise private, consensual sexual relations between adults of the same sex, and we were and are alarmed by recent severely retrograde and inhumane measures brought in to target these relationships. Other countries offer LGBTI people little or no protection from discrimination in the workplace or in the provision of goods and services.\u00a0 We remain committed to improving institutional protection against discrimination; removing or amending discriminatory laws, policies and practices; reducing hate speech, violence and harassment based on discrimination; and increasing the participation of LGBTI communities in our societies. In support of this, FRA will soon launch its\u00a0EU-wide LGBTI survey, seven years after the first one, to\u00a0capture the experiences of discrimination and hate crime towards LGBTI people. Criminalisation of and intolerance towards LGBTI persons denies them their political and civil rights just as much as their economic, social, and cultural rights. It weakens society by letting violence and bullying go unchecked, with severe consequences for the health and well-being of victims and their families. Ultimately, more tolerant and inclusive societies benefit everyone. We also wish to pay homage to the courageous advocacy efforts carried out by human rights defenders, activists, journalists, media workers and civil society organisations to raise awareness about the issues affecting LGBTI persons and the violations they may face.\u00a0 Finally, we are pleased that the initiative \u2018Diplomats for Equality\u2019 will be able to take an active part in EuroPride Vienna from 1-16 June 2019.

For example, the Danish Parliament passed a bill in which all residence permits for refugees and their family members are temporary. It also foresees limiting the number of residence permits issued for family reunification if asylum applications in Denmark grow significantly in a short time period. Sanctions for rejected asylum seekers who do not stay at their designated centre will be tougher, leading to 40 days in prison in some cases. In Greece, some people who were granted refugee status before 31 July 2017 will no longer receive housing assistance. This could lead to an increase in homelessness and hamper access to some services, such as continued education for children. In Germany, social services are refusing to reimburse hospitals for emergency treatment of irregular migrants. In some instances, access to healthcare depends on the outcome of asylum procedures. In addition, it was reported that on average asylum seekers had to wait over seven months for access to psychotherapy, and 45% of applications for psychotherapy were rejected at the start of 2019 compared with 35% in 2018. Elsewhere, there are new tougher asylum proposals in Austria. These include: housing in departure centres during admission; curfews; 20 days for asylum procedures which can hamper the proper scrutiny of claims; the withdrawal of asylum for certain criminal acts; and preventative detention for some asylum seekers. Migrants\u2019 living conditions remain a persistent problem. This is particularly acute in the migration hotspots on the Greek islands where, for example, the reception and identification centre on Samos hosts five times as many people as its capacity. In Serbia, overcrowding is also a concern. Meanwhile, in France, living conditions continue to worsen for people staying in informal camps in the North of France and in Paris, affecting their health and psychological well-being. Procedural delays during asylum processes remain an issue in various Member States such as Croatia, France, the Netherlands and Spain. For example, asylum seekers in the Netherlands had to wait 16 months before their asylum procedure started in January 2019; this could increase to 24 months in the first half of 2019. In Austria, it was the quality of second-instance asylum decisions that remains a concern and the right to be heard is not always guaranteed. In North Macedonia, ineffective asylum procedures rarely result in positive decisions and the individual circumstances of each applicant are rarely assessed. For example, no positive asylum decisions were issued during the first three months of 2019. Poor procedures were also reported in Poland. Many asylum seekers and other migrants continue to end up in immigration detention as a result of poor identification and referral mechanisms. This is despite the fact that victims of violence should not be detained according to Polish immigration and asylum law. \u00a0 The agency collects data about the fundamental rights situation of people arriving in Member States particularly affected by large migration movements.

Overall, they: leave school early - only 16% of Roma women have completed upper secondary education compared with 22% of Roma men and 75% of European women; marry young - 29% of Roma women compared with 12% of Roma men are married before they turn 18; stay at home - 40% of Roma women are not looking for work due to their care responsibilities; this is often twice as high as general population women; are not in paid work - only 16% of Roma women are employed compared with 34% of Roma men. These figures underline the need for Roma inclusion measures that are gender-sensitive, and designed and implemented together with Roma women. They show that we need to examine carefully how to combine social welfare support with opportunities for decent work. They also point to the negative consequences of a lack of access to early childhood education and care, which could provide Roma women with the time to learn skills and seek employment.

Last year some 150,000 people crossed the EU\u2019s external borders irregularly; the lowest number in five years. Asylum applications also fell for the third year in a row. The falling numbers reduced backlogs in processing asylum applications and helped improve reception capacity in some places across the EU. However, concerns persist. Even though the number of migrants arriving continue to fall, many still die en route with 2,275 deaths reported last year. Civil society rescue attempts by boat faced difficulties trying to dock. This left migrants on board for longer than necessary putting their safety at risk. In addition, there were reports of migrants, including children, being mistreated at border crossings and even refused entry unlawfully. Violence and hate speech towards migrants remain an issue with a high number of attacks being reported by non-governmental organisations, the media and the police. Even so, hate crime is often largely invisible as many incidents go unreported. In some places, intolerance towards migrants grew. This was not helped by some politicians voicing anti-migrant statements. Tougher asylum laws and policies in some Member States are also an issue. These apply to areas like asylum procedures, the right to family reunification, reception conditions and welfare for asylum seekers. In some cases, the European Courts have been asked to assess whether changes remain within the scope of EU law. And immigration detention rules become tougher. This negatively affected children.

They call for enforcing international and national antidiscrimination legislation, including tougher sanctions, and amendments to working practices to promote the diversity Europe needs to remain relevant in today\u2019s global economy. \u201cRacism in any form is toxic to the creation of a fair, equal and rights respectful society,\u201d said FRA Director O\u2019Flaherty. \u201cWe have the laws but too often they fail to deliver. We need to step up our policies and practices to reduce the barriers ethnic minorities face when trying to enjoy their basic right to employment.\u201d He pointed to a recent FRA minorities\u2019 and migrants\u2019 survey that underlined the scale of the problem. Almost a third of respondents reported they had been discriminated against when looking for a job. Half of these thought it was because of their skin colour or appearance, while one-third said it was because of their name. \u201cAccess to employment is a key to successful and sustainable inclusion of all people into society,\u201d said ECRI Chair Lehners. \u201cThrough the recommendations that ECRI addresses to the Council of Europe member states, we aim to motivate all stakeholders to open up even more to diversity and build an inclusive working culture. Employees will benefit from this through an improved working environment, and employers through better results. At the same time, we are active to prevent new discrimination risks that could arise from the use of new technologies such as artificial intelligence.\u201d \u201cA person's ethnicity or skin colour are all too often grounds for discrimination, preventing them from having equal access to the labour market and equality in the workplace,\u201d said ODIHR Director G\u00edslad\u00f3ttir. \u201cRoma and Sinti, the largest ethnic minority in Europe, experience high levels of discrimination when seeking employment, and this is a strong factor contributing to economic, social and political exclusion. Governments must make real efforts to counter discrimination against Roma or any group.\u201d G\u00edslad\u00f3ttir stressed that all OSCE participating States have committed themselves to adopt effective legislation to combat racial and ethnic discrimination in all fields, including employment, and in its Action Plan to Improve the Situation of Roma and Sinti in the OSCE area, to create specialised institutions and mechanisms to ensure the implementation of such laws. Today\u2019s International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination points to a clear need to tackle pervasive racial discrimination in all areas of life. As it is also the International Decade for People of African Descent, we should stamp out the widespread and entrenched prejudice and exclusion that too many black people continue to face simply because of their skin colour.

Positive measures like diversity audits in workplaces, public sector recruitment drives among minorities and anonymised recruiting processes are simple practical measures that can help make a difference.

Let us all work together to build the Europe where, in all of our diversity, we can live in peace and without fear.\u201d The agency\u2019s surveys and online anti-Muslim hatred database, as well as its work with Muslim communities and Islamic leaders all point to worrying levels of hatred against Muslims across EU Member States. Take FRA\u2019s 2017 report on Muslims in the EU. It provides a snapshot of their everyday experiences: 1 in 4 Muslim respondents were harassed, often repeatedly; in addition, Muslim women who publicly wore a headscarf or niqab were harassed more often than those who did not; 1 in 3 were discriminated against; often, this was because of their name. These findings reveal widespread recurring discrimination and hatred towards Muslims, as they go about their everyday life. But the survey also points to greater trust among Muslims in democratic institutions than the general public. Not only that, 3 out of 4 feel strongly attached to their country of residence. This underlines the crucial need to engage and work with Muslim communities to identify how best to keep them safe. It is also a duty of the State to protect people. We must also acknowledge that hatred towards Muslims is not just their problem. It is a societal problem that affects us all. At the same time, we must recognise that words of intolerance can stoke the fires of hate with tragic consequences, as we have recently seen. Finally, to truly understand and effectively tackle hate crime Europe must get much better at reporting, recording, investigating and prosecuting incidents of hate crime.

Victims of violence are entitled to be acknowledged as the ones whose rights are violated, to be heard by a court and to receive justice to right the wrongs done to them. The EU\u2019s Victims\u2019 Rights Directive grants victims a right to recognition and to participate in criminal proceedings.

As guidance, FRA will release a series of reports in April. They will look at victims\u2019 rights, how they apply during criminal proceedings and what this means when it comes to sanctions. There will also be a particular focus on women as victims of partner violence. The reports build on research that assessed how victims experience rights in practice during criminal proceedings. It looked at the national laws that seek to fulfil, promote and protect the fundamental rights of victims\u2019 access to justice and how this translates on the ground.

Victims are entitled to better greater access to justice and remedies.

Everyone has the right to vote.\u201d She is just one of many people Inclusion Europe, an organisation advocating for the rights of people with intellectual disabilities, spoke to about how they feel about the high number of people with disabilities that are prevented from taking part in this year\u2019s European Parliament elections. Typically, it is people with intellectual and psychosocial disability who are deprived of legal capacity - the law\u2019s recognition of the decisions a person makes. Deprived of this recognition, they then face voting restrictions. FRA\u2019s paper, \u2018Who will (not) get to vote in the 2019 European Parliament elections?\u2019, looks at developments in the right to vote of people deprived of legal capacity in EU Member States. It builds on earlier findings from FRA research in 2010 and 2014. It shows that two-thirds of EU Member States restrict the right to vote for people with disabilities deprived of legal capacity. This undermines their ability to participate in elections on an equal basis with others. However, the paper also points to slow but steady progress in realising the right to vote for all. Member States are reforming their laws to remove voting restrictions for people with disabilities deprived of legal capacity. But reforms do not always remove all restrictions for all elections and some leave it up to courts to decide. To realise the right to political participation, FRA\u2019s paper highlights four key components, namely: lifting legal and administrative barriers to political participation; increasing awareness of the right to political participation of people with disabilities; making voting procedures, facilities and election materials more accessible; expanding opportunities for participation in political life. EU Member States are already taking measures in each of these areas, the FRA paper shows. But more efforts are needed so that people with disabilities can exercise their basic democratic rights on an equal basis with others. Addressing these issues will have a big effect on the lives of people with disabilities. \u201cIt is not fair to take away the right to vote from people under guardianship,\u201d says Stephan Wolansky from Germany. \u201cThis should be changed.

For example, the Italian Parliament approved significant migration reforms. They replace humanitarian residence permits with more specific temporary permits. As a result significantly fewer people will qualify for protection. They widened the types of criminal offences that can revoke protection or reject asylum claims. In addition, the Italian approach to reception has changed: the national asylum seeker and refugee protection system, often cited as a good practice, will be restricted to only those who quality for protection; asylum applicants will be kept in lower quality facilities and greater limits will be placed on access to local services, such as training. Elsewhere, in Croatia, a new law on immigration detention is restricting migrants\u2019 access to non-governmental organisations and lawyers, making legal aid harder to receive. In Germany, asylum law amendments oblige unaccompanied children and young adults to provide supporting identity and proof of age documents during repeal and withdrawal procedures. Not only could it complicate and lengthen procedures, it also means they now have to help authorities revoke their protected status. And in Austria, proposed social welfare cuts that link benefits to employability may disproportionately affect migrants who do not have the necessary language skills yet. Practices are also changing. In Poland, authorities can now classify some residence permit and asylum files as \u2018secret\u2019. This prevents applicants and their legal support from accessing the files they need during judicial review. In France, residence permits for migrants with serious health issues have fallen by almost 40% in the last two years. This is due to changes in the review process as Interior Ministry, and no longer Health Ministry, attached doctors are responsible for medical assessments. And in Sweden, housing shortages have led some municipalities to not recognise people\u2019s right to continue living in the same municipality beyond the two-year induction period. Spain overtook Italy and Greece as the main country of arrival in 2018 \u2013 a 130% increase compared to the year before. The number of deaths and missing people also rose significantly from 202 in 2017 to 784 in 2018 \u2013 a 288% increase. Member States continue to make it hard for civil society search and rescue operations to dock. Delaying the disembarkation of migrants as Member States discuss who will accept them places migrants, often women and children, under inadequate conditions onboard until a solution is found. At the borders, there were reports of ill treatment towards migrants as many are violently pushed back across borders. The plight of migrants stuck in severely cramped reception and detention centre conditions, particularly in the migration hotspots on the Greek islands, remains an issue. Over two times as many migrants as there should be are living in containers with some having to live in tents due to the overcrowding; these tents are unsuitable for the winter conditions. Similarly, conditions in some reception centres in Sofia, Bulgaria and in the informal camps in northern France have worsened. And in Mellila, Spain, the restriction of movement of migrants, asylum processing delays of up to two years and the situation of unaccompanied children remain concerning. Covering on the situation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u00a0for the first time, the report points to ineffective asylum procedures that often drives applicants to seek ways to leave the country irregularly. It also notes a 4.5 times increase in attempts to enter the country unauthorised compared to the year before and the need for more resources at the borders. The agency collects data about the fundamental rights situation of people arriving in Member States particularly affected by large migration movements.

The EU Council\u2019s Declaration promised a common approach to better protect Jewish communities and institutions across Europe. \u201cFRA welcomes the renewed pledge to better protect Jews in Europe,\u201d said FRA Director Michael O\u2019Flaherty. \u201cIn honouring the victims of antisemitism past and present, we stand firm in working towards ensuring that hate and discrimination have no place in our society.\u201d In the years leading up to the Holocaust, hate, prejudice and racism towards Jews were all too common across society. The gradual normalisation of antisemitism paved the way for one of the worst atrocities ever to take place in Europe. \u00a0 More than seven decades later, once again Europe is haunted by widespread antisemitism. It not only threatens our Jewish communities, but also the very values of human and fundamental rights on which we have built the European Union. In December last year, the agency published the results of the biggest antisemitism survey of its kind ever worldwide. The survey shows that almost 90% of the respondents feel that antisemitism is getting worse in their country, especially online. Almost 30% of the respondents have been harassed and over one third of all our respondents considered emigrating from the EU. The results of the reports shows a frightening reality of what it is like to be Jewish in the EU today. It serves as a powerful indication of the views of almost the entire Jewish population living in the EU. Worryingly, FRA\u2019s survey results contrast with the general public\u2019s view where only 36% believe that antisemitism has risen, according to the most recent Eurobarometer results. Worse still, only 4 in 10 Europeans think the Holocaust is sufficiently taught in schools. And among people who \ufb01nished their education earlier, even less. Such findings serve as a clear reminder of the urgent need to roll out more effective measures to prevent and fight antisemitism. The European Commission\u2019s call for an expert group should help spearhead these efforts. This includes raising awareness of antisemitism today combined with Holocaust education. International Holocaust\u00a0Remembrance\u00a0Day marks the anniversary of the liberation of Nazi Germany\u2019s most notorious death camp, Auschwitz-Birkenau, where hundreds of thousands of Jews were murdered.

It revealed how some companies were treating clients\u2019 personal data as their own. They often overlooked their clients\u2019 rights. This has led to a tech backlash. Many consumers are abandoning online services as they start to reclaim control of their personal data. Take Facebook for example. In Europe alone, it lost four million users between the first and third quarters of 2018. Consumer trust has also been severely dented as users grow wary of sharing their data with a third party, or not. Since May 2018, the EU\u2019s new data protection regime, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), has put greater emphasis on the rights of users. The new rules aim to be forward-looking and efficient, offering robust personal data safeguards, as technological advances expand the frontiers of areas such as surveillance, communication interception and data storage. Users have the \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019, a \u2018right of data portability\u2019 and greater access to their data. They can even demand firms to stop using their data. Users can also seek compensation from firms for rights violations. The rules also advocate a data minimalism approach. In essence, firms should only ask for data they really need rather than what they can get. Firms doing business in Europe also stand to benefit from the new regime. It provides legal certainty. It also makes it simpler for firms to operate across the EU as rules have been harmonised. In addition, being GDPR-compliant can help firms regain trust. It signals to users whether a firm is handling personal data carefully. To help keep pace, FRA, together with the Council of Europe and the European Data Protection Supervisor, have updated their popular handbook on European data protection law. \u00a0 It provides useful insights into European data protection law and how it is being applied in practice. It is a practical tool for legal professionals as well as non-governmental organisations and others who may be confronted with legal questions related to data protection rights violations; this is an issue that is widely anticipated to come to the fore throughout 2019. In addition, important data protection questions are being discussed. Agreement on data retention is still pending, a new e-Privacy regulation is still in draft and the EU\u2019s proposed Copyright Directive is in its final stages. FRA will continue to feed into the debates, providing evidence and advice as requested. Nonetheless, the GDPR already provides a strong data protection framework across the EU. It ensures individuals and supervisory authorities have the means to effectively protect their personal data and enforce their fundamental rights. Now users can take back control of their data and ensure their rights are being upheld. \u00a0", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2019/promising-greater-data-control-users-not-controllers"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0534", "date": "2019-01-22", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Charter training for Finnish civil servants", "text": "Around 100 participants attended.

We urgently need solutions so migrants are not forced to risk their lives at sea to reach Europe.\u201d Some 53 people who left Morocco died following a collision in the Mediterranean. A further 117 died when their rubber dinghy sank near Libya. One survivor was apparently rescued by a passing fishing boat after over 24 hours at sea and is receiving medical treatment in Morocco. The Italian Navy picked up three survivors from the other shipwreck and took them to Lampedusa where they are being treated. In October last year, FRA drew attention to the recent trend of criminalising search and rescue in the Mediterranean Sea carried out by NGOs or others. This prevents most NGOs from operating at sea for fear of the consequences \u2013 arrest, prosecution, or their vessels seized. An earlier FRA report from 2013 underlined the many perils migrants face at sea. Many of the issues and suggestions covered remain just as valid today. These include the need for provide clarity on where to safely disembark intercepted or rescued migrants and refugees.

It shows how respect for fundamental rights is in the interest of the national authorities and avoids rights violations during return procedures. Violations can lead to challenges thatcan undermine the effectiveness and credibility of the EU\u2019s return policy. Based on the proposed changes, key FRA suggestions for improvement include: Avoid stricter rules limiting the use of voluntary departure while making it compulsory for Member States to have in place a national system for assisted voluntary returns. Narrowing the use of voluntary departure runs contrary to the aim of prioritising voluntary over forced returns and should be reconsidered. EU funding should be available to help Member States in all key areas to develop and carry out return measures in an effective, safe and dignified manner. Ensure that streamlined return procedures do not increase the risk of fundamental rights violations. Safeguards are needed so that combining end of legal stay and return decisions does not hamper asylum claims and appeals. This also applies to obliging non-EU nationals to cooperate with authorities which could lead to revealing asylum seekers\u2019 information to their country of origin. Issuing entry bans without return decisions should also be avoided as expedited procedures might prevent people from exercising their right to be heard. Safeguard appeals against return decisions. Five days should not be set as a maximum period for lodging an appeal nor should EU law prevent Member States from postponing returns during judicial review. Ensure detention remains a last resort rather than widen the scope for its use. Deciding whether non-EU nationals are at risk of absconding should always be based on a full individual assessment, and never be presumed automatically. Criminal cases and risks to public policy, public security and national security should continue to be dealt with through criminal law and other relevant measures, not pre-removal detention. \u00a0 Protect personal data in return procedures. Clear and adequate safeguards should be established before personal data collected by Member States is shared with the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. Personal data should be shared with non-EU countries only when necessary and in full compliance with EU law. Postpone discussions on a new border procedure to rapidly return rejected applicants for international protection, as it creates serious fundamental rights risks, until the new asylum framework has been agreed upon. The EU\u2019s Return Directive was adopted in 2008. It provides Member States with common standards and procedures for non-EU nationals who do not fulfil the conditions for entry, stay or residence in a Member State. The European Commission proposes revising the Directive to overcome the difficulties Member States face in returns and to increase the effectiveness of EU return policies. In light of this, the European Parliament asked FRA for this Opinion, which will feed its position on the proposal. It also complements an earlier FRA Opinion on the enhanced role of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency from November 2018 which also partly covers return matters. FRA issues Opinions on specific thematic topics, following requests for advice from the European Parliament, the EU Council or the European Commission.

What should have been a year to celebrate these achievements continued to witness ever-growing intolerance and challenges to human rights. And yet, as the FRA Director Michael O\u2019Flaherty told the European Parliament\u2019s LIBE Committee in November, even in these dark and very worrying times for the state of human rights, there is nevertheless \u201ca strong hard-nosed reality-based optimism and certainly a sense of direction\u201d. Dynamic activities In 2018 the Agency rose to meet those challenges facing the human rights world with a broad range of dynamic activities and numerous outputs. It also appointed a new Scientific Committee \u2013 the guarantor of the quality of the Agency\u2019s work \u2013 whose term of office started in June. All of this took place against the background of the most significant ever restructuring of the Agency, to enable it to work more effectively, better fulfill its mandate and also resulting in an equal gender balance in the senior management team. Special mention deserves to be made of the 2018 Fundamental Rights Forum which took place in September in Vienna. This event \u2013 the most ambitious ever organised by the Agency \u2013 brought together around 700 people to participate in rich and varied discussions and innovative activities such as an Ideathon where artists explored the power of using emotions when communicating about human rights, and a Virtual Zone demonstrating how digital tools can enhance the power of communication. Key outputs of the Forum included the Chair\u2019s Statement and the FRA\u2019s 10 keys to effectively communicating human rights, which was launched at the event. Pioneering studies Throughout 2018, various pioneering FRA studies and innovative tools pointed to the need to regain momentum for human rights. Its antisemitism report revealed widespread and persistent harassment, which leaves many Jews fearing for their safety with thoughts of emigration. A new database on anti-Muslim hatred provided information, reports, data and resources on issues faced by Muslims in the EU today. The Agency\u2019s \u2018Being Black in the EU\u2019 report painted a picture of racism and unbelievable prejudice in 21st century Europe as black people experience difficulties in finding somewhere to live or getting a decent job simply because of the colour of their skin. And its anti-Gypsyism report revealed how Europe\u2019s Roma continue to live life at the level of people in the world\u2019s poorer countries due to persistent inequalities that result in poor sanitation, hunger, and youth unemployment. In addition, many civil society organisations, often the champions of the underprivileged and underrepresented, are being threatened or under pressure in many parts of the EU. A FRA report drew attention to the various challenges civil society is facing that undermine democratic processes and human rights in Europe. Digital technology Several new publications also underscored the Agency\u2019s growing work on fundamental rights aspects of the digital technologies that affect all aspects of life. An updated guide on data protection European law will help anyone involved in the field to make better sense of the recent changes in this area. A focus paper explored the potential for discrimination in using big data for automated decision making, and automated decision-making also featured in the updated guide on how to avoid unlawful profiling. A full listing of all FRA publications in 2018 can be found on the Agency\u2019s website. In 2018, supporting the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals \u2013 with particular reference to those on equality (Goals 5 and 10) and strengthening of institutions (Goal 16) \u2013 remained a priority for the Agency. FRA is exploring how to support the EU and its Member States by providing evidence in monitoring progress on achieving the SDGs. The Agency is committed to contributing data analysis and expertise to help measure the implementation of human rights in practice \u2013 a fact underlined by the Director in his address to the World Bank in November. Migration remained a key issue in 2018 for the Agency, which continued to publish its regular updates on the migration situation in Europe, as well as providing expertise relating to the situation at the hotspots in Greece and Italy. In addition, the EU legislator assigned to the Agency the task of participating in the Fundamental Rights Guidance Board of the newly-established European Travel and Information System (ETIAS) - the fifth instrument of secondary EU law assigning a formal role to the Agency.

As the EU\u2019s unique and independent centre of human rights excellence, FRA will continue to release a wide range of reports and convene events, which examine the state of human rights in the EU 10 years after the Charter entered into force. We will continue to support efforts to deliver on the ground the findings of regional and international human rights monitoring bodies. Here, the agency\u2019s ground-breaking online tool, the EU Fundamental Rights Information System (EFRIS), will provide the one-stop-shop so needed by Member States and the EU to keep track of their obligations and monitoring bodies\u2019 assessments. Turning to particular issues, migration will remain a priority for the agency. It will continue to deliver frontline support in migration hotspots and report regularly its migration related overviews of fundamental rights concerns in various Member States. In addition, the agency will issue a report focusing on the long-term impact of the 2015 asylum emergency. It explores what happened to the people who sought asylum in the EU in 2015 in six EU\u00a0Member States, particularly young people aged between 16 and 24. It assesses the long-term implications on fundamental rights protection, covering issues related to reception and integration. Roma will continue to be a priority for FRA. It will again work with Roma communities on the ground across the EU countries. FRA will collect comparable data that policymakers need to improve the plight of Europe\u2019s largest ethnic minority and often most socially excluded group. The agency\u2019s work on severe labour exploitation of migrant workers will also feature during a conference in June 2019, at the end of Romania\u2019s EU Presidency. It will build on some of the reports already released in 2018, which highlight how severe labour exploitation largely remains undetected and unreported because of its illegal nature and the vulnerabilities of its victims. \u00a0 In 2019, the agency will also publish a series of reports that focus on access to justice for victims of violent crime. One of these will specifically look at domestic violence against women \u2013 physical, sexual or psychological \u2013 which remains a pressing human rights issue in the EU and its Member States. The family of reports will examine how police forces and support services respond when abuse is reported. FRA will also roll out its 2nd EU-wide LGTBI survey, which collects and documents the experiences of discrimination and hate crime against lesbian, gay, trans, bisexual and - for the first time - intersex people across the EU and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The first results are expected at the end of the year. The agency will continue promoting the findings of its survey about the shocking plight of Jews across the EU that were released in December 2018. It will raise awareness about the pervasive and persistent nature of antisemitism that continues to haunt Europe. It will work towards stimulating debate about how best governments and society can move forward to fight the everyday hate, harassment and discrimination that many Jews face. Another landmark survey of which fieldwork starts in 2019 is the agency\u2019s Fundamental Rights Survey. This general population survey will focus on situations that people in the EU face in their everyday lives \u2013 from a fundamental rights perspective \u2013ranging from data protection to equal treatment, access to justice, consumer rights and good administration. As in previous years, FRA will also release its annual Fundamental Rights Report drawing attention to the human rights achievements and challenges facing Europe. This year, there will be a particular focus on how the Sustainable Developments Goals can enhance the promotion and protection of human rights in the EU. All in all, on the anniversary of the EU\u2019s Fundamental Rights Charter, 2019 is shaping up to be yet another busy year for the agency working with the EU for the strength and protection of fundamental rights.", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2019/looking-ahead-2019"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0545", "date": "2018-12-21", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "FRA is now conducting interviews for its new Roma and Travellers survey", "text": "FRA continues to work on Roma inclusion collecting reliable and comparable data on both Roma and Travellers through large scale surveys in close consultation, as well as, in many cases, collaboration with Roma and Traveller communities.

In light of this, the European Parliament asked FRA for its Opinion on the fundamental rights implications of the revisions. Overall, FRA finds that fundamental rights protection could be stronger. For example, the role of the existing Fundamental Rights Officer should be enhanced. This should include: more support staff and resources as the Agency expands; greater safeguards for the Officer\u2019s independence; and an ability to mitigate fundamental rights risks. The complaints process also should be strengthened to make it more effective. For example, the Fundamental Rights Officer should be able to make complaints and report annually on the effectiveness of the process. Deadlines for follow-up to complaints should also be imposed. In addition, the Opinion points to a need to reduce fundamental rights risks when supporting returns. It suggests involving international bodies in governing the monitoring of forced return operations and including officers with child protection expertise in return teams. The Opinion underlines the need to independently monitor returns as the Agency cannot carry out returns and monitor itself. Another area the Opinion focuses on is cooperation with non-EU countries. To reduce risks, the Agency should carry out impact assessments before running operations outside the EU. Fundamental rights experts should also form part of the teams deployed to non-EU countries. In addition, the Agency should not be entrusted with the task of returning irregular migrants who find themselves in third countries but only limit its support to offering technical assistance on returns. FRA\u2019s support in strengthening the Agency\u2019s fundamental rights protection should be better reflected in the regulation. It could also lend its expertise to migration management support teams. The European Border and Coast Guard Agency was created in 2016 replacing its predecessor, Frontex. Much of the Agency\u2019s border management work affects fundamental rights. FRA has been providing it with fundamental rights support since 2009. This Opinion will feed the European\u2019s Parliament position on the European Commission\u2019s proposal.

It is primarily aimed at police and border guard trainers. However, it is also useful for law enforcement and border management officials who need to understand how to do profiling lawfully when carrying out stop and search operations or border checks, for example. The guide can help boost public trust and confidence in policing and border control by reducing biased and seemingly discriminatory checks. This in turn, helps improves the effectiveness of policing and border management, and ultimately increases security and safety. It outlines what is meant by profiling and when it becomes unlawful. Unlawful profiling includes, and goes beyond, discriminatory ethnic profiling. It covers discrimination based on all grounds such as ethnicity, age, nationality and gender, as well as data protection and privacy. In doing so, it underlines how profiling, if done incorrectly, can undermine community relations and trust. It also gives examples of good practices and principles that should be used. These include: Do not use characteristics like ethnicity or religion as the sole basis for singling out individuals. Be respectful, professional and informative in dealing with the public. Base stops and checks on facts not feelings. Always keep accurate and reliable data about profiling so officials can be monitored and held to account. Always respect data protection safeguards in computer-based profiling; understand fundamental rights when building algorithms or using them. The guide builds on FRA\u2019s 2010 edition in light of the EU\u2019s tighter data protection rules that apply since May 2018. It also reflects technological advances, particularly the ever-growing use of computer algorithms to analyse large datasets for profiling. It has also been expanded from law enforcement to also cover border management. In addition, discriminatory profiling on all grounds, rather than just a focus on ethnic profiling, which was thoroughly covered in the first edition. The guide is available in English.

The development of the guidance is a key action set forth in the 2017 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on Reporting on the follow-up to the EU Strategy towards the Eradication of trafficking in human beings and identifying further concrete actions. The Practical guide will assist national authorities in identifying the most suitable jurisdiction among Member States dealing with cases of EU child victims of trafficking or at risk of being victimised. The document will include practical guidance to judges, police officers, social workers, child protection services and other relevant stakeholders.

It continues to flag severely cramped reception and detention centre conditions, particularly in the migration hotspots on the Greek islands. For example, Samos hosted almost six times more asylum seekers than its official capacity. As a result, some camps are being fined or threatened with closure because of the conditions. Informal camps continue in France where conditions are worsening. In Spain, asylum seekers in Melilla and Ceuta are not allowed to travel to mainland Spain without permission. In addition, changing migration laws are making it harder for migrants to claim asylum. For example, in Italy, asylum reforms abolish humanitarian protection and prevent asylum seekers from obtaining legal residency in Italy. The reforms will remain in force, if transposed by Parliament by 4 December. This will make detention and returns more likely, and make it harder for asylum seekers to access local services, such as training. In Hungary, new rules have meant that asylum applications are inadmissible if people arrive from a country where they are not persecuted. This change affects many, as migrants often enter through Serbia. And in Sweden restrictions on granting residence permits to refugees and limiting family reunification until the end of 2019 remains a concern. At the borders, there were reports of ill treatment towards migrants. Croatian and Hungarian police have used force to push back migrants, and in Poland asylum seekers were refused entry at crossing points with Belarus and Ukraine. In Greece, 12,700 migrants entered the Evros region by land, double the number of compared to 2017. There have also been at least 40 deaths; many drowned in the fast-flowing Evros River.

In addition, lack of access to quality education and healthcare can threaten the fundamental rights of children and deprive them of their chance to escape poverty and a better life. Vulnerable children, such as those with disabilities, those from a minority background and migrant children are particularly at risk. As Member States have all ratified the UN\u2019s Child Rights Convention and the European Social Charter, they have an obligation to protect children from harm and exclusion whether it is poverty, neglect or violence. This means offering integrated and professional child protection systems and services that cater to the diverse needs of all children. While existing laws and policies at EU and national level serve to protect children, greater efforts are needed. Encouragingly, the recent European Pillar of Social Rights marks an important step in the right direction. Member States should build on this momentum to help alleviate the child poverty that continues to prevent millions of children from having quality of life and the brighter future they deserve. To make this a reality, they should establish a European Child Guarantee scheme to ensure each and every child has access to basic goods and services essential for their well-being \u2013 a healthy diet, decent housing, healthcare and education.

They help \u2018give a voice\u2019 to people on issues that matter to them, and offer assistance. They also help monitor governments\u2019 and parliaments\u2019 activities, and hold authorities to account for their actions. Their direct contact with people also makes them an invaluable source of practical hands-on advice to policy makers. However, to play this role they need a safe and enabling environment. This paper reveals that this is often not the case: over half of the organisations that responded report that they perceive the general situation is worsening for civil society. The same proportion also says that they face threats or attacks because of their work. This can take the form of verbal and online threats, physical attacks, damage to their property as well as negative media campaigns and threats to their security online. The vast majority of organisations say they have been affected by legal changes. Typically, this relates to taxation, freedom of expression and assembly and transparency or lobbying laws. Financing was also difficult. Three quarters report facing obstacles in resourcing or funding. Organisations point to a lack of core funding, which is crucial for them to operate generally beyond project-financed work.

It reveals how official data on reported antisemitic incidents were missing in eight EU Member States for 2017. In addition, the high-level of under-reporting by victims and different national approaches to data collection make it difficult for policy makers to understand the extent, nature and characteristics of antisemitism in their countries and across the EU. However, antisemitism remains a serious concern which requires action, based on the official and unofficial data that is available. Therefore, greater efforts to tackling under-reporting by encouraging victims and witnesses to report antisemitism is key. In addition, authorities need systems in place to record such incidents. National data collection on hate crime, including antisemitism also needs improving. Here FRA\u2019s compendium of practices for combating hate crime which has examples of how some Member States are recording hate crime could help. FRA also assists Member States in improving hate crime recording and data collection, within the EU\u2019s High Level Group on combating Racism, Xenophobia and other forms of Intolerance.

Rather than attempting to be a comprehensive set of agreed conclusions, it is a compilation of headline action points for FRA, EU Institutions, EU Member States, and others, to work with to help make a difference. Leading by example, FRA has committed to a number of actions. These include: Using its convening power to strengthen the dialogue with human rights institutions and bodies, and civil society to exchange national experiences and promising practices. Working locally to reach out and engage with local authorities, civil society, individuals and communities that are traditionally excluded so they can enjoy their rights. Advising the EU and national governments on how to implement rights more effectively and visibly through its robust, comparable data on the lived rights situation across the EU. Being smarter with our own public messages, drawing on our 10 keys to effective communications to reach a wider audience and trigger common values. Forging even closer ties with institutional partners like the Council of Europe and the UN to confront the threats to human rights. Investigating how digital technologies are shaping public discourse and affecting rights. Helping Member States comply with rights when using EU funds. Diversifying its own workforce and working partnerships. FRA will use the Chair\u2019s Statement at every opportunity to engage with stakeholders throughout the EU.

It also applies to the EU Member States when they implement EU law and to national courts. However, often they do not refer to the Charter. This applies for instance to assessments of the fundamental rights impact of proposed or revisions to laws. In addition, not many policies promote the Charter rights and principles despite being obliged to do so. To explore how Member States and EU agencies could make better use of the Charter, the European Parliament\u2019s President asked FRA to give its Opinion on the challenges and opportunities in implementing the EU\u2019s Fundamental Rights Charter. Member States should offer regular targeted training for national judges and legal practitioners so they are more aware of the Charter and refer to it in their deliberations. This could be supported by a practical legal handbook such as the one FRA is currently working on. Member States, national courts and EU agencies could also regularly exchange information and best practice on implementing the Charter. This would help raise awareness and ensure they learn from each other and have a common understanding of the Charter\u2019s practical application. Using established meetings of judicial and interagency networks could help. An annual dedicated meeting of the Council of the EU\u2019s Fundamental Rights Working Party (FREMP) could be a good venue to create this shared understanding. Member States should also regularly assess and monitor how the Charter is being applied and used in the courts. This could help them identify shortcomings and practical needs to improve its use. Besides pointing to untapped potential, the Opinion also offers examples of the added value of the Charter and how its use can benefit legal practitioners and rightsholders alike. This ranges from national court decisions to expert views using the Charter when screening national bills. The Opinion also suggests EU Institutions should more regularly draw on independent expert advice on fundamental rights when drawing up laws and policies. This could be facilitated by dedicated Charter focal points within EU bodies that could be consulted to ensure that external know-how is consulted wherever needed. As the European Data Protection Supervisor is regularly consulted in the context the processing of personal data, FRA, as the EU\u2019s independent fundamental rights centre of excellence, could be called on more regularly to look into the implications for other rights in the large spectrum of entitlements covered by the Charter. The newest proposal of the European Commission to make funding to Member States conditional to greater use of the Charter in national laws and policies is a welcome development that is hopefully agreed upon by Council and Parliament.

For example, Italy continues its policy of preventing rescue ships from docking and disembarking on its shores. Spain immediately returned some foreigners who entered the country unauthorised en masse, without allowing sufficient time for reviewing asylum claims. The border between Italy and France remains tense, and controls are getting tighter between Austria and Germany. Restricted access to asylum remains problematic in Croatia, Greece, Hungary and Poland with incidents of pushbacks being reported by NGOs. In the Hungarian transit zones, there were NGO reports of food being denied to rejected asylum seekers if they appealed decisions. After intervention by the European Court of Human Rights the practice was discontinued. Reception and detention centre conditions continue to be flagged as an issue particularly in Greece at the Evros border crossing with Turkey and in the migration hotspots on the Greek islands. For example, the island of Lesvos hosted almost three times more asylum seekers than its official capacity. In Chios, there are reports of an inadequate number of showers and sanitary facilities, a lack of electricity, no access to drinking water, violence against women and a lack of medical care. Informal camps in France continue where conditions are worsening. Attacks on migrants persist with instances of police brutality reported in Croatia. There have been a significant number of hate crime incidents in Italy and Spain. In Poland hate crime towards refugees and asylum seekers appears to be growing.

But there are about 86 different types of card throughout the EU. This complicates checks by authorities. Some are also less secure which makes fraud easier. To counter this, the EU proposes regulating to unify the identity documents of EU citizens and the residence cards of non-EU family members of EU citizens living in a Member State other than their own. The EU also proposes to improve security by adding fingerprinting data and facial imagery to the cards\u2019 chip. This would increase reliability and acceptance of these documents as proof of who someone is. It should also reduce fraud. To explore the impact of these changes, the European Parliament asked FRA to give its\u00a0Opinion on the fundamental rights implications of using biometrics in identity documents. The findings include: Given the various purposes for which they are used, identity cards do not need the same level of security as passports, which are used to cross the external border of the EU. For identity cards facial imagery alone should be enough to improve security. If also fingerprints are included then safeguards are needed to reduce the risk of misuse. The duty to collect biometrics from citizens could lead EU Member States to create national databases to store the data. However, this goes against privacy principles as the data should be deleted as soon as they are stored on the card\u2019s chip. Force should not be used when collecting biometric data. When getting fingerprints from children, it should be done in a child-friendly manner. The biometrics of children and older people are less reliable and more likely to result in matching errors. Facial imagery for people with disabilities who have suffered paralysis, for example, may also be less reliable. In such cases, there should either be exemptions from including biometrics or special provisions, such as manual checks by biometrics experts, to avoid the negative consequences of wrong matches.\u00a0 This Opinion raises awareness of some of the potential fundamental rights risks in the proposed Regulation and reminds policy makers to ensure that personal data is only used for the purposes for which it is collected.

Current plans could extend that by 20 million people, including all non-EU citizens residing in EU Member States.\u00a0The EU proposes to revise the current Visa Information System and widen its scope. To explore the impact, the European Parliament asked FRA to provide its Opinion on the fundamental rights implications of revising the Visa Information System. This Opinion advises the EU on how to avoid potential fundamental rights risks when implementing the Visa Information System. It focuses on core data protection principles of only processing as much data as is needed and of using data only for the purposes for which they were collected. It also underlines the need to pay particular attention to several other rights, for example, the right to asylum, child rights, non-discrimination and access to justice. Some of the findings include: Extending VIS to include holders of all long-stay visas and residence permits goes against data retention rules as personal data could be kept forever as permits are renewed. Alternatives should be explored. Adding facial images to biometric matching could result in false matches, without adequate tests of the changing technology. Facial images should only be introduced if the technical reliability of positive matches can be guaranteed. As children grow their biometric data (fingerprints and facial imagery) also change. This poses a reliability problem. Protecting child rights should be further strengthened by findings ways to reduce false matches resulting from data being kept longer than the proposed five year data retention period. This could be through involving biometric experts and not relying on automated processing. New rules on law enforcement access to VIS should contain sufficient safeguards. This would ensure that criminal information systems are consulted first. New rules obliging passenger carriers to check passport details of people travelling to the EU could mistakenly prevent people from boarding. Data entry mismatches between the passport data and VIS should not prevent genuine travellers from boarding. Passengers should be informed why they are stopped. A real-time support centre would minimise the disruption caused by possible errors. As the EU\u2019s large-scale information systems contain a significant amount of inaccurate data, the rights to access, correct and delete personal data should also be improved. This implies informing those affected and setting deadlines for processing requests. VIS was rolled out in November 2015.

However, challenges remain, as FRA\u2019s report, \u2018Making EU citizens\u2019 rights a reality: national courts enforcing freedom of movement and related rights\u2019, shows. It gives examples of how EU citizens from other Member States can be discriminated against, directly or indirectly, because of their nationality. This applies to getting educational grants, housing loans or finding work, for example. The report looks at national case law related to the rights of EU citizens to reside freely in other Member States. It shows how courts in different countries vary in the interpretation of the key EU\u2019s provisions regulating EU citizens\u2019 rights. These include the definition of a family member, sufficient resources, or when they can receive benefit. This can affect people\u2019s everyday life, their family, career and well-being. Here legal guidance and training for legal professionals would help to remove the obstacles that prevent people from fully enjoying their rights when moving freely throughout the EU. The report\u2019s examination of case law also points to restricted voting rights as EU citizens. This particularly applies to voting in municipal or European Parliament elections under the same conditions as nationals of that Member State. Member States should make greater efforts to get EU citizens that are not nationals of the country they live in to be politically active and vote in European and municipal elections. This includes removing administrative barriers such as proof of residence. Freedom of movement is one of the EU\u2019s founding principles. What it means in practice to be an EU citizen was further clarified in EU\u2019s Free Movement Directive of 2004. Member States then had to apply this legislation to their national laws. This has led to various problems in all Member States, as this report shows. Member States should therefore systematically collect data on how the Directive is being applied and identify potential issues of discrimination. This will help improve understanding of the difficulties in applying the Directive. It would also help monitor use of the Directive. European Commission and European Parliament reports have consistently highlighted the difficulties EU citizens face in enjoying their freedom of movement rights. The Commission asked FRA to carry out the first ever collection of EU-wide case law showing how Member States are applying and interpreting freedom of movement in practice. This report contains an analysis of a sample of this case law.

It compared the situation in selected EU Member States between 2011 and 2016. Combined they have earmarked \u20ac1.4 billion of EU funds from 2014 to 2020 to help boost the social inclusion of Roma. However, to date the effect has been negligible. Employment for young Roma, particularly women, has scarcely improved, although education is slightly better. Living in overcrowded housing, in segregated areas or at risk of poverty tend to increase the chances of young Roma stopping education before finishing upper secondary or vocational education. As 80% of Roma are at risk of poverty, ending poverty is key to helping Roma get a higher education. Better education will also help Roma find better and more secure jobs. For young Roma aged 16-24 the situation is particularly acute; as many as two-thirds of them are not in work, education or training. This is over three times the level of similar age groups among the general population in the countries FRA focused on. Traditional gender roles also play a role. For example, there are twice as many working Roma men as women. This underlines the importance of providing early childhood education and care to allow more Roma woman to work. However, it also underscored how education can help Roma escape the poverty cycle. As more and more Roma women are being better educated, it appears they are more likely than men to be in skilled permanent work. The report also underlined how anti-Gypsyism and discrimination can lower employment prospects. It can result in poorer jobs with less job security, benefits and pay. The analysis draws from FRA\u2019s EU Minorities and Discrimination Survey (EU-MIDIS II) survey of Roma in nine EU Member States in 2016: Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Spain. \u00a0", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2018/better-education-key-breaking-roma-poverty-cycle"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0637", "date": "2018-07-23", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "FRA attends informal JHA Ministers\u2019 meeting in Innsbruck", "text": "The Agency made a number of interventions during the meeting, including on the subject of anti-Semitism and on mutual recognition in criminal matters \u2013 where FRA was able to draw on its rich evidence base and its ongoing research to underline the importance of fundamental rights compliance and people\u2019s experiences of rights in practice.

Under the theme \u2018A Europe that protects\u2019, the focus will be on the creation of a resilient and strict asylum and migration system to prevent uncontrolled migration. According to a press release from the Ministry of the Interior, this includes considerations relating to return centres in third countries. In his speech at the \u201cEuropa Forum Wachau\u201d, the Austrian Chancellor called for more financial means for Frontex border guards and a wider mandate. Suggestions include allowing Frontex to negotiate with and operate in third countries, particularly in northern Africa, to stop people embarking on journeys to Europe. The UNHCR urged the Austrian Presidency to ensure access to territory for protection seekers and uphold the right to asylum. Italy\u2019s new government changed its approach to permitting the disembarkation of migrants rescued at sea. In line with this new approach, several boats were not allowed to dock. For example, on 10 June, the government refused to allow the Aquarius rescue boat carrying more than 600 migrants to dock. On 20 June, a Danish container ship involved in a rescue operation by the Italian Coast Guard, the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre, was held outside the port of Pozzallo for four days, before being authorised to dock. On 27 June, after Italy refused passengers to disembark from the Lifeline, the German NGO rescue boat was eventually allowed to dock in Malta on 27 June upon a commitment by eight countries to host the 234 migrants rescued. On 30 June, Italy refused access to the Spanish NGO ship Open Arms, which rescued 59 migrants as they tried to cross the Mediterranean Sea from Libya, the media reported. The Association for Juridical Studies on Immigration (ASGI) has taken a stand against the Italian government\u2019s decision, claiming that it breaches international obligations. The Minister of the Interior of Germany announced a migration masterplan including \u201cmeasures to order, control and limit immigration\u201d. For example, the plan reiterates the importance of so-called \u2018anchor centres\u2019 (AnKER Centres \u2013 zentrale Aufnahme-, Entscheidungs- und R\u00fcckf\u00fchrungseinrichtungen). These are planned centres where asylum seekers will be registered, have their cases assessed and potentially be returned from. The plan also envisages increased EU border protection and \u201cdisembarkation platforms\" in North Africa. The plan calls for transit centres at the German-Austrian border, as well as the refusal of Dublin returnees at the border \u2013 a position that was not supported by the rest of the government\u2019s coalition. NGOs condemned the plan for focusing on rules and sanctions. The German President criticised the government\u2019s migration policy dispute as \u201cexcessively harsh\u201d. In Greece, migration hotspots reception centres on the islands of Lesvos, Samos and Chios remained severely overcrowded. This is despite falling number of arrivals. The Hungarian Parliament adopted the Seventh Amendment to the Fundamental Law and a legislative package called \u201cStop Soros\u201d, amending the Aliens, Asylum and Police Acts as well as the Criminal Code. The new rules prohibit the settlement of non-European immigrants into Hungary; further restrict the right to asylum; and introduce immigration restraining orders, a new legal institution entailing prohibition of entry and stay in a designated area of the country. Furthermore, it criminalises \u201caiding and supporting illegal migration\u201d. Any form of assistance to migrants who have entered Hungary in an irregular manner constitutes a criminal office, which is punished by custodial arrest or, in aggravated circumstances, imprisonment up to one year (e.g. in case of material support to irregular migrants, organisations or individuals operating within the 8 km zone near the border; or providing assistance on a regular basis). The Council of Europe\u2019s Venice Commission criticised key provisions of the legislation as it seriously impairs legitimate NGO work.

Roma Holocaust Memorial Day honours the thousands of victims and offers a chance to learn from the past to build a better future for today\u2019s Roma. The Roma are Europe\u2019s largest ethnic minority. Yet they have long been persecuted. Antigypsyism today remains a problem in many Member States: 36% of Roma have been victims of harassment motivated by hatred and 41% have faced discrimination in the last five years. This is according to figures from FRA\u2019s second minorities and discrimination survey of Roma across nine EU Member States. The survey also points to little improvement over nearly a decade. Antigypsyism continues to be a formidable barrier to the implementation of EU and national policies to improve the life chances and living standards for Roma. This underlines the need for Member States to improve and monitor the effectiveness of measures that seek to advance Roma integration and combat antigypsyism. Member States should also boost measures to combat hate crime and hate speech towards Roma. The atrocities of the past should be a constant reminder of the dangers of allowing hatred to go unpunished. Member States should send a signal that persecution and discrimination towards Roma should not be tolerated across an EU that stands for respect, freedom and equality.

Let us use this anniversary to galvanise our efforts so that the rights of everyone across Europe are respected.\u201d \u201cThe Vienna Declaration affirms the indivisibility of all human rights, whether civil and political rights or economic, social and cultural rights,\u201d says Birgit Van Hout, Regional Representative for Europe of the UN\u2019s Human Rights body. \u201cYet, the latter set of rights are not always given the same importance. We hope this will change with the adoption by EU Member States of the European Social Pillar and the Sustainable Development Goals, so no one is left behind.\" In June 1993, world leaders convened and committed to advancing human rights. They underlined how human rights contribute to peace and security as well as social and economic development. As Europe faces growing intolerance and greater inequalities, this message remains as true today as it did back then. It also reaffirmed the principle that human rights are universal, applying to everyone, and should be promoted and protected by all countries. With many people across society feeling alienated, marginalised and under attack, a concerted effort is needed to unite and halt the erosion of support for human rights that is happening in many corners of Europe. This has led to many parts of society \u2013 the young, the old, women, as well as minorities and migrants \u2013 suffering discrimination, intolerance and hate in their daily lives. After 25 years, we have built a solid base of laws and institutions across the EU to promote and protect rights. The EU\u2019s Fundamental Rights Charter is a case in point. It offers human rights guarantees for everyone across the EU for issues ranging from education to employment, from data protection to justice. FRA and the UN will continue to work hand-in-hand to build on the solid base that we already have. Together with the EU and its Member States we will further our efforts to ensure Europe delivers in practice on its existing laws and policies.

The means are there. But we need political will to make human rights a reality for everybody in society. \u201d He also spoke of the challenges facing civil society organisations working on human rights in the EU: \u201cIt is no less important to acknowledge that the rich and dynamic tapestry of European civil society is one of the fundamental pillars of our democracies and of the rule of law. Across the EU, NGOs and other civil society actors need to be valued and respected as partners, not labelled as threats. Criminalising humanitarianism can never be right.\u201d However, he also gave a more upbeat look to the future: \u201cIn spite of the challenges facing the system of human rights protection in Europe, I am convinced that it is fit for purpose, but can always be strengthened.

In the past years, there have been increasing challenges across the board:\u00a0 access to funding, shifting legal landscapes,\u00a0 heightened concerns for activists\u2019 physical and digital safety, and many question marks around effective and meaningful access to the decision making process. In a number of EU Member States we have seen security concerns used as a pretext to curtail freedom of assembly and of association; anti-money laundering regulations misinterpreted and turned against CSOs; and - in some countries - noticeable and inacceptable efforts to criminalise humanitarian action, including for refugee support. More worrying still, we have seen civil society organisations leaving certain EU countries. Such developments used to be unthinkable inside the EU. While the European Commission included support to civil society prominently in the multiannual financial framework and a new Justice, Rights and Values Fund, adopted on 30 May this year, there is further need for a renewed support to democracy and civil society. We all recognise the legitimate concerns of governments, their duty to regulate, and their rights to decide which organisations to fund and the manner in which they do so. But it is crucial that this be done in a fair and transparent manner, in full respect of national, EU and international law. FRA stands ready to support all EU governments in this regard, building on the many promising practices we have seen on the ground.\u201d The Fundamental Rights Platform (FRP) is FRA\u2019s channel for cooperation and information exchange with civil society organisations active in the field of fundamental rights. Its Advisory Panel convened in Vienna on 14-15 June to discuss the Platform\u2019s future development, to address questions regarding challenges to civil society space in the EU, and to provide input for the upcoming Fundamental Rights Forum 2018. The FRA report on \u2018Challenges facing civil society organisations working on human rights in the EU\u2019 has already been presented in Poland (14 March), Bulgaria (30 May), and the Agency will be discussing its findings with civil society and government in Romania (19 June) and Hungary (5 July). \u00a0Presentations in Ireland, Portugal and Slovakia are foreseen for the autumn. The report has also been presented to the Council of the European Union\u2019s FREMP and COHOM Working Parties (December 2017), the Council of Europe (January), the OSCE-ODIHR (March and April), and the European Parliament\u2019s LIBE Committee (April).

These include suffering abuse and harassment from employers with many working in fear of maltreatment, of losing their job or of deportation. Often they lack privacy having to share rooms with the people they look after. They are frequently poorly paid and have to work up to 18 hours a day with short breaks and little chance of days off. The paper also explores how exploitation can happen. For example, often work permits are tied to a particular employer. This creates dependency which can be abused, especially when they also live at work. Sometimes employers also excessively control and monitor their workers, not letting them talk to others outside of work; some even withhold their workers\u2019 passports. Another reason is the lack of inspections. This is sometimes because of the legal and practical challenges of inspecting private homes which may be not considered workplaces in some countries. As a result victims often have limited opportunities to complain. Poor access to victim support networks and low rights awareness compound the problem. To help minimise the risk of exploitation, Member States should find ways to reduce dependency on a single employer. This could be through granting domestic workers the right to switch employers during the term of their visa. They should also revise national laws to grant domestic workers better working conditions, stronger protection and ensure labour inspections extend to domestic work. Providing financial benefits such as tax credits, for employers who offer formal terms and conditions to domestic workers, is one example that is already been used in some Member States. In addition, the International Labour Organisation\u2019s Domestic Workers Convention provides a framework for decent working conditions. However, seven years after it was adopted in June 2011, only six EU Member States - Belgium, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Portugal - have ratified it. More Member States should do so to allow domestic workers enjoy their right to fair working conditions. Member States should also ensure targeted support, in line with the EU\u2019s Victims\u2019 Rights Directive, is available, accessible and meets the needs of domestic workers who have been exploited. They should also carry out outreach campaigns to inform workers of working conditions and their rights so they clearly understand their terms of employment. They should also strive for a climate of zero tolerance towards exploitation among the general public. This should include raising awareness about the vital role domestic workers play in supporting and enabling society to balance the demands of today\u2019s world. The findings provide a snapshot of the experiences of 51 exploited migrant women who were employed as domestic workers in the EU. It is the first of a series of papers that captures the views and experiences of victims of labour exploitation.

Algorithms, based on machine learning and artificial intelligence, are increasingly harnessing and analysing such data. This leads to automated decision making and faster data processing. FRA\u2019s focus paper on #BigData: Discrimination in data-supported decision making starts to explore the fundamental rights impact of developments in big data and how it is being used as a prelude to wider research in this area. It acknowledges how big data can deliver better, more personalised services. Big data can also contribute to more informed and objective decisions, minimising existing prejudices that may arise when humans make decisions. However, the paper also points to serious misgivings that need addressing. There is a potential for in-built bias that leads to discrimination in applications and services, for example when calculating insurance premiums or assessing job applications. This can result from the assumptions or biased datasets used to build the algorithms. Poor, incomplete, incorrect or outdated data may also further reinforce bias. It may not be possible to generalise or predict outcomes for one group of people based on information about another group. For instance, ethnic minorities may be less likely to be called to interview because the algorithm was written using data where ethnic minorities performed worse. To help improve fundamental rights compliance, the paper gives examples of what could be done: Being transparent about how algorithms were built so others can detect and rectify discriminatory applications. Assessing the impact of potential biases and abuses resulting from algorithms. Assessing the quality of all data collected and used for building algorithms. Ensuring how algorithms are built and operate can be meaningfully explained so people can challenge data-supported decisions. The use of data and automated decision-making can improve the way decisions are made, as long as the thinking behind those decisions is fully understood and does not impact negatively on fundamental rights. Although data protection principles provide some guidance on the use of algorithms, there is more that needs to be considered. This requires strong collaboration between statisticians, lawyers, social scientists, computer scientists and subject area experts. In this way, a truly fundamental rights-compliant approach can be developed. \u00a0", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2018/4-possible-ways-avoid-big-data-bias"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0695", "date": "2018-05-28", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Border tensions and migrant suffering continue to feature in Member States", "text": "Read the May 2018 highlights\u00a0>> Looking at the situation across 14 EU Member States, the report reveals how migrants are being sent back without the chance to lodge claims for international protection in France, Croatia, Spain, Hungary, Poland and Greece. Austria, Denmark, France, Germany and Sweden prolonged internal border controls in the Schengen area for another six months. Between Italy and France, tensions remained high with reports of inappropriate practices being carried out by French border police. For those already in the EU, recurring problems remain. Overcrowding continues to be an issue. In Greece, the Reception and Identification Centres on the Aegean islands have twice as many people as places. In Evros, at the Turkish land border, hundreds of people, including many children, are placed in inadequate local police detention facilities. In Spain, NGOs said the reception system is about to collapse, particularly in Madrid, Barcelona and Bilbao, with many people living in the streets or in homeless shelters. Women and children continue to suffer. For example, a study revealed that 95% of women arriving in Italy had suffered sexual violence during their journey, 17% of whom in more than one country. In Hungary, human trafficking seems to be rising. In addition, its authorities\u2019 ability to detect potential trafficking victims among asylum applicants in the Hungarian transit zones appears to have worsened over the past three years, according to a Council of Europe report; children between 14-18 years of age in closed facilities are particularly vulnerable.

For example, integration strategies work best when there is local empowerment and delegated decision making at the local level in the towns and cities rather than far away in capital cities. Linked to this, better outcomes invariably happen when you involve local authorities, migrants and the local community in conversations that affect them. He also recognised how cities are incubators of promising practices. They can be laboratories of innovative ideas that can be transferred elsewhere. Here he cited real-life examples, such as an initiative from Rotterdam which encouraged migrants to act as volunteers in the communities and one from Athens where language training was offered to migrant parents in the schools their children were attending. However, he also acknowledged that while promising practices exist, there are also lots of examples were conflicts arise. He warned against neglecting the wider context, the macro dimension at the global, European or national level while focusing on local solutions. Both sides of the equation are equally important, especially as many decisions may be taken at the national not local level. Here he gave the example of providing accommodation for migrants where the housing authority in some countries resides in the capital. The diverse models of governance with different levels of centralised control that exist across the EU may have a huge impact on what cities can deliver. A human rights-based approach could help. This is because human right commitments are grounded in law. Therefore they are enforceable and Member States can be held accountable. In addition, existing legal obligations are comprehensive in terms of engaging with the situations that are proving most difficult for all of us. Here he drew attention to the European Convention on Human Rights, UN Treaties and of course, the EU\u2019S Charter of Fundamental Rights. They provide guidance and advice across all areas of life, from housing to employment, from combatting hate speech to establishing clear procedures for asylum. Human rights also belong to everyone, not just one group. As a result they are driver for integration as they apply to both the local community and the migrant community. He concluded by drawing inspiration from the many networks of cities that are springing up. The network of human rights cities, the European coalition of cities against racism and many others, all have the potential to assist us. They can show us how cities, towns and villages can all help meet Europe\u2019s migration challenges.", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2018/going-local-help-address-migration-challenges"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0703", "date": "2018-05-18", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Workshop discusses hate crime recording in Bratislava", "text": "The aim of the event was to raise awareness of the need to properly record hate crimes, to identify gaps in existing hate crime recording and data collection frameworks, and to discuss practical steps to improve these frameworks.

It spoke of how that many LGBT people cannot be themselves in their daily lives. Many were scared of simply holding hands in public with their same-sex partner. It also gave an indication of the levels of fear, discrimination, and hate that many faced when being themselves all across the EU back then. The survey findings helped raise awareness about the suffering many LGBTI people regularly face in their daily lives. The findings also helped focus efforts to bring about the change that LGBTI communities have long advocated for. This day, celebrating sexual and gender diversity, is a call to keep strengthening alliances. For example, this year once again FRA will join the Diplomats for Equality initiative to promote the rights of LGBTI people. In this way, organisations and communities can work together to help foster tolerance and understanding, ensure safety, fight violence, and push to change laws and policies. Indeed, a number of advances have already been made reflecting growing recognition among policy makers to end inequalities. For instance, in 2015 the European Commission published a list of actions to advance LGBTI equality. This list offers guidance to Member States on how to ensure legal protection of LGBTI people and their families, and how to monitor and enforce existing rights. In parallel, in Member States changes are afoot: Same-sex marriage is being increasingly recognised; guidance for medical professionals is becoming more trans-friendly; and gender markers in official documentation are starting to offer alternatives to male or female to take into consideration intersex people. However, to see whether such changes in laws and policies are mirrored in societal attitudes, FRA will repeat its survey on hate crime and discrimination against LGBT people in 2019. This time it will also cover the experiences of intersex people. The results will help guide future initiatives and alliances to realign policies with reality on the ground.

It holds a mirror to our society to tell it how it really is,\u201d says FRA Director Michael O\u2019Flaherty. \u201cTo keep power in check, Member States need to refrain from interfering with press freedoms. They need to ensure journalists can freely probe and challenge while exposing legitimate concerns.\u201d A recent BBC poll found that most Europeans believe their countries has become more polarised than a decade ago; almost a half see their societies as less tolerant. This is partly being driven by populist rhetoric gaining traction in many places coupled with challenges to the rule of law and judicial systems. The media plays a vital role in informing people and exposing untruths, rights violations, injustice and abuses of power. It engages people in issues that society need to be aware of and empowers them to make informed decisions. It also holds politicians and governments accountable for their actions, keeping record of what was said and done before. However, Reporters Without Borders\u2019 2018 press freedom index points to worrying tendencies in Europe, traditionally a safer haven for journalists. Journalists are being threatened and attacked repeatedly for doing their job, as a 2016 FRA paper also noted. The horrific murders in Slovakia of the journalist J\u00e1n Kuciak and his fiancee, Martina Ku\u0161n\u00edrov\u00e1, in March this year and the investigative reporter, Daphne Caruana Galizia, in Malta in October 2017, were poignant testimonies of the extreme dangers journalists can face. They are also confronted with online intimidation. Female journalists are particularly on the receiving end of abusive comments and threats left by readers. This risks jeopardising balanced media coverage of such issues as refugee integration or anti-racist demonstrations. Media consolidation is also placing pressure on the work of the media. Journalists may face commercial influence over editorial content as more and more media outlets are in the hands of fewer owners. Such abuse and pressure risks undermining press freedom, freedom of information and freedom of expression. This calls for greater efforts to counter this challenges and protect the media. The European Commission\u2019s recent whistleblower rules are an example of what can be done to help. Offering stronger guarantees to protect sources will relieve some of the pressure journalists face when exposing injustice and speaking freely to defend the many whose rights have been violated.", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2018/help-media-speak-out-against-injustice"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0717", "date": "2018-04-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Visit of the office of Hungary\u2019s Fundamental Rights Commissioner", "text": "The visit aimed at continuing and further strengthening cooperation between the Agency and the Hungarian NHRI.

This will allow national authorities make best use of existing data, detect multiple identities and counter identity fraud, and to carry out rapid and effective checks. They propose creating a European search portal to provide a \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 for searching across multiple systems. There will be a way to search existing databases and match biometric data, such as fingerprints or facial images. A common identity repository will pool basic biographical and biometric information, such as names and dates of birth of non-EU citizens, so that they can be reliably identified. In addition, a multiple-identity detector will flag cases where one person has different identities across the different systems. To explore the impact of such systems, the European Parliament asked the Agency to provide its Opinion on the fundamental rights implications of the proposed interoperability Regulations. The suggestions include: Ensuring a clear legal basis (\u2018legal foreseeability\u2019): This applies to using the common identity repository to check people\u2019s identity. Why these police checks need to be carried out, and how, must be clearly defined at EU level. Controlling law enforcement access: Law enforcement authorities are allowed to access EU databases to fight terrorism and serious crime. This is meant to allow them to check if people are in the systems. However, police databases should always be checked first and then clearance from an independent verifier should be sought before queries to EU databases. Improving data quality: Data entry or processing errors can lead to discrimination, mistaken identity or accusations that people are hiding their identity. Member States should be obliged to correct mistakes and flag inconsistencies. The EU should also establish an EU-wide handling mechanism for accessing, correcting and deleting inaccurate personal data. Limiting the scope of use: The future European Criminal Record Information System for non-EU nationals (ECRIS-TCN) proposes including the fingerprints of all those who are guilty of offences. Depending on each Member State\u2019s national law, these range from serious crime to misdemeanors. Such data should not be in the common identity repository as it appears to go beyond the scope of use of data stored in ECRIS-TCN system. Informing people: With interoperable systems it is more complex to inform people if and how their data are being used. The proposals should strengthen the right to information, including making the information child-friendly and in a language the person affected understands. Mainstreaming fundamental rights: Interoperability may pose fundamental rights challenges that will become known only during implementation. Therefore, monitoring and impact evaluations should explicitly also cover fundamental rights. The EU already has a number of large-scale border management IT systems with plans to create more. Some are being revised. They help deal with visas, asylum applications, as well as internal security to track those who have been refused entry into the EU or are linked to criminal offences. This Opinion advises the EU on how to avoid potential fundamental rights pitfalls in the proposed Regulations. It encourages respect for the core data protection principles of only sharing as much data as is needed and of limiting how such data are used. It also underlines the wider impact on other rights which should be recognised in the proposals. These include access to justice, the right to asylum and child rights as well as non-discrimination which is already covered. FRA issues Opinions on specific thematic topics, following requests for advice from the European Parliament, the EU Council or the European Commission.

For the first time in Italy, but also in the EU, a general legislative measure has been used for protecting unaccompanied migrant children. In particular, it allows youth courts to create lists of volunteer guardians for unaccompanied children. This approach could become a promising practice in the EU. It establishes a flexible guardianship system that can respond to changing needs, is less costly than a system based on professional guardians and, more importantly, actively involves society in the destination country. However, there are potential risks, particularly related to managing, supporting and overseeing a high number of people who may decide to become volunteer guardians. For the first phase of selection and training of volunteer guardians in the regions under its responsibility, the Italian Independent Authority for Children and Adolescents received support from the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) as well as other actors.

In Greece, there are rising numbers of families, pregnant women and torture victims at the border between Greece and Turkey who risk being persecuted as they are forcibly ejected from the EU. For those already in the EU, recurring problems remain. In Spain for example, the reception conditions for the growing number of newly-arrived migrants remained critical and the situation appears to be getting worse. According to the Spanish Ombudsperson, mothers with babies and unaccompanied children were held in prison-like cells, and men were sleeping on the floor with no heating. There were also delays in processing asylum claims. In Greece, migration hotspots reception centres on the islands of Lesvos, Samos and Chios remain overcrowded. This is despite falling number of arrivals. Growing intolerance towards migrants is another worry. In Hungary, for example, the government\u2019s ever stronger anti-migrant stance, has led to a hardening of attitudes among the general public towards migrants. As a result xenophobia is on the rise, according to NGOs in the country. In Germany, attacks against refugees are rising again.

This was the first legally binding instrument which requires countries to have laws against different forms of violence against women. The EU signed up to the Convention in 2017. It sent a further powerful signal to society of the need to promote and protect women\u2019s rights in these turbulent times. This was also the focus of the European Commission\u2019s 3rd annual Fundamental Rights Colloquium. Here FRA contributed by outlining human rights commitments and gave telling examples of the challenges women have faced from across the EU over the last three years. The challenges of violence, hate and discrimination are best revealed through surveys. They provide valuable insights that other official data on recorded crime may often miss. Under-reporting of incidents of discrimination, harassment and violence is common. It often masks true levels of gender based-violence. This may be especially the case for marginalised groups like migrant women and girls who are most at risk of sexual and gender-based violence. Members of ethnic minorities may also suffer because of their gender and ethnicity. In September this year, FRA will throw the spotlight on the discrimination experiences of Roma and migrant women, drawing from its second EU minorities and discrimination survey. All this points to the need for better data and the better use of existing data through cooperation and information sharing. This and other such issues will be examined at next session of the UN\u2019s Commission on the Status of Women. One of its aims is to explore how best to accelerate implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action to achieve concrete results by 2020.

In Hungary the border transit zone policy has tightened with the daily cap of people being admitted falling from ten to two. This may lead to people left waiting in Serbia for years. In addition, Austria, Denmark, France, Germany and Sweden continue to maintain temporary border controls. Although asylum applications across the EU almost halved in 2017 compared to 2016, it varied from country to country. In most Member States numbers continued to fall, with the exception of France, Greece and Spain. For those already in the EU, problems remain. The situation of people arriving irregularly in Spain by sea remained critical. According to the Ministry of Interior, more than 22,100 people arrived in 2017 \u2013 almost triple the number in 2016. Last year, some 223 people died trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea to reach Spain, while this year, at least 75 have already lost their lives. Newcomers continued to face difficulties accessing asylum procedures, and the identification and treatment of vulnerable people, such as children, women or victims of trafficking remained inappropriate. In Greece, in the hotspots on the islands of Chios and Samos, several people including families with very small children were facing harsh weather conditions in tents without heating. In France, the authorities continued to take \u2013 sometimes violent \u2013 evacuation measures against informal camps reappearing in the north of France at Calais and Grande-Synthe, where several hundred people are living, NGOs reported. Many children in Ventimiglia, Italy, are living in informal camps in appalling conditions or in the local reception centre together with adult asylum seekers, according to media reports. In Sicily, the NGO \u2018Terres des Hommes\u2019 reported that some children who arrived from Libya in extremely poor psychological and physical condition had to wait up to 13 months in local first reception centres before being transferred to reception centres for children. Family reunification also posed difficulties in many places. Over 3,800 asylum seekers eligible for family reunification under the Dublin Regulation have been waiting over six months in Greece to depart for Germany. In the Netherlands, applications for family reunification take on average over 10 months, instead of the six prescribed by law. In Germany and Sweden, laws limit family reunification and in Croatia reunification procedures are complex.

The EU\u2019s Victims\u2019 Rights Directive of 2012 was a significant milestone in setting out minimum binding standards. They grant people who have been victims of crime the right to understand and be understood, the right to receive support and the right to individual assessment. They also reinforce existing rights, including the right to be informed. To date, progress across Member States has been slow since the deadline to implement the Directive passed in 2015. Much still remains to be done. In most Member States, the rights of all victims to receive appropriate support is yet to become reality. Many\u2013 including women or victims of racism \u2013 still live in fear of being attacked again. And their right to be properly involved in criminal proceedings is often not realised. For its part, FRA will continue to support the development of victims\u2019 rights in the EU. Its surveys continue to uncover how often people, such as women, children and minorities, fall victim to crime. Its research looks into why under-reporting is so high and identifies promising practices that help to build more inclusive justice systems for victims. As FRA and others have shown, women in particular are often attacked, harassed and discriminated against. In 2017, the EU signed the Council of Europe\u2019s Convention against violence against women (\u2018Istanbul Convention\u2019). Alongside all other EU Member States that have also signed, this should mark a turning point in preventing and protecting all women from gender-based violence. EU Member States must review their criminal codes to make sure that violence against women is criminalised. This includes all forms of non-consensual sexual acts, psychological violence, and stalking. It also applies to domestic violence committed against a \u2013 current or former \u2013 partner. In addition, women must also have access to specialist support. This is one example of how the rights of one group of victims, women, are being better protected. It is time for Member States to grant all victims their legally entitled rights to be properly protected, supported and to justice. \u00a0", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2018/grant-victims-access-justice-realise-their-fundamental-rights-too"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0794", "date": "2018-02-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Helping to communicate human rights better", "text": "The guidance has been summarised in a meeting report of a seminar held by the Agency from 23 to 24 January.

Several re-introduced border controls and kept them throughout 2017. Migrants were also reportedly ill-treated by some police and border guards. In addition, some were not given the chance to apply for protection. Inadequate living conditions in reception centres even in several Member States were asylum applicants are falling. Violence against women and a lack of specialist support for vulnerable people like children and trauma victims also remain an issue. Restrictive asylum procedures in border or transit zones and delays in registering claims. Lengthy procedures or not sparing enough time for assessing claims also posed problems. In many EU Member States migrants lacked access to legal aid, interpretation and information. Leaving unaccompanied children vulnerable despite falling numbers. In most Member States, the quality of child reception facilities, appointment of guardians, access to the asylum procedure and obstacles related to family reunification remained key issues. Many received no or little education. Immigration detention should be a measure of last resort. However, the lack of legal assistance and information during detention, inadequate conditions and inhumane treatment, and immigration detention of vulnerable people remain key concerns. It also reveals improvements in asylum systems and the professional capacity of staff since the 2015 migration peak. The report also lists the top three concerns in each of the Member States covered.

This is profoundly affecting social relations, business, private and public services which are more and more interconnected through smartphones and other connected devices. As a result vast amounts of data, often personal, are being amassed and processed in increasingly complex and opaque ways. \u00a0 Many benefits but challenges remain People around the world are reaping the benefits of these changing times: Search engines provide access to a wealth of information and knowledge; and social networking allows people around the world to communicate, express opinions and mobilise support for causes they feel passionate about. Technology and personal data processing are also indispensable tools for state authorities in their fight against crime and terrorism. Big data, a technology allowing the collection, storage and analysis of large amounts of information to identify patterns and predict behaviour, is also being harnessed in many ways to gain new insights and enhance productivity. But despite this, substantial challenges exist. Regulators and lawmakers need to keep track of the pace and complexity of change. Mass surveillance and technologies allow globalised storage and processing of personal information and bulk access to data that may infringe the right to privacy and freedom of expression. Massive data sets can be further analysed to spot patterns yielding unprecedented insight into human behaviour and private life. Algorithms can be used for automated decision making. All this can be a worry if, for example, a person\u2019s health or financial situation can be inferred by corporations using automated artificial intelligence to set health insurance premiums or to offer credit. Strengthening protection More than ever there is a growing need for the robust protection of personal data, a right safeguarded by both European Union and Council of Europe instruments. Further guarantees should be offered from May this year, when the EU\u2019s reformed data protection rules will apply in the EU. They aim to empower users through greater control of their personal data. Users will have the \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019, a \u2018right of data portability\u2019, greater access to their data and the possibility to demand the end of use of their data. They can also seek compensation for rights violations. The rules will apply to everything that holds or uses personal data in and out of Europe. They aim to ensure data protection by design and by default. This means safeguards should be inbuilt to products and services from the earliest stage of development, and privacy-friendly default settings should become the norm \u2013 for example on social networks or mobile apps. In this fast moving area and with these new rules on the horizon, FRA will offer further support in the shape of its updated handbook on European data protection law.

Many sought refuge, escaping war and persecution. Many were skilled professionals and many were children. There are parallels to the situation today where the number of displaced people has again reached the same levels; currently it stands at over 65 million people worldwide. The policy of antisemitism and targeting other victims by the Nazi regime led to increasing numbers of refugees in Europe fleeing to find sanctuary elsewhere. Then, as can be seen in some places today, there was reluctance on the part of governments to find solutions. This is why in 1938, the Evian Conference was convened to seek commitments from other countries to accept more Jewish refugees. Sadly, it resulted in almost no change in the immigration policies in most of the attending nations. It was only after the war that the development of international standards on refugee protection really took off. Back then, a culture of prejudice, racism, and stereotyping and fear of refugees developed, fueled by an economic crisis and populist rhetoric by those in power. Shades of this can be found today underlining the perils of racism, hate and indifference. Learning from the Holocaust gives us the benefit of hindsight to be in a better place to help refugees today. It points to the importance of promoting and safeguarding human rights, such as equality and the protection of minorities. It shows what was done in the past to help refugees such as the \u2018Kindertransport\u2019 initiative that brought thousands of unaccompanied children to the UK. It also humanises the plight of refugees escaping tyranny. There are many other examples of how we can apply lessons learnt from the experiences of refugees before, during and after the Holocaust to the current situation. The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, of which FRA is a partner, has a useful blog called \u2018Seeking protection\u2019 which explores many of these lessons. FRA\u2019s has also developed online training material for teaching about fundamental rights and the Holocaust to public officials, which also looks explicitly at refugees during the Holocaust and the impact of the Evian conference. The aftermath of World War 2 led to a vast array of human right instruments which countries around the world have since signed up to and to the development of the current human rights infrastructure.

He spoke of the need to counter hate speech, hate crime and discrimination, as some of the root causes of terrorism and radicalisation. Citing evidence from a recent survey that covered Muslim ethnic minorities and immigrants, he showed how hate-motivated harassment and violence as well as discrimination lower the overall high sense of attachment that this community normally feels towards their country of residence. He advocated for approaches that engage local communities and also tackle socio-economic deprivation. He also touched upon the question of interoperability of EU frontier databases. While interoperability can offer new possibilities, e.g. for tracing missing children, safeguards are needed that correspond with the sensitivity of the data collected. In, addition, interoperability should not amplify the problems of inaccurate or incorrect data that could result in false accusations or wasted time and resources chasing false leads. The Director warned against framing migration as a security issue, a point also made by the EU\u2019s Commissioner for the Security Union. While we must identify terrorists who hide among migrants, we should not question the right of asylum seekers to safety and humane treatment. He referred to the EU\u2019s Terrorism Directive with its in-built human rights safeguards. His concern was that the safeguards are properly transposed into national legislation. He mentioned the need to ensure respect for the Directive\u2019s important provisions on protecting and supporting the rights of victims of terrorism.

It builds on its 2017 expert meeting that brought together an unusually wide range of disciplines and professions to share experiences on how to better communicate fundamental rights and freedoms in a world that is growing increasingly intolerant. The seminar aims to share hands-on best practices in communicating rights that will form the basis of a practical communicating human rights checklist for others to share and use. Such discussions will provide a useful backdrop to the Forum in September. It will also continue to mine the rich #FactNotFake data collected from its second minorities and migrants discrimination and integration survey. Drawing on findings from the largest EU-wide survey of experiences of and attitudes towards some of Europe\u2019s most marginalised communities, including Roma and various immigrant groups, it will release a series of targeted thematic reports. They will look at what it is like being black in the EU, as well as focus on how women from minority or immigrant groups experience life in the EU. Such nuanced insights should provide policy makers with the data they need to create more effective targeted support. Roma will be the subject of another thematic report looking specifically at the transition from education to employment which is key driver to escaping the vicious cycle of poverty many Roma are trapped in. Staying with Roma, this year will also see other related Roma findings come to light such as its report that assesses how well Roma integration measures have been in practice (April). Then in November the report from the Agency\u2019s local engagement for Roma inclusion work that sought to find ways to empower Roma in getting directly involved in decisions that affect them. Migration will again be a strong focus of the Agency\u2019s work in 2018. Throughout the year, it will continue its series of periodic reports on migration-related fundamental rights concerns. It will also continue to provide frontline support to migration hotspots in Italy and Greece. In addition, in March, it will publish a major report that looked at the fundamental rights implications of using biometrics, such as fingerprinting, in border management. As the reform of the EU\u2019s data protection rules will take effect from May, the Agency will be there with practical hands-on guidance. Its popular handbook on data protection law will be re-released with updated simple explanations and examples from European case law. It will guide legal professionals unfamiliar with data protection rules of these rules and how they are applied in practice. Further practical support to practitioners such as law enforcement officials will be released later in the year in the shape of a guide on preventing unlawful profiling. Building on FRA\u2019s 2010 guide that included data on ethnic minority, immigrant and Roma groups\u2019 experiences of police stops, this new guide will provide a general update. It will take into account legal and technological developments. The scope will also be expanded to include border management. At the same time the Agency will be busy carrying out on the ground repeat surveys on antisemitism as well as LGBTI discrimination and hate crime. It will also be surveying the general populationacross the EU to get a better understanding of their experiences and opinions on fundamental rights. All told, this is just a snapshot of some of the 2018 highlights.

They spoke of how the Agency has evolved into the EU\u2019s centre of excellence for fundamental rights. They also recognised the need for the Agency to continue its core work and to be agile and timely to address emerging needs. This reflection continued in the Agency\u2019s Fundamental Rights report 2017 which included a special focus looking at some of the dynamics underpinning the major developments promoting respect for fundamental rights in the EU since the Agency opened its doors in 2007. However, it also gave examples of where full respect for fundamental rights is still lacking. Feeding the EU migration debate One of those areas was migration which remained a top priority right across the EU throughout 2017. In response, the Agency continued to provide on-the-ground support to the migration hotspots in Greece and Italy. This led to practical fundamental rights advice to EU actors and civil society organisations working directly with asylum seekers, refugees and migrants. The Agency paid special attention to the needs of migrant children, a group that are especially vulnerable. For example, it provided guidance on how best to end migrant detention of children. This includes providing alternative housing, counselling, coaching and managing cases involving children better.\u00a0 In parallel, over the course of the year the Agency collected data on the fundamental rights situation of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees arriving in EU Member States most affected by migration. These were compiled in monthly overviews, focusing on different themes, such as education and community policing. Fostering inclusion Many migrants that have arrived in Europe have settled seeking a better life. But many barriers to their integration remain. In 2017, FRA\u2019s second EU minorities and discrimination survey (EU-MIDIS II), which surveyed over 25,500 people with immigrant or ethnic minority background living across the EU, provided hard evidence (Follow #FactNotFake) of how discrimination and harassment remains widespread, nearly 10 years after the Agency\u2019s first survey. At the same time, the survey dispelled stereotypes by revealing that the overwhelming majority of people with immigrant and ethnic minority background have a strong sense of belonging to the country they now live in and trust its public institutions. But it also showed how discrimination and harassment experiences can undermine such feelings. Further guidance on migrant inclusion and integration was provided through FRA\u2019s Together in the EU report. It identified and compared policies across the EU in areas important for successful integration. These included education, reaching out to youths, political participation, non-discrimination and language learning. Inequalities of a different nature were also examined by FRA in its paper on Challenges to women\u2019s human rights in the EU, produced for the European Commission\u2019s Fundamental Rights Colloquium. It called for renewed and stronger efforts by the EU and its Member States to promote gender equality and change societal attitudes to help eradicate discrimination and violence towards women. This need became even more apparent in the wake of the #MeToo campaign triggered by revelations of widespread abuse in the film industry, political arena and elsewhere. Reconnecting with fundamental rights To foster inclusion also requires changes in how to engage everyday people with fundamental rights. This is why over the year FRA convened a series of four expert meetings with diverse groups such as artists, communicators, religious bodies and different civil society actors. These meetings underlined the importance of reframing how people perceive rights through engaging with the arts or changing the way we communicate rights. In addition, they highlighted the need to rediscover the shared space between human rights and religion, as well as countering the many ways support for civil society is being eroded. Bringing fundamental rights into security discussions Security is a major concern for many Europeans and is high on the EU\u2019s political agenda. The Agency fed into relevant policy debates providing targeted advice on how to respect fundamental rights through adequate safeguards. It looked at the pros and cons of sharing information among EU borders and security IT systems. These included improving efficiency but at the risk of unauthorised access or hacking. Such advice aimed at helping to shape future developments as these systems go online. In this context, the Agency released its second surveillance report. It explored legal changes since the first report came out in 2015 examining the views of intelligence experts and controllers themselves to see how these laws governing surveillance work in practice. It showed that while reforms to surveillance laws are improving transparency, better checks and balances are still to match the powers of intelligence services are needed. Looking ahead to 2018 Next year, the Agency will once again hold its Fundamental Rights Forum under the theme of \u2018belonging\u2019. Building on the success of its 2016 event, the landmark fundamental rights event will focus on strengthening the ties that bind everyone in the EU to the societies they live in. It will demonstrate that human rights are for everyone and must be respected by everyone. Increasing the sense of belonging will be greatly facilitated when partnerships are enhanced among communities and institutions that rarely engage with each other. The Forum aims to provide the space for this to happen.", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2017/year-review-looking-back-fra-over-2017-factnotfake"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0840", "date": "2017-12-18", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Migration paints mixed fundamental rights picture across Member States", "text": "Read the December 2017 monthly data collection highlights\u00a0>> Looking at the situation across 14 EU Member States, it reveals how the number of asylum applicants has dropped in Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands and Poland since April 2017 compared to the same period last year. However, the same cannot be said in Greece, Finland, France, Italy, Spain and Sweden where figures rose. In Slovakia the number remained a similarly low level. This can have knock-on effects. For example, there was enough reception capacity in many Member States, such as Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Poland, Slovakia and the Netherlands. But in countries with rising applications like France, Greece and Italy, reception facilities remained overcrowded. For example, in Italy, a facility built for 540 people maximum was hosting 1,300 people. However, even when there are low numbers of asylum seekers , issues can remain. For example, conditions in the transit zones in Hungary remained poor for asylum applicants. The actual situation is harder to ascertain due to a lack of transparency and oversight by external actors since civil society organisations and the media are banned from these transit zones. In addition in Austria, although capacity is not such an issue, there were still not enough guardians for unaccompanied children and often they were appointed too late. There was also a case where an 11 year old refugee from Afghanistan, who was living together with his six siblings under the guardianship of his oldest brother, committed suicide. In France and the Netherlands shortcomings in support for unaccompanied children have also been highlighted. Children continue to figure prominently in the number of migrants arriving which remains a challenge in many Member States, particularly in Greece. As of 30 November, the Greek National Centre for Social Solidarity estimates that there are some 3,300 unaccompanied children, 2,201 of which are in inadequate accommodation waiting for appropriate shelter. This points to a growing protection gap over the past months. The European Commission asked the Agency to collect data about the fundamental rights situation of people arriving in Member States particularly affected by large migration movements.

However, their right to independent living is often impeded. This can be due to a lack of adequate community support coupled with inaccessible services in the real and digital world that leave many people with disabilities feeling excluded and lacking choice and control over their lives. Citizens also have a say in democratic processes. But for people with disabilities legal and administrative hurdles prevent them from enjoying their right to political participation. Again accessibility plays a major role. Election information and campaign material is rarely available in formats that cater to people with disabilities and accessible polling stations usually just consider those with physical impairments rather than the needs of all people with disabilities. In addition, some laws deprive people of their voting rights based on their impairment such as those with intellectual disabilities. The EU and Member States that have ratified the UN\u2019s disability convention, the CRPD, have legal obligations to facilitate people with disabilities to enjoy their rights and fully participate in society. Already the Convention has triggered wide-ranging legislative changes in and across the EU. The recent signing of the European Pillar of Social Rights is another encouraging step forward. It should give renewed vigour to drive forward a social Europe for all European citizens, including people with disabilities through equal opportunities, social protection and inclusion. It is time for the EU and its Member States to build on this momentum, to give people with disabilities their opportunity to have their voice heard, be consulted and be included on an equal footing with people without disabilities.

It has helped shape human rights all over the world and in Europe has guided the development of the European Convention on Human Rights and the EU\u2019s very own Charter of Fundamental Rights. However, in practice rights are being challenged. Recent FRA surveys reveal how ethnic minorities and migrants across the EU continue to face widespread discrimination and harassment in the daily lives. Whether they were born in the EU or have been living here for years seems to make little difference; they are still being treated differently to the majority population. Women too continue to be victimised, as recent reports and FRA\u2019s latest paper show.

This survey, the largest and most comprehensive of its kind to date, suggests that over 62 million women have suffered from physical and/or sexual violence in the EU. Such violence affects women in all walks of life, at all levels, online and off from the home to the workplace to the street. The Agency\u2019s recent paper outlined fresh evidence of the different forms of prejudice, contempt or hatred towards women and girls in EU Member States. It was compiled for the European Commission\u2019s 2017 Annual Colloquium on Fundamental Rights, which focused this year on women's rights. The paper adds to the weight of evidence from numerous other surveys that all paint a disturbing picture of every day violence everywhere. It also shows how violence severely limits women\u2019s ability to participate on an equal footing in society and enjoy their rights. While the EU and its Member States remain committed to combating violence against women, violence cannot be eradicated without investing in countering structural discrimination, promoting gender equality and changing societal attitudes and ingrained stereotypes towards women and girls. FRA\u2019s recent paper and survey report suggests possible ways forward to promote gender equality and to fight against all forms of such violence. It suggests, for example, promoting gender equality through education to help change attitudes as well as empowering equality bodies to also tackle violence against women. However, what is needed is the EU and Member States to take decisive action now. Only then can we begin to make gender equality a reality and enable women and girls live in a world free of gender-based violence. Saying no to stop violence against women is already a good step forward to challenge attitudes in the society that allow this violence to occur.", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2017/say-no-violence-against-women"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0895", "date": "2017-11-20", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Minimum age: Balancing child protection and participation", "text": "Legal minimum ages define when and how children are involved in or have influence over procedures affecting their lives. They also determine whether and under which conditions children may exercise certain rights independently and without the authorisation of their parents. As children mature at different ages, setting age limits in law or in practice may restrict some of their rights while not offering enough protection in others.\u00a0\u00a0 Some limitations lack sound criteria, and therefore seem to be solely based on adults\u2019 assumptions and preconceived ideas about childhood. Moreover, age thresholds are sometimes confusing. For instance, in some countries the age for sexual consent is higher than the minimum age to marry. Research from FRA and others has pointed to inconsistences across Member States, and even within national jurisdictions, when it comes to areas like child protection, child-friendly justice and migrant children in detention. To highlight these differences the Agency mapped the national legal age requirements in various areas across the EU. The first set of findings is now available. They cover: marriage and citizenship. For example, only Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden (and Poland for men only) prohibit marriage below the age of 18. The rest allow earlier marriages if there is consent from parents or a national authority. This runs counter to the UN\u2019s Child Rights Convention, which recommends setting 18 as the minimum age for marriage. political participation such as voting. Voting is a basic aspect of democracy and a right guaranteed by the EU\u2019s Fundamental Rights Charter. Some Member States have lowered the voting age to 16 considering that children from that age are mature enough to make reasoned decisions. health such as seeking medical advice without parental consent. Access to sexual health services for adolescents is crucial for their well-being and health, especially for girls, as also recommended by the UN\u2019s Child Rights Convention Committee. However, in some Member States, the age for sexual consent is lower than the age to access sexual health services without parental consent. religion such as changing religion without parental consent. In most Member States, there are no laws regulating changing a child\u2019s religion. However, in some age limits are set, even though the EU\u2019s Fundamental Rights Charter guarantees everyone the right to freedom of religion. The findings underline the wide differences in the limits set by Member States across different areas. They point to the need to improve the way age limits are set to achieve consistency and better balance the need to protect children with the need to empower children. Further findings will be released in 2018.

Reported problems range from pushbacks and refused entry to asylum seekers to lack of proper processing of asylum seekers and information about asylum procedures as well as restrictions of liberty at border transit zones while waiting for lengthy asylum procedures to be processed.

Large-scale under-reporting by victims and different national approaches to data collection combine to frustrate efforts to understand the extent, nature and characteristics of antisemitism across the EU that policy makers need. Nevertheless, in some Member States Jewish and general population surveys have been carried out, albeit using different approaches. Combined with the data that does exist, they show that antisemitism remains a serious concern which requires action. Therefore, greater efforts to tackling under-reporting by encouraging victims and witnesses to report antisemitism is key. In addition, authorities need systems in place to record such incidents. Data collection on hate crime, including antisemitism at the national level also needs improving. Here FRA\u2019s compendium of practices for combating hate crime which has examples of how some Member States are recording hate crime could help. FRA also assists Member States in improving recording and data collection of hate crime, within the EU\u2019s High Level Group on combating Racism, Xenophobia and other forms of Intolerance. National victimisation surveys, similar to the one the Agency carried out among Jews in the EU in 2012 and is repeating in 2018, can also guide Member States in the fight against antisemitism. Education also has a vital role to play in fostering tolerance and challenging prejudices. Civic education, and learning from and teaching about the past, should become part of school curricula. This would help promote diversity, tolerance and respect for others from an early age. It would instil empathy, foster inter-cultural dialogue and understanding, and help put an end to age-old bigotries.

This is in part fuelled by overcrowding where, for example, some centres are catering for numbers exceeding up to three times their capacity. However, even in the many Member States where there are spare places due to falling numbers of new arrivals there has been criticism about the quality of care. Unfair treatment at border zones continues in some places. Reported problems range from racial profiling, lack of information about asylum procedures and refused entry to asylum seekers, to restrictions of liberty at border transit zones while waiting for lengthy asylum procedures to be processed. Practical and legal barriers in receiving healthcare, claiming asylum, and family reunification persist. These include lack of qualified interpreters leading to lengthy waiting periods, long asylum processes, and complex and sometimes costly legal processes without due legal aid. Child protection is still poorly resourced in some places. For example, the International Organization for Migration has reported that no child protection officers have yet been assigned to children in Greek or Italian hotspots. Many unaccompanied children also continue to wait for accommodation in specialised facilities. In addition, there are indications that high numbers of children go missing from shelters and care centres. Relationships with local communities are sometimes fragile with incidents of racism, hate crime and hate speech being reported. As immigration remains highly political and in the public eye, populist rhetoric, particularly during elections, may have stirred up local feelings. The European Commission asked the Agency to collect data about the fundamental rights situation of people arriving in Member States particularly affected by large migration movements.

These figures and later surveys have shown that perpetrators are found across the social and political spectrum. Most are men. They operate in all areas of life and it happens online just as much as it does offline. The EU and its Member States are committed to combating violence against women. There is a legal framework in place to help safeguard the rights and dignity of women and girls. Most recently, the EU itself signed the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence in June 2017, which all EU Member States have signed and 15 Member States have ratified. However, much still remains to be done to realise gender equality and to enable women and girls live in an environment free of gender-based violence and misogyny. The European Commission\u2019s 2017 Annual Colloquium on Fundamental Rights in November will focus on women's rights. It will also discuss the link between misogyny in society and the violation of women\u2019s fundamental rights, the subject of a paper that FRA drafted for the event. The paper outlines fresh evidence of the different forms of prejudice, contempt or hatred towards women and girls in Member States and suggests possible ways forward to promote gender equality and to fight against all forms of such violence. This evidence will point to the urgent need for the EU and Member States to take decisive action, many examples of which can also be found in FRA\u2019s survey findings report, to help ensure women and girls can fully enjoy their rights to life, liberty and security, to education, work and housing and to participate in public life.

He referred to the brutal murder on 16 October of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana who led the investigation into corruption in Malta as unprecedented in the EU. He spoke of how attacks and pressure on journalists undermine freedom of the media, freedom of information and freedom of expression, and have a disproportionate impact on female journalists. Pressure can also result from commercial influence over editorial content brought about by concentration of ownership in the media market. Although market consolidation may not necessarily reduce pluralism, recent studies from the Media Pluralism Monitor in Florence point to 12 at risk countries in Europe. Then there is the issue of the changing nature of political discourse and media content which is becoming increasingly intolerant. As FRA has shown mounting hate speech, offline and online, is inciting discrimination, hatred and violence. As the internet is often a primary source of information, thanks in part to the ease and speed with which content can be spread, digital equality needs addressing. Being able of participating and engaging online combined with being digital literate, are vital elements to building a world that includes not excludes all members of society. To address the prevailing situation, the Director spoke about the need to boost media literacy. It must become part of school curricula to equip children with the skills they will need for the future. Already promising practices exist in many Member States which need to be better collected and built on. Similarly, there is a need to reduce digital inequalities. Everyone should all have equal access to the internet so they can fully engage in the digital age independently whether they are old or young or whether they live in a town or in a rural area Improving training for journalists is another area that could help. Here, FRA is currently revising its media toolkit to equip journalists with the necessary capacity and sensitivities related to fundamental rights to help maintain professional standards of quality journalism. The Director also spoke about being more creative in how fundamental rights are communicated and how the core values of the EU\u2019s Fundamental Rights Charter are promoted. Another area that needs addressing he said was improving how law, especially criminal law, is implemented. Fundamental rights apply equally to the virtual as they do the real world, and need protecting in both worlds. That means the full force of the law must be brought to purveyors of hate speech and other criminal content online. In addition, the law must also be fully used to protect journalists and prosecute those who attack the media, otherwise media pluralism and the rule of law will remain under threat.", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2017/facing-todays-challenges-media-pluralism"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0931", "date": "2017-10-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "FRA exchanges views on fundamental rights at EU Council", "text": "In his speech in front of the Justice Ministers in Luxembourg on 12 October, the Director focused on the implementation of the Charter and presented the Agency\u2019s perspective on issues that are highlighted in the Council Conclusions.

Furthermore, as a recent study by the\u00a0European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions\u00a0highlighted, one in ten of European workers are at risk of poverty and 13% are materially deprived, meaning that the \u2018working poor\u2019 represent now a worrying proportion of working people in the EU with potentially far reaching negative consequences on social cohesion. The uneven distribution of poverty within Member States, leads to the overrepresentation of young people, as well as certain vulnerable social groups, among the poor. For example, this is the case for Roma, the EU\u2019s largest ethnic minority. In the nine Member States\u00a0that FRA surveyed in 2016 which have the\u00a0highest proportion of Roma, 8 out of 10 Roma live at-risk-of-poverty and nearly 4 out of 10 Roma live in households without a toilet, shower or bathroom inside their home. The vicious cycle of poverty is cause and consequence of fundamental rights violations, including discrimination, calling for a rights-based approach to reducing poverty. The EU's\u00a0Fundamental Rights\u00a0Charter includes the right to social and housing assistance to ensure a decent existence for all those who lack sufficient resources. It also contains the right to engage in work, the right to education and to vocational and continuing training, as well as the right to healthcare. However, persisting inequalities within and across Member States affect the enjoyment of these rights, which means that efforts to reach the targets set by Europe 2020 have not produced the expected results to date. In this regard, the proposed European Pillar of Social Rights can be the starting point for a renewed effort to tackle poverty and improve the enjoyment of fundamental rights, both mutually reinforcing dimensions of life in dignity for everyone in the European Union.", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2017/living-poverty-violates-fundamental-right-dignity"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0934", "date": "2017-10-17", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Stronger protection in migration hotspots to guard against human trafficking", "text": "Ahead of EU Anti-Trafficking day on 18 October, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) calls for stronger anti-trafficking safeguards in hotspots. It highlights some of the challenges and steps taken at hotspots to support EU-wide efforts in addressing human trafficking in the context of migration. In its regular visits to Greek and Italian hotspots, the Agency has advocated for increased attention on the issue of trafficking. This is a key issue especially as increasing numbers of single women and unaccompanied girls arrive in Italy from the main risk countries for\u00a0 trafficking. Hotspots in Greece become seriously overcrowded affecting people\u2019s safety. In many EU Member States unaccompanied children continue going missing with an increased risk of falling into the hands of traffickers. Important steps have been taken by various actors operating in the field. For example, in Greece in June, Standard Operating Procedures for preventing and responding to sexual and gender-based violence were finalised. They facilitate the joint referral for women, men, boys and girls at risk, including victims of trafficking. Capacity-building activities with a focus on human trafficking in hotspots were stepped up with a series of workshops organised by Frontex for deployed screening officers, the Hellenic police, the EU\u2019s law enforcement agency (Europol) and others active in the field. In Italy, targeted counselling of new arrivals at risk, changes to the guardianship system and increased availability of shelter for unaccompanied children has resulted in shorter times children spend in hotspots and better protection. Even so, continued attention to preventing and responding to\u00a0human\u00a0trafficking and other forms of sexual and gender-based violence is needed. Stronger protection safeguards are needed in the hotspots to\u00a0provide appropriate, gender specific and child sensitive assistance and protection for victims of\u00a0\u00a0trafficking. These include: Improving the identification and vulnerability screening procedures to ensure timely support and referral of victims of trafficking with a focus on particularly vulnerable groups, women and children; Continuing offering guidance and training for frontline staff, including police officers and border guards on identifying potential victims of trafficking. This could also extend to how best to handle traumatised people; Cooperating with support groups who can offer specific assistance such as identifying, counselling or supporting victims; Providing specific safeguards for unaccompanied children by placing them in specialised facilities, adequate to cater for their specific needs, and enacting a coherent guardianship system centered around the need to safeguard the best interests of unaccompanied children; Ensuring gender-sensitive shelter allocation, mixed female-male police patrolling of the hotspots at night, and access to secure and well-lit sanitary facilities to prevent further victimisation.\u00a0\u00a0 Such safeguards could significantly contribute to EU-wide efforts to address human trafficking and raise awareness, just some of the aims of the EU Anti-Trafficking day. \u00a0", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2017/stronger-protection-migration-hotspots-guard-against-human-trafficking"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0935", "date": "2017-10-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "10 years of being Together for an Equal Europe", "text": "The panel discussion focussd on the main challenges for the future of equality bodies.

The Agency\u2019s latest summary focused on the oversight of certain key provisions related to reception facilities including: housing, food, healthcare, information and the best interests of children. Some of the findings were: All Member States consulted pointed to challenges in providing adequate conditions in reception facilities because of such issues as capacity, security or living conditions, although good practice examples exist. Most have some kind of written standards for reception conditions which are sometimes legally binding and are publicly available. However, these standards can vary regionally or depending on the type of facility. Almost half define the standards for reception facilities in the contracts with reception facilities operators, which provides a framework for what is expected for those who run such facilities. Most have designated bodies responsible for oversight of reception conditions that also regularly inspect facilities, which is important for effective oversight. While independence is a key element for effective control mechanisms, only a few Member States have independent oversight bodies. Although asylum seekers can lodge a complaint in most Member States about the conditions of reception facilities, very few do. Drawing on existing practices, FRA suggests that for oversight to be effective, there should be: an independent oversight body; regular unannounced inspections; strong complaint mechanisms. The European Commission asked the Agency to collect data about the fundamental rights situation of people arriving in Member States particularly affected by large migration movements. The reports cover 14 Member States: Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden.

Dr Ahmed Shaheed, UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion and Belief said we should not overlook the potential for tension between religion and human rights such as the numerous religious reservations made to human rights treaties. He also spoke of how globalisation has spawned anxieties and fear, leading to rising intolerance based on belief. To move forward he called for greater religious literacy among the human rights community and more rights literacy for religious actors so each group better understands each other and can work together. Recognising that human rights need to be promoted and taught, Michael O\u2019Flaherty spoke of the importance of building strong alliances with diverse faith groups built on ground rules for shared understanding.

This includes shorter time frames for registering asylum applications. In addition, procedures are often lengthy with little access to counselling and information about rights and how to apply for asylum.\u00a0 Some reception centres still face problems with overcrowding and conditions remain poor. The extreme summer heat in some regions also posed a problem due to a lack of protection from the heat. NGOs also reported alleged incidents of police violence and intimidation. Child protection remains a worry. Guardianship systems continue to be under-resourced and over-burdened in many Member States with unaccompanied children in particular being kept in poor conditions and being made to wait over 15 months to be interviewed in some instances. The number of children reported missing from reception centres also continues to be a concern. There were a number of notable legal and policy changes over the summer, several of them restricting asylum and migration rights. For example, Italy established six new migration hotspots. The EU\u2019s Court of Justice also proposed dismissing attempts by Slovakia and Hungary to challenge the legality of the mandatory relocation of asylum seekers from Greece and Italy. The Court also ruled that Croatia was responsible for asylum applications of people who had passed through Croatia on the way to Slovenia and Austria. This reaffirmed the so-called Dublin principles which describe which Member States should process asylum applications. In addition, the European Commission and national interior ministries proposed a code of conduct for NGOs operating in the Mediterranean Sea around Libya that was criticised by NGOs. Anti-migrant incidents also continued to be reported in many Member States ranging from public demonstrations and campaigns against migrants, rising hate speech and hate crime including violent attacks. An international network of racist and far-right organisations also rented vessels trying to obstruct save-and-rescue operations in the Mediterranean Sea carried out by NGOs. The European Commission asked the Agency to collect data about the fundamental rights situation of people arriving in Member States particularly affected by large migration movements. The reports cover 14 Member States: Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden.

Electorates have grown tired of political elites and have spurned traditional parties, upsetting the democratic order that has prevailed in many EU Member States. This political shift may have profound effects on societies, as populist views become mainstream and more widely accepted potentially. This may in turn fuel intolerance and hatred. Against such a backdrop it is vital that younger generations actively take part in democratic processes, and their views are heard and taken into consideration. Younger voters also need to be know that their voices count and can make a difference. For this to happen, they need to be involved from an early age and be given the opportunities to voice opinions and be heard in decision making procedures. Some cities and countries have established children and youth councils or advisors. For example, the Maltese President\u2019s Foundation for the Wellbeing of Society has its own Children and Young Persons Councils, Ireland has a national child participation strategy, in Sweden the Ombudsman for Children holds regular consultations with children and recently FRA held a conference where children shared their views with policy makers and experts on such burning issues as migration, and poverty and exclusion. Such initiatives allow young people to be consulted on issues that affect them. They are given the chance to have a say on issues that concern them and these views are taken on board. \u00a0 It should be remembered that child participation is enshrined in core human rights instruments such as the UN\u2019s Child Rights Convention and the EU\u2019s Fundamental Rights Charter which all EU Member States have signed up to. Policies also ensure young adults, older than 18, participate in decision-making processes. This in itself reveals a crucial difference. Children are protected by human rights standards. When they are no longer considered children and are instead young adults, they lose this protection and only policies prevail. However, there are often differences in the ages that define young people. For example, the UN considers youths as being between 15 and 24 but in its Convention on the Rights of the Child defines children as being below the age of 18. In addition, the lack of clear criteria for minimum age requirements and discrepancies in age requirements contradicts the notion of participation dictated by human rights instruments. Voting rights are a classic example where there are differences across Member States depending on the type of elections, whether they are national, regional, local or even European. For example, Austria is the only EU Member State where at the age of 16 you can vote in all elections. Being a candidate in elections is another example. The right to stand as a candidate varies from one country to another. In ranges from 18 to 40 years old, depending on the kind of election. To increase political participation for young people clear policies are needed both at the national and European levels. By improving political participation, the voices of young people will be heard and listened to. Ultimately, this should help shape a better Europe.", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2017/help-mobilise-youth-ensure-their-voices-count"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_0988", "date": "2017-07-28", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Strengthen child protection to guard against trafficking", "text": "Large numbers of children have fled their home countries, either alone or with their families.

In other developments, Greek NGOs, the UNHCR and the Council of Europe\u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights expressed deep concerns over alleged pushbacks at the Greek-Turkish land border, and the Greek Ombudsman ordered an investigation of alleged forced returns of Turkish citizens by Greek authorities to Turkey. \t\t\u00a0 The number of asylum applications also remains high in various EU Member States, with the Greek Asylum Service registering some 4,200 new applications for international protection in June. Germany received some 16,640 asylum applications in May, an increase of 12.1% compared to April. Also in Germany, several human rights and welfare organisations demanded an improvement of the non-governmental and independent support structures for applicants of asylum and refugees after an internal investigation of 2,000 asylum decisions revealed severe deficiencies in the procedure. \t\t\u00a0 The number of forced returns in some Member States remains high, with more than 700 forced returns from Greece conducted by the Hellenic Police in June, compared with close to 420 returns under the IOM Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration programme over the same period. Meanwhile returns to Afghanistan were criticised and demonstrated against by various stakeholders in Austria, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, given the allegedly unstable and deteriorating security situation in the country. \t\t\u00a0 Reception conditions \u00a0remain a concern, in particular the formation of informal camps, overcrowding, violence and poor living conditions were reported in \u00a0in a number of countries. \t\t\u00a0 Various aspects of child protection continue to be worrying.

Similar to the US\u2019 ESTA travel system, ETIAS will screen people from visa-free countries before they travel to check whether or not they can enter the EU. Border controls will still apply but should be much simpler for ETIAS-authorised travellers. The European Parliament asked the Agency for its Opinion on the fundamental rights impact of the ETIAS proposal. Since the European Commission has not carried a comprehensive fundamental rights impact assessment, this Opinion indicates how ETIAS could affect fundamental rights. Some of the observations include the need to: Embed fundamental rights into ETIAS: there should be in-built checks to ensure fundamental rights compliance. This could include fundamental rights experts sitting on screening boards, as well as handbooks to provide practical guidance. Only collect data that is necessary: some of the personal data that users should provide about their health, education or employment for example appears to be unnecessary and should be further defined for some categories of data or limited to broad categories for others. Prevent discriminatory profiling: predicting if travellers constitute a risk for irregular migration, security or public health is part of ETIAS. However, comparing applicant information to specific risk indicators may lead to discriminatory profiling and should be tested before implementation. Review when law enforcement agencies can access ETIAS data: conditions for accessing data should be aligned with existing systems like the EU\u2019s Eurodac fingerprinting database, and be limited to some situations such as protecting missing or trafficked children. Respect the right to asylum: the proposal should consider the needs of people seeking international protection. This includes not sharing personal data with non-EU countries in case they can be identified and persecuted. The proposal to impose fines on travel operators\u2019 for not checking authorisations before boarding also creates additional difficulties for those who hide their identity when seeking asylum and needs further review. Allow for complaints: there should be a way for users to complain, appeal decisions, and amend the data in the system. This should extend to informing users about ETIAS processes through Member States embassies in visa-free countries. This Opinion aims to raise awareness of some of the issues that require further consideration to improve overall fundamental rights compliance.

The Agency\u2019s latest summary focused on areas where there is available data and high numbers of asylum seekers. Some of the main findings include: Fear of becoming a victim of crime is a common concern among local communities, including existing migrant populations, as well as asylum seekers or refugees. Building trust between the police and local communities is vital in trying to resolve and prevent conflicts that arise within different communities. However, this requires adequate resources and competences within local police services, as many asylum seekers are unlikely to report being victims of hate crime or exploitation by traffickers and criminals. The police in some of the areas covered have dedicated more resources to dealing with hate crime against migrants and some have established specialised units. Most areas have crime prevention activities at reception facilities or asylum centres such as police patrols and visits to build trust as well as surveillance measures. There are also radicalisation prevention efforts ranging from police liaison to security training on how to handle radicalisation situations. Community policing-related training has also been taking place, boosting awareness of the needs of migrants and how to avoid discriminatory profiling. Measures include recruiting staff with different migrant backgrounds. Such measures may not necessarily relate to the arrival of migrants but are part of wider efforts to have more inclusive policing. Although local authorities, communities and civil society are involved in community policing processes, migrant communities are rarely consulted. In some instances there were consultations with citizen and community organisations on the arrival and/or reception of asylum seekers during which the police were involved. Newly-arrived migrants are only sometimes provided policing-relevant content on, for example, how national policing and judicial systems work as well as the services the police offer. The European Commission asked the Agency to collect data about the fundamental rights situation of people arriving in Member States particularly affected by large migration movements.

This includes alternative housing, counselling, coaching and managing cases involving children better. It reveals that while migrant detention of children is not illegal, it should not be arbitrary and is only lawful in certain situations. Even then the conditions must suit the needs of children These exceptions must be strictly respected. This includes setting maximum detention periods which should be as short as possible. At present detention can last as long as 18 months. Protecting children from exploitation or preventing them from going missing should not be used as an excuse for detention. Instead better facilities, continual specialist support and stronger guardianship systems are needed. Training staff to know how to treat and inform children appropriately, and involve them are also important. When detention cannot be avoided facilities should be child-friendly. Uniformed armed staff and barbed wire surrounding enclosures should be avoided. Together with adequate education and healthcare outside detention facilities, this would ensure children are treated with respect and dignity, minimising stress and trauma which can affect them in later life. Each case should be assesessed individually taking the children\u2019s best interests into account. Close consultation and liaison with child protection authorities would help ensure the needs of children are met.

One example of past cooperation under the MoU is a workshop held by the Agency in cooperation with the Greek Reception and Identification Service (RIS) on 29 May to discuss guidance on preventing and responding to self-harm in the migration hotspots. This guidance was developed for field workers with the aim of informing about self-harm risk factors and technics to prevent and manage self-harm while ensuring respect for human dignity and fundamental rights.

The Agency\u2019s latest summary identifies pressing fundamental rights issues that need addressing in various EU Member States. Some of the main findings include: Children in immigration detention have no access to any form of education in nine out of the 14 Member States covered by this report. This is mainly because Member States expect short detention periods, which may also be shorter than needed to perform the administrative and medical checks for schooling. In the other countries informal education is offered. Education, independent of the time spent in detention, is only on offer in three Member States. Very few Member States specifically address the educational needs of those who have been unable to attend school regularly before arriving. As a result they may also lag behind students of a similar age. This is particularly a problem in many Member States when it comes to educating children who are above the compulsory school age without the necessary skills. Traumatised children often have difficulties integrating due to behavioural issues or because they are withdrawn. In four Member States, there is some form of psychological support but it does not specifically target refugee children. Teachers receive support through training or guidance in dealing with traumatised children in only three Member States. Early childhood education can help students learn better and prevent them from leaving school early. However, long waiting periods, language barriers, long distances, insufficient guidance to families, lack of information, low allowances for asylum applicants to cover expenses, and the treatment and integration of traumatised children are all factors limiting access to early childhood education. For example, over 40% of Dutch municipalities with reception centres have no childcare facilities at these centres. In four Member States, asylum seekers and refugees have no access to formal schooling in some parts or regions of the country. Although almost all Member States have special support classes to help children follow or join regular schools, in five they spend up to two years in separate preparatory classes outside schools until they can attend public schools. Once enrolled in school, migrant children generally benefit from the same services as national children. In some Member States they are also eligible for additional support such as language courses or allowances for buying school supplies. Problems recognising non-EU diplomas hinder access to third-level education and employment in many Member States. Most Member States increased their budgets and staffing for education following the 2015/2016 migration crisis. For example, in Austria staffing for basic care has quadrupled since the large-scale increase in migration. The European Commission asked the Agency to collect data about the fundamental rights situation of people arriving in Member States particularly affected by large migration movements. The reports cover 14 Member States: Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden.

More has to be done to ensure the EU is a safe haven for those fleeing their home countries in fear of their lives.\u201d In its laws and policies, the EU recognises the homophobic hatred and discrimination that has driven many people to seek asylum on our shores. The EU\u2019s Court of Justice has also provided guidance to Member States.

However, much still remains to be done, as a recent FRA report on the human rights situation of LGBTI asylum seekers entering the EU revealed. The urgency of stepping up efforts in this area is manifest from recent reports of the detention and ill-treatment of a number of men on the basis of their assumed homosexuality. Such events are clear evidence that EU governments need to expedite the use of humanitarian visas and refugee resettlement programmes to assist LGBTI people in imminent danger in their home countries. Guidance is also needed for frontline migration, border staff and asylum officers to ensure they are equipped with the skills and knowledge needed to evaluate LGBTI asylum claims.

Central to this is a free and pluralistic media, as enshrined in the EU\u2019s Fundamental Rights Charter. However, a FRA study has identified worrying signs of intrusions into press freedom such as intimidation, threats, and even violence. This has led some media outlets to close and some journalists to self-censor out of fear. Women journalists in particular are often targeted because of their gender. They are also face more online harassment and threats than their male counterparts. In addition, state security is often used to justify surveillance of journalists. For example, in one EU Member State, a pre-trial investigation revealed that a district judge court authorised the secret services to tap 17 journalists to find the source of a leaked government report.

Drawing on the Agency\u2019s findings, he highlighted the importance of capturing the views of both professionals and children. This work underlined that the best systems in the world will not necessarily make justice child-friendly, if the attitudes of professionals towards children are wrong. The testimonies of children that participated in the Agency\u2019s research who were also at the meeting corroborated this view firsthand. They spoke of their experiences of judicial proceedings, where empathy was lacking and they felt pressure to change testimonies. They talked about how their views were not taken seriously and how they were made to feel wrong for asking questions. One child mentioned that over the course of many years there was no hearing when she was younger and then had to wait a long time to report about her situation to the judge. She questioned how could she give an account of her firsthand experiences if she is not even asked? Their testimonies stressed the importance of being listened to and being given the opportunity to speak. This is why the children felt compelled to take part in the Agency\u2019s research: \u201cSomeone was willing to listen to our testimonies and not be judgemental\u2026 [The FRA research] was very important in the hope of change so other children don\u2019t experience the same.\u201d Assembled child rights and justice experts further explored the challenges of child participation, building on the findings on the Agency\u2019s research into child-friendly justice. They pointed to the fact that every child has the right to be heard under the UN\u2019s Child Rights Convention yet many laws and policies seem intent on setting arbitrary age limits for involving children. They highlighted areas of improvement and outlined promising practices currently in use which should be shared more widely to all those involved in working with children. These included: the Council of Europe\u2019s child-friendly justice guidelines; the European Commission\u2019s 10 principles for integrated child protection systems; the Agency\u2019s checklist for professionals to help justice more child-friendly; Malta\u2019s child protection act that consulted with children as it was being drafted; not to mention inviting children to give their views in meetings such as these, for example. Education was repeatedly mentioned as playing a vital role. This includes not just on-the-job training for professionals but also in the colleges and universities where they learn their trades. This could also extend to improving multidisciplinary cooperation and training so social workers, the police, the judiciary better understand each other\u2019s needs and roles. Parents may also benefit from improving their skills so they too are more aware of child rights and needs, not only when it comes to judicial proceedings, but also to find alternative conflict resolutions in cases of custody conflicts, for example. In summing up, there was talk about a paradigm shift in mainstreaming child participation in all types of proceedings, including administrative ones. This will help create a culture where involving children becomes the norm; this should become embedded in practices rather than being the exception. In essence, changes to behaviour and attitudes among professionals are needed so they can better empathise with children. In this way child participation will become mainstreamed which is so fundamental to ensuring child-friendly justice.\u00a0", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2017/mainstreaming-child-participation-ensure-childrens-voices-are-heard"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_1081", "date": "2017-04-28", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Experts on methodologies for recording and collecting hate crime data meet", "text": "The draft paper is an overview of practices from across EU Member States and sets out core common elements for recording and collecting data on hate crime.

The Agency\u2019s latest summary identifies pressing fundamental rights issues that need addressing in various EU Member States. Some of the main findings include: Asylum-seeking and migrant children continue to suffer in many countries. Unaccompanied children often receive little support and can be housed with adults they do not know. Their health and wellbeing can also deteriorate, resulting in suicide attempts, as they approach adulthood or face moving to other parts of the country or being returned following failed asylum claims. Methods for assessing age, where, for example the Swedish Migration Agency found 60% of all cases to be insufficiently investigated, pose problems for children in many cases. In addition, not enough guardians, staff lacking the skills or time to deal with migrant children, and too few places in adequate and secure facilities, all compound the difficulties children face. The pattern of new arrivals is changing with numbers rising in Greece but particularly in Italy, and dropping significantly in Hungary, where a smart fence with speakers warns against irregular crossing in different languages. In Spain, the use of small boats to arrive grew by 62% in the first three months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Asylum patterns are also changing with applications rising in Italy and falling in Germany and Hungary. In Hungary, the transit zone policy has left some 8,000 people waiting in Serbia to enter and only 5 people per working day are being admitted to each of the two transit zones. Overcrowding, poor facilities and the growing use of detention remain problematic, particularly in hotspot and reception facilities. Healthcare for people with mental health issues or suffering anxiety and depression, and privacy for women continue to be issues. Hate speech, particularly online, continues to remain high. In the Netherlands over a fifth of all online hate speech was found to target asylum seekers and migrants. In some countries the political response to the migration situation continues to become more restrictive. Legislative initiatives in several Member States aim at restricting appeals, increasing detention, and facilitating and accelerating returns. Society in many Member States is also becoming more polarised with demonstrations for and against migration and asylum. The European Commission asked the Agency to collect data about the fundamental rights situation of people arriving in Member States particularly affected by large migration movements. The reports cover 14 Member States: Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden.

This can infringe workers\u2019 rights, the right to privacy, be discriminatory, can lead to ill-health, or have an impact on many other human rights. Access to justice, a right in itself, can also be jeopardised. This is being increasingly recognised by European and international bodies from the UN to the Council of Europe and the EU who have developed guidance, strategies, policies, and laws.\u00a0 To explore what more the EU can do, the EU Council asked the Agency to provide its Opinion on improving access to remedies when it comes to business and human rights. Some of the suggestions include: Making judicial remedies more accessible: Victims often turn to courts when it comes to seeking justice. However, issues such as deciding which court to turn to, costs, the complexity and length of proceedings, can cause obstacles. To make it easier for victims, the EU should create minimum standards for legal aid and improve funding for legal support, particularly for vulnerable people such as children or people with disabilities. The burden of proof should also be shifted from victims to companies with clearer minimum standards on what evidence businesses should make accessible. Supporting cross-border cases better: As globalisation and the EU\u2019s Single Market has made cross-border business more common, it is harder for victims to seek redress from companies based elsewhere or when rights violations happen abroad. To help, the EU should provide guidance so that there is a common understanding across Member States on how to proceed with cross-border cases. This could include drawing on how environmental cases are treated, by allowing exceptions to existing rules. This would ensure high enough EU-level damages are awarded to deter businesses from abuse in countries that can be more lenient towards business. Using criminal justice systems: Although EU laws cover corporate crime in relation to business and human rights, they are rarely used. The EU should therefore promote the greater use of existing laws. This could include EU-wide data collection on complaints and compensation, training, improving the human and financial resources of law enforcement to tackle such crime as well as guidance for victims in claiming for damages in criminal procedures. Providing alternatives through non-judicial remedies: Non-judicial mechanisms can be more accessible, quicker and cheaper. The EU should therefore strengthen such mechanisms by creating minimum standards that also allow collective redress, by establishing well-resourced national contact points to advise victims on remedies and by encouraging companies to create their own grievance mechanisms. Improving transparency and data collection: Different Member States take different approaches when it comes to access to remedies for business and human rights which makes it difficult for companies to operate and victims to seek justice. National action plans are often lacking and vague. The EU needs to encourage Member States to develop action plans that also include access to remedies and clear indicators to measure achievement. The EU should also provide information on available remedies, how they work and perform, possibly with comparative assessments and coordination across the region. This would provide greater transparency and would aid understanding among the public, legal practitioners and ultimately victims. Establishing EU-wide networks to share knowledge, guidance and best practices would also help. In addition, the EU should publish information from companies which must disclose the impact of their work on rights under EU law. It could also encourage Member States to oblige companies to systematically assess the impact on human rights of new activities as part of their planning. This Opinion provides a range of advice on how the EU could improve access to remedies for victims of rights abuse by businesses. It aims to contribute to growing awareness of the need for the EU to do more to strengthen access to judicial and non-judicial remedies.

In opening his speech the FRA Director acknowledged the vital role ombudsperson institutions play as defenders of rights and champions of values in public life. While outlining the current difficult climate ombudsperson institutions, and the many promoters and protectors of rights are operating in, he suggested ways forward. He spoke of the pressing need to tackle the growing inequalities across Europe that are fuelling unease among the general public. This in turn is making many turn their back on rights. As a result Europe needs to find ways to re-engage with the public, to show them that rights matter for them and their families. He gave the example of rights for elderly people. Everyone knows someone who is elderly. It may be their father, their grandmother or neighbour. By using such examples we can show that rights are not a niche issue but apply to everyday people. Here ombudsperson institutions can play a key role as frontline operators convincing the public that rights are about them and for them. Allied to the drive to reconnect with ordinary people, the Director spoke about having to get local. Using a general approach at a country or state level will not succeed, he said. Here he underlined the importance of working with local communities on rights-based approaches. FRA recognises this which is why it is engaging directly with mayors and is helping bridge the gap with local authorities to get local Roma communities involved in decisions that directly affect them. \u00a0\u00a0 Focusing specifically on the \u2018malign\u2019 threat posed by populism, he spoke of the necessity to push back against the lies that are being fed to the public. Here it is important that we challenge and counter these lies, and stamp them out quickly before they get hold. He used the example of the Cologne attacks against women over the New Year in 2015/2016. Some were quick to point the finger towards migrants saying how violence against women was something imported by those who had recently arrived. FRA was able to refute these claims thanks to its EU-wide survey on gender-based violence which clearly revealed how such violence is very much an indigenous problem with most women attacked by known perpetrators. While the Director spoke of the need to reconnect with the public he reminded the audience that we should never overlook the vulnerable, the marginalised, the others. He regretted how despite the rise in hate crime, police investigations and prosecutions are not keeping pace; an imbalance which clearly needs addressing. In all of this, FRA stands ready to assist policy makers at all levels. It will continue to provide relevant timely data that decision makers need to make informed policies. The Agency\u2019s pioneering socio-legal research and legal opinions are being coupled with the deployment of Agency staff in the field to Greek migration hotspots and the monthly reporting of fundamental rights concerns resulting from the migration situation across 14 frontline Member States. Concerned about the growing disconnect with rights, the Agency is also embarking on seeing how best to better communicate rights by engaging with people from diverse fields such as neuroscience and marketing. It will also continue to work hand-in-hand with its human rights partners such as ombudsman institutions. In concluding, he said the crisis has brought greater clarity about what is wrong and what is needed: \u201cSo it\u2019s not a case of a despairing sense of loss but rather of getting our act together and getting on with the work.\u201d", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2017/getting-our-act-together-help-tackle-crisis-rights"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_1116", "date": "2017-03-31", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Exploring teachers training on citizenship education in France", "text": "The Working Group brings together Member States on ways forward in implementing the 2015 Paris Declaration.

The research involved engaging with Roma and local authorities to understand why many Roma inclusion efforts fail to produce tangible results. It also sought to identify successful practices for creating social inclusion at the local level. Some of the key points that emerged include: Building trust \u2013 after years of discrimination, poverty and social exclusion as well as the many failed inclusion efforts, managing expectations and building trust among the Roma is the key to successful integration. This involves keeping everyone informed and finding out what they most need. Meaningful participation \u2013 participation can take many forms from simply being invited to meetings through to helping to implement actions. However, whatever shape it takes, Roma should be involved as equals, rather than as a token gesture. For this, it is important to agree on specific goals that will deliver concrete meaningful results. This helps ensure local participation of the Roma community and motivates them to remain engaged. Empowering people \u2013 giving Roma the chance to engage in dialogue with local authorities empowers them to claim their rights. By listening to each other\u2019s views, a shared understanding is created and expectations are better managed. In this way stereotypes can be broken and the Roma will feel respected and stand up for the rights. Learning from the past \u2013 a deeper understanding of the reasons for successes and failures can help shape future efforts. By learning lessons, and being open about what went wrong and why, challenges can be overcome and future projects, policies and approaches adjusted. Ultimately this can improve the chances of success. The research has captured a wealth of information about social inclusion and Roma integration measures on the ground. Already it reveals the importance of a more targeted case-by-case approach taking into account the needs of each community rather than using a blanket solution for everyone. The Agency will publish the case studies and accompanying videos from the 21 localities on 26 April. They will reveal the different local contexts, including their particular needs and challenges, the efforts that have been made to promote inclusion, as well as the various successes. Together they help to illustrate critical aspects that must be considered if money, resources and efforts are to be better used, and if policies are to be more effective in actually improving the lives of Roma across the EU. The findings will help feed a wider analysis that will be published in 2018. The stocktaking event sought to provide input to the EU\u2019s mid-term assessment of its Framework for national Roma integration strategies. The discussion should help improve the remaining years of implementation until 2020 as well as help shape the EU\u2019s Roma policies post-2020.

European leaders need to state clearly that the Union is not just a union of states but also a union of people, all of them with inviolable human rights.\u201d Sixty years ago, Europe was struggling with the aftermath of the Second World War and trying to heal societies that had been torn apart. The Treaty of Rome laid the basis for closer cooperation and integration to help rebuild Europe. Since then, Europe has developed a formidable array of structures and practices to protect fundamental rights. These include the EU\u2019s Fundamental Rights Charter, accredited national human rights institutions and equality bodies, and the creation of FRA, the EU\u2019s independent centre of fundamental rights expertise. In 2012, the EU received the Nobel Peace Prize for its contribution to peace, reconciliation, democracy and human rights across Europe. However, people living in the EU continue to face enormous challenges in their daily lives, with too many in poverty and many unable to enjoy their basic rights to education and healthcare. As well as a worrying trend towards more hate speech and discrimination in many places, Europe is also witnessing a disturbing erosion of commitment to human rights, both among policy makers and in our societies. This anniversary is a timely reminder of the values on which the EU is based. We need to seize the opportunity to reconnect Europe with its people and their rights.\u00a0", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2017/back-future-time-reconnect-europe"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_1123", "date": "2017-03-24", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Towards stronger social rights across Europe", "text": "The event, organised by Maltese Presidency of the EU, brought together Social Affairs Committee Chairs from across the EU. It sought to take stock of Europe 2020 policies and propose ways forward from a social perspective. The economic and financial crisis that swept the world dented efforts to reduce poverty, acknowledged Ioannis Dimitrakopoulos, head of one of FRA\u2019s research departments, in his keynote address. However, looking ahead he spoke of the need to increase efforts to tackle poverty and outlined why. \u00a0 For example there are widespread income inequalities across and within Member States. This status quo is unsustainable in democratic societies for growth to be inclusive. This is backed up by public opinion polls: Over 80% of Europeans agreed that a free-market economy should go hand-in-hand with a high level of social protection, with almost a half citing social equality and solidarity as a future major global challenge. In addition, there is also the duty to respect and protect fundamental rights. Here he referred to the Agency\u2019s recent survey results on Roma which revealed shocking living conditions: 80% continue to live below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold of their country; and every third Roma child lives in households that face hunger. Mr Dimitrakopoulos then mentioned how the EU is responding with changes to the European Structural and Investment Funds, and a proposal for a new European Pillar of Social Rights. For example, funding now depends on including efforts to promote fundamental rights such as combatting social exclusion. He continued by describing the new pillar potentially as a real \u2018game changer\u2019 in promoting and protecting rights based on human rights standards. However, for this to happen any instruments derived from the Pillar would need to take a legally-binding form. Therefore, any resulting laws or policies should be based on a thorough assessment of existing laws to ensure they can make a real difference to people\u2019s lives. There should also be clear policy targets which are regularly monitored. In addition, Member States should strictly adhere to any new measures with support from the EU where needed. He also underlined the need to raise rights awareness among the people of Europe, particularly those who are currently most excluded. Such awareness would empower those at risk of discrimination and inequalities. Taken together, such efforts should help ensure respect for fundamental rights is further strengthened as a basic pillar of EU law and policy. This will also reflect the fact that the \u201cEU is not just a union of states, but a union of people, granting rights to citizens and individuals,\u201d said Mr Dimitrakopoulos.", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2017/towards-stronger-social-rights-across-europe"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_1124", "date": "2017-03-23", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Study visit explores school integration of newly-arrived migrant children", "text": "They were interested in practices of preventing violence and promoting integration of newly-arrived migrant children.

Nearly 80 countries worldwide still criminalise sexual orientation; in five the sentence can be death. Although such persecution is a ground for claiming asylum under EU law, official figures are not collected, making it difficult to assess numbers of LGBTI applicants. However, civil society estimates of those seeking help, point to significant numbers. For example, in The Netherlands, one organisation alone was contacted by up to 3000 applicants. While the EU offers sanctuary to LGBTI people who may be tormented in their home countries, many Member States are failing to adequately support LGBTI asylum seekers, as this latest report shows. Some of the report\u2019s main findings include: Only a few Member States have national guidelines or training on interviewing LGBTI people. Interviews are often too short to specifically assess claims of LGBTI persecution. This is particularly problematic as applicants may be uncomfortable about revealing intimate aspects of their life. Asylum officers also tend to have stereotypical views on sexual orientation or gender identity such as knowledge of gay bars in their home country which applicants may not be aware of if they have lived in anti-LGBTI societies. In addition, interpreters may also have an anti-LGBTI bias. However, the report points to how civil society support has significantly improved the handling of asylum cases and applicants\u2019 openness towards asylum authorities. When it comes to reception conditions, in most Member States there are no special accommodation facilities for LGBTI people. However, special measures \u2013 such as transfers to single rooms \u2013 can often be used in cases of abuse or harassment but such hate crime tends not to be reported or recorded. Again LGBTI awareness training for reception centre staff is not systematic and is often provided by NGOs who also provide information leaflets. Transgender people often also face additional difficulties, especially when it comes to continuing their hormonal treatment. Treatment for asylum seekers may either be simply unavailable or on a case-by-case basis. The report also identifies promising practices that have been developed by, for example, Europe\u2019s Asylum Support Office that other Member States could use to support LGBTI asylum seekers. The European Commission asked the Agency to collect data about the fundamental rights situation of people arriving in Member States, particularly affected by large migration movements.

And their fierce resistance to integrate newcomers will continue. They will use lies; they will use fear and intimidation.\u201d He spoke of the effect that all this is having on minority communities, drawing on earlier Agency work. He spoke of many minorities experience widespread discrimination when looking for work; at work; when looking for housing; in education; or when accessing healthcare or social services.

They speak of integration as a dynamic, two-way process of mutual accommodation by all immigrants and residents of Member States. However, drawing on a report the Agency will publish on 15 March, he outlined some of the problems with existing integration approaches. For example, across the EU, different Member States have approached integration in different ways. As a result deficiencies in one or another Member State may impact others. In addition, often these approaches do not explicitly address people with a migrant background, even though they are often disadvantaged. They also tend to be \u201cblind to the situation of women\u201d which underlines the need for a gendered approach. Then there is the question of education and language learning, two elements vital for successful integration. Language learning is often of poor quality and rarely linked to on-the-job-training. There is also strong evidence of some form of segregation in schools revealing migrants and non-migrants living separate, divided lives. To help refocus integration efforts, he called on \u201call EU institutions, national governments, human rights institutions, civil society, social partners, and faith communities [to] do our part to ensure that the European project is one of which we can be proud; one that puts human dignity at its very heart.\u201d", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2017/facing-challenges-migrant-integration"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_1137", "date": "2017-03-09", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Legal experts discuss improvements to pre-trial detention", "text": "The meeting explored how pre-trial detention can be improved, including greater use of alternatives.

For women in particular, the picture is especially bleak. They remain trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty, social exclusion and unemployment. Exclusion from education impedes their access to meaningful employment which condemns them to a life of poverty and poor housing conditions. Roma women then remain in poverty, with low education without employment opportunities, limiting their choices in later life. A good education is the path to better jobs and better wages. But this road is closed to many young Roma women, who often drop out of secondary school without further training. Nearly three quarters of young Roma women aged 16-24 are not employed, in education or training, compared with over a half of young Roma men in the same age group, according to findings from the Agency\u2019s second EU Minorities and Discrimination survey in nine EU Member States. In countries like Greece, Portugal and Hungary the gender gap was even more marked. This gap translates to poorer job prospects: For example, only 20% of Roma women are in paid work compared with 41% of men. Often this is compounded by traditional gender roles where women do most of the domestic work in poor conditions without tap water, indoor bath, shower or toilet. Unsurprisingly, the health of Roma women also suffers. Clearly, Member States need to protect Roma girls and women from discrimination and give them a real chance to break free from the cycle of deprivation. This means ensuring they stay longer in school, receive training and learning support. Businesses and local authorities need to create training schemes and work opportunities for Roma women. And Roma communities should enjoy a decent standard of living free of poverty. Local efforts to empower Roma women should also be used to boost inclusion, as FRA research has found.\u00a0", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2017/help-roma-women-break-cycle-deprivation"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_1141", "date": "2017-03-02", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Combating discrimination for LGBTIQ workers", "text": "Access to justice was identified as one of the barriers faced by workers when faced with discrimination.

There are many people who are often exposed, vulnerable or at risk and need fundamental rights protection. Patterns of abuse continue such as the rise of hate speech. Then there is the rejection of human rights, and the loss of goodwill and commitment for rights among the general public. Taken together this is opening a window of opportunity for nationalistic politicians to \u201cstart chanting the glories of a past that never was and the promises of a triumphant future that will never be,\u201d as Commissioner Jourov\u00e1 put it. \u201cWe must hold the politicians to account when they try to pretend the past discrimination, hatred and tragedies did not happen. They may suffer from chronic amnesia, we must not make the same mistake,\u201d she warned. The testing times we face was also echoed by President Van der Bellen. He said the situation seems a lot worse for rights than it was 10 years ago: \u201cIt seems that these are not the times for human rights. A day does not go by without news reports of human rights violations in countries across all regions of the world.\u201d He argued that human rights are often seen as abstract when in fact they are very concrete and real: \u201cThey are what ordinary people all over the world in their daily life are striving for: to live a decent life free from fear and want.\u201d This thread was also picked up by Franco Frattini, the European Commission Vice President responsible for justice, freedom and security at the time FRA was created. \u201cMany fundamental rights are a pillar for European identity.\u201d \u201cIf Europe forgets promotion and protection rights Europe becomes an entity without a heart,\u201d he continued. However, he believed there is a growing realisation that we badly need greater efforts and more courageous political leadership at EU, but particularly at the national level to promote and protect rights. In response, we need to ensure there is human rights systems are not rejected. \u201cThere is no alternative; no plan B,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Flaherty. He also spoke of the need to be much smarter in promoting the business case for human rights s-, to convince leaders and society that the human rights way is the right way to go, as ultimately it will lead to better outcomes. This is already being picked up by many businesses who recognise the value of diversity in their workforce for example, as Beate Winkler, former Director of FRA\u2019s predecessor, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia also pointed out. There is also a need to reconnect with the public better so they understand that rights are also about them, their families and their neighbours. Human rights are for everyone and not only for minorities. Tackling serious inequalities that lie at the root of many right violations also needs addressing. The example of high levels of poverty among children and Roma in many Member States was given. Here socio-economic rights require greater focus and the EU\u2019s move towards a European Pillar of Social Rights is a welcome step forward for many speakers. The FRA Director also spoke of the importance of being local where rights matter. Rights need to be brought to the villages and local communities; mayors have to be motivated to make a difference and bring about change on the ground for everyday people. Looking back, Michael O\u2019Flaherty spoke of the many achievements the Agency has made since it opened its doors. It has brought badly needed data to feed the laws that help shape our lives. Its work has also given its number one client, right holders, people, a seat at the table so they can voice their experiences. Many speakers underlined the many achievements Europe can all be proud of. Frauke Seidensticker, FRA\u2019s Management Board Chairperson, said: \u201cThe EU has developed a formidable array of structures and practices to protect fundamental rights.\u201d These include the EU\u2019s Charter of Fundamental Rights, a Commission First Vice President specifically in charge of fundamental rights, accredited national human rights institutions, equality bodies, fundamental rights compliance checks for all laws and policies, and the creation of FRA. The mainstreaming of human rights as never before was also cited as a considerable achievement by former FRA Director, Morten Kjaerum, Director of the Raoul Wallenberg Institute of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law. There was also widespread recognition of the important role the Agency has played and should continue to play. Ulrike Lunacek, European Parliament Vice President, said it was a \u201cunique provider of comparative landmark studies.\u201d She also spoke of the parliament\u2019s efforts to strengthen FRA\u2019s mandate. Commissioner Jourov\u00e1 said: \u201cFRA's work alerts and guides our political action: for example the 2014 survey on violence against women opened Europe\u00b4s eyes to the extent of the problem.\u201d Looking ahead, FRA\u2019s Director said the Agency will continue to do what it does well and deliver the robust evidence-based advice that has become the hallmark of its first 10 years. However, he also said the Agency will become more agile. For this it needs to be relevant, act in real-time and have a tangible impact on the ground. As a result in 2017, while continuing to work on its priority areas, it will also directly support civil society to see how best to address the problem of shrinking space for civil society. It will also seek to strengthen national human rights institutions and equality bodies, explore how best to better communicate human rights, and call out abuses where the Agency sees them and act accordingly. First and foremost it will remain the body giving a face and a voice to vulnerable people at risk. Others also underlined the importance of FRA for a right-based future. International law professor, Jan Wouters, Director of the Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies said: \u201cFRA should remain central to EU human rights efforts in the decades to come.\u201d President Van der Bellen is \u201cconvinced that over the next 10 years the work of the Agency will be even more indispensable\u201d. In summing up, Frauke Seidensticker was inspired by all the remarks made throughout the day. It showed \u201cwe have a strong basis for human rights in the EU...

This includes physical and psychological violence, torture, inhuman or degrading treatment. Lengthy bureaucracy, uncertainty about the outcome of asylum proceedings and poor reception conditions can compound their suffering. In Denmark alone, there were 120 suicide attempts and incidents of suicidal behaviour among asylum seekers in 2016, of which 29 were by children. Despite international and EU laws guarding against such treatment and offering support to victims, many Member States are falling short of their duties, as this latest report shows. Some of the report\u2019s main findings include: The true extent of suffering is hard to gauge as only limited data on the victims of torture and trauma and on suicide attempts is collected in the other 13 Member States studied. Only Greece regularly collects information on torture victims. Recurrent violence or the excessive use of force by state officials or those working on their behalf was not found although there were cases of individual and localised incidents. However, serious incidents are more frequent along EU external border zones. Identifying victims is problematic given the lack of formal screening procedures. Instead it heavily relies on the expertise and knowledge of individual staff, although tools are increasingly being developed to facilitate identification by non-experts. Access to support is limited by the number of specialised medical staff who can provide psychological or psychiatric help. The lack of staff often leads to long waiting periods; for example, in Germany around 5,600 asylum seekers waited over a year to receive treatment. It is also a challenge starting therapy when asylum applicants are homeless or live in reception facilities that are not adequate to sustain the therapy. Despite training, monitoring bodies and complaints mechanisms in all Member States, their effectiveness in preventing ill-treatment varies from country to country. Despite the lack of attention to torture and trauma victims, the report also identifies promising practices that other Member States could adopt to identify and support victims. The European Commission asked the Agency to collect data about the fundamental rights situation of people arriving in Member States, particularly affected by large migration movements. The reports cover 14 Member States: Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden.

On the positive side, he recalled the drafting of the Yogyakarta Principles \u2013 an initially modest initiative which had become something remarkable in framing LGBTI equality issues as human rights issues. He also referred to developments on a global level, including the UN OHCHR report Living Free and Equal, which maps hundreds of good practices in tackling violence and discrimination against LGBTIQ persons and the recent appoint of an Independent Expert on LGBTI issues. However, he added, a sombre reminder on what remains to be done is clear when one looks at the large number of countries where being gay or lesbian carries the death penalty. In that context he announced that the issue of LGBTIQ asylum seekers will be the topic of a short report by the FRA in March. In the EU context, he drew attention to three orientation papers by the FRA on the issues of LGBTIQ equality mainstreaming in education, healthcare and public safety, which are the topics of panel discussions at the event, based on extensive FRA research. In order to meaningfully address these issues in the EU, the FRA Director proposed nine framing items: 1. Avoid geographic bias \u2013 LGBTIQ issues are everywhere, and no country gets it completely right. 2. It\u2019s not just about being nice or fair, it\u2019s about the law. 3. The principle of equality for all must be respected. 4. Avoid making LGBTIQ people a problem, but instead acknowledge that it is society and population that may in fact bring the obstacles to equality. 5. The attitude of the public towards LGBTIQ people is still an issue - FRA\u2019s LGBT survey showed there is not one EU Member State where more than half the LGBTIQ community are willing to hold hands in public. 6. The rights of LGBTIQ people must be respected \u2013 e.g. when accessing healthcare, they should not have to avoid asking for the help they need. 7. More attention should be paid to the situation of trans- and intersex persons. 8. There is a need to better identify and learn from good practices. 9.\u00a0LGBTIQ hate crimes should be prosecuted and apologies demanded for historic abuses.

In addition, the EU\u2019s very own bill of rights, the Charter of Fundamental Rights underlines the importance of data protection by dedicating a self-standing article to this right that has become so central to our increasingly digital lives. This article on the protection of personal data tells us three things: our data can be used only for specified purposes, only after consent, and we have the right to access the data collected about us. In reality, many people across the EU are concerned about how their data are being protected. Over 90% of Europeans strongly believe in the need to protect their personal data, according to a recent Eurobarometer survey. At the same time over 90% want the same data protection rights across the EU, regardless of where their data are processed. The EU\u2019s new data protection rules that were adopted in May 2016 hope to make this a reality with considerably stronger data protection safeguards. The aim is to empower users. People should regain control of their personal data. Users have the \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019, a \u2018right of data portability\u2019, greater access to their data and the possibility to demand the end of use of their data. They can also sue for compensation if they feel these rights are being violated. The new wide-ranging rules will have an impact on everything that holds or uses personal data in and out of Europe. They aim to ensure data protection by design and by default. This means safeguards should be inbuilt to products and services from the earliest stage of development, and privacy-friendly default settings should become the norm \u2013 for example on social networks or mobile apps.

At the same time, a keen sensitivity to the past can be harnessed for the present. This appalling episode in human history demonstrates the non-negotiable need for respect and tolerance across our societies today.\u201d \u201cIt is important to remember that the Holocaust did not begin with murder \u2013 it began with words and progressed to the denigration of fundamental rights, culminating in genocide. This is why the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance feel so strongly about combating all forms of hate speech, including antisemitism. Hate speech does not respect national borders so we stand united with our international partners, including the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, to tackle this scourge at the roots,\u201d\u00a0 said Ambassador Mihnea Constantinescu, Chair of the IHRA. In the wake of the Second World War and the terrible tragedy of the Holocaust, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was developed as a comprehensive corpus of rights to which everyone is entitled on the basis of the humanity we all share. The rights set out in the Universal Declaration subsequently evolved further in international treaties, national constitutions, policies and laws. However, despite the strong international and European human rights framework, we are witnessing massive backsliding on human rights commitments in many places. This makes it all the more important to fight Holocaust denial and distortion, and to learn from the past in order to ensure future generations in Europe are not confronted with the horrors of war and genocide. The Fundamental Rights Agency is one of the IHRA\u2019s seven permanent international partners. Together, we are committed to honouring the victims of the Holocaust and raising awareness of the past today in order to prevent the fundamental rights violations of the future. The Holocaust shows us the potential consequences of policies that deprive people of their fundamental rights and trample on human dignity. Holocaust and human rights education can therefore teach us much about the role of remembrance and good citizenship, which is so needed today.", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2017/educating-future-through-learning-past"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_1177", "date": "2017-01-26", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Reviewing measures to combat sexual orientation discrimination in the EU", "text": "The presentation in Brussels on 20 January was given in the framework of deliberations on the EU\u2019s proposed Equal Treatment Directive.

It currently stores the fingerprints that all asylum seekers and migrants apprehended at the EU\u2019s external borders must provide. It allows Member States to check if someone has already elsewhere applied for asylum or been apprehended when crossing external EU borders. Law enforcements authorities can also access it to help fight serious crime and terrorism. The European Commission has proposed revising the Eurodac Regulation to expand the scope so it can also be used to control irregular immigration and movement within the EU. Facial images and personal data would also be stored instead of just fingerprints and basic data such as gender and Member State. Personal data would also be kept for longer (ten years for international protection applicants and five years for those who have been apprehended) and the age for capturing data from children would be lowered from 14 to 6. The European Parliament asked the Agency to provide its Opinion on the fundamental rights impact of the proposals on children. Some of the suggestions to ensure the Regulation fully respects the EU Charter for Fundamental Rights and international human rights treaties include: Avoiding force when taking fingerprints which should also be carried out in a child-friendly and gender-sensitive manner \u2013 the Agency\u2019s checklist for taking fingerprints could help; Adequately informing children in an age appropriate manner so that they understand what is happening and why; Adding the aim of identifying and protecting trafficked and missing children to the proposal. To facilitate family reunification, information about family links should also be captured. Maintaining existing rules that restrict access for law enforcement authorities. The existing rules state that access is only possible after other databases have been consulted and when there is evidence that access will help combat terrorism or serious crime. Protecting trafficked children by only allowing law enforcement authorities responsible for combating child trafficking and Europol to consult Eurodac. \u00a0\u00a0 Strengthening the safeguards when sharing Eurodac data with non-EU countries to prevent applicants and their families from harm in the country of origin and to ensure that only necessary return data is shared once return decisions are final. Including the possibility to amend and correct data as part of a regular data review to improve accuracy. This would also guard against potential mismatches. Carefully evaluating how the processing of facial images impacts fundamental rights before introducing facial recognition technology; FRA could assist this evaluation.

After opening with the contribution of Poland and its people to the values that underpin European identity and to the establishment of international and EU human rights law, the Director stressed that despite Europe\u2019s solid and sophisticated human rights framework, these rights are in danger. \u201cHuman rights are often regarded as an abstract concept. But the threats to those rights in Europe are very specific and concrete.\u201d Detailing the areas in which the Fundamental Rights Agency is currently observing particular threats to human rights in the EU, he spoke about hatred and discrimination, threats to freedom of speech, and security measures that are not based on or even ignore human rights. He pointed out that while ensuring the safety of everyone in the EU is of primary importance, security must not be invoked as an excuse for the repression of democratic freedoms. Protecting rights Mr O\u2019Flaherty then moved on to speak about the most essential elements of human rights protection. He emphasised first of all that such protection is not possible without adherence to the rule of law, which includes the independence of the judiciary and of the institutions that comprise the overall human rights framework. A thriving and vibrant civil society is also crucial. Finally, a sensitivity to the past is vital in order to better understand the present, thus ensuring that history is used to heal and not divide. In closing, the Director said that rather than a crisis of human rights, Europe is facing \u201ca major crisis of commitment,\u201d with human rights too often viewed as an optional extra that can be sacrificed. He ended by saying: \u201cWe must have the courage of our convictions, the courage to speak out against human rights violations, and the courage to act. With this courage, with energy and with good will, we can overcome this crisis to ensure that human rights protection does not become a hollow shell, but remains at the beating heart of our societies.\u201d Communicating rights Taking questions from the floor, Mr O\u2019Flaherty underlined failures in recent years to communicate the importance of human rights in creating just societies that enjoy sustainable economic growth and provide the framework in which all its members can flourish. \u201cWe need to think about whether we\u2019re being effective in communicating the advantages of human rights and EU membership more generally. We must not turn people into problems because they hold views we don\u2019t like, but rather consider what we have been doing wrong and how we can better convince them.\u201d ", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2017/fra-director-speaks-protecting-human-rights-challenging-times"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_1185", "date": "2017-01-20", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Icy conditions threaten migrants\u2019 health", "text": "Access the January monthly data collection highlights\u00a0>> The Agency\u2019s latest summary identifies pressing fundamental rights issues that need addressing in various EU Member States. Some of the main findings include: In many countries new arrivals continue to fall. For example, arrivals to Greece in December 2016 dropped 98% compared to the same month in 2015. However, the extreme cold in south eastern Europe severely affected people on the move resulting in some, including children, dying from or being hospitalised with frostbite. Others were made to wait in the cold in self-made tents in transit zones for the chance to apply for asylum; as a result at the Hungarian-Serbian border every second person is sick, many with fever, colds or the flu. Overcrowding remains a persistent problem at hotspot and reception facilities with many housed in buildings without heating despite the harsh weather. Immigration detention also continues to be common practice in many Member States and is increasing in some places. Problems in accessing protection procedures continue to be reported during initial registration and asylum processing. Unaccompanied children can be left waiting in transit zones for admission for over two months and families for over six months. Lack of information and a shortage of interpreters further exacerbate the situation. People facilitating the arrival of migrants without profit continue to be prosecuted and sometimes imprisoned in various countries. In Denmark, migrants helping family members or others arrive may be expelled in addition to a fine or a prison sentence. When it comes to returns, there is concern about the lack of information and advance notice in some countries; for example in Austria a child was taken from school during a lesson. In Sweden, the police increasingly ask municipal services for help in locating undocumented migrants who have dependent children and receive benefits. Child protection remains problematic in many countries. The lack of standardised methods for assessing age, overburdened or insufficient numbers of guardians, too few places in adequate and secure facilities, and little attention being paid to the child\u2019s right to be heard remain common concerns. Hate speech online and off, and violent crime continue to remain high with intolerance in society and in public speech against asylum seekers and migrants on the rise. In Germany, the media refrain from naming reporters covering demonstrations as a result of violent attacks. In northern Italy, the regional governing party has called on mayors to name places associated with the Muslim community to strictly control Islamic worship in the region. In some countries the political response to the migration situation is hardening. Legislative initiatives in several Member States aim at reducing basic benefits, restricting family reunification and facilitating and accelerating returns. However, especially over the Christmas period, there have been numerous charitable and civil society initiatives to support migrant groups in many Member States. The European Commission asked the Agency to collect data about the fundamental rights situation of people arriving in Member States particularly affected by large migration movements. The reports cover 14 Member States: Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden.

The Agency provided fundamental rights expertise to the European Commission, EASO and Frontex on their operations in Greece and Italy, as in 2016 those countries remained the main points of entry for asylum seekers and migrants to the EU.\u00a0It delivered practical on-the-ground support to EU actors and national authorities working directly in the 'hotspots' set up in Greece.\u00a0The Agency also carried out fact-finding missions to the Italian 'hotspots'\u00a0to familiarise itself with the fundamental rights challenges arising there. Observations from the ground fed into an Opinion on the fundamental rights situation in the hotspots. It made suggestions on how to deal with the challenges that can arise when the stay of new arrivals is prolonged and the concerns related to unaccompanied children, as temporary guardianship systems fall under considerable pressure. Another FRA Opinion analysed the impact on children of the proposal for a revised Dublin Regulation, which is the EU's rules for determining which Member State is responsible for dealing with each asylum application (known as the\u00a0'Dublin System').\u00a0 In parallel, over the course of the year the Agency collected data on the fundamental rights situation of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees arriving in EU Member States most affected by migration. These were compiled in monthly overviews, with each month focusing on a different theme, such as family reunification, hate crime and trafficking. Hindering hate crime Concern over immigration, terrorist attacks and populist rhetoric contributed to rising intolerance across Europe. As a result, hate crime once again plagued the EU. To tackle this core fundamental rights abuse, proper recording and reporting of hate crime incidents is required. The Agency\u2019s compendium of best practices on recording and reporting hate crime showcased practical examples of what Member States are doing for others to follow. Further guidance can be found in the Agency\u2019s report on the perspectives of professionals working on hate crime. It highlights hurdles that impede victims\u2019 access to justice. They both marked the end of the Agency\u2019s Hate Crime Working Party, which became part of the European Commission\u2019s High Level Group on racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance. Media and politicians can also amplify intolerant attitudes in society, an issue explored by the Agency in its paper for the European Commission\u2019s second Annual Colloquium on Fundamental Rights. Such intolerance can ultimately incite hatred and even violence, marginalise migrants and minorities, and erect barriers to an inclusive society. Fostering inclusion These barriers are felt by people across Europe as the Agency\u2019s surveys repeatedly reveal. The latest is the second EU minorities and discrimination survey, which surveyed approximately 26,000 people from immigrant or ethnic minority backgrounds living in the EU. Looking initially and specifically at Roma, Europe\u2019s largest minority, the results pointed to intolerable discrimination, appalling deprivation and unequal access to vital services. Some 80% of Roma surveyed live below their country\u2019s at-risk-of-poverty threshold and every third Roma child lives in a household where someone went to bed hungry at least once in the previous month. The findings underline the need for consistent efforts to combat discrimination and provide sufficient employment opportunities. These are the bedrocks in creating inclusive, equitable societies. Further results will emerge in 2017 when the Agency will present the main results from the survey. Fundamental Rights Forum \u2013 a platform for change All of these issues were explored in-depth during the 2016 Fundamental Rights Forum where centred around three key themes: refugee protection; inclusion; and the digital age. Under the motto of Rights, Respect, Reality: the Europe of Values in Today's World, over 700 participants from different walks of life around the world gathered in Vienna. Practitioners, grassroots workers, thinkers and high-level decision makers collaborated on solutions to Europe\u2019s most pressing fundamental rights problems. These led to the Chairman\u2019s Statement of around 100 recommendations for promoting and protecting fundamental rights, distilled from the lively debates during the 4-day event. Looking ahead to 2017 Next year, the Agency will have its ten year anniversary. The Agency will mark this event with a symposium to reflect on how fundamental rights have evolved over this period and the challenges that remain. In 2017, the Agency will release some of the results of EU-MIDIS II, the largest EU-wide survey of experiences of and attitudes towards some of Europe's most marginalised communities, including Roma, Muslims, and other minority/migrant groups. This will allow for comparison with teh situation ten years earlier when the\u00a0Agency for the first time undertook such a survey. With intolerance and hate an increasing concern across many Member States, the results of the survey should\u00a0galvanise efforts to address this worrying trend.

Separated children may arrive with another adult who can be a relative or an unrelated carer, but also an abusive adult, smuggler or trafficker. This potential risk underlines the need for specific harmonised guidance to safeguard such children. Some of the report\u2019s main findings include: Member States do not collect data on separated children; when they are registered, they are generally classed as unaccompanied children without their specific needs being catered to. Guidance on how to handle separated children is also lacking, resulting in different approaches in different regions, cities or even reception centres. Separated children also tend not to be informed about asylum procedures, the possibility of applying for asylum independently from the accompanying adult, and the consequences of different choices. They are often housed with the accompanying adult before their relationship is assessed. This places the child at risk of abuse. There are considerable difficulties establishing the relationship between the child and accompanying adult. This can be due to the lack of official documentation or the high cost of DNA testing. Sometimes the accompanying adult becomes responsible for the child without assessing whether the person is capable and willing to take care of the child. The approaches to migrant children married abroad varies. Most Member States recognise, under certain conditions, marriages which occurred outside the EU. Even though the child may be a victim of forced marriage, child protection authorities are rarely consulted. Migration authorities mainly decide on family reunification transfers.\u00a0 When it comes to the monitoring of reception facilities where children are housed, there is often a lack of coordination and clarity about who is ultimately responsible. The European Commission asked the Agency to collect data about the fundamental rights situation of people arriving in Member States, particularly affected by large migration movements.

We all have a duty to stem this erosion of the humane values that form the cornerstone of European society.\u201d One example of this growing intolerance is the hostility towards migrants and asylum seekers, as the Agency\u2019s latest summary of migration-related fundamental rights in selected EU Member States reveals. Hate crime incidents range from everyday harassment to arson attacks, violence, and even murder. Children are also under threat, particular migrant children. Some 30% of the migrants arriving in the EU are children, many unaccompanied. They face enormous risks along the migration route, including sexual abuse and exploitation. Once they arrive, detention of children 'for their own safety' in inadequate conditions is still a regular practice. Although Member States are making efforts to improve guardianship systems, they often remain ill-equipped to deal with the current migration situation. A recent report from the Agency also highlighted the plight of Roma in the EU and the widespread deprivation that is destroying Roma lives. Families are living excluded from society in shocking conditions, while children with little education face bleak prospects for the future. Only 30% of the Roma in FRA\u2019s newly published survey are in paid work, compared with the average EU employment rate of 70%. Human Rights Day is celebrated on 10 December each year. This year\u2019s campaign, \u2018Stand up for someone's rights today!\u2019, reminds us where human rights begin: \u201cIn small places, close to home - so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world,\u201d as Eleanor Roosevelt put it. These include the shops, factories, offices, farms and neighbourhoods where we work and live. Together, we can make a difference. For this though, we need to reaffirm our commitment to respect, promote and protect human rights for all, no matter who they are. The EU Agency for Fundamental Rights will continue to engage with its partners and stakeholders to champion fundamental rights and to provide the evidence and law-based advice needed to bring about meaningful change.", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2016/stand-my-your-their-rights"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_1218", "date": "2016-12-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Data collection lack of progress impedes antisemitism fight", "text": "This latest report, Antisemitism: Summary overview of data available in the European Union 2005\u20132015, reveals large gaps in data collection on antisemitism in EU Member States, as previous overviews also noted. In addition, each Member State collects different types of data, preventing any meaningful comparison of the data collected. Nevertheless, where comprehensive data exist, they show that antisemitism remains a serious concern which demands decisive and targeted policy responses. This would not only better protect Jewish communities against antisemitism, but would also send a clear signal that across the EU the fundamental rights of all people are protected and safeguarded. Greater efforts need to be made to counter underreporting. Not only do victims and witnesses need to be encouraged to report antisemitic incidents, but the authorities need to have systems in place that would record such incidents. Continued and sustained efforts at the national, European and international levels, as well as at the level of civil society, are needed to improve data collection on hate crime, including antisemitism. However, steps in the right direction are being made. These include the European Commission\u2019s appointment of an EU antisemitism coordinator in December 2015, alongside the Agency\u2019s work under the EU\u2019s High Level Group on racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance chairing a subgroup on methodologies on recording and collecting data on hate crime. National victimisation surveys, similar to the one the Agency carried out among Jews in the EU, can also help Member States gauge antisemitism and how well they are doing combating it. Taken together such evidence can paint a more complete and accurate picture of antisemitism. This is turn should allow Member States progress in their longstanding fight against antisemitism. The updated report compiles available data on antisemitic incidents collected by international, governmental and non-governmental sources, from 1 January 2005 until 31 December 2015. No official data on reported antisemitic incidents in 2015 were available for Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Malta, Portugal and Slovenia by the time this report was compiled.

Migrants are often housed in overcrowded reception centres that are ill-equipped to keep women and children safe from violence and harassment. The lack of appropriate information also leads migrants to be uncertain and ill-informed about their legal rights. In addition, unaccompanied children are at risk of neglect and abuse or detained for their \u2018own safety\u2019 and subject to temporary guardianship systems that are ineffective. To address some of these challenges the Agency\u2019s migration hotspots Opinion makes a number of suggestions. These include: improving information flows about procedures and the status of applications to ease tensions among migrants as well as providing translations and child-friendly information; free and greater access to legal counsel; better protection for children such as prioritising the claims of unaccompanied children, vetting staff, individual risk assessments and sufficient resources for child guardians; qualified staff who are trained how to work with children, to identify victims of trafficking and gender-based violence; and avoiding excessive use of detention for migrants who will be returned. The EU\u2019s current Dublin rules determine which Member State is responsible to examine applications for international protection. However, applying these rules can take up to 11 months, leading to bottlenecks and leaving applicants, particularly children, in challenging circumstances. To improve the rules, the EU is proposing revisions. The Agency\u2019s Opinion on the impact on children of the proposed revisions to the Dublin rules underlines the need to adhere to existing child rights standards. This will ensure children\u2019s best interests are taken into account, their rights to be heard and informed are respected, and guardians, not only legal representatives, are appointed. Promoting family unity and safeguarding unaccompanied children should be prioritised while also allowing sufficient time for thorough assessments and information collection rather than using fast tracked procedures. This also means allowing new information on family members to be considered rather than using pre-determined deadlines. Both Opinions were requested by the European Parliament. The Agency\u2019s assessment should feed into revisions to the EU\u2019s new Dublin rules, and guide the EU and its Member States better safeguard fundamental rights in the hotspots in Greece and Italy. They complement the Agency\u2019s regular overviews of migration-related fundamental rights challenges in selected EU Member States and its evidence-based advice.

Its focus paper on CRPD-inspired reforms, and the Agency\u2019s Fundamental Rights Report both examined developments that have taken place. For example, in the last ten years, eight EU Member States have taken steps to give people with disabilities greater autonomy, and respect their will and preference by replacing substitute-decision making with laws and policies that give people with disabilities equal recognition by law. In addition, in the last two years, over 10 EU Member States have adopted CRPD-relevant strategies and action plans. The EU, itself having signed the convention, has also taken steps to fulfil its obligations. It has changed EU financing rules under its European Structural and Investment Fund to ensure accessibility improvements are a condition for receiving money. Civil society organisations must also be part of the planning, implementation and monitoring of such EU-funded projects in their Member State, giving a voice to disabled people\u2019s organisations.\u00a0 In addition, just two months ago, the European parliament adopted a Directive on the accessibility of public sector websites. A European Commission proposal for a wider Accessibility Act is also currently being discussed by the EU Council. These are some of the steps the EU is taking to fulfil the recommendations it received from the UN\u2019s CRPD Committee in 2015. Further steps will be taken by the EU, some of which will be set out in the update of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 that will be published by the end of 2016. The EU\u2019s CRPD Framework, chaired by the Agency, will also help guide the EU when it comes to implementing the CRPD. The convention has also had a much wider reach. It is spearheading a drive to a human-rights based approach to disability globally. The UN\u2019s new 15-year plan for global development \u2013 the Sustainable Development Goals \u2013 includes the needs of people with disabilities for the first time. Four areas in particular have been singled out: inclusive education; reducing inequality; promoting full employment; and ensuring accessibility for all. Not only that, when tracking the goals\u2019 progress, the data being collected will also specifically identify people with disabilities. In only 10 years, the convention has already made a mark in helping to improve the rights and lives of people with disabilities across the EU.

In June, the monthly report focused on gender-based violence. The report highlights various realities and threats that women and girls face once they are in the EU. While all of the nine EU countries looked at in the Agency\u2019s report have one or more measures in place to protect female asylum seekers, very few have comprehensive responses. The realities on the ground can mean inadequate provision of separate accommodation for males and females, problems with separate washing facilities, and a lack of security to enhance women\u2019s safety. In addition, provision of information on gender-based violence and how to report it is a major weakness in all Member States covered in the report. This situation increases non-reporting of abuse and allows abusers to act with relative impunity. Various EU and national laws and policies take gender-based violence into consideration when it comes to granting asylum and when receiving asylum seekers. In addition, the European Parliament has called for new gender guidelines to better protect female refugees. The European Commission has also suggested that the EU ratifies the Council of Europe\u2019s Convention on combating violence against women and domestic violence (the Istanbul Convention), which also covers migration and asylum. This would provide a solid legal basis for addressing violence against all women. Until such initiatives materialise, the Agency\u2019s report identifies areas Member States could address to help combat violence against migrant women and girls. These include: better information on gender-based violence and what to do if it happens; staff guidelines and training; and separate facilities for females and support for victims, including legal support. Taken together, these measures could significantly help eliminate violence against migrant women and girls seeking sanctuary in the EU.

Technology will always stay ahead of law and social policy,\" he said, opening the session 'Protecting journalists and their freedom of expression' on the second day of the Colloquium. \"We don\u2019t need more basic international human rights law with regard to the issues at play. What we need is better attention to and understanding of, delivery of, implementation of and better framing of the issues in the categories of international human rights law.\" This point was echoed by Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens, a former Judge and Vice-President of the European Court of Human Rights and a member of FRA\u2019s Scientific Committee. \u201cWe don\u2019t need more law but more enforcement, more respect for court rulings,\u201d she said during the same session. It was suggested during the session that in order to defend media freedom in its broadest sense, the EU and its Member States could adopt a multi-stakeholder approach that brings together all those already active in the field. In this regard, some kind of inter-institutional framework could be put forward. Fostering a vibrant civil society can also ensure that government authorities or the private sector cannot limit media freedom with impunity. Speaking on the first day of the Colloquium, FRA\u2019s Director also talked about the responsibility of journalists and all those with a public voice not to incite hatred. A second FRA paper published on the occasion of the Colloquium that covers incitement in media content and political discourse shows that \"16 Member States report incitement in the media, which is typically aimed at minority groups in this societies. The study of FRA shows inadequate policing within this field, in terms of criminal prosecution, the proceedings towards incitement are not consistently carried out.\" The EU could play a useful role in \"soft approaches to deal with and challenge incitement in the media,\" he added. The Colloquium focused this year on media pluralism and democracy.

The report identifies serious and widespread incidents of violence, harassment, threats and hate speech towards migrants and asylum seekers, and their children, across 14 EU Member States. Human rights advocates, \u2018pro-refugee\u2019 politicians and journalists have also been targeted. It points to some of the perceived perpetrators, and highlights the problem of under-reporting and under-recording of hate crime which impedes efforts to find effective responses. Some of the main findings include: Most Member States do not collect or publish statistical data on hate crime incidents against asylum seekers and migrants; civil society often are the main sources of information. Vigilantes and the general public are often behind the attacks. Offline and online hate speech, including by public figures who sometimes even condone attacks, is fuelling open intolerance. This intolerance is spilling over to other parts of society with Muslims, especially women, and people from ethnic backgrounds, particularly targeted. Asylum seekers and migrants rarely report hate crimes to authorities or other organisations for a number of reasons. These include: a lack of trust in the police and public authorities; fear of arrest, being deported or of retaliation; a belief that nothing will change; and language barriers. Under-reporting also leads to the issue being buried. State responses to hate crime against asylum seekers and migrants are perceived as weak by civil society in many Member States. Victim support services that meet the needs of asylum seekers and migrants are rare. Asylum seekers and migrants also have limited access to existing support. EU laws offer protection to victims and the Agency has compiled information about various initiatives that tackle hate crime in the EU. However, Member States lack the robust data they need to prevent hate crime, and protect and promote the rights of migrants and asylum seekers in an increasingly openly intolerant Europe. The European Commission asked the Agency to collect data about the fundamental rights situation of people arriving in Member States, particularly affected by large migration movements. As of this month, the reports cover the situation in 14 Member States: Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden. FRA has published overviews since September 2015. Each overview covers such issues as: initial registration and asylum applications; criminal proceedings initiated for offences related to irregular border crossings; child protection; reception conditions for new arrivals; access to healthcare; public response such as rallies of support, humanitarian assistance or voluntary work; racist incidents such as demonstrations, online hate speech or hate crime.

The monthly reports consistently point to inadequate reception facilities often resulting in incidents of abuse, sexual assault and children going missing. The findings underline the need for specific measures to protect children from violence. This includes training staff to identify children at risk and having clear and efficient guardianships procedures that can offer children protection. However, migrant children are not the only ones at risk. The problem is much wider than that. Results from FRA\u2019s violence against women survey underlined the scale of childhood abuse throughout the EU. Some 12% of women had experienced sexual violence by an adult before they were 15 years old. Prevention is therefore of paramount importance. Greater efforts and emphasis should be placed on identifying risks of abuse and taking action to minimise these risks. These include training to help staff in social, health and education services spot potential risks factors, identifying at risk families, home visits, and additional safeguards for children in reception and detention centres. Given the prevalence of such abuse there is a strong need for procedural safeguards during judicial proceedings. Concrete measures on a child\u2019s right to be informed, to be heard and to be protected should be made standard practice. This includes ensuring that there are no possibilities of meeting defendants and their families before, during and after hearings. This does not just apply to hearings but also in the waiting areas or when entering or leaving court buildings, as the Agency\u2019s research has shown.\u00a0Soon the Agency will also provide a report on the views of children in judicial proceedings.

There is a system of impunity that rests on three pillars: a fragmentation of criminal law provisions, a lack of monitoring (in particular a lack of inspections from labour inspectorates), and a lack of proactive police investigations. Building on its 2015 report, the Fundamental Rights Agency will continue its research in 2017 by carrying out face-to-face interviews with foreign workers in the EU who have been exploited for their labour. This research will fill a significant gap in research on the subject, and will provide legislators, policy makers and those responsible for combating severe labour exploitation at EU and national level with the evidence necessary to further develop effective measures to counter severe labour exploitation. Moving on to discuss the Roma, Michael O\u2019Flaherty presented new data from the Fundamental Rights Agency\u2019s survey of Roma across nine EU Member States, which will be published at the end of this month. He emphasised that the Roma employment rate is much lower than among the general population, while the gap between young Roma not in employment, education or training and their peers around the EU is still larger. In closing, the Director pointed out that in the area of disability, the EU has a disability employment gap of some 23 percentage points, with only 48% of people with impairments in employment.

Over 100 representatives from international and EU institutions, national governments, judges and other legal professionals, national human rights institutions and other \u2018access to justice\u2019 actors will be invited. They will exchange real-life practices and experiences in order to develop practical suggestions on how to strengthen cross-border justice. Participants will examine current trends and challenges in cross-border justice. They will focus on three particular areas and the related EU laws: common EU-wide rules to ensure fairness; mutual trust and mutual recognition among national legal practitioners; and better information and targeted guidance to improve rights awareness and access to justice. FRA will also use the event to launch two new reports and promote its access to justice handbook for legal practitioners which will be published in Slovak during the event, with more language versions to follow later. One report looks at right of suspected and accused people across the EU to translation, interpretation and information; the other looks at fundamental rights in pre- and post-trial cross-border transfer procedures in relation to criminal detention and their alternatives in the EU. Taken together, the event and reports aim to bring justice closer to everybody in the EU. They will enable decision makers to better understand and hence tackle the challenges in facilitating cross-border access to justice and national legal professionals to address the barriers in cross-border justice by drawing on existing promising practices.", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2016/trust-cross-border-justice"}, {"id": "FRA_NEWS_1292", "date": "2016-10-28", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Rights and border management discussed at Biometrics Institute\u2019s Annual Conference", "text": "It drew on findings from its current project on biometrics in large-scale EU migration databases.

The report highlights these four priority areas after reviewing data collected over the past year. It signposts key areas that should be addressed to better safeguard the rights of asylum seekers and migrants. Some of the main findings include: Unaccompanied children \u2013 inadequate first child reception facilities often result in missing children. Qualified staff and clear guidance to identify children at risk are often lacking. Guardianship remains problematic with delays in appointment or the temporary use of reception staff hindering child protection and family reunification. In addition, children face legal and practical obstacles to access asylum procedures. They may also be detained to protect and prevent them from absconding. Violence and hate speech against migrants \u2013hate crime and hate speech continues to be a major concern and seems to be worsening and spreading in some Member States. It spans physical attacks and murder, damage to property including arson, threats to aid workers and service providers, and hostile demonstrations against refugees. Such incidents are often politically-motivated and in part being carried out by vigilantes. There also have been incidents of police violence. Safety and protection at reception facilities \u2013 While they may have various protection and safety measures, incidents of abuse and sexual assault on women and children have been reported. This points to the need for specific measures to protect vulnerable people against violence that are often lacking. Impact on local communities \u2013 The lack of information and contact between local and refugee communities is contributing to growing hostility in many local communities. However, shifting budgets to the local level to deal with the impact of arrivals and integrating migrant children into local schools seems to be improving. Numerous challenges still remain to safeguard asylum seekers and migrants. This report underlines persistent issues from the past year that the EU and its Member States need to urgently address. The European Commission asked the Agency to collect data about the fundamental rights situation of people arriving in Member States, particularly affected by large migration movements. The countries covered are: Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy and Sweden. From next month, the Agency will extending reporting from Denmark, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia and Spain. Future reports will be shorter, including main findings for the Member States covered together with a thematic focus section. Specific findings for the Member States will include references to these for a better understanding of the challenges which affect several EU\u00a0Member States or the EU as a whole. FRA has published overviews since September 2015. Each overview covers such issues as: initial registration and asylum applications; criminal proceedings initiated for offences related to irregular border crossings; child protection; reception conditions for new arrivals; access to healthcare; public response such as rallies of support, humanitarian assistance or voluntary work; racist incidents such as demonstrations, online hate speech or hate crime.
