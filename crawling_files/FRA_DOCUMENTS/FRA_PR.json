Yet in some countries, civil society organisations are under great strain,\u201d said FRA Director, Michael O\u2019Flaherty. \u201cWhile there are some green shoots of hope, the EU and EU countries need to support civil society organisations everywhere, so they can fulfil their vital role and defend our fundamental rights.\u201d FRA\u2019s report \u2018Protecting civic space in the EU\u2019 sheds light on the challenges civil society faces across the EU. An online consultation with over 400 human rights civil society organisations carried out for the report reveals: Worse conditions \u2013 over half of civil society organisations (57%) say that the conditions for their work deteriorated in 2020; Threats and attacks \u2013 40% received verbal threats online, one third (33%) reported smear campaigns against their organisation and 10% experienced legal harassment; Limited freedom \u2013 many report difficulties in exercising their rights to freedom of assembly (29%), to freedom of expression (25%) and to freedom of association (18%); Lack of funding \u2013 over half (60%) have difficulties in finding funding for their work; Limited involvement \u2013 almost half (46%) lack adequate information about getting involved in decision making and public consultations. But the report also highlights positive developments and promising practices. These include authorities publicly acknowledging the importance of civil society work, fully involving civil society in policy development or reducing bureaucracy for NGO registration. Building on these positive examples, FRA encourages the EU and EU countries to: Monitor developments \u2013 keep track of civil society challenges and find ways to respond rapidly to counter restrictions; Safeguard rights \u2013 ensure the EU and national laws strengthen the right to freedom of expression, assembly and association; Provide funding \u2013 address civil society needs in EU funding and remove funding obstacles; Encourage dialogue \u2013 support an open, transparent and regular dialogue between policymakers and civil society at the EU, national and local levels; Protect civil society \u2013 ensure effective protection against attacks and administrative harassment. This report is based on evidence collected by the Agency\u2019s research network in 2020, two online consultations with civil society organisations and desk research. It builds on FRA\u2019s 2018 report on civil society challenges.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For more contact: media@fra.europa.eu / Tel.: +43 1 580 30 653 Selected quotes from respondents to FRA\u2019s 2020 consultation: \u201cCivil society is more essential than ever (\u2026) yet we are under pressure from all sides (\u2026) It is unsustainable and creating unprecedented situations of burnout for people who work tirelessly for social change, not for profit.\u201d \u201cWe have not faced challenges in court - but had to ask ourselves how to speak about and address COVID emergency laws (\u2026) without fear of negative consequences on our experts.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWe have reported several incidences of hate speech and death threats to the police.

It is time to rebuild trust among all communities and ensure police stops are always fair, justified and proportionate.\u201d The \u2018Your rights matter: police stops\u2019 paper compares people\u2019s experiences with police stops in Europe. The paper draws on findings from FRA surveys and for the first time shows differences between the general population and ethnic minorities across EU Member States. Overall, the police most often stop men, young people, ethnic minorities, Muslims or people who do not identify as heterosexual. In some countries, police stopped almost 50% of people from certain minorities, shows the EU Minorities and Discrimination Survey. The police searched or asked 34% of ethnic minorities for their identity papers compared to 14% of people generally. The context for a police stop can affect the way people experience them. Most people are stopped while driving, but most minorities are stopped while on foot. Moreover, in some countries, over 80% of ethnic minorities perceived the most recent police stop as ethnic profiling. Perceptions of profiling may be less common when people are stopped while driving because this is more likely to involve random checks unrelated to the personal characteristics of the person being stopped. Those who experience ethnic profiling also show lower trust in public authorities than those who do not. When it comes to treatment during police stops, 80% of people generally say that the police treated them respectfully. By contrast, 46% of minorities say so. Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden show the biggest differences in how people and ethnic minorities perceive the police stop. \u00a0 FRA renews its call on EU countries to fight discrimination and end unlawful ethnic profiling. To support police officers in avoiding this practice, FRA published a\u00a0Guide on how to avoid unlawful profiling. The guide includes practical information the police can use in their everyday work. Background information: The paper is one of a series of thematic \u2018Your rights matter\u2019 publications looking at people\u2019s views and experiences of fundamental rights. It draws on findings from FRA\u2019s Fundamental Rights Survey (2020), EU Minorities and Discrimination Survey (2017) and its Roma and Travellers Survey (2020). In this series, FRA has already published reports on \u2018What do fundamental rights mean for people in the EU?\u2019 and \u2018Crime, safety and victims\u2019 rights\u2019 and two papers on \u2018Data protection and privacy\u2019 and \u2018Security concerns and experiences\u2019.

Irregular migrants are no exception,\u201d says FRA Director Michael O\u2019Flaherty. \u201cEU rules protect the rights of workers to get justice. EU countries need to step up their efforts to protect irregular migrants from labour exploitation, compensate victims and ensure employers pay all due wages, especially now during the pandemic.\u201d FRA\u2019s latest report looks at how the Employers Sanctions Directive protects irregular migrants from exploitation. It focuses on how EU countries use the directive to enable exploited workers get justice. It identifies implementation gaps and suggests EU countries: Improve complaint systems: Exploited workers rarely use existing complaint systems. This is often out of fear of being detected, detained, and returned. Lack of information on their rights as workers and available complaint systems is another factor. Third parties, such as trade unions and non-governmental organisations\u00a0(NGOs) can help. EU countries should enable these parties to support irregular migrant workers to claim their rights. No country centralises data on filed and successful complaints from irregular migrant workers about back payments of due wages. To assess the effectiveness of the complaint system, countries should collect relevant data. This includes complaints about back pay, awards, and the compensation irregular migrant workers received. Change laws and practices: Workplace inspections can play a key role in preventing and identifying labour exploitation. But labour inspectorates share irregular migrants\u2019 personal data with police or immigration authorities in 20 out of 25 EU countries. This discourages workers from reporting abuse during inspections. Ending this requirement and focusing labour inspectorates on protecting workers and not enforcing immigration law will encourage victims of rights violations to come forward. Compensate exploited workers: Even when workers seek compensation from employers, practical difficulties exist. These range from the time and effort needed to take employers to court, and to receive compensation. Employers may declare themselves bankrupt. State compensation funds, when available, may not cover irregular migrant workers. To ensure victims of severe labour exploitation receive all back pay, criminal courts should also decide on civil law claims. EU countries should guarantee that all irregular migrant workers recover outstanding wages. This could be through access to state compensation or freezing and confiscating employers\u2019 assets. Issue temporary residence permits to victims of severe labour exploitation: Countries vary in how they support victims of severe exploitation. Some offer temporary residence permits, others only do this for trafficked victims. One third of EU countries did not issue residence permits to victims of severe labour exploitation in the last years. Countries should make greater use of such permits. The EU Employers Sanctions Directive aims to stop employers from recruiting irregular migrants. It also protects irregular workers by ensuring that they get any outstanding pay from their employers, by facilitating complaints and by emphasising the right not to be subjected to particularly exploitative working conditions. The directive came into force in 2009. It applies to all EU countries, except Denmark and Ireland. The research drew on legal analysis, and information from national authorities, courts and irregular migrant and victims\u2019 support organisations.

But too many hate crime victims do not report being attacked and too many countries do not record hate crimes properly,\u201d says FRA Director Michael O\u2019Flaherty. \u201cThis needs to change. Countries should simplify reporting and improve hate crime recording, investigation and punishment to fully uphold victims\u2019 rights.\u201d FRA\u2019s latest report \u2018Encouraging hate crime reporting: the role of law enforcement and other authorities\u2019 highlights the gaps in hate crime reporting across the EU. FRA calls on EU countries to remove barriers that prevent victims and witnesses of hate crimes from coming forward and to encourage reporting. The report highlights what needs to change to move towards a victim-centred approach so victims can get justice: End discrimination and empower victims \u2013 EU countries need to empower victims and witnesses to come forward and report hate crimes. They need to tackle structural discrimination and prejudice in society, eliminate discriminatory policing, publicly condemn hate crime and raise victims\u2019 awareness of their rights and support available. Improve reporting, recording and referrals \u2013 EU countries need to make hate crime reporting easier, for example by enabling third-party or anonymous reporting. This needs to be coupled with improvements to national recording and data collection systems. Standardised referrals to and from support services would also better protect and support victims. Build capacity to tackle hate crime \u2013 EU countries should provide practical guidance and training to the police, establish specialised hate crime units and ensure structured cooperation between law enforcement authorities, victim support organisations, civil society organisations and equality bodies. Millions of people across the EU experience hate-motivated violence and harassment. This can be due to their ethnic or immigration background, skin colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation or disability. FRA\u2019s surveys of immigrants and ethnic minorities, Jews, LGBTI people or Roma and Travellers shed light on the extent of discrimination and violence these groups face in Europe. FRA\u2019s recent Fundamental Rights Survey highlights that some minority groups experience twice as much violence as people generally. Up to 9 in 10 people do not report being attacked. Most think that nothing would change if they report it, it is too difficult to report or they do not trust the police. The new EU Anti-racism Action Plan 2020-2025 and the EU Strategy on victims\u2019 rights 2020-2025 both stress the need to improve hate crime reporting and recording. The recent key guiding principles on encouraging hate crime reporting and this report should help countries put an effective victim-centred approach to reporting hate crimes into place. FRA\u2019s new project will look into understanding online hatred towards certain groups. Results are due in 2023.

Only a rights-based approach allows governments to build inclusive societies.\u201d FRA\u2019s Fundamental Rights Report 2021 reflects on the developments and shortfalls of human rights protection in the EU over the past year. Its Coronavirus focus chapter reviews the pandemic\u2019s fundamental rights impact on people\u2019s daily lives, particularly on vulnerable groups such as older people, people with disabilities, Roma and migrants. Moving forward, governments should consult with national human rights bodies to assess how their public health actions affect fundamental rights. They should also: boost the resilience of educational, healthcare and social support services to meet everyone\u2019s needs; adopt digital solutions, bridge the digital divide and tackle disinformation; pay attention to high-risk groups like those in care, detained or homeless; ensure fair and equal access to vaccines. Other key issues in 2020 include: Racism \u2013 the pandemic fuelled discrimination, hate crime and hate speech towards minorities, particularly people with immigrant backgrounds and Roma. At the same time, the Black Lives Matter movement and the first-ever EU Anti-racism action plan mobilised efforts to tackle racism in Europe. EU countries should step up efforts to counter racism through national action plans, penalise hate crime, support victims and tackle discriminatory ethnic profiling in policing. Migration \u2013 respecting fundamental rights at borders remained challenging in the EU. Migrants died at sea, faced violence and pushbacks at land borders, and overcrowding at reception centres. In line with the proposed EU Migration and Asylum Pact, EU countries should carry out effective and independent monitoring to counter rights abuses at borders. They should also provide adequate facilities at reception centres. Child rights \u2013 many children suffered during the pandemic, particularly those from economically or socially disadvantaged backgrounds. Remote education was difficult without internet access or computers. Child abuse also rose during lockdown and quarantine. The EU should support initiatives under the future European Child Guarantee targeting areas and groups most affected by the pandemic. EU countries should ensure all children have equal access to education and are protected from abuse. The report summarises and analyses major human rights developments in the EU in 2020. It contains proposals for action covering the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and its use by Member States; equality and non-discrimination; racism and related intolerance; Roma inclusion and equality; asylum, borders and migration; information society, privacy and data protection; child rights; access to justice; and implementing the UN Convention on the rights of persons with disabilities\u00a0(CRPD).

FRA identifies problems in safeguarding these rights and calls on EU countries to: Treat all defendants equally \u2013 ensure that the presumption of innocence applies to all defendants. It should apply regardless of their ethnic background, status or gender. Clear rules and training are needed to prevent bias and prejudice among police officers, jurors and judges. Countries should encourage diversity among justice professionals. Use restraints only when needed \u2013 do not publicly present defendants under restraint, such as handcuffs or glass boxes in court, unless justified. Media should be able to photograph unrestrained defendants. Balance powers \u2013 prosecuting authorities often have wider powers to search for evidence than the defence. The defence should thus be able to request authorities to investigate specific circumstances and search for crucial evidence on its behalf. Inform suspects about their rights \u2013 ensure that police officers inform suspects about their right to remain silent and to not incriminate themselves before questioning. Any testimonies collected outside of this should not be treated as evidence. Respect the right to be present at trial \u2013 make more effort to ensure that defendants can be present at their trial. The report looks at practices in nine EU Member States with different legal traditions: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, Poland and Portugal. The findings are based on interviews with 123 defence lawyers, judges, prosecutors, police officers and journalists in those countries.

National governments need to do more to grant victims their rights and provide the support they need.\u201d Victims are often unaware of their rights or left voiceless. They do not report crimes because of fear of retaliation or intimidation from offenders. \u00a0 FRA\u2019s report \u2018Crime, safety and victims\u2019 rights\u2019 should guide national policymakers as they deliver on their international commitments and the EU\u2019s victims\u2019 rights laws. It complements the EU Strategy on victims\u2019 rights which aims to empower victims of crime to report it more frequently. It calls for Member States to: Ensure access to justice: Nearly one in 10\u00a0people in the EU (9\u00a0%) experienced violence within five years of the survey, ranging from 3\u00a0% to 18\u00a0% depending on the country. For harassment, it is 41\u00a0% in the EU \u2013 ranging from 15\u00a0% to 62\u00a0% nationally. Countries should provide all victims, including the most vulnerable, with appropriate information, support and protection, and enable their participation in criminal proceedings. This also applies to online settings. Offer targeted support: Close to a quarter of young people (23\u00a0% of 16-29 year-olds) and a fifth of people who identify as LGBTI (19\u00a0%), have a disability (17\u00a0%) or are from an ethnic minority (22\u00a0%) report that they were victims of physical attacks in the last five years. Countries should pay particular attention to the specific needs of various groups to better protect them from violence. They should also inform them about their rights in ways that they understand. Support women better: Over a third of physical violence against women (37\u00a0%) takes place at home, with psychological after effects for 69\u00a0% of the victims. Close to three in four sexual harassment incidents (72\u00a0%) against women are perpetrated by someone they do not know. Most of these incidents happen in public. Countries should ensure a gender-sensitive approach when it comes to legal sanctions, education and training, protection and support for victims\u2019 rights. This includes crime prevention through educating men, who are mostly the perpetrators. Facilitate crime reporting: Only a third (30\u00a0%) of victims report their physical attack and a tenth (11\u00a0%) their incident of harassment to the police. Reporting levels differ across countries, reflecting cultural differences and varying levels of trust. People who are older, have lower education levels, or struggle to make ends meet are generally less willing to engage law enforcement. Countries need to do more to encourage and make it easier for people to report crimes. This includes using other avenues, like civil society or healthcare services to capture incidents of crime, to inform victims about their rights and refer them to relevant support services. The report captures the views of 35,000 people and their experiences of violence, harassment, burglary and consumer fraud, and the impact on victims. The results also examine people\u2019s views on safety and their willingness to act when witnessing a crime. It is one of a series of reports looking at people\u2019s views and experiences of fundamental rights. The findings draw on responses to FRA\u2019s Fundamental Rights Survey from across all EU Member States, North Macedonia and the United Kingdom. It ran from January to October 2019. Ipsos MORI collected the data on behalf of FRA, in cooperation with Statistics Netherlands (CBS) in the Netherlands, the Centre des Technologies de l'Information de l'Etat (CTIE) in Luxembourg and Statistics Austria in Austria.

That is why people need to be aware when AI is used, how it works and how to challenge automated decisions. The EU needs to clarify how existing rules apply to AI. And organisations need to assess how their technologies can interfere with people's rights both in the development and use of AI,\u201d says FRA Director Michael O\u2019Flaherty. \u201cWe have an opportunity to shape AI that not only respects our human and fundamental rights but that also protects and promotes them.\u201d The FRA report \u2018Getting the future right \u2013 Artificial intelligence and fundamental rights in the EU\u2019 identifies pitfalls in the use of AI, for example in predictive policing, medical diagnoses, social services, and targeted advertising. It calls on the EU and EU countries to: Make sure that AI respects ALL fundamental rights - AI can affect many rights - not just privacy or data protection. It can also discriminate or impede justice. Any future AI legislation has to consider this and create effective safeguards. Guarantee that people can challenge decisions taken by AI - people need to know when AI is used and how it is used, as well as how and where to complain. Organisations using AI need to be able to explain how their systems take decisions. Assess AI before and during its use to reduce negative impacts - private and public organisations should carry out assessments of how AI could harm fundamental rights. Provide more guidance on data protection rules - the EU should further clarify how data protection rules apply to AI. More clarity is also needed on the implications of automated decision-making and the right to human review when AI is used. Assess whether AI discriminates \u2013 awareness about the potential for AI to discriminate, and the impact of this, is relatively low. This calls for more research funding to look into the potentially discriminatory effects of AI so Europe can guard against it. Create an effective oversight system \u2013 the EU should invest in a more \u2018joined-up\u2019 system to hold businesses and public administrations accountable when using AI. Authorities need to ensure that oversight bodies have adequate resources and skills to do the job. The report is part of FRA\u2019s project on artificial intelligence and big data.

But too often, they cannot deliver on their true potential,\u201d says FRA Director Michael O\u2019Flaherty. \u201cGovernments and Parliaments should free NHRIs from unnecessary constraints and grant them the power and resources they need to do their job properly. As the Coronavirus pandemic affected or limited many rights, it is especially important that we have strong and independent NHRIs to champion people\u2019s fundamental rights during and after COVID-19.\u201d NHRIs are independent organisations set up by states to promote and protect human rights within their countries in line with the United Nations (UN) guiding \u201cParis principles\u201d and Goal 16 of the Sustainable Development Goals. This new FRA report on Strong and effective NHRIs: challenges, promising practices and opportunities reviews their situation across the EU, North Macedonia, Serbia and the United Kingdom. It identifies various ways how NHRIs could further promote and protect fundamental rights: Sufficient powers: NHRIs often have wide mandates. They cover many areas of EU law where the EU\u2019s bill of rights, the Fundamental Rights Charter, applies. This includes monitoring fundamental rights, handling complaints, investigating rights violations, advising policy makers, as well as liaising with other rights bodies nationally and internationally. To boost their impact, Member States, both governments and Parliaments, should formally consult NHRIs, follow up on their recommendations and answer their specific queries. Enhanced role at EU level: The EU is steadily hardwiring fundamental rights into EU law and funding and could draw further on NHRIs when monitoring the implementation of fundamental rights commitments under EU law, including the EU\u2019s legally binding Fundamental Rights Charter. It could also regularly engage with them on fundamental rights issues, such as the rule of law or use of the Charter. Compliance with the UN Paris Principles: Sixteen NHRIs in the EU are now fully compliant with the UN\u2019s guiding principles, up from nine since FRA published its first NHRI overview in 2010. Six other countries have non-compliant NHRIs and the remaining five are creating NHRIs, seeking accreditation and compliance. A European network (ENNHRI) now also supports, strengthens and connects NHRIs. All Member States should draw on such support and ensure their NHRIs are fully compliant with the UN\u2019s principles. Protection and independence: Almost half of the NHRI leaders have legal protection against criminal and civil liability. Thirteen NHRIs reported that their staff faced threats and harassment at work. Member States need to protect NHRIs, their members and staff, including by law, and safeguard NHRIs\u2019 full independence to work. Diversity: Engaging with a wide cross section of society can help raise rights awareness and make NHRIs more effective. This also includes building closer ties with civil society as well as regions and cities. Adequate resources: Many NHRIs continue to lack staff considering their multiple mandates. Member States should therefore equip NHRIs with the necessary financial and human resources to carry out their mandates effectively.

It highlights widespread inequalities that perpetuate cycles of poverty and exclusion: Living conditions: Over 90% of Travellers in Belgium, Ireland and the Netherlands say that there are not enough places for them to live. Every fourth Roma and Traveller child surveyed lives in a household that cannot afford basic items, such as healthy food or heating, or has trouble paying the rent. Many face hunger. And their life expectancy is 10 years lower than among the general population. Work: Fewer Roma and Travellers are in paid work compared to the general population. This ranges from 15% in Ireland to 50% in Belgium. For women and the young, the employment situation is particularly hard. Schooling: Almost a third of parents said that their children have been verbally harassed at school because they are Roma or Travellers. Two thirds of young Roma and Travellers completed only lower secondary education. The EU will soon release its new EU Roma Strategic Framework for Equality, Inclusion and Participation. Moving forward, FRA calls on the EU and its Member States to work with the Roma and Traveller communities to design policies and set clear targets to: Improve life quality: Member States should allow Travellers to follow their lifestyles, providing sufficient halting sites that offer decent accommodation. They should avoid forced evictions, especially as it affects children, and offer alternative housing for evicted people. They should also offer social protection to improve healthcare, reduce poverty, and eliminate hunger, especially among Roma and Traveller children. Enhance employment opportunities: Member States should find ways to enable women and the young to find jobs through work experience, public sector job schemes and better access to bank accounts, for example. Boost educational prospects: Member States need to tailor education to Roma and Travellers needs through, for example, assigning special teaching assistants, home schooling and distance learning, and create incentives so they reach a higher level at school. Curricula and teacher training should also counter negative Roma stereotypes within schools. The survey involved face-to-face interviews from December 2018 until July 2019 with over 4,500\u00a0Roma or Travellers. It complements earlier FRA research in nine other EU countries.

The findings of FRA\u2019s 2018 report \u201cBeing Black in the EU\u201d shed light on the widespread discrimination black people face in the EU. It showed that many black people in Europe experience racist harassment and violence, including at the hands of the police: racial harassment \u2013 30% of respondents say they have been racially harassed and 5% were attacked in the five years before the survey; discriminatory profiling in police stops \u2013\u00a024% of respondents were stopped by the police in the five years before the survey. Among those, 41% felt the stop constituted racial profiling. gender aspect \u2013 men are three times more likely to be stopped than women (22\u00a0% vs 7\u00a0%), and they are more likely to consider the most recent stop as racial profiling compared to women. underreporting \u2013 only 14 % of the most recent incidents of racist harassment were reported to police or other services. not reporting attacks by police \u2013 a majority (63 %) of victims of racist physical attack by a police officer did not report the incident to anybody, either because they felt it would not change anything or because they do not trust the police. FRA renews its call on Member States to fight discriminatory ethnic profiling, better support victims of racism and properly prosecute perpetrators. To support Member States in this, FRA published a Guide on how to avoid unlawful profiling to help raise awareness and support police officers in avoiding this practice. FRA stands ready to further support EU Member States with its data and expertise. Background information: The \u201cBeing black in the EU\u201d report drew on experiences of nearly 6,000 black people in 12\u00a0EU Member States.

This includes maintaining privacy and data protection legal safeguards.\u201d This second Coronavirus pandemic in the EU: fundamental rights implications report looks at the measures EU\u00a0Member States use to address the pandemic to highlight rights-respectful approaches that other Member States can learn from. It underlines the need to carefully and regularly assess the impact on people\u2019s fundamental rights as governments manage the pandemic: Users\u2019 data, their privacy, data protection and other rights: Many countries allow health and police authorities to access traffic and location data from telecommunication providers to track individuals, such as those under quarantine. Governments are also rolling out the development of contact-tracing apps to curb the spread of the virus. Many consulted with data protection authorities and/or experts to ensure compliance with EU data protection rules. Governments should ensure they implement all fundamental rights\u2019 legal safeguards when protecting health, including free and informed consent, and not extending the use of the personal data collected. Efforts to make the apps source code public should continue to enhance transparency and confidence in using such tools. States of emergency: Many governments introduced or prolonged states of emergency or equivalent to manage the pandemic. Governments should carefully assess the fundamental rights impact of emergency measures when limiting and enforcing freedom of movement and assembly. Daily life: All EU governments maintained physical and social distancing measures. This had a wide-ranging impact on fundamental rights, such as the rights to freedom of movement and of assembly. Public health controls at the border also led some countries to suspend asylum procedures. Rights relating to work, education and access to justice were also affected. As almost all education facilities remained closed in April, some switched to distance learning. Governments should find ways to offset existing inequalities for those children that have remote access difficulties. These include migrant or minority children, children from poorer families, and children with disabilities.\u00a0 Vulnerable groups: some people are more at risk than others because of the difficulty of physical distancing in residential care homes and prisons or overcrowded homeless shelters. Stay at home measures also disproportionately affect some groups like Roma whose livelihood often depends on working outdoors in markets, for example. Governments should continue to provide solutions to address the specific needs of these groups including maintaining social contact and support. This is the second in a series of reports on the impact of the Coronavirus across the 27\u00a0EU\u00a0Member States. It covers measures in place from 21 March until 30 April 2020. It also includes findings from FRA\u2019s Fundamental Rights Survey on people\u2019s awareness of privacy settings on their mobile phones.

Persistent inequalities, harassment and prejudices are likely to worsen,\u201d says FRA Director Michael O\u2019Flaherty. \u201cGovernments need to ensure planning for the \u2018new normal\u2019 to lead to a fair and just society that honours the dignity of everyone and ensures that no one is left behind.\u201d FRA\u2019s Fundamental Rights Report 2020 reflects on the developments and shortfalls of human rights protection in the EU over the past year. Its focus section highlights how the EU\u2019s Fundamental Rights Charter has gained visibility and sparked a new fundamental rights culture at EU level. But nationally, awareness and use of the Charter remain limited despite it being legally binding for 10 years. The insights presented will hopefully encourage others, including governments, to take ownership of this great instrument \u2013 and give it full force so that it can truly help transform people\u2019s lives. Other key issues identified include: Respecting fundamental rights at borders remained one of the top human rights challenges in the EU. Migrants died at sea, and faced violence and pushbacks at land borders. Some Member States threatened humanitarian rescue boats. In others, migrants continued to experience overcrowding and homelessness. Child detention also increased, including unaccompanied children who were without guardians to aid them. Member States urgently need to stop such fundamental rights abuses, and develop effective measures to protect the rights of children, particularly unaccompanied children. Child poverty rates in the EU improved slightly. But 1 in 4 children remain at risk of poverty. This means that children still go to bed hungry and live in poor conditions with their health and education suffering. Children with foreign parents fare worse with 4 in 10 at risk. For children in single-parent households, it is 1 in 3. The EU should adopt its Child Guarantee initiative with clear targets and sufficient funding to reduce child poverty. Governments and companies are rushing to embrace the potential benefits of Artificial Intelligence. Ethics and fundamental rights considerations are beginning to take shape as the European Commission and Council of Europe formulate guidelines and laws. The EU and its Member States should ensure future regulations incorporate thorough and transparent fundamental rights impact assessments of the use of AI, coupled with independent supervisory bodies. The report summarises and analyses major human rights developments in the EU over 2019. It contains proposals for action covering the EU\u2019s Fundamental Rights Charter and its use by Member States; equality and non-discrimination; racism and related intolerance; Roma inclusion; asylum, borders and migration; information society, privacy and data protection; child rights; access to justice; and implementing the UN\u2019s disability convention.

Even though some countries have advanced LGBTI equality, our survey findings show that overall there has been too little real progress, leaving many LGBTI people vulnerable. Their job and healthcare difficulties may worsen due to COVID-19. Policymakers should take note and do more to actively promote full respect for rights of LGBTI people,\u201d says FRA Director Michael O\u2019Flaherty. European Commissioner for Equality, Helena Dalli added: \u201cDespite the important steps forward regarding the equality of LGBTI+ people in the EU in the last years, LGBTI+ people still report high levels of discrimination. More worryingly, we have recently witnessed within the EU anti-LGBTI incidents such as attacks on prides, the adoption of \u2018LGBTI ideology-free zone\u2019 declarations, fines for LGBTI-friendly advertisements and others. Everybody in the European Union should feel safe and free to be themselves.\u201d The \u2018A long way to go for LGBTI equality\u2019 report looks at how around 140,000 LGBTI people in the European Union, the United Kingdom, Serbia and North Macedonia experience their human rights. It also underlines changes since FRA\u2019s first LGBT survey carried out in 2012. Comparing the two surveys reveals little overall progress over the seven years. The EU averages mask important differences between countries. In some, over 70% LGBTI respondent say society is more tolerant, while in others, up to 68% say it is less. Key survey findings include: Openness: 6 in 10 avoid holding hands in public with their partners. Harassment: 2 in 5 respondents say they were harassed the year before the survey. Attacks: 1 in 5 trans and intersex people were physically or sexually attacked, double that of other LGBTI groups. Discrimination: 1 in 5 feel discriminated against at work and over 1 in 3 feel discriminated against when going out to eat, drink or being social. Schooling: 1 in 2 LGBTI students say someone among their peers or teachers supported LGBTI people. Economic situation: 1 in 3 LGBTI people say they have difficulties to make ends meet. The situation is worse for intersex and trans people (about 1 in 2). This evidence will support the European Commission\u2019s LGBTI Equality Strategy due this year. FRA calls on the EU and its Member States to put in place measures protecting the rights of LGBTI people, including: Hate crime \u2013 build a culture of zero tolerance towards violence and harassment of the LGBTI community so that LGBTI people can enjoy their right to move freely and without fear. Invest in training to ensure that police can recognise, record and properly investigate hate crimes against LGBTI people so that victims feel safe to report attacks and are treated equally. Reporting \u2013 make it easier for victims to report crimes and discrimination through online reporting tools, community liaison and police training. Adequately resource equality bodies so they can effectively support victims of discrimination. Discrimination - adopt the Equal Treatment Directive to extend protection against discrimination beyond employment. Realise comprehensive national actions plans to promote respect for rights of LGBTI people across all areas of life. Schooling - create safe and supportive environment for young LGBTI people at school. Help schools and teachers to share experiences, counter bullying of LGBTI students and ensure educational materials do not equate being LGBTI with having a disease. Lead by example - everyone can play their part so that equality becomes a reality. This survey covers the EU 27 Member States, the UK, Serbia and North Macedonia. For the first time, it includes experiences of intersex people and young LGBTI people aged 15 to 17. Together with the main survey results, FRA publishes an extensive online data explorer, which allows to filter data by country, by survey question and by L, G, B, T or I group.

Human rights are for everyone and nobody should feel left behind,\u201d says FRA Director Michael O\u2019Flaherty. \u201cThe number of people who feel disenchanted by corruption and how our democratic society works should prompt EU\u00a0countries to take action. We all have a duty to ensure that human rights bring tangible benefits to each and everyone of us, no matter who you are.\u201d The \u2018What do fundamental rights mean for people in the EU?\u2019 report reveals that 88% of people in the EU believe that human rights help create fairer societies. Yet there is little reason for complacency. The survey findings also raise important issues that need addressing. These include: Benefits: 44% of people who struggle financially believe human rights only benefit those who do not deserve them, such as criminals and terrorists. The results reveal how financial constraints and lower levels of education diminish people\u2019s confidence in equality and human rights. This should prompt governments and human rights bodies to make wide-ranging efforts to ensure that fundamental rights deliver real benefits for everyone. Trust and engagement in politics: The majority of Europeans (60%) think that mainstream parties and politicians do not care about them. This rises to a staggering 73% for people who face difficulties to make ends meet. By comparison, only 45% of those who easily make ends meet share this view. The EU and Member States need to find new ways to reach out to those who feel \u2018left behind\u2019, including also particularly young people, to involve them in decision-making and consider their needs. Judicial independence: 27% of respondents believe that judges are not free from government influence. Governments should improve public trust in the judiciary by safeguarding the independence of judges. As there are large national differences, countries can learn from each other to improve the situation Corruption: Over 60% in some countries consider it common for people to offer favours to speed up access to healthcare. Governments should adopt zero tolerance towards corruption as it erodes public confidence. This also involves open channels to freely report corruption and withholding EU funds where corruption is suspected. The findings draw on responses to FRA\u2019s Fundamental Rights Survey from 35,000 people across all EU Member States, North Macedonia and the United Kingdom. The survey ran from January to October 2019. FRA will present the report at the \u2018Human rights in the new normal\u2019 online conference on 24 and 25 June. It is one of a series of thematic reports looking at people\u2019s views and experiences of fundamental rights.

These strategies must also ensure that any limitations to people\u2019s fundamental rights should only last as long as necessary and that they protect already vulnerable people who may face even greater risks from COVID-19.\u201d The FRA report 'Coronavirus pandemic in the EU: Fundamental Rights Implications' looks at the measures EU\u00a0Member States use to address the pandemic to highlight rights-respectful approaches that other Member States can learn from. It focuses on four issues underlining the need to carefully and regularly assess the impact on people\u2019s fundamental rights as governments react to the ever-developing pandemic: Daily life: Government responses have had a wide-ranging impact on fundamental rights, such as the rights to freedom of movement and of assembly, as well as rights relating to work, health and education. Social and physical distancing measures \u2013 While countries ordered at different times and with varying intensity such measures, they should not lead to social isolation. Vulnerable groups: some people are more vulnerable than others, for example the elderly and children, people with pre-existing medical conditions, Roma, refugees, homeless people, prisoners, people in institutions. Greater protection \u2013 EU countries should protect but not isolate people in institutional settings, such as nursing homes, prisons or refugee centres. They should develop targeted measures to address the specific needs of other vulnerable groups such as shelters for victims of domestic violence and accessible healthcare information to those who regular messaging may not reach. Racism: The COVID-19 pandemic triggered an increase in racist and xenophobic attacks particularly against people of perceived Asian background. Reporting \u2013 EU countries should closely monitor racist and xenophobic incidents and effectively report, investigate and prosecute such crimes. Disinformation and data protection: Almost all EU\u00a0countries face disinformation on the pandemic. Many collect data to help curb the spread of the virus. Ensure data protection - EU countries should stay vigilant and ensure they implement all data protection safeguards when protecting health. This is the first in a series of three monthly reports on the impact of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) across the 27\u00a0EU\u00a0Member States.

EU Member States need to ensure respectful detention conditions to improve the chances of prisoners\u2019 rehabilitation.\u201d The \u2018Criminal detention conditions in the European Union: rules and reality\u2019 report outlines selected minimum standards at international and European levels, and how they translate into national laws. It also shows how these rules apply in practice focusing on: Cell size: Overcrowding often leads to prisoners having less than 3m2 per prisoner, violating the recommended minimum of 4m2. Time outside: Member States do not always regulate how long prisoners can spend outside their cell. Sometimes prisoners spend one hour per day outside their cell, which especially is insufficient in overcrowded prisons. Sanitation: Dirty prisons with limited access to bathrooms breach international and national laws, even though conditions are slowly improving. Healthcare: Although prisoners should benefit from the same level of healthcare as the public, staff shortages often lead to delays. They also lack privacy during their examinations. Violence: Fights, sexual violence and bullying among prisoners is common in many Member States, despite the States\u2019 obligation to protect inmates under their custody. The findings will guide judges and other legal practitioners to assess whether prisoners are at risk of inhuman and degrading treatment, in violation of their fundamental rights. This is especially useful when deciding on cross-border cases, such as when Member States issue a European Arrest Warrant. FRA\u2019s new online criminal detention database complements the report. It contains national standards, laws and monitoring reports on detention conditions from across the EU. FRA used reports from national monitoring bodies and interviews from previous research to illustrate how detention conditions vary across the Member States. The European Commission asked FRA to compile information on prison conditions and monitoring across all EU Member States to assist judicial authorities when deciding on transferring detainees to another EU Member State For more information, contact: media@fra.europa.eu / Tel.: +43 1 580 30 642", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2019/criminal-detention-are-rights-respected-0"}, {"id": "FRA_PR_0018", "date": "2019-11-11", "text_type": "PR", "title": "EU Charter of Fundamental Rights marks its 10th anniversary", "text": "The Charter upholds and protects core European values, which are reflected across all the EU\u2019s legal and policy initiatives, such as the General Data Protection Regulation and the new rules to protect victims of crime and whistleblowers.

But as FRA\u2019s findings repeatedly show, we still have a long way to go. We have a duty to bring the rights enshrined in the Charter to life, to make them a reality for everyone \u2013 for the public at large, for Roma and Jewish communities, for newly-arrived migrants and for LGBTI people.\u201d Member States authorities, judges, policy makers, law enforcement bodies, legal practitioners and representatives of National Human Rights Institutions, Equality bodies, ombuds-institutions and civil society organisations will all attend tomorrow\u2019s conference \u00a0to share their views. Moreover, the outcome of tomorrow\u2019s conference will feed into a new Strategy on the Charter, which the Commission is expecting to publish in 2020. Background Earlier this year, the Commission published a report on how the EU institutions and Member States have been applying the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The report showed that European policy makers are increasingly aware of the importance of ensuring that initiatives are compliant with the Charter. The Charter is however still not used to its full potential and awareness remains low. Along with this year\u2019s report, the Commission published a Eurobarometer survey, which showed that only 4 in 10 respondents have heard of the Charter and only 1 in 10 knows what it is. 6 in 10 would like to have more information. The FRA\u2019s 2019 Fundamental Rights Report shows that Member States continue to lack national policies promoting awareness and implementation of the Charter. FRA\u2019s findings highlight that civil society organisations and National Human Rights Institutions play a key role in ensuring that the Charter is a reality in people\u2019s lives. But they also show these organisations are not sufficiently aware of the Charter and when it applies. Since then entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty on 1 December 2009, the European Commission has published an annual report on the application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The annual reports monitor progress in the areas where the EU has powers to act, showing how the Charter has been taken into account in actual cases, notably when new EU legislation is proposed. It addresses the role that EU institutions and Member States authorities play in making fundamental rights a reality in peoples' lives. The Commission works with authorities at national, local and EU level to better inform people about their fundamental rights and where to find help if their rights have been infringed. Practical information is available on the e-Justice portal.

Some of the key findings include: The police inform defendants of their rights but practices vary. These range from written to oral information, including leaflets, which may be difficult to understand. Member States should ensure defendants properly understand what their rights are, and provide information in writing and orally as soon as they are a suspect. They should also pay attention to people who may have difficulties due to language or a disability, for example. Very often defendants receive minimal or unclear information about the charges against them. This makes it difficult for them to defend themselves. The police should properly, clearly, and fully inform suspects of their crimes and why they were arrested, as soon as possible. Receiving legal assistance promptly and directly does not also always occur, particularly for people that have been locked up. Member States should ensure all defendants receive prompt, direct and confidential access to a lawyer before they question jailed defendants. Sometimes the police treat suspects as witnesses or informally question them. However, this deprives suspects of their right to remain silent and not to incriminate themselves. Member States should treat all suspects as suspects to respect their rights. The report also looks at European Arrest Warrants that come from another EU Member State. As well as the issues above, defendants also face rights issues arising from having two countries involved. Linguistic differences often make it difficult for defendants to understand their rights when it comes to warrants and their right to consent to be transferred abroad for questioning. Member States should provide translation and interpretation services so that defendants can fully understand the charges against them and what the European Arrest Warrant entails. Defendants often have difficulties getting legal representation in both countries. This can be due to linguistic differences, as well as the police\u2019s lack of knowledge about other countries\u2019 legal systems and unwillingness to interfere in another country\u2019s jurisdiction. Authorities in the country that process the warrant should help defendants get legal assistance in the country that issued the warrant. Member States could provide legal association lists when issuing the warrant. FRA interviewed over 250 defendants and justice professionals in Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Greece, the Netherlands, Poland and Romania. Quotes from respondents are throughout the report. The European Commission asked FRA for this work. It complements their report, also issued today, on how EU Member States have implemented the EU\u2019s Access to a Lawyer Directive.

But these challenges are not insurmountable,\u201d says FRA Director Michael O\u2019Flaherty. \u201cDiverse examples highlight how smart and thoughtful policy decisions can go a long way towards overcoming obstacles. Policymakers at both national and EU level need to embrace such strategies to allow this generation become full members of our society.\u201d Based on interviews with over 160 refugees and 400 frontline workers, FRA\u2019s \u2018Integration of young refugees in the EU\u2019 report identifies serious obstacles in existing migrant integration approaches for young people aged between 16 and 24. It also highlights good, local policy initiatives from each country. Examples include: financial support for individual housing of asylum applicants who are part of the reception system, in Vienna, Austria; fast-track integration support to enter the labour market in Sweden; a Youth Guarantee financial assistance scheme available for young refugees in France; a mobile app in seven languages on life in Germany. FRA calls on Member States to: speed up asylum procedures: Up to two years to complete the asylum procedure and get a residence permit underlines the need for sufficient financial and human resources to process claims on time. It would allow applicants with a high chance of approval start their integration as early as possible; limit family reunification bureaucracy: Family members had to take expensive trips through war-torn regions to reach the nearest embassy in a neighbouring country to apply. Swift and affordable family reunification rules are needed; provide proper housing: Some people lived on the streets throughout the asylum procedure. Refugee housing policies should cope with peak arrivals, and meet education and employment needs to minimise disruption due to relocations; improve mental healthcare: Already traumatised refugees are not able to sleep, drink or eat as they wait to be processed. This calls for swift and efficient identification, referral and treatment of mental health issues, including training for frontline workers; enhance education: Some children have to wait one year to attend compulsory school. Children need to be in mainstream education systems as early as possible. Grant asylum applicants early access to education, vocational training and employment to prevent criminals pushing them into a life of crime. Background information From 2015 to 2018, almost 2 million people received international protection in the EU. EU\u00a0law is clear and EU Member States have a duty to protect refugees. EU\u00a0funding to support their integration is also available. But the situation on the ground is very uneven across the Member States. These problems get even worse when young refugees turn 18 and the support networks they previously relied on sometimes disappear overnight. Notes to editors: The report draws on interviews across 15\u00a0locations in six EU\u00a0Member States: Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Italy and Sweden.

Recent research among Europe\u2019s Jewish community, published by FRA in December\u00a02018, shows that across the EU people reported that antisemitism was on the rise. In Austria specifically, the research shows that: More than 7 in 10 people (73\u00a0%) considered antisemitism a \u2018big\u2019 or \u2018very big\u2019 problem. 75\u00a0% of the respondents consider antisemitism has increased over the past 5 years. The same proportion believes that the Austrian government\u2019s efforts to combat antisemitism are not effective. Meanwhile, nearly two thirds (64\u00a0%) positively assess the government\u2019s efforts to ensure their security needs. Two thirds of Austrian Jews (67\u00a0%) who might sometimes wear, carry or display items that could identify them as Jewish now choose to avoid doing so. The Austrian Jewish community is less aware of laws forbidding discrimination based on ethnic origin or religion than the average of the 12\u00a0EU\u00a0countries surveyed (78\u00a0% awareness in Austria compared to an average of 87% in the countries surveyed). The three specific topics which will be addressed at the meeting include the security needs of Jewish communities; rethinking Holocaust remembrance and education; and improving data collection on antisemitism. Chaired by Dr Peter Kostelka, the Austrian member of FRA\u2019s Management Board, and opened by FRA\u2019s Director, Michael O\u2019 Flaherty, the meeting will hear keynote addresses in German from: Karoline Edtstadler, State Secretary at the Ministry of the Interior, Austria Ariel Muzicant, Vice-President, European Jewish Congress J\u00f6rg Wojahn, the representative of the European Commission in Austria, will also give a presentation on the European Commission\u2019s actions to fight antisemitism. \u201cThe Fundamental Rights Agency\u2019s survey on antisemitism in the EU shows that not only has it become normalised, but that it is getting worse. Only by working together to combat this highly disturbing trend can we achieve our aim of promoting and protecting the human rights of the Jewish community,\u201d says Michael O\u2019Flaherty, FRA\u2019s Director. \u201dIt is shocking to note that antisemitism not only persists in Europe after the Holocaust, but is even rising. It is our task to actively support Jewish life in our country and fight against any form of antisemitism. In Austria and Europe, there must not be any room for antisemitism. We will therefore target the youth and make the fight against antisemitism a topic in schools and education,\u201d emphasises State Secretary Karoline Edtstadler.

But the workers\u2019 perspectives in FRA\u2019s report \u2018Protecting migrant workers from exploitation in the EU\u2019 show how their exploitation contributes to the supply chains of the everyday goods and services we take for granted \u2013 from the food on our plates, to the shirts on our backs. The report reveals that over half of the workers found their jobs by word of mouth but ended up in \u2018concentration camp conditions\u2019 where \u2018they keep us like dogs, like slaves\u2019. FRA researchers found that some of the EU\u2019s exploited migrant workers are: paid as little as \u20ac5-a-day; forced to pay debts to traffickers before earning a cent; working 92-hour, seven-day weeks, with no holiday or time off; sleeping in shipping containers, with no water or electricity; monitored on CCTV 24/7 by bosses; subjected to beatings, verbal abuse and threats of further violence; given no protective clothing to work with hazardous chemicals; face sexual and gender-based violence or forced into moving drugs; threatened of dismissal and deportation when they ask for their wages. The report outlines 13 actions for EU institutions and Member States to end exploitation: End fraudulent or deceptive recruitment practices. Work with Europol, internet service providers and social media to tackle recruitment websites used by traffickers and exploitative employers. Enforce labour laws to protect migrant workers\u2019 rights on pay, conditions and hours. All EU Member States, which have not yet done so, should ratify the International Labour Organization\u2019s decent work for domestic workers Convention and include domestic workers in national laws resulting from the EU\u2019s Working Time Directive. Ensure all workers, including seasonal and posted workers, have adequate living standards and fair rental agreements and that the rent is not automatically deducted from the wage, when accommodation is provided by the employer. Build labour exploitation into the EU\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Strategic Framework by 2020. Include domestic workers in the EU\u2019s Safety and Health at Work Directive. Enable law, inspection and monitoring bodies to identify and tackle labour exploitation through training and sufficient resources. Develop regulated and targeted labour migration programmes to fill labour market shortages. \u00a0Reduce workers\u2019 dependency on employers, by issuing residence permits or visas not tied to a single employer, for example. Enable seasonal workers to freely change employers more than once, under the EU\u2019s Seasonal Workers Directive. Inform workers of their rights in a language they understand. Make specialised support services available to all victims of crime, including victims of severe labour exploitation. This includes ensuring organisations supporting trafficking victims also cover victims of labour exploitation. FRA Director Michael O\u2019Flaherty says: \u201cThis report shows how exploitation often starts with false promises and fraud, describes the extreme conditions the exploited workers endure, and identifies what facilitate exploitation. But it also outlines what can be done to help exploited workers access justice. \u201cWe hope that our focus on this issue encourages the responsible national authorities, as well as social partners, to recognise the reality of severe labour exploitation, and to take the steps necessary to create a climate of \u2018zero tolerance\u2019.\u201d Editor\u2019s notes The report draws on face-to-face and focus group interviews with 237 adult workers who have been victims of severe labour exploitation between 2013 and 2017.

They point to rising levels of antisemitism. About 90% of respondents feel that antisemitism is growing in their country. Around 90% also feel it is particularly problematic online, while about 70% cite public spaces, the media and politics as common sources of antisemitism. Almost 30% have been harassed, with those being visibly Jewish most affected. Antisemitism appears to be so deep-rooted in society that regular harassment has become part of their normal everyday life. Almost 80% do not report serious incidents to the police or any other body. Often this is because they feel nothing will change. Over a third avoid taking part in Jewish events or visiting Jewish sites because they fear for their safety and feel insecure. The same proportion have also even considered emigrating. Such results underline the need for Member States to take urgent and immediate action. In doing so they need to work closely together with a broad range of stakeholders, particularly Jewish communities and civil society organisations, to roll out more effective measures to prevent and fight antisemitism. This includes strengthening Holocaust education and awareness raising activities, keeping Jewish communities and sites safe, and regularly monitoring hate crime towards Jews. Regular victimisation surveys would help assess the effectiveness of laws and policies. In addition, all Member States should fully and correctly transpose EU laws to protect victims and to counter racism into their national law. This would help ensure victims get the support they deserve and perpetrators are sentenced with effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties. This would, in turn, encourage victims and witnesses to speak out and report incidents. The results cover 12 Member States where over 96% of the EU\u2019s estimated Jewish population live. Over 16,000 Jews aged 16 or over took part in the online survey from May to June 2018. It builds on the first survey\u2019s results and opinions published in 2013.

For this, Member States need effective and targeted policies and laws to ensure black people are fully included in our society.\u201d The Being Black in the EU report reveals the many challenges black people face. Take racial harassment: 30% of respondents say they have been racially harassed in the last five years; 5% have been physically attacked. Member States should therefore make greater efforts to better support victims of racism and to properly prosecute perpetrators. Racial discrimination also remains problematic. Around a quarter of black people experienced racial discrimination at work or when looking for work. Young black people are especially vulnerable; in some countries, up to 76% are not in work, education or training compared to 8% of the general population. Member States should therefore develop targeted measures to counter such discrimination. This could include diversity audits in workplaces and public sector recruitment drives among black people. Housing is another issue: 14% of respondents say private landlords will not rent accommodation to them. This is especially problematic, as only 15% own property, as opposed to 70% of the EU\u2019s general population. In addition, 45% live in overcrowded housing compared to 17% of the general population, pointing to the need for Member States to improve the quality of housing and to eradicate housing exclusion. Discriminatory profiling in police stops is also an issue: 24% of respondents were stopped by the police in the last five years. Among those stopped, 41% felt the stop constituted racial profiling, which undermines trust in policing and community relations. To counter this, Member States should develop specific, practical guidance for police officers so they can avoid unlawful profiling \u2013 FRA\u2019s will publish a guide on how to avoid unlawful profiling on 5 December. Guidance on community policing would also help. This report examines the experiences of nearly 6,000 black people in 12 EU Member States, as part of FRA\u2019s 2nd EU Minorities and Discrimination survey.

They covered such activities as local housing, education and employment. Looking across all activities, four key success factors emerge: Participation: Roma should be meaningfully engaged in projects and policies from start to end. This includes agreeing on specific goals and outcomes, and addressing issues that meet people\u2019s needs, such as adequate housing, education, and jobs. They should also have a real role in decision-making and jointly creating the change they want to achieve. Trust: As Roma communities and local authorities are often frustrated after repeated efforts that result in little progress, building trust is vital. When planning new activities, focusing on previous successful projects and trusted local authorities, community members and networks who are willing to help also improves success. Communications: Clear, accessible and targeted communications about aims, what participation actually means, as well as project budgets and whether participation is voluntary or paid, can create real understanding and buy-in of inclusion efforts. It also helps manage expectations. In addition, taking time to support people to properly engage and voice opinions can lead to more sustainable commitments. Community relations: It is important to know the different relationships within local communities when planning projects. This ensures people who can champion the project are fully on board. It helps to address interests that are shared by Roma and non-Roma alike, such as housing or employment. Allowing all sides to engage in respectful dialogue with local authorities can also improve the chances of success. The report also contains lessons for future projects and policies. These include granting enough time for the four keys to work and situating local integration efforts in wider social inclusion projects to ensure sustainability. It also underlines the importance of being flexible and adapting to specific local needs when designing and running projects. The report stemmed from FRA\u2019s research on the barriers to and drivers for successful investment in Roma inclusion. This was needed in order to develop and monitor the implementation of measures related to national and European policies for Roma inclusion.

Each report has a separate focus, looking at access to justice from a rights perspective. The last report looks at women as victims of domestic violence. The reports propose practical ways policymakers can make improvements to help victims. These include: More effective and comprehensive support to address the piecemeal approach to support. Better coordination between the police and support services for swift and effective referrals. Member States should also provide adequate staffing and funding for support services. This includes free legal aid, counselling, and advice on victims\u2019 rights. More protection during court proceedings to prevent further trauma when encountering offenders again. Measures should be in place to separate offenders and victims throughout proceedings. Greater police protection. The police and judges should better protect women in fear of violence again by their partner. They should systematically use barring and court orders. Better compensation for victims for the suffering endured. Inform victims of their right to compensation from offenders and from the state. Train judges that compensation is an important part of sentencing offenders. Rehabilitating offenders through anti-violence training, probation and victim-offender mediation. This helps society by preventing further violence. It also makes offenders more accountable for their actions. Judicial and police training to encourage understanding and empathy when dealing with victims. This would help the courts and police to better recognise victims\u2019 rights. It will ensure that victims are treated respectfully. Train healthcare providers to identify and act on incidents of abuse. Educate police on the need to intervene to prevent women from further suffering at the hands of their partner. The reports explore the rights-based approach to criminal justice. They result from fieldwork in Austria, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and the UK. They capture the perspectives of victims of violent crime, and of victim support staff, lawyers, the police and judges when it comes to protection against repeat victimisation and seeking justice.

Ratification of the UN\u2019s Disability Convention\u00a0(CRPD) by 2018 of all EU Member States and the EU\u2019s provisional agreement on the proposed European Accessibility Act were notable important milestones. Globally, the Agenda 2030 and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals outline a blueprint for a better world of equality, justice, and peace. But to succeed, human rights need to be embedded within them as the report outlines in its focus section. Other key issues identified include: Racial discrimination and harassment remain commonplace throughout the European Union. Recognising this, EU institutions adopted measures to counter antisemitism and to tackle racism towards Afro-Europeans. People because of their skin colour, religious belief or ethnicity continue to face widespread harassment, discrimination, entrenched prejudice and discriminatory ethnic profiling across the EU, as FRA\u2019s surveys show. For example, 1 in 5 black people and nearly 3 in 10 Jews experience harassment. All EU\u00a0Member States should therefore develop national action plans to fight racism and racial discrimination. They should also take a tougher stance against hate crime and hate speech through effective recording, investigating, prosecuting and trying alleged incidents. Refugee integration progressed despite diverse hurdles. However, almost 4 in 10 Europeans consider migration as problematic and almost half overestimate the size of irregular migration. Also allegations of migrants including children being push backed, sometimes violently, across the EU\u2019s external border and police mistreatment persist. Such actions underline the urgent need for Member States to act now to stop such abuse, and to ensure asylum and return procedures respect EU asylum law and people\u2019s human rights. Child poverty rates in the EU improved slightly but still 1 in 4 children are at risk of poverty. This means that, in one of the richest regions of the world, there are children who go to bed hungry and live in poor conditions with their health and education suffering. For children with foreign parents, it is as high as 4 in 10. Children from an ethnic minority continue to be marginalised. For example, 15% of Roma children experience segregated education. The EU and its Member States should therefore ring-fence funding for measures to reduce child poverty. They should also enhance efforts to address discrimination of minority children to boost social inclusion and their integration. The report summarises and analyses major human rights developments in the EU over 2018. It contains proposals for action covering the EU\u2019s Fundamental Rights Charter and its use by Member States; equality and non-discrimination; racism, xenophobia and related intolerance; Roma integration; asylum, borders and migration; information society, privacy and data protection; child rights; access to justice; and implementing the UN\u2019s disability convention.

Now we need action so the EU and its Member States honour their commitments to uphold the rights of children to give them a better future.\u201d The report, Combating child poverty: an issue of fundamental rights, highlights how one in four children under 18 are at risk of poverty or social exclusion across the EU. In some Member States, like Romania, it is as high as 1 in 2. While it can affect all children, some groups, like Roma and migrant children fare even worse; a FRA survey revealed over 90% of Roma children in nine Member States experience poverty. The report underlines how combating child poverty is also a matter of realising their fundamental rights. It also suggests what the EU and its Member States can do to address the issue: The EU and its Member States should tighten existing laws and policies to meet legal standards under the UN\u2019s Child Rights Convention and the European Social Charter. This would enable them to tackle child poverty better. They should prioritise the protection of vulnerable children and establish a European child guarantee scheme, as proposed by the European Parliament, to ensure each and every child has a decent home, diet, healthcare and education. The EU should link funding to Member States to plans and measures to reduce child poverty, inequalities and the social exclusion of children. \u00a0 The European Commission should cover child poverty and child rights in its country specific recommendations following its review of Member States\u2019 budgets and policies. The European Parliament and EU Council should adopt the European Commission proposal to improve work-life balance for parents and carers to help promote the well-being of children. The EU and its Member States should improve the collection of data to help monitor and assess progress towards ending child poverty and social inclusion. \u00a0 The report also identifies how the European Pillar of Social Rights can help ensure that children have the right to be protected from poverty. Discussions about the direction of EU funding also herald an opportunity to help children escape poverty.

This includes people with disabilities and their families. It underlines the strong legal framework in the EU and its Member States to support this transition, such as the UN\u2019s Disability Convention (CRPD) and the EU\u2019s Fundamental Rights Charter, and recent commitments, such as the European Pillar of Social Rights. However, the lack of available and affordable support services, persisting stigma and discrimination, and inaccessible environments impede people with disabilities from fully realising their legal rights. The report suggests ways to counter this, such as: All Member States should ensure there are clear targets and deadlines with sufficient funding, including EU funds, to enable people with disabilities to live independently in the community. The EU and its Member States should raise awareness of the benefits of independent living, including by using personal stories to further the positive change in attitudes towards people with disabilities. Member States should coordinate all efforts to support and provide services for independent living. This includes fully involving people with disabilities and frontline organisations in decision making and shaping policies. Member States should offer practical guidance and training on how best to make independent living a reality. Member States should offer specialist services and make general services accessible to cater to the wide range of needs of people with disabilities. This also involves empowering them with the skills to live independently. The report draws on fieldwork in Bulgaria, Finland, Ireland, Italy and Slovakia.

As children mature at different ages, setting age limits in law or in practice may restrict some of their rights while not offering enough protection in others. \u201cChildren have the right to be protected but also to be heard and take part in procedures that affect them,\u201d says FRA Director Michael O\u2019Flaherty. \u201cMember States need to find the right balance to ensure children are protected, but also empowered so that they have equal access to their rights across EU Member States.\u201d FRA\u2019s report on minimum age requirements in justice shows how age thresholds for children to be heard vary across the EU. They also depend on whether, for example, they relate to family, criminal or asylum law or whether children are witnesses or victims, or need to be taken care of. Furthermore, procedural safeguards may not apply to all children up to the age of 18 across Member States. For example, some allow children below 18 to waive their right to a lawyer. To highlight the critical issue of the different minimum age requirements across the EU, the Agency has been mapping national legal age requirements in various areas across the EU since 2017.

This helpful report is a key resource to guide those efforts.\u201d Victimisation surveys, such as the ones conducted by FRA, continue to underline how hate crime and hate-motivated harassment towards many groups \u2013 migrants, LGBTI people and minorities - persist across the EU. However, official statistics rarely tell the same story undermining societal trust in the systems that are there to protect them. The \u2018Hate crime recording and data collection practice across the EU\u2019 report shows how national police, legislators and policy makers recognise the need to improve hate crime recording.

The report\u2019s overview of practices across all 28 Member States builds on the activities of FRA\u2019s subgroup on methodologies for recording and collecting hate crime data and the online compendium of practices. Drawing on these practices, it suggests how Member States could improve: They should collect detailed data on the various biases behind hate crime. Only 15 currently break down their hate crime data. Such details would allow the police to monitor how effective their responses are and can help rebuild trust among communities. They should conduct regular victimisation surveys to get a better insight into the national situation. Only nine Member States do such surveys with questions specifically on hate crime. They should capitalise on civil society know-how by strengthening cooperation between police forces and civil society in areas such as training and outreach. Police forces should ensure a more tolerant culture pervades all levels of their service to instil a wider respect and understanding towards potential hate crime victims. Police officers should always have to assess if crimes are motivated by hate to ensure the crimes can be properly prosecuted. 15 Member States already provide their officers with some guidance; others should do so.

Severe exploitation should be rooted out,\u201d says FRA Director Michael O\u2019Flaherty. \u201cLabour inspections play a vital role in spotting abuse. For this, Member States need to strengthen inspections to catch exploitative employers and better protect workers.\u201d \u201cWe had two forms in which we officially only worked for 8 hours and in the one other one we worked for 14 hours,\u201d said an interviewed Polish agricultural worker in Germany. \u201cIn case [an] inspection came, we were to show the (first) list.\u201d The report, \u2018Protecting migrant workers from exploitation in the EU: boosting workplace inspections,\u2019 collected first-hand accounts from nearly 250 exploited workers from EU and non-EU countries. Over a half had not witnessed or heard of workplace inspections. They mentioned how many employers had advance warning of inspections enabling them to cover up malpractices. This in turn undermined workers\u2019 trust in inspections. To combat this, inspectorates should not inform employers when an inspection will happen in sectors where abuse is common. Member States should also punish employers that have tried to deceive inspectors. Member States should pay special attention to the construction and food sectors where exploitation is likely. They should also find ways to inspect domestic work. Workers were more likely to report on their employers when inspectors informed and involved the workforce. Inspectors should therefore create a safe environment for workers so they can freely give their views without fear of retribution. This may also involve finding ways to overcome language barriers when speaking with workers. Inspectors should also ensure inspections focus on workers\u2019 rights and working conditions rather than the immigration status of workers. To make inspections more effective, Member States should train inspectors to spot exploitation. Here specialist investigative units within labour inspectorates and joint operations with the police help. Member States should also raise awareness and enlist the help of other organisations, such as hospitals and trade unions, to report suspected cases of exploitation. This report is the second in a series that captures the views and experiences of victims of labour exploitation.

This is a key element of the EU\u2019s 2011 National Roma Integration Strategies Framework. Areas of particular concern include: Anti- Gypsyism remains high with one out of three Roma being victims of harassment. Member States need to recognise and monitor anti- Gypsyism, and take effective measures to combat such hate crime and hate speech. Living conditions for EU Roma have not changed much between 2011 and 2016: 80% of Roma are at risk of poverty compared with an EU average of 17%. 30% live in households with no tap water. Their access to safe water is often on a par with people in Ghana or Nepal. Such conditions undermine progress in education, health or employment. This calls for greater efforts on reducing poverty including eliminating segregated housing, better access to public utilities like electricity and water as well as more social housing. Education has improved in some Member States but gaps remain. Over 50% of young Roma children attend early childhood education. This is often much less than non-Roma children their age. As for pre-school education rates, Roma in the EU are similar to the people of Puerto Rico. Member States should provide access to high quality education, learning support to compensate for the poor living conditions of many Roma pupils, as well as targeted support at every stage of their education. Youth unemployment: The share of young Roma from 16-24, particularly women who are not in employment, education or training remains high compared to the general public. Member States need to boost employment, particularly for young Roma, through on-the-job training, traineeships and apprenticeships, for example. Roma should also receive targeted support to help them set up their own business. This report will feed the debate on future EU Roma inclusion as the existing EU framework ends in 2020. It measures the impact of existing measures over the years. It also contextualises Roma deprivation against other countries globally. This will help the EU and its Member States measure their commitment to the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. The report was issued pursuant to the European Parliament Resolution of 25 October 2017 on fundamental rights aspects in Roma integration in the EU: fighting anti-Gypsyism (2017/2038(INI)). Following this resolution, the European Parliament requested the Agency to issue \u201can independent report formulating opinions on progress made on Roma inclusion since the Commission\u2019s Communication of April 2011 and focusing on the impact of anti-Gypsyism and measure taken to address it\u201d.

Member States should abide by the laws, including international standards that recommend civil society participation in policy cycles. Due attention must also be paid to ensure that new or redrafted laws and policies do not undermine the work of civil society. Civil society funding also needs to be protected.

It also sets out how to safeguard people\u2019s fundamental rights: About 50% of European border and visa officials interviewed by FRA spoke of data entry mistakes in their IT systems. This can result from misspellings, lack of interpretation, or fingerprints being assigned to the wrong person. This shows the need for the EU and its Member States to strengthen quality assurance. They should also ensure people know why data is being collected and how to easily correct or delete inaccurate personal data. Data may be hacked; oppressive regimes may access data of people seeking refuge; data of children may stigmatise them into adulthood. Such issues call for strong safeguards controlling data access as well as ways of monitoring how data are being used. IT systems can also be a force for good. Nearly a third of border guards had come across children flagged as missing. This shows how IT systems can help trace missing and trafficked children.

On 13 November 2007, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the children had suffered discrimination in education, banned under international and European law. The action of these 18 children triggered Europe-wide efforts to end separate, substandard schooling for Roma. Despite these efforts, desegregation has not yet succeeded. On the contrary, although the participation of Roma in education is steadily increasing Europe-wide, school segregation is manifestly worsening as indicated in the most recent Communication by the European Commission on the Midterm review of the EU framework for national Roma integration strategies. Children placed in segregated education are victims of discrimination. When educated separately, they are ill-equipped to handle the complexities of our diverse societies. Segregated education denies Roma and other minorities, children with disabilities and migrant children, as well as children from majority communities, the benefits of inclusive education and the positive value of diversity for vibrant democracies and, above all, for people. Coupled with this, the substandard education these children receive severely limits their chances in all walks of life and harms their quality of life. The European Court\u2019s D.H. judgment came too late for the children who brought the complaint. By the time justice was rendered, they were in their twenties. Together with hundreds of thousands of other Roma around Europe, they had been under-educated and condemned to a life of low-wage employment and exclusion. In addition to the legal obligations of States to implement European equality law and the international human rights treaties to which they are parties, the \u201cno one left behind\u201d spirit of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda provides a compelling impetus for a renewed commitment to bring children together for inclusive education. In order to track progress, States should also redouble their efforts to develop their knowledge base as well as to produce and make public data in this area, with due consideration to privacy and data protection. Notes to editors: In the D.H. and Others v. Czech Republic case, the eighteen Romani child activists of the complaint showed that more than half of the children in special schools for the mildly mentally disabled in Ostrava in the Czech Republic were Romani, as well as that more than half of the Romani child population was in such \u201cspecial schools\u201d. They also demonstrated that in Ostrava any Romani child was 27 times more likely to be in separate educational arrangement than a non-Romani child. On the other hand, in the same city of Ostrava, at least 16,722 children of 33,372 children attending schools in Ostrava as of February 1999 went to school every day without meeting any Romani children. The European Court also relied on evidence from the Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (now the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights) showing that the number of Roma children in special schools in the Czech Republic was disproportionately high. The complaint was first brought before domestic courts in 1999, and ruled on finally by a Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights on 13 November 2007. The European Court of Human Rights has since ruled on cases concerning educational segregation in a number of other European countries. It has also ruled that pre-textual separate arrangements for Romani children based on language are also illegal, as is refusal to enroll or other forms of tolerated non-schooling.

It builds on FRA\u2019s 2014 violence against women survey, the largest and most comprehensive survey of its kind to date. The evidence collected reveals how persistent discrimination and endemic gender-based violence severely limit the ability of women to enjoy their rights and to participate on an equal footing in society. It gives examples of how harassment, including online and towards female journalists and politicians, and gender stereotyping, fuelled also by media representations of women, further reinforce such inequalities. Taking this evidence into account, the paper suggests a number of ways that could help improve gender equality and change how society treats women and girls. These include: Creating a safer online environment to counter the growing use of the internet and social media to abuse women and girls; Breaking gender stereotypes from an early age through promoting gender equality in education and lifelong learning; Introducing gender quotas to compensate for the lack of women at higher levels of politics and business, for example; Incorporating gender equality across all EU socio-economic policies to help Member States meet their gender equality commitments; Enabling national equality bodies to tackle all issues that impact women\u2019s rights, from gender equality to violence against women; Improving data collection and the sharing of knowledge on all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls to help decision makers better assess the impact of their laws and policies.

These reports serve as a wake-up call to guide policy makers to ensure this right is fully implemented across the EU.\u201d The \u2018From institutions to community living\u2019 reports explore different aspects of the move away from institutions towards independent and community living, a right enshrined in the UN\u2019s Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). They look at: deinstitutionalisation plans and commitments; funding; and the impact this is having on people with disabilities. The reports show that many Member States have deinstitutionalisation strategies which commit them to enabling independent living for all people with disabilities. EU structural funds have also made the transition from institutions to community-based support a condition for receiving funding. However, strategies often lack adequate funding, clear timeframes and targets, and fail to properly involve disabled persons\u2019 organisations, hampering progress. In addition, many Member States still finance institutions.\u00a0 Coupled with a lack of coordination among the many different national and local authorities that offer support, people with disabilities commonly live in worse conditions than people without disabilities. This is especially true if they have severe impairments. This often leaves them feeling excluded and lacking control over their lives. This points to the need to establish clear, properly resourced plans in terms of funding and responsibilities for supporting the closure of institutions and enabling community-based living, such as providing a range of good quality personal assistance options. Adequate community support should exist to support people with disabilities as they leave institutions. Making everyday services like transport, healthcare and education accessible is therefore essential. Involving people with disabilities and their representative organisations in decision making and monitoring progress is also key to ensuring their needs are addressed so they can enjoy their right to live independently.\u00a0 For further information please contact: media@fra.europa.eu /\u00a0Tel.: +43 1 580 30 642.

Security threats and new technology have triggered numerous extensive reforms to surveillance laws. While reformed legal frameworks are clearer, they are often still too complex, leading to uncertainty over the powers and mandates of intelligence services. This calls for stronger safeguards when it comes to data protection and privacy. The judiciary, specialised expert bodies, parliamentary committees and data protection authorities play a vital role in overseeing the work of intelligence services. However, as the report notes, they are hindered by a lack of access to information, and limited competences, powers to issue binding decisions, technical know-how, resources and independence. This points to the need for independent oversight with sufficient powers and competences. This also applies to international intelligence cooperation where safeguards and oversight are weaker. There is also the need to ensure full cooperation and complementarity between various oversight bodies so there is continuous coverage of all surveillance steps \u2013 from authorisation to implementation. \u00a0\u00a0 The complexity of who can help and the secrecy surrounding intelligence work also make it difficult for victims of rights violations to seek effective remedies. In addition, many non-judicial bodies that can offer support lack the expertise to tackle intelligence issues, and independence and powers to investigate, access materials, or issue binding decisions. However, some Member States have found solutions enabling people seek justice through expert judges who may access classified information.

In addition, since 88% of ethnic discrimination, 90% of hate-motivated harassment and 72% of hate-motivated violence were not reported, much stronger outreach is needed to encourage victims to come report incidents, while law enforcement and equality bodies need the right tools to deal with these reports effectively. Some of the other key findings include: 38% of respondents were discriminated against over the last five years with North Africans (45%), Roma (41%) and Sub-Saharan Africans (39%) particularly affected. Discrimination was greatest when it came to looking for work (29%). 31% of second-generation immigrant respondents experienced hate-motivated harassment in the last year. 50% of these victims were harassed at least six times in that year; Fewer minority members (61%) completed at least upper secondary education compared to the general population (74%). This reduces their employment chances. The results also indicate a higher level of trust in public institutions than the general population with a majority feeling strongly attached to the country they live in. They are also largely open towards other ethnic groups. However, the impact of discrimination, harassment or violence is also clearly shown. Those who have been victims trust public institutions less and feel less attached to the country they live in. This is the second minorities and migrants survey carried out by the Fundamental Rights Agency. The survey asked about experiences of discrimination, harassment, police stops, and rights awareness, as well as markers of integration, such as the sense of belonging and trust in public institutions, and openness towards other groups.

He stressed that these fabrications could only be countered through education and media literacy. \u201cThe challenge is to address those who are receptive to intolerant views. Encouraging greater media literacy is an essential element of this, particularly in the digital environment,\u201d the FRA Director said. \u201cWe need to support both children and adults to critically assess what they see and hear in the media. This will enable them to recognise propaganda, and help them to confront and report statements that incite hatred.\" In addition to the prompt condemnation of the use of hate speech, ECRI Chair Ahlund highlighted the need to challenge and engage those who propagate it. \u201cPolicies against hate speech should also envisage steps to encourage those who use hate speech both to repudiate this use and to help them end their association with groups using it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not an easy task. Nonetheless, changing behaviours, by demonstrating both the falsity of the foundations on which hate speech is based and its unacceptability, is not impossible.

To enhance rights protection in the EU, the report makes proposals including: Use the Charter of Fundamental Rights\u2019 full potential in national legislation and case law as well as in EU policy cycles like the European Semester to deliver on equality and justice for all across the EU. The creation of an EU internal strategic framework for fundamental rights and the EU\u2019s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights would further strengthen rights protection in the EU.

We need a new narrative that stresses the benefits that migrants, their children and their children\u2019s children bring to our societies,\u201d says FRA Director Michael O\u2019Flaherty. \"Integration is key to our security and to our democracy.\" There are some 20 million non-EU citizens living in the EU. Many have settled and started families. However, despite efforts from 2004 to follow common principles to guide and improve integration across the EU, Member States have widely different approaches to guide and improve integration and inclusion across the EU. The report Together in the EU: Promoting the participation of migrants and their descendants identifies and compares policies across the EU in areas important for successful integration. These include: Education: Migrant pupils face some form of school segregation in around half of EU Member States, often despite efforts by the authorities to prevent it. This depicts a worrying reality of migrants and natives living in divided societies. Youth: Fewer than half of Member States have action plans or strategies explicitly addressing youth with a migrant background, even though they can be important to avoid marginalisation, alienation and even radicalisation. Discrimination: 16 Member States do not protect migrants against discrimination on the basis of their nationality or status as migrant, refugee or foreigner, which can mask ethnic and racial discrimination. Language: Few Member States provide courses to all residents with limited language proficiency, including citizens of migrant background. At the same time, language learning programmes are rarely linked to employment, and job-specific or on-the-job language training courses are uncommon. As well as examining the national integration policies and strategies across the EU that determine the social and political participation of migrants and their descendants, the report also identifies examples of good practices that can be used or adapted for use in other national contexts.

These can be custodial battles in divorce proceedings or cases of sexual abuse or exploitation. The report \u2018Child-friendly justice: Perspectives and experiences of children involved in judicial proceedings\u2019 is based on interviews with 392 children. It both identifies the barriers children face and possible solutions, as well as a number of promising practices already in use in EU Member States. Children underlined the importance of their right to be heard with understanding and respect. This points to the need for clear and practical guidelines, as well as training for all professionals who come into contact with children. The children also want to be kept informed throughout the often lengthy proceedings about developments in the case and about their own rights. This demonstrates the necessity of providing age-appropriate information before, during and after trial. It was clear from the interviews that many situations cause children to feel uncertain and unsafe. Here it is vital to ensure that Member States have procedural safeguards in place that cater to the needs of children, in extreme cases such as those concerning domestic violence or sexual abuse but also in the many custody cases around the EU. These safeguards can include child-friendly hearing locations, video links or pre-recorded evidence, as well as protecting children\u2019s personal data from the media and public. The findings are based on interviews with children in 9 Member States: Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, France, Germany, Poland, Romania, Spain and the UK.

Only 30% of the Roma surveyed are in paid work, compared with the average EU employment rate for 2015 of 70%. 41% of Roma feel they have been discriminated against over the past 5 years in everyday situations such as looking for work, at work, housing, health and education. 82% of Roma are unaware of organisations offering support to victims of discrimination. The survey findings indicate that despite Member States\u2019 efforts, they are still falling short of most of their integration targets, a key element of the EU\u2019s 2011 National Roma Integration Strategies Framework. The results underline the need for: early childhood learning support and integrated schooling better employment opportunities and greater social protection to eradicate poverty targeted education and training to specifically help Roma youths and Roma women in their transition from primary to secondary education, and thereafter find work. The report is based on a survey that collected information in nine EU Member States, derived from nearly 8,000 face-to-face interviews with Roma.

It points to the shared use of bathrooms and showers in reception and accommodation centres particularly in the evenings or at night that are not separated for men and women. Sometimes such facilities are accessible via unlit corridors and doors that cannot be locked. Such issues expose women and girls to greater risks, and leave them feeling unsafe. Victims rarely report their attacks. This is often due to fear about the repercussions on the victim\u2019s asylum claim or from the perpetrator (especially when it comes to domestic violence), and the lack of information about what can be done. In some Member States, if they flee the centre without permission because of fear or because they have been attacked then they may also be judged as having committed an offence. Various EU and national laws and policies take gender-based violence into consideration when it comes to granting asylum and when receiving asylum seekers. However, drawing on data from the nine Member States most affected by the migration flows, FRA has identified challenges in identifying, reporting and protecting female refugees which Member States should tackle. These include: No Member State collects data on reported incidents of gender-based violence towards female refugees that have just arrived or need international protection. Information on gender-based violence, how to report it and where to seek help is not usually available in reception centres. Victims are reluctant to report to reception centre authorities or the police. Most Member States are taking steps to address this. These include: asylum interviews with women in private rooms by trained staff and interpreters of the same sex separated from the husband; information material and sessions; and \u2018women-only\u2019 spaces. Nearly half of the Member States have guidelines or procedures to identify and deal with victims. However, they are not always effective and training is often lacking. All Member States offer some form of prevention of gender-based violence and protection for victims. Most commonly this includes separate accommodation for newly-arrived unaccompanied migrant women and access to women\u2019s shelters for victims. Sometimes victims can receive medical and psycho-social support, and report incidents of violence but protective and preventative measures are rarely comprehensive and seldom coordinated. Most Member States have no special procedures for children who are victims of violence. Some Member States lack legal support or adequate interpretation for victims of gender-based violence in reception centres. To better protect female refugees the European Parliament has also recently called for new gender guidelines. In addition, the European Commission has suggested that the EU ratifies the Council of Europe\u2019s violence against women convention (the Istanbul Convention) which also covers migration and asylum. It would then join the 14 Member States that have already ratified the Convention (all 28 have signed it) which provides a solid legal basis for addressing violence against all women. The European Commission asked FRA to collect data about the fundamental rights situation of people arriving in Member States, particularly affected by large migration movements. The countries covered are: Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Slovenia and Sweden. FRA has published overviews since September 2015. Each overview covers different issues including: initial registration and asylum applications; criminal proceedings initiated for offences related to irregular border crossing; child protection; reception conditions for new arrivals; access to healthcare; public response such as rallies of support, humanitarian assistance or voluntary work; racist incidents such as demonstrations, online hate speech or hate crime. While this month has a section looking specifically at gender-based violence, last month\u2019s focus was on trafficking and smuggling.

This is the only way we can ensure that people will be fairly treated.\u201d The reports examine EU laws and how their use in varying national contexts affects individuals during criminal proceedings and sanctioning, before and after trial. They also show how rights protection can enhance trust between Member States in cross-border cases and how these laws can significantly improve the enjoyment of fundamental rights in the EU. Rights of suspected and accused persons across the EU: translation, interpretation and information examines the right to information and translation and the right to interpretation of suspects and the accused. These rights ensure effective participation in criminal proceedings and overall fairness during trial, regardless of where in the EU the proceedings take place. Criminal detention and alternatives: fundamental rights aspects in EU cross-border transfers examines issues of criminal detention and alternatives in cross-border transfers. Such mutual recognition between Member States depends on trust, which in turn hinges very much on fundamental rights. For instance, detention should be used as a last resort and alternatives used more, in line with human rights standards. As well as helping the reintegration process, alternatives to detention are often cheaper. Both reports note that criminal proceedings should also consider the specific needs of people with disabilities or children, in accordance with European and international human rights standards. This includes accessible information about individual rights, and ensuring people are transferred to places with adequate detention conditions.

This is what we debated over the last four days in Vienna during the Fundamental Rights Forum 2016,\u201d said FRA Director and Forum Chair Michael O\u2019Flaherty. \u201cHuman rights cannot be viewed as an optional extra that can be sacrificed. They are the cornerstone of European identity; if we lose them we will lose Europe.\u201d The EU has built up a strong fundamental rights system over the years. However, rights are in crisis. Trust in democratic institutions is falling, undermining rights protection and promotion that ultimately benefit us all. To move forward, Europe must work together, always mindful that Europe is not alone in today\u2019s increasingly interdependent world. Areas that need joint action include: Ensuring fundamental rights are not a niche issue but are instead mainstreamed in all policy discussions and decisions at the EU and national level, particularly in the social and economic sectors. Building a strong fundamental rights culture through rights education that is essential in today\u2019s societies. This includes improving rights awareness among everyone in the EU. Strengthening the oversight by parliaments and rights watchdogs, the national human rights bodies, to better hold governments account of their fundamental rights obligations. Guaranteeing that everyone, including vulnerable groups, is involved in decisions on policy measures that affect them. The Forum focused on the three most pressing fundamental rights challenges facing the EU today: refugee protection, inclusion and the digital age. Three of the very many suggestions were: Broadening legal ways of reaching safety as an alternative to risky irregular entry. EU Institutions and Member States could consider enlarged resettlement schemes, as well as building public support for responsible asylum policies through political leadership and creating powerful counter-narratives to anti-refugee rhetoric; National, regional and local authorities, the business sector, professional groups and civil society should work together to use EU funds to stimulate socially responsible and inclusive growth that fosters fundamental rights and respect for diversity; A \u2018traffic light\u2019 warning system for users of digital technology, by IT companies and their regulators.

With 60 million people forcibly displaced worldwide, the migration situation is set to remain at the top of the EU agenda. The majority of refugees coming to Europe, many of them children, are risking their lives by paying smugglers to cross the sea in overcrowded and unseaworthy boats. An upsurge in racist and xenophobic incidents was noted in many Member States, fuelled by fears over the migration situation and a spate of terrorist attacks. FRA\u2019s report finds that Muslims and Jewish communities were particularly affected. The terrorist attacks once again highlighted the difficulty of finding the right balance between protecting personal data and privacy and maintaining internal security. A number of EU\u00a0Member States are in the process of reforming their legal intelligence framework, which could potentially increase the intrusive powers of the services.

The FRA work on data collection and its support of Member States in improving recording of hate crime needs to be operationalised and will be of central importance in this renewed context.\u201d The online compendium contains measures that EU countries are using to combat hate crime, with details on their implementation and evaluation. Some 30 practices are being launched today, but these are just a beginning, as the compendium is a living document that will be revised and added to in the coming months. It is aimed at policy makers and law enforcement officers, who are encouraged to review and adapt practices from other countries for their own national context. The compendium emphasises the Fundamental Rights Agency\u2019s growing focus on practitioners as a vital element in countering hate crime. In this context, FRA is also publishing a new report based on interviews with 263 experts from law enforcement, criminal justice, and civil society organisations. While listing a number of promising developments across the EU, the report chiefly highlights the difficulties of recording hate crime, as well as the risk that police officers may share the discriminatory attitudes of offenders, the probability of discrimination being overlooked in court proceedings, and the overall challenges faced in living up to and enforcing the ideal of a diverse society based on respect for human dignity. Today, the majority of hate crimes \u2013 whether against Roma, LGBT people or members of Muslim or Jewish communities \u2013 remain unreported, unprosecuted and therefore invisible, often leaving victims without redress for their suffering. The objective of FRA\u2019s work is to assist EU Member States in encouraging and supporting victims to report their experiences on the one hand and to improve the performance of the police and the judiciary in tackling hate crime on the other, thus helping to ensure access to justice for all victims.

It is essential that any migrant facing involuntary return has the opportunity, on the basis of his/her personal circumstances, to challenge any assumption of safety,\u201d said FRA Director, Michael O\u2019Flaherty. \u201cFrom a fundamental rights point of view, the existence of a list of safe countries of origin is legitimate, however, it must be constructed and applied respecting fundamental rights. Above all, it must be administered in a manner that non-negotiably honours the right to asylum.\u201d Safe countries of origin are the asylum seekers\u2019 countries of nationality where there is no risk of persecution. Member States compile lists of these countries to help fast track asylum applications. However, they differ widely in which countries are included in national lists. Their approaches to handling asylum applications from these countries also varies. This has partly led to a European Commission proposal to establish an EU common list of safe countries of origin which the European Parliament asked FRA to comment on. FRA\u2019s Opinion concerning an EU common list of safe countries of origin looks at the fundamental rights impact of the proposal. It finds that such a list should only be viewed in the wider context of overall EU asylum laws and responsibilities, and how they are being implemented in the Member States. However, it should not be the only tool to speed up asylum processing; more financial and human resources, as well as training, enhanced coordination between agencies etc. should be deployed to ensure individual assessments are still carried out. If such a list was established it could fast track asylum applications which are unfounded. This could free up existing scarce resources to focus on dealing with bona fide claims, shorten processing times and make more space available at reception centres. However, the fundamental rights of all asylum seekers would need to be maintained and protected. These include: The right to asylum, non-refoulement and preventing collective expulsion: Without exception, no one should ever be returned to a country where they risk being persecuted. This principle of non-refoulement, guaranteed by EU and international law, means that every asylum seeker from safe countries has the right to be heard, and should be given ample opportunity and assistance to present their asylum case. Member States should also ensure there are adequate safeguards against collective expulsions. The EU list must also build in flexibility for change to remove unsafe countries or to reflect worsening circumstances in these countries. Such assessments must be based on comprehensive sources. The right to an effective remedy: All asylum seekers have the right to appeal decisions. If they come from a country on a safe list, they should still be allowed to stay in Member State during the appeal procedure. They should also have proper access to information and legal assistance, especially since the burden of proof for them is greater as they need to disprove any presumption of safety. Child rights: Unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from listed safe countries should not have their claims assessed too fast. This does not give enough time for the child\u2019s best interests, a legal requirement under EU and international law, to be assessed. In addition, while claims for safe countries are being processed at border points, children should not be arbitrarily detained. The right to non-discrimination: While all people in similar situations should be treated equally, when it comes to generalised safe lists, care needs to be taken to ensure minority groups are not put at risk. Such groups may be at greater risk of persecution if returned than the general population. FRA\u2019s assessment serves to highlight potential areas of concern when establishing an EU common list of safe countries of origin. The opinions are meant to feed into the European Parliament\u2019s own assessment of the Commission\u2019s proposal.", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2016/4-fundamental-rights-issues-consider-eu-safe-countries-list"}, {"id": "FRA_PR_0065", "date": "2016-03-16", "text_type": "PR", "title": "Wrong and outdated views towards LGBT people endanger their fundamental rights", "text": "Access the report\u00a0Professionally speaking: challenges to achieving equality for LGBT people\u00a0>> In the first-ever comparative survey across 19 Member States of the views of public officials, health officials, teachers and police officers, the positive impact of EU initiatives was largely acknowledged. However, they also recognised the lack of information and professional training about the needs of LGBT people prevents them from acting to help counter the discrimination LGBT people continually face. \u201cLGBT people have the same rights to education, to healthcare and to be treated equally as everyone else. They too have the right to live their life in dignity, free from fear and discrimination,\u201d says FRA Director Michael O\u2019Flaherty. \u201cFRA\u2019s latest findings reveal how some doctors still wrongly believe that homosexuality is a disease. They underscore the need for the EU and its Member States to empower public officials to act on their duty to deliver high quality service to help end the suffering many LGBT people experience.\u201d FRA spoke to the professional groups best placed to identify the barriers and drivers in implementing fundamental rights policies on the ground. Some of the key findings that emerged that can be found in the \u2018Professionally speaking: challenges to achieving equality for LGBT people\u2019 report include: Society can have hostile views towards LGBT people and professionals can harbour prejudices, such as believing that homosexuality is a disease that can be caught. This points to the need for more positive EU and national awareness-raising campaigns, such as in the EU\u2019s list of actions to improve respect for LGBT people and their rights. All professional groups have low levels of awareness and knowledge about LGBT needs. This underlines the importance of professional training, and civil society partnerships and cooperation to help counter prejudice, especially towards trans people in healthcare, and better deliver the same high level of service that most other people enjoy. The lack of objective information, particularly in schools, can result in bullying and prejudice in later life, and force LGBT youths to hide their sexual orientation/ gender identity. Member States should work with education authorities and schools to formulate targeted campaigns to help make schools a safer and friendlier place for LGBT people. LGBT hate crime often goes unrecognised, unreported and unrecorded. Member States should make more efforts to ensure the laws guarding against hate crime are properly enacted, and that greater efforts are made to improve LGBT hate crime reporting which should be recorded. The report surveyed public officials, doctors, teachers and police officers about which laws and policies work and which do not, and why, when it comes to protecting and promoting the rights of LGBT people. A comprehensive EU-wide overview of LGBT-relevant laws and policies can be found in a FRA report launched in December 2015. This report also looks at the problems intersex people face. The findings complement the results from FRA\u2019s ground-breaking EU LGBT survey which revealed large-scale fear and discrimination among LGBT people across the EU.

Many are being let down by the systems that should protect them,\u201d says FRA Director a.i. Constantinos Manolopoulos. \u201cQualified guardians can, and should, be vital to the wellbeing of such vulnerable children. To better protect children from harm, Member States should urgently develop and implement quality standards that will strengthen guardianship across the EU.\u201d Guardians are a key element of protection systems for children who cannot have their interests represented by their parents. This report, Guardianship systems for children deprived of parental care in the European Union, explores the key features of guardianship systems across all EU Member States that have been established to meet the needs of children without parental care. It includes those at risk of becoming victims of human trafficking or other forms of violence and exploitation. This comparative report complements the handbook on guardianship for children deprived of parental care that should soon be available in all official EU languages. It will help decision makers take measures to promote the effective protection of all children, in line with the EU\u2019s anti-trafficking Directive and Strategy. It does this by explaining the strengths and weaknesses of national guardianship systems which vary greatly from country to country, even within countries. For example: Appointment procedures: The time taken to appoint guardians and the process itself vary considerably, lasting up to one year. This is despite laws that state that the process should be quick. Such variations can be even more pronounced when guardianship is managed regionally or locally. This is not in the best interests of the child as it leaves children uncared for and uncertain until arrangements are in place. Qualifications and skills: In most Member States guardians should be competent and qualified by law. However, requirements tend to be very general, and systematic training is lacking, particularly with respect to the needs of trafficked children. Duties and tasks: Laws tend to only define the duties and tasks of guardians in general terms, except for the duty to legally represent children. As a result how common tasks are performed, such as taking care of the child\u2019s education and healthcare, varies. Some accompany children to doctors\u2019 meetings, others do not; some never even meet the child. Systems for foreign or trafficked children: No Member State has a separate system for trafficked children. Generally children are legally protected no matter what their nationality or status is. However, in practice their migration and residence status often determines guardianship and representation arrangements. Legal representation and legal aid: Despite the importance of having specialised legal aid for child victims of trafficking, specialist lawyers are rare and are often unavailable. Accountability and monitoring: Although all Member States have systems for monitoring and supervising guardians, they are often poorly structured and inefficient. In addition, complaint mechanisms are missing. Overall, the lack of a uniform approach to guardianship, despite provisions in national and international law, often results in less than adequate support and protection for the children the systems were set up to protect. Migration and asylum law also often overrides child protection law. An integrated approach to child protection that looks to the best interests of the child is therefore clearly needed. Harmonising and strengthening guardianship systems is a vital component of protecting children from all forms of violence and exploitation. This report underlines the wide variation that currently exists across all Member States. To read the report, see: Guardianship systems for children deprived of parental care in the European Union.

The EU and its Member States need to take immediate and decisive action to combat extremist, xenophobic and antisemitic discourse and crimes.\u201d FRA points out in its annual overview of data on antisemitism in the EU that the reliable and comparable figures vital to help tackle the phenomenon effectively are currently missing.

It addresses its scope under EU and national law. It also explores the practical application of this right for everyone and for specific population groups examining how barriers to judicial remedies impede the freedom to conduct business. At the same time the report also identifies promising practices in respect to this right. The research reveals that, while a number of initiatives related to the freedom to conduct business have been implemented at EU and national level, much remains to be done to realise the full potential of this right. This includes raising awareness about this right which is rarely referenced in economic policies and legal texts. The freedom to conduct a business is influenced by complex and time-consuming procedures, by difficulties to find financing, by barriers in accessing justice such as lengthy and costly litigation, and the lack of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. Under-represented population groups including women, youths, migrants and people with disabilities face additional hurdles. For example: Women are not adequately supported to balance family and work life as compared to men, when engaging in entrepreneurial activities.\u00a0 Young entrepreneurs have limited exposure to and practical experience of the business environment. Many face difficulties navigating the complex systems and regulatory requirements associated with setting up business, not to mention start-up costs.\u00a0 Migrants face additional obstacles to securing financial capital for starting a business, problems in recognising their qualifications, language barriers, limited knowledge of legal requirements and regulatory procedures, and in many cases cultural differences and discrimination.\u00a0 People with disabilities may face limitations in terms of independence and infrastructure needed at the workplace. They often have difficulties securing adequate funding to start a business, or may also face uncertainty about the financial consequences of setting up a business. However, the research also found that all Member States have taken steps to remove excessive regulation and alleviate the administrative burdens faced by entrepreneurs, particularly SMEs. This includes the increasing and widespread use of online tools and one-stop-shops for registration and information. Significant efforts have also been made at EU and national level to promote entrepreneurship among under-represented groups. Nevertheless, the report finds that much more needs to be done to remove barriers specific to these groups.

Almost 15 years after the last conflict in the Balkans and 70 years after WWII, it is time to reflect on how we deal with the new challenge of asylum seekers travelling through Europe by land or crossing the Mediterranean to find shelter in the EU,\"\u00a0said FRA interim Director Constantinos Manolopoulos. \"We are facing a humanitarian and a human rights emergency and many EU citizens are welcoming the desperate people seeking asylum, because, whether or not they have permits, visas or passports, they have a right to life and to dignity.\u00a0It is the moral and legal duty of the Union and its Member States, despite the great difficulties this may entail, first to address the humanitarian emergency in an efficient and effective manner; secondly, to protect and fulfil the right to seek international protection without risking lives.\u201d Already at FRA\u2019s 2014 Fundamental Rights Conference Fundamental Rights and Migration to the EU, participants discussed the need for a more holistic approach to migration and asylum policy in the EU and emphasised that fundamental rights must be at the very heart of such policies and not just one element of them among many. FRA has also pointed out that there are currently few legal avenues by which people in need of protection can access the EU. In Legal entry channels to the EU for persons in need of international protection: a toolbox, FRA presents a number of ways in which Member States could enable more people in need to reach the EU without resorting to smugglers. In recognition of the urgency of the growing humanitarian crisis at the EU\u2019s borders, FRA is now stepping up its work in the area of asylum and migration. For example: On 3 September FRA will publish its latest report, The cost of exclusion from healthcare \u2013 the case of migrants in an irregular situation. The report details the findings of the Agency\u2019s research into the comparative costs of providing healthcare access or emergency treatment only to irregular migrants in three EU Member States FRA is supporting its sister agencies, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and the border management agency Frontex, with the development of a common training tool for border guards and asylum officers A major FRA project underway on the social inclusion and democratic participation of migrants and their descendants in Member States will be used as the basis for developing fundamental rights indicators that can be used throughout the EU, thus helping to increase integration and prevent radicalisation FRA is conducting a large-scale research project on the fundamental rights impact of the collecting, storing and using the biometrics data collected in the three large-scale IT systems (Eurodac, the Schengen Information System and Visa Information System) established to exchange personal data in the area of asylum and borders A selection of FRA\u2019s numerous publications in the area of migration, asylum and borders can be found below. Focus papers Criminalisation of migrants in an irregular situation and of persons engaging with them \u00a0The majority of Member States punish irregular entry and stay with imprisonment or fines. Criminalisation harms not only the migrants themselves, but also those who support them, such as providers of humanitarian or legal assistance, or people who rescue migrants in distress at sea. Reports FRA has published a series of three reports on the fundamental rights situation at the EU\u2019s southern sea borders, at five major EU airports, and at six land borders. Fundamental rights at Europe\u2019s southern sea borders examines the conditions at Europe\u2019s southern sea borders with respect to the most fundamental of rights: the right to life and the right not to be sent back to torture, persecution or inhuman treatment. It examines sea border surveillance and disembarkation procedures, as well as training and Frontex-coordinated operations. Fundamental rights at airports: border checks at five international airports in the European Union examines the checks that border guards carry out on third-country national passengers entering EU territory at five international airports. Fundamental rights at land borders: findings from selected European Union border crossing points examines fundamental rights challenges at land borders, helping to create a shared understanding among border guards of what fundamental obligations mean for their daily work and therefore ultimately enhancing fundamental rights compliance at the EU\u2019s external borders. Already in 2011, FRA carried out research into the fundamental rights situation of migrants at the Greek/Turkish land border. The findings can be found in this report: Coping with a fundamental rights emergency - The situation of persons crossing the Greek land border in an irregular manner FRA has also published several reports on the fundamental rights of irregular migrants in the EU. Migrants in an irregular situation employed in domestic work: Fundamental rights challenges for the European Union and its Member States Based on interviews conducted with migrants and civil society organisations in 10 EU Member States, this report highlights some of the fundamental rights challenges affecting migrants in an irregular situation employed in the domestic work sector. More than 600 experts were interviewed for FRA\u2019s research of labour exploitation in the EU. Severe labour exploitation: workers moving within or into the EU Worker exploitation is not an isolated or marginal phenomenon, but despite its pervasiveness, severe labour exploitation and its adverse effects on third-country nationals and EU citizens have to date been the subject of little research.

But there has also been progress,\u201d says FRA interim Director Constantinos Manolopoulos. \u201cThe report\u2019s evidence and conclusions can guide policy makers across the EU in their actions to better promote and protect fundamental rights. They can serve as a launch pad to help ensure that the policies and laws can better deliver fundamental rights in practice for everyone in the EU.\u201d As in past years, the FRA Annual report 2014 highlights challenges and achievements in many areas of fundamental rights from across the EU. For example: The plight of migrants continued to worsen. Record number of migrants died in the Mediterranean; there was a fourfold increase in those rescued or apprehended at sea; the processing of migrants at the borders of some Member States worsened; and public discourse surrounding migrant integration continued to be a challenge. However, in 2014 new EU funding mechanisms were established to help Member States implement EU migration and asylum law, improve solidarity between Member States and help fight cross-border crime. Overall, the current migration situation in the EU points to the need for an over-arching EU-wide policy that addresses all aspects of migration from cause to effect. The recent European Agenda on Migration is an important step in this regard.\u00a0 The persisting challenges in reporting and recording hate crime. The results of FRA\u2019s extensive survey on violence against women pointed to widespread abuse of women at home, work, in public and online throughout the EU. As with previous FRA surveys, for example on antisemitism and on discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, it also revealed general feelings of fear and high levels of under-reporting among victims. However, some Member States have made steps to better protect victims of crime by reviewing their laws and policies as the November 2015 transposition deadline of the EU Victims Directive comes closer. FRA\u2019s Annnual report notes that Member States should adopt further measures to establish comprehensive victim support services, enable victims access such services, and train police officers and legal practitioners on victim support.\u00a0 Child protection continues to be under-resourced in many Member States, hindering efforts to better protect child rights in practice. Data show that child poverty and social exclusion rates remains high. At the same time, some Member States are improving the legal protection of child victims or children without parental care. However, as the FRA Annual report shows, Member States should improve coordination mechanisms and develop quality standards, as well as effective inspection and monitoring mechanisms to ensure services comply with the obligation to respect child rights. As in previous years, the Annual report also contains a specific focus section. This year it takes a close look at fundamental rights indicators, as a tool to enhance and gauge EU and national commitments to protecting rights.

EU Member States need to make a greater effort to promote a climate of zero tolerance for severe forms of labour exploitation and take steps to monitor the situation more effectively and sanction perpetrators.\" FRA\u2019s new report is the first of its kind to comprehensively explore all criminal forms of labour exploitation in the EU affecting workers moving within or into the EU. The findings show that criminal labour exploitation is extensive in a number of industries, particularly agriculture, construction, hotel and catering, domestic work, and manufacturing, and also that perpetrators are at little risk of prosecution or of having to compensate victims. This situation does not only harm the victims themselves, but also undermines labour standards more broadly. While exploited workers are spread across different geographical locations and sectors of the economy, they often have much in common, such as very low wages \u2013 sometimes of \u20ac1 per hour or less \u2013 and working days of 12 hours or more for six or even seven days a week. One important factor contributing to the present situation of widespread impunity is a lack of reporting by victims, who are either prevented from doing so or do not wish to come forward for fear of losing their job. Among proposals FRA makes in the report to improve the situation are the following: EU Member States must ensure a comprehensive, effective and well-resourced system of workplace inspections. To improve the effectiveness of investigations into cases of severe labour exploitation, close links should be established between the police, public prosecutors and monitoring authorities such as labour inspectorates, support services, and employers\u2019 associations, also in cross-border contexts. Victims\u2019 access to justice needs to be strengthened, e.g. through greater efforts to make victims aware of their rights, both before and after their arrival in the EU country in which they are working. National authorities need to establish trust and provide a sense of safety, security and protection to encourage exploited workers to report their experiences, while labour inspectorates and police should cooperate more closely to ensure they identify cases of severe labour exploitation wherever they occur. Both private companies and national authorities are called on to ensure they avoid supporting labour exploitation by contracting or subcontracting companies involved in the exploitation of workers. Consumers must be informed of the risks that a product or service offered was created involving severe labour exploitation by such means as a system of certification and branding of products of companies that respect workers\u2019 rights.

Intersex people vary in their chromosomal, hormonal and/or anatomical characteristics which do not match strict medical definitions of male or female. To date, intersex issues have been largely treated medically. However, at both EU and national level institutions and civil society are beginning to be more aware of the fundamental rights implications. This paper focuses on three of these issues: Registration of sex at birth: Many Member States legally require births to be certified and registered as male or female. This puts pressure on those concerned with registration, particularly parents and health professionals to choose the sex of the new-born child and to intervene medically. However, at least four Member States allow birth certificates to be registered as sex neutral and two allow birth certificates to be issued without a sex identifier. Gender markers in identity documents and birth registries should therefore be reviewed to better protect intersex people. Medical treatment of intersex children: In at least 21 Member States, medical interventions are carried out on intersex children to impose a sex on them. In 8, legal representatives can give consent and 18 require patient consent. However, involving children in such decisions is a grey area as factors such as age determine when the child can decide, when parents should decide and opens up the question what happens when there are disagreements between the intersex child and parents over the decisions made. It should also be noted that non-medically essential surgery without consent is viewed by international law as inhumane, cruel and degrading. Member States should therefore avoid non-consensual \u2018sex-normalising\u2019 medical treatments for intersex people. Protection from discrimination: Intersex discrimination is better covered by sex discrimination rather than discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and/or gender identity as it is the determination of the sex that gives rise to inequalities. Given intersex covers a large variation of sex characteristics, cases will probably be approached differently, even within the same legal system, in the absence of specific protective legislation. Legal and medical professionals should therefore be made aware of the fundamental rights of intersex people, particularly children. The paper draws on evidence from FRA\u2019s third update of its comparative legal report on homophobia, transphobia, and discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, gender identity and now covers intersex. The update is based on data collected until mid-2014 across the EU and will be published later this year. To read the Focus paper, see: The fundamental rights situation of intersex people.

This is especially the case for judicial proceedings. Member States should also ensure that the Council of Europe guidelines on child-friendly justice are applied in daily practice by everyone involved.\u201d Improving child rights\u2019 protection in judicial systems is addressed by the United Nation\u2019s Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which all EU Member States have ratified. The Council of Europe produced special guidelines on child-friendly justice because this is an issue which affects many children. For example, around 74,000 children were victims of crime and 495,000 were affected by divorce in 11 EU Member States in 2010. FRA research reveals that child participation practices vary widely not just across, but also within, Member States, and these practices are not always child-friendly. This points to a need for clear and consistent standards and guidelines which should be systematically monitored. The research also identified the need for awareness raising measures and the special training of professionals. The key findings relate to specific child rights, for example:\u00a0 In recent years respect and fulfilment of the child\u2019s right to be heard has improved, particularly in criminal proceedings. In civil proceedings children are not always heard. Greater efforts are needed to ensure that children are heard in safe and child-friendly rooms, using techniques appropriate for a child\u2019s age and maturity. Children should be heard in as few hearings as possible involving a small number of well-trained professionals;\u00a0 National legislation often contains provisions on the right to information, but in practice there is significant variation in the way children are informed, when, by whom, about what and how. Regular, child-friendly information and material about child rights and judicial procedures, tailored to the child\u2019s age, throughout the proceedings, can improve their trust in justice;\u00a0 Most Member States have made significant efforts to guarantee the child\u2019s right to privacy and their right to protection from harm and re-traumatisation, especially in criminal proceedings. In practice, however, protective measures are often under-utilised. Separate rooms to prevent contact with defendants and the use of video recordings and video links by trained professionals in courtrooms and police stations should become standard practice in the EU to protect children adequately;\u00a0 Despite legal provisions on equal treatment, staff often lack the expertise to deal with children in vulnerable situations, such as those with disabilities or those with a minority ethnic background. There is a need to ensure that children\u2019s access to justice and their treatment in judicial proceedings is effectively monitored to prevent any discrimination. Access to legal aid and support for children in vulnerable situations should be facilitated. The report also highlights a number of examples of promising practices.

Politicians and other public figures have a particular responsibility in this regard because of their capacity to influence a wide audience, they said. In addition, education has a key role to play in undermining the misconceptions and misinformation that form the basis of hate speech. \u201cHate speech is an extreme form of intolerance and contributes to hate crime. If left unaddressed, it can lead to acts of violence and conflict on a wider scale,\u201d ODIHR Director Link stressed. \u201cWithin the OSCE region, it is important for political representatives and opinion-makers such as the media, community leaders and educational institutions to show strong leadership whenever hate speech and hate crimes occur.\u201d Aware of the grave dangers posed by hate speech for a democratic society, the heads of the three institutions said that criminal prohibition is necessary when hate speech publicly incites violence against individuals or groups of people, but is not sufficient to eradicate it. \u201cRaising public awareness of the importance of respecting pluralism, as well as of the dangers posed by hate speech can often be the most effective means of preventing it,\u201d ECRI\u2019s Chair Ahlund said. \u201cIn this context, national authorities should support non-governmental organisations, equality bodies and national human rights institutions working against hate speech.\u201d Ahlund, Kjaerum and Link stressed that victims should be helped to cope with the trauma of being targets of hate speech and encouraged to report it to the authorities. At the same time, appropriate action must be taken to ensure that society understands that the use of hate speech is unacceptable. \u201cIn the current climate, we need urgently to move away from the culture of impunity we see on internet and social media platforms,\u201d said FRA Director Kjaerum. \u201cNational authorities as well as the private corporations that run them need to work together. This would help to reduce marginalisation and fight radicalisation, which are both for good reason high on the European agenda.\u201d The Heads of all three organisations said they would continue their co-operation to raise awareness about the need to promote mutual respect and understanding between all groups in society and provide support to governments to prevent and combat the dangerous consequences of hate speech.", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2015/values-threatened-hate-speech-must-be-reinforced"}, {"id": "FRA_PR_0079", "date": "2014-12-09", "text_type": "PR", "title": "What does it mean to be transgender in the EU today?", "text": " Access the report: Being Trans in the EU - Comparative analysis of the EU LGBT survey data >> \u201cEveryone has the right to be themselves. However, in reality many trans people live in fear as society is often intolerant and ignorant of trans people and their needs,\u201d says FRA Director Morten Kjaerum. \u201cOur research shows that trans people live noticeably better lives where Member States are aware of the problems and have developed policies to protect and support them. The EU and all Member States should follow this lead so all trans people can be themselves in all walks of life.\u201d The report points to how trans people experience frequent discrimination and victimisation, harassment and disrespect, drawing on the responses to FRA\u2019s wider EU LGBT survey. Some difficulties that trans people particularly face include: Repetitive violence: Over two in five trans respondents, who were victims of violence, indicate that this happened three or more times during the year before the survey. Such findings point to the need to improve policies to combat hate-motivated violence and harassment by specifically protecting against transphobic hate crime and improving awareness among police of how to deal with such hate crime.\u00a0 Fear of being yourself: One third of all trans respondents avoid expressing their gender identity through the way they look or dress for fear of being assaulted, threatened or harassed. Half of the trans respondents avoid places particularly public places, like on the street, in squares or in parking lots, because of these fears. Almost one in five respondents avoid being open even in their own home. EU action and national responses should be strengthened and address gender identity and gender expression to better protect trans people. Member States should also ensure legal gender recognition in identity documents, without the need to resort to medical intervention or divorce, to help trans people enjoy their fundamental rights.\u00a0 Discrimination in employment, education and healthcare: One in three trans respondents felt discriminated against when looking for a job or at work. These findings point to the need to ensure that laws to protect against discrimination include explicitly gender identity. Employers should consider diversity training to improve awareness of trans issues; schools should provide a safe environment for trans pupils and objective information about gender identity and gender expression; and in healthcare, medical professionals should be made aware of the healthcare needs of trans people. The analysis also shows that young and unemployed trans people, and those from the lowest income strata are more likely to report experiences of discrimination, harassment and violence. The report also provides evidence that where action plans, positive measures and equality policies combating discrimination are well developed and implemented, trans people are more open and can live a better life.

EU Member States must ensure they comply with obligations in the Victims\u2019 Directive to train police officers and court staff, and make available the additional resources needed to implement these measures. Bureaucratic hurdles should be removed so that legal aid is made available to victims who are party to criminal proceedings in the same way as it currently is to defendants. Member States should introduce measures that ensure victims have access to information about their rights and available support services, as well as to relevant information about their case. To encourage more victims to come forward and report crimes, EU Member States should ensure that information about victim support is made immediately available by all authorities and public services with which victims come into contact, including the health service. FRA research has consistently found that underreporting is a major obstacle to ensuring victims have full access to their rights. Targeted and practical victim support systems are a crucial element of any strategy to increase trust in the authorities and increase reporting rates, without which it is impossible to improve the investigation and prosecution of crime. In this regard, the Victims\u2019 Directive, or Directive establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime is a big step forward. Member States must transpose the articles of the Directive by 16 November 2015. The subject of victim support is closely linked to FRA\u2019s other work on access to justice, discrimination and hate crime, and particularly to the findings of the Agency\u2019s large scale surveys of people who are most often victimised. The results of this work can be found in publications such as the LGBT report, discrimination and hate crime against Jews, or Violence against women. For today\u2019s report, FRA has collected data from all 28 Member States in order to provide information and analysis on current procedures at national level. The publication demonstrates that despite the many challenges, there have been a number of positive developments across Member States. Many of these are listed in the report as promising practices. For example: Some EU Member States such as Belgium, Estonia or Finland ensure that victim support organisations are run either directly at police stations or in their immediate vicinity, making referrals easier. In several Member States, including Denmark, Poland and the United Kingdom, money is raised for victim support services by means of a fund paid into by people on conviction of a criminal offence. Apps have been developed in some Member States such as Spain or Sweden that provide details on court procedure, as well as on locations and contact details. The report is available here: Victims of crime in the EU: the extent and nature of support for victims The Victims\u2019 Directive is just one element of the broader Victims\u2019 Package. Two other pieces of legislation that make up the Package will enter into force on 11 January 2015, which ensure crime victims who are granted protection in one EU country will be eligible for similar protection in another Member State.

However, their role and work varies from across the EU. This handbook provides the much needed guidance that should help strengthen guardianship systems across the EU to better protect all children who are at risk.\u201d \"We must ensure that all children, particularly children without parental care, are safe from criminals, who violate their rights and deprive them of their childhood. Children are particularly vulnerable and at greater risk of becoming victims of trafficking in human beings. Child protection is a cornerstone of our EU anti-trafficking legislation and guardianship plays a very important role for the prevention of child abuse and exploitation. Regardless of their immigration status, children should be first and foremost treated as children,\" says EU Commissioner for Home Affairs Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m. There are many reasons why children might be separated from their parents. Trafficking is one of them. Unaccompanied children and children without parental care living in residential institutions are at higher risk of being trafficked. FRA\u2019s handbook explains the important role guardians play in protecting all children from child abuse and exploitation. They form a central role in integrated child protection systems. Given how guardianship varies from country to country across the EU, the handbook aims to promote a shared understanding of the main principles and features of guardianship systems. Irrespectively of the reason of separation, all children have the same needs and equal rights. This underlines the need to strengthen child protection systems across the EU for all children. The handbook presents a set of core common principles and key standards to improve conditions of children in guardianship. These include: 1.\u00a0\u00a0 Non-discrimination: All children are entitled to the same level of protection, no matter where they come from. In this respect, EU Member States should harmonise guardianship provisions and services. 2.\u00a0\u00a0 Independence and impartiality: Guardians must be able to act independently and impartially, guided by the best interests of the child. 3.\u00a0\u00a0 Quality: Guardians and legal representatives should be qualified and receive continuous training on child protection and welfare. This should extend for example to skills in meeting the particular needs of child victims of trafficking or unaccompanied children. 4.\u00a0\u00a0 Accountability: National law should ensure that guardianship systems are clearly defined and monitored so that the relevant authority can be held responsible and accountable. 5.\u00a0\u00a0 Sustainability: States should provide sufficient human and financial resources for guardianship systems, which should also cover monitoring and training. 6.\u00a0\u00a0 Child participation: Children should be informed and involved in all aspects of their guardianship. This also includes awareness of their rights and of how to complain, if their rights are not respected. The handbook provides specific guidance for Member State officials and guardians on how guardianship systems and individual guardians can cater for the particular needs of child victims of trafficking and protect their rights. The handbook will be available later in all EU languages. FRA will also publish a comparative overview of guardianship systems across the EU in early 2015.

As the new European Parliament and Commission take office, the time is now ripe to put equality and non-discrimination of LGBTI people back on the EU\u2019s agenda.\u201d The Italian Presidency of the Council of the EU, in cooperation with the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) and the General Secretariat of the Council are hosting the high-level conference \u201cTackling sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination: next steps in EU and Member State policy making\u201d at the Council of the EU. The conference aims to support the further development of policy responses by the EU and its Member States to address the fundamental rights challenges faced by LGBTI people in their daily lives, including hostility, hate crime, discrimination and bullying. It builds on the results of FRA\u2019s EU LGBT survey and other studies that revealed the extent of discrimination and hate crime that LGBTI people face regularly at home, at work and in public. Many EU Member States have moved forward and have adopted legislation and policy measures that have improved the situation of LGBTI people. For example: In 2008, 9 Member States limited sexual orientation discrimination to just employment. By 2014, this has dropped to 3 Member States; In 2010, 8 Member States consider same-sex spouses as \u2018family members\u2019 in the context of free movement within the EU. This is now the case in 18 Member States. However, in practice hate crime, bullying and discrimination remain major problems for many LGBTI people. Comprehensive concrete legislative and non-legislative measures at the EU and national level are needed to improve the situation so all LGBTI people can live their lives in dignity and with respect. Over 400 decision makers and fundamental rights\u2019 practitioners from across the EU are gathering to discuss how equality policies in different areas of the EU\u2019s competence can be further strengthened and mainstreamed and what Member States can do to help. The results of such discussions will be a useful contribution to the broader equality and non-discrimination high-level event organised by the European Commission and the Italian Presidency that will take place in Rome from 6 to 7 November.

Together with FRA\u2019s earlier report on fundamental rights at the EU\u2019s southern sea borders, these studies describe the treatment of people entering the EU and make suggestions to improve respect for their human rights. \u201cThe EU\u2019s borders are its first point of contact with the external world. This is where the EU\u2019s fundamental rights\u2019 obligation begins,\u201d said FRA Director Morten Kjaerum. \u201cAny action taken by the EU to help manage its external borders must comply with fundamental rights. Making fundamental rights part of the Schengen border control evaluations is already a step in the right direction. Security concerns at the borders must not overrule fundamental rights, which must be at the core of modern and integrated border management.\u201d The two new reports reveal a number of issues that affect the fundamental rights of non-EU citizens arriving in the EU. In the light of these findings, FRA makes a number of proposals to improve fundamental rights safeguards at the EU\u2019s borders, aimed at EU and national policy makers, the EU borders Agency Frontex, and operative officers working at border check posts. For example: Although border guards receive instructions on professional and respectful treatment, some passengers found border guards to be unhelpful, unresponsive and hostile verbally. EU Member States should therefore take effective action to address serious forms of disrespectful conduct towards travellers; Less than half of border officers interviewed at the airport and land borders say they inform people undergoing detailed checks of the purpose and procedure of the examination. Over two thirds also said they would not tell people who are refused entry into the EU where to get legal assistance. Border guards must provide all travellers with timely and adequate information when they are subjected to detailed checks or if they are refused entry. Member States should also be more active in promoting language learning by border guards and put in place effective interpretation mechanisms at border crossing points*; A third of border guards interviewed at the land border crossing points said they would not start an asylum procedure even if the traveller said their lives or freedom would be at risk if they were returned to the country they had left. At four of the airports investigated, an average of only 22% of border guards had received written guidance on identifying potential victims of trafficking. Border guards therefore need to be better trained and sensitised to recognise asylum seekers or migrants who have been trafficked. Border management authorities should also ensure there are procedures in place and training available for border guards who deal with children*; Facilities for migrants who have been refused entry or who have arrived without papers are often insufficiently equipped, even though people can be held there for several hours; at some airports they were held for several days. Member States must ensure that the facilities in which people whose entry to the EU has been denied are held meet basic needs, including the provision of food and water. FRA\u2019s annual Fundamental Rights Conference, which begins today, is devoted this year to the topic of fundamental rights and migration to the EU. As well as border management, the conference will debate issues such as the protection of children, migrant integration and the growing racism in some places against migrants. Participants will also discuss the challenges posed by the recent pressures at the EU\u2019s external borders for receiving countries, and ways of responding to the situation.

Europe needs to act together to find long-term comprehensive solutions that will address all aspects of migration from cause to effect\u201d. The Italian coastguard, through the Mare Nostrum initiative, has already saved thousands of lives of those in peril on the seas surrounding the EU\u2019s external borders. However, such short-term actions are insufficient to address fundamental rights emergencies as EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) pointed out in its report on Fundamental rights at Europe\u2019s southern sea borders. Unless structural solutions and actions adopted at EU level are fully implemented, more tragedies are likely to occur. This also means that the EU should review its legislation to combat human smuggling as outlined by FRA in its 2014 paper on Criminalisation of migrants in an irregular situation and of persons engaging with them. This is an important aspect of the European Commission\u2019s \u2018Task Force Mediterranean\u2019, which was set up following the deaths of almost 400 people off the Italian island of Lampedusa in October 2013. In light of the Mediterranean Task Force recommendations, and FRA findings from its work on migration, the EU needs a more comprehensive approach leading to a joint commitment by all Mediterranean coastal and other interested States to address unsafe migration by sea. This would include: tackling the reasons why people flee: the EU need to help improve the human rights situation in third countries; \t\t\u00a0 enhancing regional protection: this will enable asylum seekers access fair and efficient processes in their region of origin without exposing them to perilous sea crossings. This also involves supporting those regions who receive refugees fleeing from trouble zones; \t\t\u00a0 alleviating the pressure on countries of first arrival: resettlement needs significant improvements. For example, in 2012 the US received 50,000 refugees whereas 12 EU Member States only received 5,000; \t\t\u00a0 improving maritime safety: unseaworthy boats should be prevented from taking to sea and all efforts made to uphold the global search and rescue regime, including the swift disembarkation of rescued people to safe places; \t\t\u00a0 assisting migrants in distress: Private shipmasters must not be discouraged from providing humanitarian assistance. Criminal rules to combat human smuggling must be implemented in a way to avoid that people providing such assistance are punished; \t\t\u00a0 creating legal ways to access Europe for people who need protection: currently such people are too often dependent on smuggling networks to reach safety; \t\t\u00a0 recognising the added-value of migration: many migrants enter the EU and help drive the EU economy. This needs to be acknowledged and supported by the appropriate migration channels; \t\t\u00a0 providing full access to fair and efficient asylum procedures: Member States should make use of EU funds and operational support from the EU Asylum Support Office (EASO) to provide adequate and humane reception conditions for migrants, including support for vulnerable people; \t\t\u00a0 boosting operational support for border operations carried out by the EU border agency, Frontex, which must be fundamental rights-compliant. Here FRA offers support by sharing its expertise as well as through fundamental rights training for border guards; \t\t\u00a0 showing EU solidarity: All EU Member States should equally shoulder responsibility for migration. FRA will support the Italian Presidency to help move the EU migration agenda forward. As part of this, FRA\u2019s flagship event this year, its Fundamental Rights Conference will focus on fundamental rights in the area of migration, integration and border management.

The choices the EU makes now will shape fundamental rights for the years to come. We need to work together to ensure that the laws we have today deliver fundamental rights in practice for everyone in the EU.\u201d As in past years, the FRA Annual report 2013 highlights challenges and achievements in many areas of fundamental rights from across the EU. This includes for example: FRA surveys on violence and discrimination towards lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, on violence against women, and on antisemitism all revealed general feelings of fear and high levels of under-reporting among victims, particularly hate crime victims. Greater efforts are needed to strengthen support and protection of victims under the 2012 EU Victims\u2019 Directive. The tragic events off the Italian coast of Lampedusa underlined the urgent need for EU-wide action to safeguard the lives and rights of migrants. The European Commission initiative to reduce deaths at sea sets out lines of action to address many of the issues through stronger European cooperation. The revelations of widespread data surveillance pointed to apparent weaknesses in the authorities responsible for data protection at European and national level. Significant reforms of the EU\u2019s data protection rules that resulted from the backlash should help strengthen data protection across the EU. As the Council discusses the priorities in the area of justice and home affairs in the coming five years, FRA\u2019s Annual report underlines the need for the EU and its Member States to reaffirm and strengthen their joint commitment towards protecting and promoting fundamental rights. It suggests the creation of an internal fundamental rights strategy and an annual policy cycle to better link up and to regularly assess fundamental rights efforts at EU and national levels. This would mirror the existing external human rights framework and consolidate the EU as a beacon of human rights worldwide.

With European elections around the corner, it is timely reminder that across the EU change is needed to allow all people with disabilities to have an equal say in the political life of our society.\u201d Together with the European Commission, FRA developed a set of human rights indicators on how the right to political participation, as described in the UN\u2019s Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), is being respected, promoted and fulfilled across the EU. The data which populate these indicators show that given the opportunity people with disabilities actively participate in politics through voting, political meetings and engaging with elected officials.

This led FRA to propose: Lifting legal and administrative barriers: National disability action plans should address how to promote the political participation of people with disabilities. This includes amending laws depriving people of the right to vote based on their disability. Alternative forms of voting for people in long-term institutions, for example, and accessible ways to request support in voting should also be introduced so no one is excluded from taking part in elections. Complaint mechanisms about voting should also be more accessible. Here allowing disabled people\u2019s organisations (DPOs) to bring complaints to court should help. Making political participation more accessible: Polling stations should cater to the needs of all people with disabilities not just those with physical impairments. This includes offering appropriate support to all those who want to vote. Election information and campaign material should also be available in a wide range of accessible formats \u2013 e.g. Braille, national sign-language, easy-to-read, etc. Expanding opportunities for political participation: Under the CRPD, consulting with and actively involving people with disabilities in decisions affecting them is an obligation. EU bodies and Member States should strengthen mechanisms to involve DPOs. Opportunities for people with disabilities to take part in public consultations, through the use of accessible communications, for example, should be promoted. Candidates with disabilities should also have equal opportunities to run for office by providing additional support where required, for example. Increasing rights awareness: Election officials, political parties, public authorities and media providers need training and guidelines on how to cater to the needs of people with disabilities. Member States should also involve DPOs when producing such guidelines. This includes tackling inaccessible polling stations and campaign material. Collecting data to measure political participation: Robust, comparable data needs to be collected at EU and Member State levels to help shape targeted measures that will improve political participation. This includes developing common approaches for capturing such data and guidelines for measuring accessibility.

Shortfalls in national data collection methods also mean that many such crimes remain unrecorded, leaving them unresolved and invisible. To discuss these issues and find ways of improving the situation, FRA is organising a seminar together with the Hellenic Presidency of the Council of the EU, in cooperation with the Centre of International and European Economic Law (CIEEL). Representatives of almost all EU Member States will participate, as well as experts from international organisations including the OSCE\u2019s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights and the Council of Europe. The focus of the seminar will be on encouraging reporting and improving recording of hate crime. \u201cOne of the most shocking findings of our work on hate crime is the fear it instils in whole communities,\u201d said FRA Director Morten Kjaerum. \u201cMuch still needs doing to build trust among victims that reporting their experiences will lead to recognition of their suffering and the prosecution of perpetrators. At the same time, EU Member States must work to improve their data collection methods to ensure that these crimes finally become visible.\u201d Since its establishment in 2007, FRA has built up a large body of work on hate crime. This includes data on the experiences of groups such as lesbian, gays, bisexual and transgender people, Roma and other ethnic minorities. The seminar, entitled 'How can EU Member States combat hate crime effectively? Encouraging reporting & improving recording', takes place on 28-29 April in Thessaloniki.

FRA video - Voices of victims of violence against women: \u201cThese survey figures simply cannot and should not be ignored. FRA\u2019s survey shows that physical, sexual and psychological violence against women is an extensive human rights abuse in all EU Member States,\u201d said FRA Director Morten Kjaerum. \u201cThe enormity of the problem is proof that violence against women does not just impact a few women only \u2013 it impacts on society every day. Therefore, policy makers, civil society and frontline workers need to review measures to tackle all forms of violence against women no matter where it takes place. Measures tackling violence against women need to be taken to a new level now.\u201d The survey asked women about their experiences of physical, sexual and psychological violence, including domestic violence. Questions were also asked about incidents of stalking, sexual harassment, and the role played by new technologies in women\u2019s experiences of abuse. In addition, the survey asked about respondents\u2019 experiences of violence in childhood. Drawing on the survey responses, some of the key findings show that: 33% of women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence since the age of 15. That corresponds to 62 million women. 22% have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by a partner. 5% of all women have been raped. Almost one in 10 women who have experienced sexual violence by a non-partner, indicate that more than one perpetrator was involved in the most serious incident. 43% have experienced some form of psychological violence by either a current or a previous partner, such as public humiliation; forbidding a woman to leave the house or locking her up; forcing her to watch pornography; and threats of violence. 33% have childhood experiences of physical or sexual violence at the hands of an adult. 12% had childhood experiences of sexual violence, of which half were from men they did not know. These forms of abuse typically involve an adult exposing their genitals or touching the child\u2019s genitals or breasts. 18% of women have experienced stalking since the age of 15 and 5% in the 12 months prior to the interview. This corresponds to 9 million women. 21% of women who have experienced stalking said that it lasted for over 2 years. 11% of women have experienced inappropriate advances on social websites or have been subjected to sexually explicit emails or text (SMS) messages. 20% of young women (18-29) have been victims of such cyberharassment. 55% of women have experienced some form of sexual harassment. 32% of all victims of sexual harassment said the perpetrator was a boss, colleague or customer. 67% did not report the most serious incident of partner violence to the police or any other organisation. The survey on which the report is based makes clear that a wide variety of groups need to take action to combat violence against women, including employers, health professionals and internet service providers. FRA makes a number of proposals to improve the situation and to support EU and national policy makers to introduce and implement comprehensive measures to prevent and respond to violence against women: EU Member States should ratify the Council of Europe\u2019s Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (the Istanbul Convention). EU Member States must regard intimate partner violence as a public and not a private issue. The law in all EU Member States should therefore treat rape within marriage the same as other incidents of rape, and should respond to domestic violence as a matter of serious public concern. EU Member States need to review the existing scope of legislative and policy responses to sexual harassment, recognising that it can occur in various settings and can use different mediums, such as the internet or mobile phones. Police, healthcare professionals, employers and specialist victim support services need to be trained, properly resourced and given the necessary powers to reach out to victims. The police and other relevant services should be trained to recognise and understand the impact of psychological abuse on victims to ensure all forms of violence against women (and girls) in varied settings are recognised, recorded and acted on. The police should be encouraged to routinely recognise and investigate cases where cyberstalking and cyberharassment plays a role. Internet and social media platforms should proactively assist victims of cyberharassment to report abuse and be encouraged to limit unwanted behaviour. Specialist support services are required to address the needs of victims who suffer from negative feelings in the aftermath of victimisation, which can include self-blame and a sense of shame. Campaigns on and responses to violence against women must be directed at men as well as women. Men need to be positively engaged in initiatives that confront how some men use violence against women. There is a clear need to improve and harmonise data collection on violence against women, both in and between EU Member States.

Note to editors: Over 42,000 women were interviewed for the survey. The net sample size was 1,500 respondents per country (except in Luxembourg, where the net sample size was 900 respondents). Respondents were 18-74 years of age at the time of interviewing. All respondents were selected randomly and the survey results are representative both at EU and national level. o Questions were asked about experiences and incidents since the age of 15 and over the 12 months preceding the interview. The Council of Europe\u2019s Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (the Istanbul Convention) aims to ensure better protection for women as victims of gender-based violence. To date only Austria, Italy and Portugal has ratified the convention but 17 EU Member States have signed it.

Ambassador Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d, Director of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), Christian Ahlund, Chair of the Council of Europe's European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI), and Morten Kjaerum, Director of the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), stressed that the opportunities enjoyed by political leaders to shape opinions and set agendas come with a responsibility to unequivocally denounce expressions of racism and combat xenophobia and related intolerance. The failure to counter racism in an outspoken and effective manner contributes to further marginalisation and vulnerability of the individuals and communities targeted, they said. In addition, it risks giving the perpetrators of racially motivated crimes a sense of impunity. \"When leaders speak out against hate crimes, this sends a strong message of reassurance to affected communities\", said Lenar\u010di\u010d, Director of ODIHR. \"Political leaders also play a key role in developing policies to counter hate crime. First, they need to put in place a system for comprehensive reporting and recording of racist incidents, so that policymakers have the information they need to create robust and effective responses.\" The heads of the three institutions said that effective leadership in combating racism had to include co-operation with and support for non-governmental efforts in this direction. \"Civil society organisations' commitment in this area makes them strong partners for governments \u2013 especially in responding to hate speech with counter speech,\u201d said ECRI Chair Ahlund. \u201cEffective co-operation between governments and civil society is also needed to ensure that victims of racist violence are heard and its perpetrators are condemned.\" They stressed that other public figures, such as religious leaders, have an important role to play by speaking out against racist and ethnically motivated violence. The media is also crucial to countering stereotypes and distorted portrayals of groups that frequently find themselves the target of attacks. Openly combating racism is even more essential in times of economic crisis, when these communities are often in greater danger of being stigmatised and scapegoated. \"Racism and hate crime instil fear into entire communities and undermine social cohesion. We cannot allow such fundamental rights violations to persist at their current high levels,\" said FRA Director Morten Kjaerum. \"Particularly in the run-up to the European Parliamentary elections, political leaders and other opinion makers need to speak out clearly against racist opinions whenever and wherever they are expressed.\" The heads of all three organisations said they would continue their co-operation to raise awareness about racism and its impact, and to provide support to governments to prevent and combat all forms of racial discrimination.

The report findings also underline the urgent need for the EU\u2019s reformed data protection rules to come into effect. \u201cToday it is too easy to simply collect and abuse the personal data of Europe\u2019s citizens. This infringement of rights can have a profound effect on the victims of data protection violations,\u201d says FRA Director Morten Kjaerum. \u201cIt is now time to give power to the data protection authorities to help counter these violations so victims can receive adequate redress.\u201d \u201cIn the European Union data protection is a fundamental right. We must make sure that this right is protected and that citizens can enforce it,\u201d said European Commission Vice-President Viviane Reding, the EU\u2019s Justice Commissioner. \u201cAs the report from the EU Fundamental Rights Agency shows, today, many citizens don't know where to go to if their data has been misused. This is not good enough. The Commission\u2019s data protection reform proposals will make life easier so citizens can always address their local data protection supervisor. I hope ministers will follow the European Parliament's lead to swiftly enact the data protection reform that will improve citizens' rights.\u201d Interviews with victims have shown that most victims of violations turn to data protection authorities. They often do this to ensure similar violations do not reoccur rather than to seek financial compensation. Only in exceptional cases do they go through courts. Court procedures were viewed as being too complicated, costly and time consuming. The lack of legal assistance and of data protection specialists as well as under resourced data protection authorities and intermediary organisations were also identified as concerns. In addition, information about data protection procedures and remedies was found to be lacking. The report shows that across EU Member States data protection authorities can issue orders to rectify violations and impose sanctions ranging from warnings and fines to the revocation of licenses. However, the size and duration of these sanctions can vary significantly from country to country. In almost all Member States, criminal sanctions can also be imposed, in the form of a fine or imprisonment but again there are large national differences in the duration of sentence and size of the fine. Web-based activities, direct marketing, or video surveillance with closed-circuit television cameras accounted for most data protection violations. Government bodies, law enforcement, and financial and health institutions are most often responsible for these violations. As a result victims most frequently experience, insecurity, damage to reputations or emotional distress. The proposed reform of EU data protection rules should help to alleviate such problems. Based on the report findings FRA suggests: Raising public awareness of complaint mechanisms, including the existence and role of national data protection authorities; Data protection training for legal professionals so they can offer more informed advice; Strengthening the independence of data protection authorities; Providing adequate resources and empowerment to data protection authorities to remedy violations; Funding civil society organisations and independent bodies to help victims seek redress; Streamlining rules on the burden of proof, particularly for online cases, to make it simpler for individuals to bring cases before a court or supervisory authority.\u00a0 The report contains an overview of the legal framework and the procedures people can use in cases of data protection violations. It also gives examples of actual experiences of victims and those dealing with data protection violations in order to identify areas for improvement in accessing data protection remedies. In order to help better explain data protection issues, FRA will publish tomorrow a handbook on European data protection case law. The handbook, developed together with the Council of Europe, is aimed at legal professionals and non-governmental organisations who are not specialists in data protection.

This is the significant parliamentary presence of political parties standing for and promoting an extremist ideology that particularly targets irregular migrants (in Greece) and the Roma and Jews (in Hungary), and which are either themselves or have links to paramilitary organisations committing racially motivated acts of violence.\u00a0 The EU and its Member States already have strong legislation in place to fight racism, intolerance and extremism. However, greater efforts are needed to ensure effective implementation. In addition, more needs to be done, particularly at local level, to foster social cohesion and increase trust in the police and other law enforcement authorities. The overall aim of this report is to provide a better understanding of the barriers to combating racism and intolerance, and fulfilling fundamental rights throughout the EU. The proposals contained in the final section of the report are therefore relevant for all Member States when developing their own strategies for combating racist discrimination and violence, as well as the emergence of extremist ideologies on the political scene. Key proposals suggest that EU Member States: Review their legislation to ensure that the formation of associations or political parties does not serve as a basis for promoting hatred and racist violence. Consider adopting national strategies to tackle racist and related crime, focusing on issues such as how to prevent hate crime, increase reporting, improve recording, prosecute hate crime offences, and provide effective victim support. Explore ways in which trust in law enforcement agencies can be increased among members of minority groups, and fight ethnic discrimination and racist abuse on the part of the police and other public officials. One of the principal barriers to reporting racist and related incidents is victims and witnesses\u2019 distrust in the police. Assess the benefit of enhanced penalties in sentencing perpetrators of hate crime, in order to ensure that the bias motivation behind the offence is always taken into consideration. Consider developing exit strategies and programmes for people involved with extremist groups and organisations. For these to be effective, close cooperation would be needed between law enforcement agencies, the criminal justice system and civil society organisations. Ensure that victim support is provided in close cooperation with civil society and representatives of minority groups, and facilitate the active involvement of the police in supporting victims.

The rescued migrants have been on board for three days. FRA welcomes the swift agreement between Malta and Italy that will uphold the rights of these migrants. \u201cMigrants who have already had the trauma of being rescued at sea should not also suffer the indignity of being pawns in legal disputes,\u201d says FRA Director Morten Kjaerum. \u201cTime and time again we see this happening. International human rights obligations should ensure the rights of rescued migrants are safeguarded and they receive the assistance and support they need. FRA is pleased to see the fast response by Malta and Italy that will allow these migrants to disembark.\u201d Earlier the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, had urged the Maltese government to take swift action and allow the migrants to disembark on their territory. In its 2013 report on Fundamental rights at Europe\u2019s southern sea borders, FRA underlined the unacceptable consequences of delays in disembarkation for rescued migrants due to unclear rules in international law. In one of the examples from the report, over 100 migrants were stranded on a vessel under NATO command for several days in July 2011, as Malta, Spain (the flag ship) and Italy debated where to take them. They were finally brought to a refugee camp in Tunisia. The FRA report concluded that in such cases all parties should make practical arrangements to allow for swift resolution of any disputes in full respect of the principle of not returning potential victims to a place where their life and safety are at risk. The Maltese authorities had said the migrants should be sent to Libya as it was shipmaster's responsibility to return to Libya. The reasoning was that the maritime rescue coordination centre of Rome ordered the Liberian-flagged tanker M/V SALAMIS to take the migrants back to Libya when it was close to the Libyan coast. However, FRA\u2019s report also concluded that none of the neighbouring coastal states in North Africa provide effective protection to people seeking asylum. It found that national authorities in such countries still do not have the capacity or willingness to adjudicate asylum claims in accordance with international standards. On 7 August the Maltese government announced that Italy had agreed to take the migrants and the tanker would head for Syracuse in Sicily.

It is one of the worst such disasters to occur off the Italian coast in recent years. \tEach year, hundreds of men, women and children board overcrowded and ill-equipped boats in an attempt to reach Europe. They may be fleeing violence and persecution or seeking improved opportunities for themselves and their families. Many do not survive the trip, never reaching their destination, as the recent example off the coast of the Italian island of Lampedusa stands testament. \tFRA\u2019s report \u2018Fundamental rights at Europe\u2019s southern sea borders\u2019 looked at the deficiencies, promising practices and challenges of protecting fundamental rights at the EU\u2019s southern sea borders. It described the hazardous journey and deaths at sea, discussed current maritime surveillance mechanisms and cooperation with third countries, and detailed the treatment of migrants when they arrive on shore. \tThe report noted that such hazardous crossings began in the late 1980s, when European countries tightened immigration policies, making it more difficult to enter such countries in a regular way. Since then, the EU has established common rules on border management and also offered, through Frontex, the EU\u2019s border agency, operational support to EU Member States. \tNonetheless, as the report findings show migrants who put their lives at risk by crossing the sea in unseaworthy boats to reach southern Europe represent an alarming and unresolved chink in the EU\u2019s protection of core rights of individuals. This underlines why all possible efforts should be made to reduce the need for people to take such a dangerous journey. This could include reinforcing EU efforts to strengthen protection of migrants waiting to leave for Europe in so-called \u2018transit\u2019 countries in close collaboration with the UN. Such efforts should focus on establishing effective asylum systems. In addition, the European Asylum Support Office should use its mandate to cooperate with third countries with a view to supporting their asylum and reception systems as well as implement actions aimed at finding durable solutions for refugees. \tAt the same time, there is an urgent need for ensuring that when the new Eurosur surveillance system will be established, Member States do their utmost to maximise its life-saving potential by facilitating the early detection \u2013 and hence early rescue - of boats in distress at sea, thus making it possible to avoid the tragic loss of life in cases such as Lampedusa. Eurosur will be a platform for exchanging information and cooperation between Member States and Frontex. It will have two objectives: combatting irregular immigration; as well as protecting and saving the lives of migrants. \t\u00a0", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2013/tragic-reminder-coast-italy-europes-need-address-asylum-and-migration"}, {"id": "FRA_PR_0100", "date": "2013-11-08", "text_type": "PR", "title": "Combating antisemitism: more targeted measures needed", "text": "\u00a0 Results: Full report Press pack Interactive national data - survey results data explorer Factsheet on findings in Dutch, English, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Latvian, Swedish Video messages\u00a0by Martin Schulz, President of the European Parliament, Herman Van Rompuy, President of the European Council, Morten Kjaerum, FRA Director\u00a0 This report, which covers responses from 5,847 Jewish people in the eight countries in which some 90% of the estimated Jewish population in the EU live, will thus be a vital tool for EU decision makers and community groups to develop targeted legal and policy measures. \u201cAntisemitism is a disturbing example of how prejudice can persist through the centuries, and it has no place in our society today. It is particularly distressing to see that the internet, which should be a tool for communication and dialogue, is being used as an instrument of antisemitic harassment,\u201d said FRA Director Morten Kjaerum. \u201cWhile many EU governments have made great efforts to combat antisemitism, more targeted measures are needed.\u201d Key findings: 66% of respondents consider antisemitism to be a major problem in their countries, while 76% said the situation had become more acute over the last five years. 21% of all respondents have experienced an antisemitic incident or incidents involving verbal insult, harassment or a physical attack in the 12 months preceding the survey. 2% of respondents had been victims of an antisemitic physical attack over the previous year. Under-reporting: 76% of victims of antisemitic harassment did not report the most serious incident to the police or any other organisation. Under-recording: limited data-collection mechanisms in many EU Member States mean that antisemitic attacks remain under-recorded. Antisemitism is considered the fourth most-pressing social or political issue across the countries surveyed, below unemployment, the state of the economy, and concerns about government corruption (see Table 1 in report). Three-quarters of respondents consider online antisemitism to be a problem (see table below). \t\t\u00a0 Assessment of manifestations of antisemitism according to country (% of respondents who said that a given form of antisemitism is \u2018a very big problem\u2019 or \u2018a fairly big problem\u2019 in the country) \u00a0 BE DE FR HU IT LV SE UK Average of 8 countries (%) Antisemitism on the internet 85 67 85 86 87 52 68 64 75 Antisemitism in the media 70 40 71 73 59 37 54 52 59 Expressions of hostility towards Jews in the street or other public places 74 48 84 72 30 16 51 35 54 Desecration of Jewish cemeteries 42 46 74 79 41 56 34 35 50 Antisemitic graffiti 52 30 69 69 61 21 29 26 45 Vandalism of Jewish buildings and institutions 54 33 78 52 43 23 30 31 45 Antisemitism in political life 51 30 50 84 36 35 41 34 44 The survey also showed significant differences between countries, which frequently demonstrates their differing histories and traditions, and also patterns of immigration in recent decades. For example, In the UK, 9% of respondents said they had often heard the statement \u201cJews are responsible for the current economic crisis,\u201d while this figure rose to 59% for Hungary. The survey found that while in Latvia only 8% of survey respondents said the Israeli-Arab conflict had a large impact on how safe they felt, the figure rose to 28% for Germany and was as high as 73% in France. In response to the findings of the survey, FRA has formulated a number of suggestions for decision makers, including: EU Member States need to record Jewish people\u2019s experiences of fundamental rights violations effectively and comprehensively. Public figures should publically condemn antisemitic statements. The EU and its Member States must work urgently to find effective ways of combating the growing phenomenon of online antisemitism, for example exploring the option of establishing specialised police units that monitor and investigate hate crime on the internet, as well as encouraging reporting of antisemitic web content to the police. Background: hate crime Antisemitic attacks are a form of hate crime. Today\u2019s survey report is published together with FRA's annual antisemitism overview, which brings together statistical data on antisemitic incidents collected by governmental and non-governmental sources. Together, the two reports complement the Agency\u2019s considerable body of work on hate crime. This includes data on the experiences of groups such as lesbian, gays, bisexual and transgender people, Roma and other ethnic minorities.

Member States are taking measures to ensure that victims have access to confidential victim support services; The impact of budget cuts on education, healthcare and social services for vulnerable groups, such as children; Roma continue to face discrimination and social exclusion, with many living in deep poverty and lacking access to healthcare and decent housing; The EU is driving forward efforts to reform the EU\u2019s data protection framework, the most far\u2011reaching reform of EU data protection laws in 20 years; The EU pushed ahead with the increased use of databases and IT tools for border management and visa processing, and successfully negotiated asylum instruments which were under review. Following the implementation of the Return Directive, many EU Member States have introduced alternatives to detention in national law. However, figures indicate that alternatives are being used effectively only in some countries in practice. In others, detention remains the most frequent measure taken for persons in return procedures; Some Member States took further measures to combat racism and xenophobia through criminal law. These included ensuring that the criminal code better recognises crimes motivated by racism, xenophobia and related intolerances, or through introducing enhanced penalties for crimes motivated by such biases. As 2012 was Year of Active Ageing the EU also focused on the challenges and obstacles facing older people, including those with disabilities.

FRA is seen as accessible and responsive to stakeholders and their needs; respondents are satisfied with the agency's work. Member States appreciate FRA\u2019s work at the EU level. However, they believe FRA should increase its relevance and visibility nationally.

The agency\u2019s Fundamental Rights Platform (FRP) is acknowledged as an effective cooperation channel between FRA and civil society. This evaluation process is required by FRA\u2019s Founding Regulation, which states that FRA must carry out an external evaluation five years after its creation. Ramboll, the independent external evaluator, interviewed over 300 of FRA\u2019s key partners and stakeholders - either online, by phone or face-to-face. Questions were asked about the impact of the agency\u2019s work, its efficiency and effectiveness, EU added value and coherence. The FRA Management Board received Ramboll\u2019s evaluation report at the end of last year. The board made recommendations based on the evaluation, which were recently presented to the European Commission and the Council of the EU.

The results underline the need to promote and protect fundamental rights for LGBT people so they too can live their lives with dignity. \u201cEveryone should feel free to be themselves at home, work, at school and in public \u2013 but clearly, LGBT people often don\u2019t. Results from FRA\u2019s survey show that fear, isolation and discrimination are common in Europe\u2019s LGBT community,\u201d says FRA Director Morten Kjaerum. \u201cWe need EU-wide action to break down the barriers, eliminate the hate and create a society where everyone can fully enjoy their rights, no matter what their sexual orientation or gender identity is.\u201d Some of the difficulties many LGBT people face include: Schooling: 2 out of 3 LGBT respondents were hiding or disguising being LGBT at school. At least 60% personally experienced negative comments or conduct at school because they were LGBT while over 80% in every EU Member State recall negative comments or bullying of LGBT youth at school. Therefore, Member States need to ensure LGBT students feel safe at school as this is where negative LGBT experiences, societal prejudices and exclusion often begin. This could include LGBT awareness campaigns for teachers and pupils and policies against homophobic bullying. Work: 19% of respondents felt discriminated against at work or when looking for a job, despite legal protection under EU law. This underlines the need for EU-wide action to counter the many obstacles LGBT people face to their basic rights in their everyday life. Fear: 26% of LGBT people who answered the survey had been attacked or threatened with violence in the last five years. 66% of respondents across all EU Member States were scared of holding hands in public with a same-sex partner. For gay and bisexual men respondents it was about 75%. This shows that LGBT victims need recognition and protection EU-wide and nationally to counter harassment and hate crime that results in LGBT people living in fear. This could include police training and victim support services as well as laws against hate speech and hate crime. The survey also reveals that transgender people are the most affected among LGBT respondents to have personally felt discriminated against, particularly in employment and healthcare. About 30% said they were victims of violence or threats of violence more than three times in the year before the survey. High levels of under-reporting of instances of discrimination and hate crime were also detected. This is despite 56% of respondents being aware of laws against discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity. Half of all victims of violence and harassment felt that the police would do nothing. This pattern is not unique to the LGBT group researched. FRA found such under-reporting also in other groups, for instance, among members of ethnic minorities (See FRA hate crime reports, 2012). The survey asked LGBT people whether they had experienced discrimination, violence, verbal abuse or hate speech on the grounds of their sexual orientation or gender identity. They were also asked to identify where such incidents took place, such as at school, work, when seeking healthcare or in public places. The analysis of the survey findings are contained in two reports. They will feed into discussions in the EU and Member States on legislation and policies to improve the situation for LGBT people. To read the report, see: EU LGBT Survey results: at a glance, which breaks down the key findings with simple graphs.

A final chapter is devoted to sea operations coordinated by the EU\u2019s border control agency (Frontex), and to EU solidarity mechanisms. European Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m: \u201cI very much welcome FRA\u2019s report on fundamental rights issues at the EU\u2019s southern sea borders. It identifies the difficulties migrants face during their journey and the serious and urgent challenges they come up against after their arrival. The right to life and respect for the principle of non-refoulement are core fundamental rights, and the European Union as well as Member States must do everything they can to ensure these rights are implemented to the full. FRA\u2019s report provides concrete proposals on how this can be achieved.\u201d While many reports discussing this issue focus on a particular incident at just one border crossing, FRA has collected exhaustive data on the four countries to which the majority of migrant boats arrive (Spain, Italy, Greece and Malta). Sources included border guards, fishermen, and migrants themselves. The large scope of the research and broad range of interview partners enabled FRA to list promising as well as bad practices, and indicate where policymakers need to act in order to increase the fundamental rights protection of migrants when they arrive in the EU. \u201cThe EU and its Member States must ensure that border surveillance and management, while necessary, are not detrimental to the fundamental rights of migrants arriving at our shores,\u201d said FRA Director Morten Kjaerum. \u201cThere are many reasons for people to venture the journey to Europe. Some are making use of their fundamental right to seek refuge from persecution in their home countries; some are looking for a better life for themselves and their families; and some, particularly women and girls, are being trafficked against their will. But whatever the context of their arrival, we expect migrants entering the EU to be afforded the same rights and treated with the same dignity accorded to any other person.\u201d\u00a0 There have been considerable changes in the patterns of migration by sea over the last 10 years. Arrivals rose significantly in 2011 following the Arab Spring, before dropping again in 2012: Figure 1: Data trends (2001\u20132012) for Greece, Spain, Italy and Malta \u00a0FRA\u2019s new report makes a total of 50 suggestions, targeted at EU and national policymakers, on means of improving fundamental rights protection at the EU\u2019s sea borders. These include: The EU should develop clear guidance on where to disembark migrants intercepted or rescued at sea, particularly for Frontex-coordinated operations. This guidance must include a ban on the return of migrants to third countries if this could put them in danger of inhuman or degrading treatment.\u00a0\u00a0 The planned border surveillance platform Eurosur has life-saving potential, as it is likely to be able to provide information on boats or people in grave danger and requiring immediate assistance. This potential must be fully utilised.\u00a0 Practical steps need to be taken by those using the Eurosur system to avoid the unintentional storing and sharing of personal data. An existing safeguard against the sharing of information with third countries, which could expose migrants to the risk of inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, must be translated into practice. Frontex has recently taken significant steps towards protecting fundamental rights. However, there are still aspects that remain to be addressed, for example paying greater attention to fundamental rights in the pre-deployment briefings given to officers before each operation. It is important to ensure that practical training for border officers fully integrates fundamental rights issues from the very beginning, particularly the knowledge that returning a person to persecution, torture or other serious harm is prohibited.\u00a0 Fundamental rights expertise should be brought in at key stages of the planning, implementation and evaluation of projects using funds that the EU provides for the management of external borders.\u00a0 >> The full report can be downloaded here: Fundamental rights at the EU's southern sea borders Notes to editors: The principle of non-refoulement bans the return of individuals to countries in which they could face persecution, torture or other serious harm.

FRA will also be presenting a new report that looks at the practical barriers to accessing justice in discrimination cases. \u201cThe crisis is putting existing structures, including our justice systems, under increased pressure\u201d, says Martin Schulz, President of the European Parliament. \u201cWhile we are all in a prolonged global economic slowdown that forces governments to stringent\u00a0 budgetary cuts, those values guaranteed in the Lisbon Treaty should in no way be undermined\u201d, says Loucas Louca, the Cypriot Minister of Justice and Public Order. Senior decision makers, practitioners and experts will come together at the conference to examine existing policies and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of different judicial systems and their financing mechanisms. They will also identify how the crisis can be turned into an opportunity for reform by exchanging promising practices and innovative solutions that could feed future policy developments, such as the EU\u2019s upcoming review of its non-discrimination laws. \u201cAs times grow harder, more and more Europeans are in a vulnerable situation. Unemployment in the EU is at its highest rate in well over a decade, and with this and stagnating wage growth in many countries, poverty and social exclusion are rising,\u201d says FRA Director Morten Kjaerum. \u201cIn times of crisis, the search for scapegoats can lead to xenophobia and other fundamental rights violations. So more help in access to justice is needed, not less. Indeed, cutting back during these difficult times not only exposes more people to human rights violations, but is also short sighted. Safeguarding access to justice for all must be a key consideration in any discussion of potential budget cuts\u201d. The new FRA report, \u2018Access to justice in cases of discrimination in the EU \u2013 Steps to further equality\u2019, examines the process of seeking justice in discrimination cases in eight EU Member States, based on fieldwork interviews. It highlights a number of the practical barriers faced by complainants and suggests some solutions. The proposals include: Simplifying overly complex complaint systems; Ensuring that non-judicial mechanisms are made more use of, as they can improve access to justice while potentially reducing the overall cost of the justice system; Stipulating minimum support structures for victims such as legal advice and guidance, as well as counsellors for psychological support; Raising awareness on equality and diversity to build a fundamental rights culture in which no justified claims are discouraged. The report also gives examples of how various Member States are already working to overcome difficulties in accessing justice.

The meeting discussed the draft Council Directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment between all persons. The report finds that in such cases, people and their legal advisors often have difficulties in bringing a complaint of discrimination on \u2018multiple\u2019 grounds to court. This is either because of a poor understanding of \u2018multiple\u2019 discrimination, or because legally it is simply easier to deal with a complaint on only one particular ground.\u00a0 \u201cTo ensure that everyone is treated equally when accessing their basic rights, legislation and healthcare systems need to reflect the complexity of real people\u2019s lives,\u201d says FRA Director Morten Kjaerum. \u201cPeople are not just characterised for example by their gender, but also by their age, ethnicity, or disability. Anti-discrimination laws should be changed to allow victims of multiple discrimination to take their cases to court. Anti-discrimination training for healthcare staff is also needed to ensure that people are treated according to their needs, no matter who they are.\u201d\u00a0 The report shows that:\u00a0 Uneven protection and legal ambiguity make it hard for \u2018multiple\u2019 discrimination cases to be brought to court. In healthcare, EU anti-discrimination law protects against racial and sexual discrimination, but not against discrimination for age, disability or sexual orientation. In addition, only 6 of the 27 EU Member States address \u2018multiple\u2019 discrimination in their national laws, often with unclear definitions. Providing equal protection in healthcare against discrimination on all grounds would be an important first step towards effectively addressing \u2018multiple\u2019 discrimination. This issue is addressed in the \u2018horizontal directive\u2019, a piece of legislation currently under discussion at EU level that would extend protection against discrimination beyond the area of employment to cover the grounds of religion or belief, disability, age and sexual orientation. Lawyers often do not file healthcare complaints as discrimination cases, due to lower compensation compared to, for example medical malpractice suits. For existing anti-discrimination laws to be effective, courts need to award dissuasive and proportionate compensation for discrimination cases. This would encourage more people, and their lawyers, to bring discrimination cases - including \u2018multiple\u2019 discrimination - to court. Low levels of awareness of how and where to complain makes access to justice difficult. Victims are often uncertain where to turn to for help: either health complaint bodies or equality bodies which are responsible for ensuring equal treatment for all citizens. In addition, there are low levels of trust in the effectiveness of existing complaint systems in healthcare as well as fear that filing a complaint will lead to worse treatment by healthcare staff. A single equality body for all areas of discrimination, including \u2018multiple\u2019 discrimination, combined with better coordination with health complaints bodies, would greatly improve access to justice.\u00a0 Healthcare systems do not always consider the varied needs of healthcare users. Healthcare systems may (unintentionally) create barriers in access to healthcare or provide healthcare of different quality to people who share more than one protected trait, such as sex, age or membership of a minority group. Governments and health authorities can improve the situation by actively encouraging anti-discrimination training for health professionals, and by taking positive action to support and empowering people at risk of \u2018multiple\u2019 discrimination; for example by making information more readily available through language and mediation services and through outreach activities. Current health statistics are insufficient to accurately assess the extent of disadvantage of groups that share multiple characteristics. Data facilitate the development of evidence-based and thus more effective policy measures. It is important to develop instruments providing robust and comparable data that can show the true extent of disadvantage in healthcare concerning the different grounds of discrimination. The report looks at how \u2018multiple\u2019 discrimination is legally addressed and examines relevant case law with a special focus on healthcare. It also explores health users\u2019 and professionals\u2019 views and experiences on how people of different gender, age, disability and ethnic origin experience discrimination and multiple discrimination when accessing the health system in Austria, Czech Republic, Italy, Sweden and the UK.

She may then face discrimination because of the combination of being Roma and being a woman.

Greater political will is needed on the part of decision makers to counter pervasive prejudice against certain groups and compensate for the damage. Victims and witnesses should therefore be encouraged to report such crimes, and legislation should be adopted at the EU and national levels obliging Member States to collect and publish hate-crime data. This would serve to acknowledge victims of hate crime, in line with requirements stemming from the case law of the European Court of Human Rights. To hold perpetrators better to account, legislators should also consider enhanced penalties for hate crimes to stress the severity of these offences, while courts rendering judgments should address bias motivations publicly, making it clear that they lead to harsher sentences. \u201cHate crimes create an \u2018us and them\u2019 mentality that does tremendous psychological damage\u201d, says FRA Director Morten Kjaerum. \u201cThey undermine the basic democratic tenets of equality and non-discrimination. Hate crimes thus harm not only the victim, but also other people belonging to the same group \u2013 many of whom are terrified that they will become the next target \u2013 and society as a whole. To counter this, the EU and its Member States need to ensure both that such crimes are made visible, and that offenders are made to answer for the damage they have done\u201d. A new FRA report entitled Making hate crime visible in the European Union: acknowledging victims\u2019 rights outlines a fundamental rights approach to hate crime and offers a comparative analysis of official data collection mechanisms on hate crime in the EU Member States.

The report shows that every fourth person (24\u00a0%) of the 23,500 respondents to the EU-MIDIS survey \u2013 the first EU-wide survey to specifically sample ethnic minority and immigrant groups on their perception of racially or ethnically motivated crime \u2013 said they had been a victim of crime at least once in the 12 months preceding the survey.

The EU adopted key legislative and policy measures in, for example, the areas of victim protection, human trafficking and the integration of Roma. Various EU Member States, among other steps, reformed their child protection systems and made efforts to shorten the length of court proceedings. Challenges, however, remain. The year 2011 sent stark and tragic reminders of how far the excesses of extreme intolerance can go if left unchecked. Equality and non-discrimination will therefore remain core concerns. The EU and its Member States must also remain on guard to ensure that prevailing economic weakness does not threaten the fulfilment of the fundamental rights of EU citizens. \"In these difficult economic times, the EU must guarantee more than ever that there is no rollback on fundamental rights protection.

The main problems include: Laws and policies that do not enable people with disabilities to live independently; Negative attitudes and prejudice that do not recognise the contribution people with disabilities make to society; Lack of employment opportunities resulting in reliance on state support and benefits. The report shows that for independent living to be successful, deinstitutionalisation needs to be coupled with social policy reform in education, healthcare, employment and personal support options. People with disabilities have to be involved in the development of these policies. \"People at the ministries and authorities should talk to people like me when they develop legislation and policy. They should ask us what we want and need, and not make our lives more difficult.\" (Man, 32, Bulgaria, interviewed during the research) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.\u00a0 Report: Involuntary placement and involuntary treatment of persons with mental health problems The second FRA report underlines that the laws regulating involuntary placement or treatment must consider fundamental rights in accordance with the CRPD. Although all EU Member States have minimum safeguards in place, FRA fieldwork points to overwhelmingly negative experiences of involuntary placement or treatment due to a: Lack of information and discussion about the process and their situation when they could have been consulted leading to a lack of control over what was happening to them; Feeling of fear and humiliation during treatment. Voluntary placement and treatments were viewed more positively. Both FRA reports provide a basis for EU and Member States' discussions on how to protect and fulfil the rights of people with disabilities, and can be used to support them in fulfilling their obligations under the CRPD. For the full reports see: Involuntary placement and involuntary treatment of persons with mental health problems\u00a0 Choice and control: the right to independent living - Experiences of persons with intellectual disabilities and persons with mental health problems in nine EU Member States Notes to the editors: The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), which entered into force in May 2008 has since been ratified by 21 EU Member States and the EU itself. This is the first legally binding international human rights instrument to which the EU is party. The CRPD requires signatories, among other responsibilities, to make independent living a reality for all people with disabilities, and to support them participating in the community on an equal basis with everyone else. Mental health problems can affect a person's thoughts, body, feelings, and behaviour. They include depression, bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness), attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, schizophrenia, and conduct disorder. Intellectual disability is a permanent condition characterised by significantly lower than average intellectual ability, resulting in limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour. It is usually present from birth or develops before the age of 18. Examples include: Asperger Syndrome, autism and Down Syndrome. The nine countries covered in the Choice and control report are: Bulgaria, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Romania, Sweden and the UK. The Involuntary placement and treatment report provides a comparative law analysis of 27 EU Member States along with personal experiences from the nine countries covered in the Choice and Control report.

But in practice these rights are often violated,\" says FRA Director, Morten Kjaerum, on the occasion of International Women's Day on 8 March. \"In addition, since discrimination can take many forms, as FRA research has shown, many women face multiple discrimination because, for example, of their gender and ethnic background or because of their gender and their age.\" The FRA conducts independent research into many areas of fundamental rights. This means that the Agency looks at a number of factors that impact on people's lives and their enjoyment of rights. Rather than look at gender in isolation, the Agency looks at gender alongside factors such as ethnicity and age, and as such has identified how the rights of women are violated in a way that is often exacerbated by other forms of discrimination: Women with disabilities can experience unequal access to reproductive healthcare. For example, health professionals do not always talk to those women directly but prefer to communicate with their carers. Reproductive rights may also be denied. There is evidence of women with intellectual disabilities and women with mental health problems as being victims of forced sterilisation in some EU Member States. Migrant women often face considerable discrimination and are over-represented in poorly regulated and poorly paid sectors of employment, such as domestic work. As domestic workers are mostly women, they are often vulnerable to specific forms of gender-based violence and racial discrimination. In addition, their irregular migration status means they are often not entitled to basic rights under national law such as healthcare (For more, see FRA report on access to healthcare for irregular migrants). Violence against women continues to be a problem and policy makers lack comparable cross-national data to help tackle the issue. The FRA is currently interviewing over 40,000 women across the EU to document their experiences of violence at home and at work, including stalking and experiences in childhood. The survey has been developed over the course of two years, with input from leading experts, as well as the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). In an effort to reflect and understand the diversity of women's experiences, the data will compare findings across Member States, taking into account differences according to factors such as age, employment and education.

The surveys have documented the situation on the ground. The results provide policy makers with the necessary evidence for designing effective policy responses to address the situation. The survey results have fed into the European Commission's Roma Communication which will also be presented in Brussels on 23 May 2012. Video interview with FRA expert on Roma issues, Michail Beis: \tNotes to the editors: The FRA and the UNDP surveys interviewed in total 22,203 Roma and non-Roma providing information on 84,287 household members in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Spain. Interviews were carried out face-to-face in Roma and non-Roma respondents' homes, all living close by and therefore sharing similar infrastructure and labour market conditions. This report presents the first results of the surveys based on an analysis of a small part of the available data, which will be published later in thematic reports. These and future surveys will provide decision makers with the necessary evidence for designing effective policies, supporting the European Commission's Communication of April 2011 on an EU Framework for national Roma integration strategies up to 2020. The Commission Communication asked the FRA to continue monitoring the situation and to act jointly with EU Member States, by providing assistance in putting in place robust monitoring mechanisms that can measure progress over time in a comparative way. Both surveys used a common core questionnaire. The FRA survey focused on human rights issues, such as discrimination and rights awareness. The FRA will conduct two more surveys in the coming years till 2020 to identify trends over time and across countries. The UNDP/World Bank/European Commission survey looked deeper into the socio-economic situation of Roma in the selected EU countries and non-EU countries of south-eastern Europe. The survey provides baselines for the new Roma integration strategies and allows for looking at the dynamics of the Roma inclusion processes, compared with 2004 when the UNDP implemented a similar survey. The work carried out by the UNDP in partnership with the World Bank was funded by the European Commission Directorate-General for Regional Policy, as well as core resources of the UNDP and the Nordic Trust Fund at the World Bank. EU Member States have developed national strategies for Roma integration. Local authorities should engage with both Roma and non-Roma in their\u00a0communities to implement these plans, building trust, developing social cohesion, and combating discrimination and anti-Gypsyism.

Two to four million migrants in Europe live in an \u2018irregular' situation. They often face increased risk to their health from poor living and working conditions. At the same time their access to healthcare is limited due to legal, economic and practical obstacles. Excluding migrants in an irregular situation from healthcare endangers their lives and well-being, increases the cost of future emergency treatment and, when infectious diseases go untreated, poses a health risk to the wider community. FRA Director Morten Kjaerum: \"The right to healthcare is guaranteed under international and European human rights law. These standards apply to everyone regardless of their migration status. Although this does not oblige EU Member States to guarantee access to all health services on an equal footing with citizens it does impose some minimum requirements. At the very least, this should include access to necessary medical care for all, equal access to healthcare for children, and antenatal and postnatal healthcare for mothers.\" All 10 EU Member States covered in the study grant migrants in an irregular situation access to emergency healthcare. However, the report identifies several obstacles to accessing healthcare: Irregular migrants - who are not usually permitted to work - may have to pay for medical care, which is available cost-free to nationals. Only five Member States offer emergency care free of charge to irregular migrants if they cannot afford it (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Spain). Only four Member States allow them access to treatment beyond emergency healthcare cost-free or at a reduced rate (Belgium, France, Italy and Spain). The cost barrier also affects vulnerable groups: All the Member States studied allow pregnant women access to treatment for delivery, but in some countries payment may be required. Full cost-free access to antenatal and postnatal care is granted in four Member States (Belgium, France, Greece and Italy). In only two of the Member States studied are migrant children in an irregular situation entitled by law to receive cost-free healthcare on the same basis as nationals (Spain and Greece). The risk of possible deportation deters irregular migrants from seeking even emergency healthcare. In some EU Member States, a policy or practice exists of reporting irregular migrants to immigration authorities when they access healthcare. Administrative requirements can make it difficult for migrants in an irregular situation to access health care even if, in theory, it is available cost-free. For example, the need to produce proof of a fixed residence. Video interview with\u00a0FRA Programme Manager Ludovica Banfi\u00a0on the new report: The report suggests several\u00a0ways forward: Access to necessary healthcare should be made available to irregular migrants on the same basis as nationals. This should include the same rules relating to payment of fees and exemption from payments. Administrative pre-conditions, such as producing proof of residence, should be reviewed. Healthcare authorities should not be placed under a duty to report migrants in an irregular situation to immigration authorities, and such practices should be discontinued. Pregnant women in an irregular situation should have access to cost-free healthcare services for antenatal and postnatal care, and for delivery. Children in an irregular situation should have the same access to healthcare as citizens, including immunisations. Where access to healthcare exists, awareness should be raised about the rights of irregular migrants among medical staff and institutions and irregular migrants themselves. Support should be given to non-governmental organisations, as these play an important role in facilitating access to healthcare for irregular migrants.

The 2011 Fundamental Rights Conference is organised by the FRA with the support of the Polish Presidency of the Council of the European Union and is taking place in Warsaw on 21-22 November 2011. The event brings together about 300 policy makers, practitioners and experts from across the EU and provides a forum to support the development of policies to improve fundamental rights for irregular migrants. FRA Director Morten Kjaerum: \"We employ irregular migrants as cheap domestic workers to clean our homes. We eat the fruits and vegetables that they pick. But despite their contribution to our societies, when irregular migrants try to access healthcare or education services, or try to seek justice in case of abuse, they often face a closed door or, worse, deportation. Human rights belong to all human beings. And we remain human beings even if we do not have a passport, or a visa or a residence permit.\" The FRA's main findings highlight the following challenges: Irregular migrants are often prevented from accessing education and healthcare for a number of reasons: (1)\u00a0Access to necessary healthcare for children and pregnant women, and emergency medical treatment is often not available to irregular migrants on the same cost-free basis as for nationals. (2) Requirements to produce official documents, such as residence permits or medical certificates, often prevent irregular migrant children from accessing public schools. (3) Detection measures and reporting practices. These include law enforcement operations near schools or hospitals, and reporting duties or practices of education and healthcare providers, and courts, which may inform immigration authorities of irregular migrants using their services. Irregular migrants, who are vulnerable to exploitation in the workplace, are often prevented from getting access to justice because they may have no right to remain in the country to take legal action. Some irregular migrants find themselves in a situation of \u2018legal limbo' where legal or practical obstacles prevent authorities from enforcing a decision to return them. In such cases, they are often given no official status and, consequently, cannot access basic rights. The report suggests several measures which could help to improve the situation: Access to necessary healthcare should be made available to irregular migrants on the same basis as nationals, including rules relating to payment of and exemption from fees. Pregnant women should have cost-free access to ante and post natal care and care during delivery, and children should have the same access to healthcare as nationals. Irregular migrant children should be entitled to enrol for free primary education. Healthcare and education providers and the courts should not be placed under a duty to report irregular migrants to immigration authorities. Where such practices exist, they should be discontinued. Law enforcement authorities should not conduct operations that directly discourage migrants' access to fundamental rights such as patrolling at education and healthcare facilities. Building on the Employers Sanctions Directive, effective mechanisms should be put in place to allow access to justice in practice for irregular migrants. The role of non-governmental organisations and trade unions which help irregular migrants to overcome practical barriers to access healthcare, education and access to justice, should be recognised and supported by national authorities. \u00a0 The Fundamental Rights Agency publishes: 'Fundamental rights of migrants in an irregular situation in the European Union' (November 2011) See also on irregular migrants: Migrants in an irregular situation employed in domestic work: Fundamental rights challenges for the European Union and its Member States (July 2011) Migrants in an irregular situation: access to healthcare in 10 European Union Member States (October 2011) Notes to the editors: This report relates specifically to migrants in an irregular situation.

However, FRA research shows that in practice there are a number of barriers to this.\" For example, 22 of the 27 EU Member States apply the rule that the losing side in a court case should pay the legal costs of the winning side. The risk of losing puts victims off bringing cases, even if they have a strong claim. The report reveals several problems that result in victims being deterred or unable to enforce their rights by taking cases to court: excessive length of proceedings appears to be the most frequent challenge across Member States; high legal costs including lawyers' fees and court fees; restrictive rules on who may take a case to court. This is often limited to the victim, rather than allowing other bodies to bring cases, such as non-governmental organisations, trade unions or national equality bodies; a high degree of variation among Member States on the amounts of compensation awarded, which in some cases appear too low to act as a deterrent or fully compensate for the harm suffered. The report also finds promising practices in some Member States, such as: expedited procedures insurance covering legal fees legal advice centres or pro bono work offering victims free legal advice and representation simple procedures where victims can represent themselves alternatives to going to court to settle disputes, such as mediation or other non-judicial mechanisms generous rules of legal standing allowing non-governmental organisations or other interested and specialised bodies to bring claims Related FRA publications on this issue: Access to effective remedies: the asylum-seeker perspective (2010)\u00a0 EU-MIDIS Data in focus 3: Rights awareness (2010) Find the full report here: Access to justice in Europe: an overview of challenges and opportunities For more background information, see national thematic studies.

This is reinforced by the ILO Convention Concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers, which was adopted in June 2011, and which applies to all domestic workers.\" He continued: \"It is up to the governments to decide what labour force to bring into a country from abroad. But once a person is in the country and employed in spite of being in an irregular situation, core labour law and human rights standards must apply. In practice, the fear of deportation or dismissal deters victims of abuse or exploitation from going to court. Because possible deportation is the price of access to justice, often those who mistreat irregular domestic workers go unpunished.\" The report is based on in-depth interviews with domestic workers, civil society organisations and trade unions from across ten EU Member States and covers their enjoyment of fundamental rights in five areas: working conditions, dismissal, freedom of association, redress mechanisms and family life. Main findings: Domestic work undertaken by employees is typically less regulated by legal standards and enforcement mechanisms (such as labour inspectorates) than other forms of employment. Domestic work is typically carried out by women - and often migrant women in an irregular situation - who are vulnerable to multiple discrimination because of gender-based forms of violence, including sexual assault, as well as racial discrimination. They typically work for long hours and low pay. Rest periods, paid holidays, and paid sick leave are often not provided, even if available under legislation. A number of physical and mental occupational illnesses were reported, which are exacerbated by the situation of irregular migrants. The threat or fear of dismissal, lack of affordable health care, and lack of paid sick leave was found to deter individuals from seeking medical assistance or taking time to recover - even where injury resulted from work accidents. This sometimes leads to chronic injuries or permanent disability. Individuals seeking access to justice for exploitation or abuse face several barriers. Principally they are deterred by the fear of public bodies alerting the immigration authorities, who may then deport them. Because their employment is often not formalised through a written contract, they also face difficulties in producing evidence of an employment relationship. Similarly, because they work in a domestic context, it can be challenging to prove alleged abuse, for example through a witness. The report suggests several ways forward, including: The introduction for all domestic workers of clear standards that: impose limits on payments in kind; ensure that where a minimum wage exists in national law, it also covers domestic workers; guarantee rest and sick leave; and create safe and healthy working conditions, as provided for by the ILO Convention adopted in June 2011. Extending supervision by labour inspection authorities to the domestic work sector. The introduction of targeted migration programmes where demand for domestic work is found to exist, which is not met by the available workforce. This would ensure that these workers have a regular migration status and so can enjoy better protection. Facilitate access to justice by ensuring greater support for trade unions and non-governmental organisations which play a key role in providing legal assistance for victims of abuse or exploitation.

A person who performs domestic work only occasionally or sporadically and not on an occupational basis is not a domestic worker. Domestic work typically involves providing care for children, the elderly, or persons with disabilities, and housekeeping tasks including cleaning, cooking and shopping. It may also include gardening as well as driving and supplying security services to private households (although these are not covered in the report). It can be live-in (where the worker resides within the employer's household) or live-out. This report relates specifically to \u2018irregular migrants' employed in domestic work. This refers to individuals who are not nationals of an EU Member State and are present in an EU Member State without a visa or a residence permit. It does not include individuals who have permission to reside in a Member State, but do not have permission to work. The ILO (International Labour Organisation) Convention Concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers, and its accompanying Recommendation, were adopted on 16 June 2011. These new instruments are aimed at improving the working conditions of domestic workers worldwide.http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/press-and-media-centre/videos/events-coverage/WCMS_157933/lang--en/index.htm The ten EU Member States selected for the study were: Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Spain and Sweden.

Major fundamental rights challenges in 2010 included barriers in the way of getting access to justice, high levels of discrimination, as well as violence against children. The EU and its Member States must also face up to the marginalisation of the Roma, inadequate conditions for asylum seekers in particular at the EU's external borders, and threats to the protection of personal data.\" Asylum and migration 2010 witnessed a fundamental rights emergency at the Greek-Turkish land border, where a large number of irregular border crossings into the EU took place. The Greek authorities have encountered significant difficulties in providing reception conditions that comply with fundamental rights standards, and in ensuring that migrants in need of protection have a fair chance to apply for asylum. The European Court of Human Rights has found detention conditions for migrants in Greece to violate Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits torture and inhuman and degrading treatment. Member States experiencing high pressure migration will have difficulties in implementing their fundamental rights obligations, unless all Member States share responsibility through a Common European Asylum System, which is due to be completed by 2012 and will, therefore, require significant progress in 2011. The Roma Roma experience lower levels of employment, poor housing conditions, barriers to health care and segregation in education systems. This prevents the Roma from enjoying a standard of living comparable to that of the general EU population. Efforts at the European and national levels must be stepped up to promote equality and combat discrimination. Through data collection, research and its expertise, the Agency is assisting the European Commission and the Member States to assess the impact of their policies to promote the inclusion of Roma. The report makes a number of suggestions on how to bring about the successful inclusion of Roma communities, such as ensuring that the EU Racial Equality Directive is fully enforced to combat discrimination in employment and access to services. Data Protection The events of 2010 highlight that there is a continuous need to balance the opportunities offered by new technologies to promote freedom of expression, cultural and social life, and free movement, against the potential threat to other rights. Google Street View, for example, attracted attention from law-makers and regulatory bodies in Austria, Germany, Italy, Slovenia and Spain because of the potential threat that it poses to privacy and data protection. Similarly, the EU's Data Retention Directive, which obliges phone and internet companies to collect data about all of their customers' communications, has attracted opposition in several Member States. The constitutional courts of Romania and Germany have barred the application of national laws transposing the directive and the Commission has announced that this legislation is under review.

These positive developments need to be strengthened and stimulated, since discrimination and victimisation still remain far too widespread. At the same time, levels of reporting by victims of racist assaults, threats or serious harassment and awareness of how to access redress mechanisms remains low.\" \"We are convinced that persistent racist and xenophobic speech from public figures and in the media can fuel prejudice and hatred against ethnic minorities and migrants, leading to discrimination in many areas of social and economic life, particularly in access to employment, health care, education, and housing.

People, including pregnant women and families with small children, are held in inhumane conditions,\" FRA Director Morten Kjaerum commented. The situation in the detention centre in Soufli can be taken as an example: on 29 January 2011, the day of the FRA visit, 144 persons were being held in one room measuring about 110m2. There is no heating, and only one toilet and one cold shower are available for all detainees - with outside temperatures of around zero degrees Celsius. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) of the Council of Europe recommends 4m\u00b2 of space per detainee in multi-occupancy accommodation. Nevertheless, no emergency measures have been implemented by the Greek authorities to address the conditions in detention centres in Evros - despite the availability of EU funds. The FRA report identifies a number of factors which contribute to the current crisis, for instance, that everyone - except for persons requiring urgent hospitalisation - is automatically detained, including children and even babies. Coordination of the local response in the Evros region is a key problem. Responsibilities for migration management are divided between four different ministries and allocation of responsibilities at local level is unclear. One obvious way forward in addressing the immediate needs is the development of much stronger coordination mechanisms at a local operational level, which has proven to work effectively in other EU Member States. Data and information for this report were directly collected by FRA staff through interviews with key actors, including people in detention as well as all relevant public authorities, and through direct observation of conditions at the border and inside detention centres; secondary data complemented the field research. The Greek government provided unimpeded access to all detention facilities to the FRA. Frontex provided important assistance in facilitating the field research. Since 2010, Greek external EU land and sea borders account for 90% of all detections of irregular border crossings along all EU external land and sea borders. Daily crossings at the eastern border in Evros reached peaks of up to 350 persons. The largest group of migrants (44%) comes from Afghanistan. In 2010, 45 people lost their lives trying to cross the border in the Evros region (see FRONTEX).

For example, when a North African Muslim woman is denied access to a female doctor in a hospital, she faces a problem not just because she is a Muslim or not just because she is a woman, but because she is a Muslim woman. Most European courts deal only with one ground of discrimination per case. This means that victims of multiple discrimination find it harder to present their case in a court and be compensated for all the different types of discrimination suffered. Introducing the concept of \u2018multiple discrimination' into legislation could as well help to better match the law and a person's every-day complex experiences of discrimination.\" The results of the FRA survey show that one out of four ethnic minority or immigrant respondents in the EU had felt discriminated against on two or more grounds during the 12 months preceding the survey. Having an ethnic or immigrant origin emerged as the most significant ground for experiencing discrimination among the respondents who were surveyed. The grounds of discrimination surveyed are: ethnic or immigrant origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion or belief, disability, or \"other\" reasons as relevant for the respondents. Within the framework of its EU-wide survey on discrimination of immigrants and minorities, EU-MIDIS, the FRA interviewed 23,500 people with an ethnic minority or immigrant background in all 27 EU Member States. Key questions on grounds of discrimination are comparable with results from a Eurobarometer survey of the majority population. Those from ethnic minorities are on average almost five times more likely to experience multiple discrimination than those from the majority of the population. \u2018Visible minorities' - those who generally look different from the majority population - feel discriminated against more often and across a larger number of grounds as compared to other minorities. For example, Roma and people of African origin are more likely to experience discrimination than former Yugoslavians, those with a Russian background, and Central and East Europeans. Gender and age can have an impact on how likely a person is to suffer discrimination: for example, young ethnic minority/immigrant men tend to report high levels of discriminatory treatment. Some 46% of respondents who experience discrimination on different grounds were concentrated in the lowest income quartile recorded for their EU Member State. \u00a0 The Fundamental Rights Agency publishes its first report on multiple discrimination: EU-MIDIS Data in Focus 5: \u2018Multiple Discrimination' (February 2011) This report focuses on perceptions of multiple discrimination experiences by respondents of ethnic or immigrant origin, compared with the general population. The FRA has also analysed multiple discrimination as a part of its reports on: Homophobia and discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity in the EU Member States: Part II - The Social Situation (2009) Housing conditions of Roma and Travellers in the European Union (2009) For further information please contact the FRA Media Team E-mail: media@fra.europa.euTel.: +43 158 030 642 Notes to editors: Defining multiple discrimination: the term \u2018multiple discrimination' can be understood as meaning discrimination on more than one ground in any given situation or time.

Groups that are already vulnerable to human rights violations are also those are mostly affected by HIV. In Europe, these groups include men having sex with men, injecting drug users, sex workers, migrants and prisoners. Therefore, if we want to reduce the likelihood of exposure to HIV transmission for these groups, we need human rights interventions that improve their overall situation. For people already living with HIV, a rights-based approach means creating and enforcing legal protection against discrimination, for example in employment or housing, or facilitating medical treatment during working time.

Sports events therefore provide the ideal platform for fostering inclusion, diversity and mutual respect, while combating racism, discrimination and exclusion. Our research findings show, however, that often this potential is not realised. Instead, incidences of racism and ethnic discrimination continue to affect sports at both professional and amateur levels across the EU. We have to get the ball rolling and tackle this; everybody needs to take up their responsibly in this regard.\" Widening participation in sport In many sports across the European Union, minorities and migrants are underrepresented, especially in the management of sports organisations. Women and girls with an ethnic minority background are particularly underrepresented. More targeted activities by sports governing bodies, federations and clubs are necessary - such as diversity programmes to encourage the participation of migrants and ethnic minorities in sports, and initiatives to remove the barriers to accessing management positions in sports organisations. Monitoring racist incidents in sport Systems monitoring racist incidents in sports only exist in a number of EU Member States. Some are more advanced and capture more racist incidents than others; most available data, however, are related to football. National and local authorities are encouraged to develop effective ways of monitoring racist incidents and discrimination in sport, in close cooperation with sports federations. Equality Bodies and sport The FRA report shows that in at least 16 EU Member States Equality Bodies and other institutions, such as National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs), take action in cases of racist incidents and ethnic discrimination in sport. Equality Bodies and National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) should be more involved in addressing racial discrimination in sport. These bodies could support sports federations and clubs in developing awareness-raising activities. They could provide support to potential victims and, where this is permitted, participate in legal action against perpetrators. The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) has published two reports on racism,ethnic discrimination and exclusion of migrants and minorities in sport in the EU: Racism, ethnic discrimination and exclusion of migrants and minorities in sport: a comparative overview of the situation in the European Union Racism, ethnic discrimination and exclusion of migrants and minorities in sport: the situation in the European Union - Summary Report A Handbook of good practice will be published in 2011 for sports federations, clubs, and players or athletes, with examples of initiatives to combat racism, ethnic discrimination and the exclusion of migrants and minorities in sports.

The Agency's evidence aims at informing EU and national policy makers about fundamental rights challenges on the ground, as well as at contextualising debates on fundamental rights issues in the European Union. The report contains the results of interviews with representatives of sport federations, player and athlete organisations and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) from across the EU, together with an analysis of secondary data and information on racism, ethnic discrimination and the exclusion of migrants and minorities in sport.

Thanks to this data, the police and local communities are informed about the situation on the ground and can identify policing practices that may be discriminatory. Looking at the results as a whole, minority respondents were stopped more often by the police than majority respondents; for example on public transport or on the street. Some minority groups are particularly heavily policed. For example in Greece, Roma respondents who said they were stopped by the police experienced on average 6 police stops in a 12 month period, while majority population respondents experienced on average 2 stops in the same period. Minority respondents were more likely to be asked for their identity papers. For example, in Italy, 90% of Northern Africans who were stopped were asked for identity papers in comparison with 48% of majority respondents.

Some EU Member States should therefore adapt their laws so that persons with mental health problems and persons with intellectual disabilities who wish to vote can do so. These individuals should be able to participate in society as other citizens do. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities sends a clear message: it is not persons with disabilities who need to change to fit society, but society itself, which must adapt to the needs of persons with disabilities. \" \"Even if I cannot speak, it does not mean I have nothing to say\"(Interviewee in a FRA study) The report's findings show that too often EU Member States automatically deny voting rights to persons who do not have legal capacity. In such cases, persons who are not legally entitled to enter into contracts or marry, for example, because they have a mental health problem or an intellectual disability, are automatically denied the right to vote, with no individual assessment by a court or judge of their capacity. This approach seems to contradict the article of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities on legal capacity. \"Nothing about us without us\" This report is part of a larger research project by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights on the fundamental rights of persons with mental health problems and persons with intellectual disabilities. In addition to an analysis of relevant laws in the 27 EU Member States, the ongoing research also assesses the situation on the ground, involving persons with intellectual disabilities and persons with mental health problems as researchers. The findings about the fundamental rights challenges faced by these two groups of individuals will be published in 2012. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) represents a major shift in the way disability is conceptualised; it is society that must adapt to the needs of persons with disabilities, not these individuals who need to be \"cured\". The European Union has signed the CRPD and 16 of the 27 EU Member States have already ratified it. As the first human rights treaty to which the EU will accede, this marks an important step towards guaranteeing the rights of persons with disabilities living in the EU. The findings of the FRA report will be presented at a conference in Lisbon on promoting social inclusion and combating stigma in mental health, by the FRA project manager, Mario Oetheimer, on 9 November.

The Agency's evidence aims at informing EU and national policy-makers and contextualising debates on fundamental rights in the European Union. The report on the political participation of persons with mental health problems and persons with intellectual disabilities examines the legal situation in the 27 EU Member States. It is based on data collected by the FRA legal network of experts (FRALEX). Mental Health Problems can affect a person's thoughts, body, feelings, and behaviour. These problems can be severe, seriously interfering with a person's life, and even cause a person to become disabled or commit suicide. Mental health problems include depression, bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness), attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, schizophrenia, and conduct disorder. Intellectual Disability (also described as \u2018mental disability' or \u2018learning difficulty') refers to a permanent condition characterised by significantly lower than average intellectual ability, resulting in limitations in intellectual functioning and in adaptive behaviour as expressed in conceptual, social, and practical adaptive skills. It is usually present from birth or develops before the age of 18. A person with intellectual disability usually requires support in several areas of life activity: self-care, receptive and expressive communication, and economic self-sufficiency.

This pattern holds true for both Muslim and non-Muslim youth. However, Muslim youth in our survey reported having experienced more discrimination and social marginalisation than non-Muslim youth. In order to tackle some of the root causes of violence, it is important to ensure that children are not exposed themselves to violence and discrimination.\" On average, 1 out of 4 young people reported that they had been unfairly treated or picked on. Muslim youths were significantly more likely than non-Muslims to say that this had happened to them in France and Spain; in the United Kingdom there was no difference between responses for Muslim and non-Muslim youth. Figure 1: Experience of being unfairly picked on (%) Many of the young people surveyed have experienced violence (ranging from bullying and other forms of emotional violence to more physical forms of aggression). It was also found that there is a strong link between being a victim and being an offender. In all three Member States surveyed, young people who felt socially marginalised, and those who had been a victim of violence because of their cultural or religious background, skin colour or language, were more likely to use emotional violence (such as teasing or bullying) towards others than young people who did not feel socially marginalised or those who had not been victimised for the above-mentioned reasons. Overall, there is a low acceptance of violence among young people, and there is no direct link between attitudes supporting violence and actual engagement in violence.

The survey focused on three EU Member States that have experienced terrorist attacks associated with radical Islam or urban unrest related to immigrant youth with a predominantly Muslim background. The research set out to explore the experiences and attitudes of both Muslim and non-Muslim young people in these countries with a view to providing results that are of use to those formulating policies to address discrimination, social marginalisation and integration.\u00a0 The FRA survey set out to explore possible relationships between young people's experiences of discrimination and social marginalisation, including experiences of racism, and their attitudes towards and actual engagement in violent behaviours.

It also provides advice to the EU institutions and Member States, based on the evidence found. The Agency's surveys and studies undertaken in 2009 in particular show that many equality bodies, national human rights institutions and data protection authorities lack resources, are not independent enough, and often have very weak mandates. Many separated asylum-seeking children disappear whilst their case is being processed. LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transsexual) persons suffer discrimination in areas of everyday life, such as at work or in bars.

See http://fra.europa.eu/ The Report also collects examples of good practices that Member States can build on to improve fundamental rights protection in their respective country. For example, the law was changed in Scotland (UK) so that if an offence is committed because of a prejudice based on a person's sexual orientation or transgender identity, this must now be taken into account in sentencing. This is the first European provision specifically tackling transgender hate crimes. Another example is the case of Hungary, where the Prime Minister announced a government plan to offer 200 positions to experts of Roma origin in public administration from January 2010.

The full report is expected to be published in June. More than 300 separated, asylum-seeking children and the adults responsible for their care were interviewed face to face in 12 EU Member States - Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Hungary, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The interviews revealed that separated, asylum-seeking children, although under State care, often live in accommodation that is unsuitable for them, including in detention, even if they have not committed a crime, or under strict curfew rules. The minors frequently lack quality medical care and access to appropriate education and training; their religious needs are not always respected or fulfilled; they can be victims of discrimination with little opportunity for redress, or even mistreated. \"I went to the doctor because I broke my finger... He said he could not help me because I was irregular, even though my finger was swollen. Now, if I'm sick, I don't say anything to anybody.\"(Boy, age 17) The children are often insufficiently informed about legal procedures and opportunities available to them, which are crucial for their future. Their views are often not taken into consideration, their life depending on decisions, which authorities can take a very long time to make. These decisions are based on processes that often make the children feel insecure and often unprotected or ill-advised. FRA Director Morten Kjaerum: \"Every year thousands of separated, asylum-seeking children come to the EU. The effective protection of these children at EU level should not be delayed. It is essential to enhance co-operation between Member States, encourage exchange of information and good practices, and reinforce existing protection instruments as soon as possible. In this context, an EU action plan on unaccompanied minors, providing effective measures for the protection of separated, asylum-seeking children could be an important instrument.\" Based on its findings, the report includes a number of recommendations as to how the needs of these children can be met, to facilitate the implementation and fulfilment of their rights (as enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights). Key recommendations: \u00a0Access to adequate healthcare must be guaranteed to all children without discrimination and irrespective of their status. \u00a0The provision of professional interpretation and intercultural mediation support to separated, asylum-seeking children in accessing healthcare should be mandatory. \u00a0Member States should ensure that access to education is guaranteed to separated, asylum-seeking children under similar conditions as for country nationals. \u00a0A legal guardian should be provided to every separated, asylum-seeking child as soon as possible. \u00a0Member States should ensure that administrative and disciplinary rules applicable to separated, asylum-seeking children are aimed at the children's protection. These rules should establish\u00a0 \t\t\u00a0undue, detrimental or discriminatory restrictions affecting the children's ability to interact with others. \u00a0Separated, asylum-seeking children should be actively encouraged to and supported in reporting situations of discrimination and mistreatment to the authorities, in particular to child ombudsmen \t\t\u00a0 institutions, where they exist. \u00a0Financial or other forms of material support should be adequate, in order to ensure the separated, asylum-seeking children's ability to participate in social life, interacting with their peers from \t\t\u00a0the host society. \u00a0Recognising that age assessment cannot be precise, Member States should, in cases of doubt, treat the person as a child, granting the right to appeal age assessment decisions.

Discrimination in education is particularly damaging as it can have a negative impact on young people's opportunities in the labour market. Actors at all levels, from governments to service providers, must use this evidence, collected on the ground through in-depth interviews, to develop targeted policies to prevent the exclusion of these groups from European societies.\" Everyday Life \t11% of North African respondents had experienced discrimination on the basis of their ethnicity when in, or simply trying to enter, a shop. 17% of Roma indicated that they had been discriminated against by healthcare personnel. Almost a quarter (22%) of Sub-Saharan Africans were discriminated against because of their ethnicity at least once when looking for work.[1] Victims of crime \t1 in 4 (24%) of all respondents was a victim of crime at least once in the last 12 months. Members of minority groups, often stereotyped as criminals themselves, can clearly also be victims of crime in need of assistance, protection, and support. Police stops Among all North Africans who were surveyed, 1 in 5 (19%) considered that they were stopped by the police specifically because of their ethnic minority background.\u00a0 This leads to a perception of discriminatory police treatment amongst some respondents. Awareness of Rights The survey exposes the serious lack of awareness of anti discrimination legislation amongst ethnic minority and immigrant groups.\u00a0 Almost half (46%) of respondents were unaware that legislation exists forbidding discrimination against people on the basis of their ethnicity in relation to shops, restaurants, bars or clubs.\u00a0 \"Nothing would happen\" 82% of those who were discriminated against in the past 12 months did not report their most recent experience of discrimination either at the place where it occurred or to a competent authority.\u00a0 The most common reason for non-reporting was the belief that \u2018nothing would happen'.\u00a0 This lack of reporting indicates that official figures on racist discrimination constitute just the \u2018tip of the iceberg' when it comes to the true extent of the problem. It also shows that those who discriminate can act with impunity as their actions are not brought to justice. See the EU-MIDIS website for more details.

Human rights aren't a subject in lessons; at most in theory, but not in practice.\" (Student, Focus group discussion, Berlin) Many of the interviewed students stated that they would appreciate a stronger connection to the present in education activities about the Holocaust, both at school and at historical sites and museums. However, only one of the 22 surveyed Holocaust commemoration sites regarded informing people about human rights as its most important objective.\u00a0Based on the findings of the study, the FRA is of the opinion that Holocaust education should go beyond the mere transmission of historical facts to include discussion and debate on past and present human rights issues. Teachers call for guidance Interviewed teachers appealed not only for financial support for visits to memorial sites, but also for guiding material on how to make best use of such visits. The FRA will publish a handbook for teachers on Holocaust education and human rights education, as well as a handbook to be used by memorial site staff, later in the year. Based on the findings of its report, the Agency suggests that: Member States better integrate human rights education into the school curriculum. Teacher education and training include both learning about the Holocaust and learning about the history and present role of human rights. Schools take on the responsibility of promoting learning about the Holocaust and human rights and how links between these two fields can be achieved. National governments and institutions produce and/or disseminate guiding material for visits to memorial sites and museums dealing with the Holocaust, introducing the subject of human rights education. Museums and memorial sites assess which type of training and qualifications will be needed by their staff to integrate human rights education more extensively into their work.

Authorities need to act urgently, as poor housing conditions and residential segregation also have a negative impact on education, employment and health for the Roma. For example, living in segregated sites makes it difficult for Roma children to have access to schools, and for Roma and Travellers to find work and to get to work.\" Unacceptable housing conditions Many Roma and Travellers in the EU have to live in informal settlements without basic infrastructure, often in hardly habitable dwellings, without prospects of legalising their homes and improving the quality of their housing. Very often Roma housing areas have poor access to public services, employment and schools, as well as an inadequate supply of water, electricity or gas. High segregation rates Segregation exists in many Member States, sometimes as a result of deliberate policy choices made by local authorities and/or national governments. Forced evictions The report highlights forced evictions from municipal accommodation, even of Roma who are regular rent payers. These evictions often happen without prior notice, and may involve police violence and destruction of personal property. There are many cases where authorities fail to provide alternative housing and/or adequate compensation for expropriation. Discrimination Discrimination on grounds of race or ethnic origin in access to housing is legally forbidden. However, an FRA survey shows that many Roma experience discrimination which varies considerably between Member States. In one Member State, 34% of Roma reported discrimination in access to housing. Low number of official complaints due to lack of knowledge 70% of Roma do not know that laws exist which prohibit their discrimination in access to housing. 71% think nothing would happen if they reported it, and 41% are unsure how to report discrimination. As a result, the number of official complaints remains very low. Based on the findings of its report, the Agency advises: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should resolve the issue of residential segregation, as well as the problem of informal Roma and Traveller settlements. This means adopting positive measures, in particular concerning \u2018culturally adequate' and acceptable housing conditions. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should provide for the regular collection of usable and meaningful ethnically disaggregated data regarding the housing situation of Roma and Travellers. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member States should ensure that the specialised bodies, e.g. Equality Bodies, are properly resourced to fulfil their tasks. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Governments, local authorities and Equality Bodies must intensify their efforts to raise awareness and disseminate information regarding anti-discrimination legislation and the possibilities for redress. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The EU Commission should link the use of European Union Structural Funds with the implementation of equal opportunity and desegregation plans in housing. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The active participation of Roma and Travellers in planning, implementation and review of housing policies is essential.

They stress that, as the economic crisis deepens, political leaders need to unequivocally and publicly condemn any form of violence targeting Roma: \"In order to avoid inciting and inflaming ethnic tensions, politicians and other public figures must consider their statements carefully\", they said. Discrimination and ethnic profiling The statement deplores that Roma who are EU citizens have the right to move and reside freely within the EU, but nevertheless often face discriminatory treatment. The organisations are particularly concerned about racial profiling of Roma in some States. Finally, the four organisations commit themselves to review Roma-related policies, measure their impact, identify good practices and assist States in developing and implementing sustainable integration policies - all in partnership with the Roma communities. Upcoming FRA report on Roma On 22 April, FRA will present a new report on discrimination against Roma in the EU. This will be the first in a series of publications using data gathered by a major survey, the EU-MIDIS (European Union Minorities and Discrimination Survey). Roma were one of the groups interviewed and of those Roma interviewed, 50% considered that they had been discriminated against, at least once, in the previous 12 months.

This recent surge in anti-Semitic incidents is reason for great concern. While it is too early to draw conclusions, there are indications that this rise could partly be affected by the situation in the Middle East, as well as by the global financial crisis.\u201d Morten Kjaerum continued: \u201cEveryone has the right to feel safe and protected, whatever religious belief or ethnic origin.

It presents the latest available statistical data on anti-Semitic incidents, and illustrates developments in the EU for the period from 2001 to 2008. Yet, the report notes that a significant number of EU Member States do not maintain official or even unofficial data and statistics on anti-Semitic incidents. For these countries, the Agency provides lists of cases reported either ad-hoc by civil society organisations or through the media. In light of current events, the FRA has also collected as much information as possible on anti-Semitic incidents since the latest outbreak of hostilities in Gaza. The FRA will continue to collect the relevant data in 2009, to present an elaborated analysis in its next year's update that will be published in early 2010. The report \u201cAnti-Semitism.

Many suffer violence within the family or the community, whilst those belonging to minority groups are often subject to discrimination in education. Children continue to be trafficked and smuggled into and across EU Member States\". He continued: \"Protecting our children must be a priority for everyone. Yet without a thorough knowledge of both the extent and nature of the problems, it will be very difficult to accurately address this situation and assess changes over time. We hope that Member States will use our indicators to collect data that will allow them to formulate evidence based policies to protect the rights of the child\". \"In order to protect our children, there is a need for concerted EU action. The European Commission has today adopted two proposals for new rules to step up the fight against trafficking in human beings and child sexual abuse, which are important steps for the better protection of our children\", concluded Morten Kjaerum. Notes to editors: Indicators have been developed by the Agency in the following areas: Family Environment and Alternative Care; Protection from Exploitation and Violence; Education, Citizenship and Cultural Activities; and Adequate Standard of Living. Following the 2006 European Commission Communication \u2018Towards a Strategy on the Rights of the Child', the Commission asked the EU Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), in July 2007, to develop indicators to measure how child rights are implemented, protected, respected and promoted across the EU. The European Commission has today adopted two proposals for new rules to step up the fight against trafficking in human beings and child sexual abuse, sexual exploitation and child pornography. These new proposals replace existing legislation which was implemented in 2002 and 2004. The new proposals will guarantee full alignment with the highest European standards, whilst also providing greater assistance for victims and tougher action against criminals responsible for child sexual abuse and trafficking. The FRA will present an in-depth study on child trafficking by mid-2009.

This study has been requested by the European Parliament to examine the need for new European Community legislation to combat discrimination. Initial results of FRA's ongoing project highlight that key issues include the access to civil partnerships or marriage, the achievement of social acceptance and visibility in areas such as employment, sports and the media as well as the importance of fair and non-discriminatory pension and tenancy laws. Effective legislation is hereby seen as a key instrument in tackling and overcoming such challenges across the EU. The European Union and the Council of Europe play a lead role in promoting human rights and equality for LGBT people in Europe. The European Community Treaty and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights list sexual orientation among the prohibited grounds for discrimination. The European Parliament has taken a strong position against homophobia in its Resolution of April 2007. It also gave its full support to the Yogyakarta Principles on the application of international human rights law in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity in the recently adopted \"Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2007 and the European Union's policy on the matter\". There have been some recent landmark decisions of the European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice. Finally, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, in his latest viewpoint, called on States to take concrete action to make \"human rights principles apply also to sexual orientation and gender identity\". \"The fight against homophobia must continue with all possible means. Our forthcoming study aims to make a strong contribution to this common effort and to help the EU institutions and Member States in making equality a reality for all people in the EU who face discrimination today\", said Constantinos Manolopoulos. Notes to editors The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) is an independent body of the European Union. Its task is to provide advice and expertise on fundamental rights matters to the EU and its Member States. The aim is to support them to respect fully fundamental rights in the application of European Community law. FRA is based in Vienna and builds on the former European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC). It publishes an annual report on fundamental rights and thematic studies based on its research and surveys. FRA also works to raise awareness on fundamental rights issues. Discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation is one of the thematic areas specified in FRA's first Multiannual Framework and has been included in FRA's annual work programme for 2008. In late 2008, FRA will publish the first comparative EU study on the situation concerning homophobia and discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation in all 27 Member States of the European Union. This study, which has been requested by the European Parliament in June 2007, is based on official and unofficial information on both national and EU level. It will examine existing case law and legal instruments while providing evidence on homophobic incidents and discrimination. It will also outline existing policies and good practice by public authorities and civil society organisations. As requested by the European Parliament, the study shall support discussions on the need for a Council Directive covering all grounds of discrimination listed in the Article 13 of the European Community Treaty, including in the areas of education, social security, healthcare, and access to goods and services.

She encouraged governments to make use of \u2018positive action' to achieve equality in practice. \"Nothing is more unfair than the equal treatment of unequals. To remove deep-rooted discrimination against Roma and Travellers, we need more than just equal treatment. Take the example of the labour market. The unemployment rate among Roma in several EU Member States is as high as 70-90%. The EU anti-discrimination law specifically allows for positive action. Employers could, for instance, run targeted recruitment campaigns or offer vocational training to Roma and Travellers. We need more such measures to enable Roma and Travellers to compete on equal terms with other job applicants,\" Beate Winkler commented.\u00a0 She continued: \"When, if not during this European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, will we make real progress in turning these principles of equality into reality? The Year must raise awareness of the ongoing discrimination against Roma and Travellers and encourage action to combat it.\" Roma form one of the largest ethnic minority groups in the EU-27. They are amongst the groups most vulnerable to discrimination. According to a recent Eurobarometer survey on discrimination, 77% of Europeans believe that being a Roma tends to be a disadvantage in their country. The Fundamental Rights Agency has documented that Roma and Travellers are subjected to racially motivated violence. They face systemic discrimination in education, public health care, services and employment. Romani women and children often fall victim to multiple discrimination on the grounds of age, ethnicity and gender. Notes to Editors: Information about FRA: The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) is an independent body of the European Union. Its objective is to provide assistance and expertise on fundamental rights matters to the EU and its Member States, when they are implementing Community law. The aim is to support them to respect fully fundamental rights when they take measures or formulate courses of action. FRA was established through Council Regulation (EC) No 168/2007 of 15 February 2007. It is based in Vienna and is being built on the former European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC). \u00a0 For background: A broad majority of Europeans (77%) believe that being a Roma is a disadvantage in their society. (http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_263_en.pdf) Education systems across the EU are failing Roma pupils. As a result, Roma pupils tend to leave education early, which deprives them of the qualifications that would enable them to compete in the labour market. Segregation in the education of Roma and Traveller pupils still persists in many EU countries - sometimes as the unintended effect of policies and practices, and sometimes as a result of residential segregation. According to data available to FRA, the marginalisation of Roma on labour markets persists in nearly all Member States where they represent a significant minority. Unemployment among Roma is estimated to reach 70-90% in at least three Member States. In the field of housing, Roma and Travellers are among the groups facing most discrimination. Surveys show that they are the group \"least wanted\" as neighbours by majority populations. A common problem in some Member States is a lack of provision of accommodation sites by the authorities. This often results in people from these groups living in unapproved accommodation, which lacks basic sanitary facilities. In some countries, the extreme deprivation of Roma housing is heightened by subjection to evictions and forced relocations. In the field of access to health care, Roma are subjected to discriminatory treatment, ranging from segregation in maternity wards to discriminatory treatment by medical professionals. The designation of 8 April as International Roma Day goes back to the fourth congress of the International Romani Union in Warsaw in 1990. The International Roma Day is celebrated as tribute to the first international meeting of Roma representatives, on 8 April 1971, near London. \u00a0 Further information concerning Roma and Travellers in Europe: FRA Reports: Romani women and access to public health care Roma and Travellers in Public Education Annual Report 2006 \u00a0 European Commission reports: Eurobarometer Survey on Discrimination in the EU: http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_263_sum_en.pdf European Commission Portal on Roma: http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/fundamental_rights/roma/index_en.htm \u00a0 Other international organisations: Council of Europe Roma and Travellers Division: http://www.coe.int/T/DG3/RomaTravellers/Default_en.asp Contact Point on Roma and Sinti Issues (ODIHR-OSCE): http://www.osce.org/odihr/18148.html UNICEF: http://www.unicef.de/4298.html ", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2012/situation-roma-europe-demands-more-rigorous-action"}, {"id": "FRA_PR_0173", "date": "2008-03-21", "text_type": "PR", "title": "Joint statement on the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination", "text": "Our organisations jointly condemn all discourse that spreads ideas of superiority on grounds of race, colour, language, religion, nationality, or national or ethnic origin. Racist discourse is opposed to the basic equality of all people. Public perception of different minorities, cultures and religions as well as attitudes towards issues such as immigration, integration and the fight against racism are to a great extent influenced by political discourse. By speaking out against racist acts and incidents, political representatives can play a positive role in the promotion of mutual respect and understanding in society, and can have a significant impact in defusing tensions. Racist political discourse contributes to dehumanising individuals, denigrating certain ethnic, religious or cultural groups, perpetuating stereotypes, and creating a climate in which racist violence may flourish. Racist, anti-Semitic and xenophobic political discourse is no longer the sole preserve of extremist political parties, but is to be found in the overall political environment in many states. Such developments may lead to the legitimisation and trivialisation of this type of language. Concern over the increasing use of racist discourse in politics has been expressed in numerous reports, statements and documents adopted by the Council of Europe, the European Parliament and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Based on the existing standards and commitments of our organisations and, in light of the Charter of European Political Parties for a Non-Racist Society (2), which could serve as a blueprint for other similar initiatives, we call upon all political leaders for continued leadership in the fight against intolerance and discrimination. We: Call on political leaders to defend basic human rights and democratic principles and to reject all forms of racist violence, incitement to racial hatred and harassment and any form of racial discrimination; Call on political parties to deal responsibly with sensitive issues related to race, ethnic and national origin and religion; Encourage political parties to adopt concrete policies against all forms of racism and xenophobia in their party programmes; Encourage political parties to strive for the fair representation of racial, ethnic, national and religious minorities within and at all levels of their party system; Urge political representatives to act responsibly and refrain from providing simplistic explanations with racist, anti-Semitic and xenophobic connotations to complex social, political and economic problems or phenomena; Recommend political parties to work closer with civil society to combat racism and xenophobia and form partnerships in order to reach this goal. Notes to editors 1. The International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination is observed annually on 21 March. On that day, in 1960, police opened fire and killed 69 people at a peaceful demonstration in Sharpeville, South Africa, against the apartheid \"pass laws\". Proclaiming the Day in 1966, the UN's General Assembly called on the international community to redouble its efforts to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination. 2. The Charter of European Political Parties for a Non-Racist Society was signed on 25 September 2003 by the President of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly and the President of the European Parliament. The Charter calls on political parties to act responsibly when dealing with issues related to race, ethnic and national origin and religion. The EUMC, the Fundamental Rights Agency's precursor, worked on promoting the Charter. ECRI in March 2005 adopted a Declaration on the use of racist, antisemitic and xenophobic elements in political discourse, making reference to the Charter", "url": "https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2012/joint-statement-occasion-international-day-elimination-racial-discrimination"}, {"id": "FRA_PR_0174", "date": "2008-04-07", "text_type": "PR", "title": "European Union needs common action to make equality a reality for the Roma", "text": "\"We have put in place strong legislation to root out discrimination in the EU, but the promise of equal opportunity remains unfulfilled for many Roma and Travellers in our societies\", said Anastasia Crickley, Chairperson of FRA's Management Board, in a statement ahead of International Roma Day (8 April). \u00a0\"Roma and Travellers are subjected to racially motivated violence and hate speech. The Fundamental Rights Agency and many other organisations have documented the endemic discrimination against Roma in education, employment, health care, housing and access to services. Romani women and children are particularly vulnerable. The action plans and strategies on how to solve these issues through comprehensive programmes have all been drawn up long ago. We must now implement them rigorously, measure their impact, identify good practice and learn from our mistakes. Partnership with the Roma communities themselves must be one of the principles guiding the implementation of these programmes and policies\", Anastasia Crickley continued. A particularly acute problem across many Member States of the European Union is the housing situation of Roma and Travellers. The lack of provision of accommodation sites by local authorities often results in people from these groups living in sub-standard accommodation, which lacks even basic sanitary facilities. In some countries, the housing conditions, in which some Roma communities live are aggravated by their subjection to evictions and forced relocations. \"Member States need to step up awareness among local authorities of the importance of addressing the particular needs of Roma in the development of land use and housing policies\", Anastasia Crickley commented. \"They should take effective measures to prevent and remedy discrimination against Roma in access to public and private housing.\" The situation of Roma and Travellers and the discrimination they face is a European concern requiring a common European response. The Agency therefore welcomes the moves towards greater coordination of Member State efforts at European Union level. At the European Council in December 2007, the Heads of States and Governments of the EU recognised the \"very specific situation faced by the Roma across the Union\" and invited Member States and the Union \"to use all means to improve their inclusion\". The European Commission was requested to examine existing policies and instruments and to report to the Council on progress achieved before the end of June 2008. The Fundamental Rights Agency will make a strong contribution to support any common EU effort to help Roma and Travellers realise their right to equal opportunities in the EU. In this regard, the Agency attaches great importance to the expertise and views of civil society in general, and Roma organisations in particular. FRA will therefore engage in a structured consultation with key stakeholders to gather ideas for its future work on issues affecting Roma and Travellers in the EU. The designation of 8 April as International Roma Day goes back to the fourth congress of the International Romani Union in Warsaw in 1990. The International Roma Day is celebrated as tribute to the first international meeting of Roma representatives, on 8 April 1971, near London.
