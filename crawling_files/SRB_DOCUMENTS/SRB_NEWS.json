The bank resolution framework was put in place for banks whose collapse might shake other parts of the economy. In these cases, the SRB can use its resolution tools to manage their failure effectively. For most small banks, however, failure means going into normal insolvency, as we have seen in recent cases. Let me say from the outset that the plan for most, if not almost all, banks under the SRB\u2019s remit is resolution: I will return to this later.We base the decision between resolution and normal insolvency on the so-called public interest assessment (PIA). In effect, we must determine if it is in the public interest to apply the SRB\u2019s resolution tools to a failing bank. We make this assessment in our resolution plans, which set out a preferred strategy for each bank \u2013 resolution or insolvency. However, we revisit this assessment annually and in particular when a bank is declared failing or likely to fail, taking into account the circumstances at that point. The SRB\u2019s Executive Session, the governing body that decides on the approach, makes the final determination as to whether the bank should be resolved. The assessment, in essence, looks at whether resolution can achieve one or more of the five resolution objectives better than normal insolvency proceedings.The five resolution objectives are:To ensure the continuity of critical functions to the economy, such as lending to small- and medium-sized businesses;To avoid significant adverse effects on financial stability in one or more countries;To protect public funds by minimising reliance on extraordinary public financial support;To protect depositors covered by the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive, which protects deposits of up to 100,000 euros, and investors covered by the Investor Compensation Scheme Directive;To protect client\u2019s funds and assets.Last year, we published our methodology for how we do this. However, measuring some of these objectives is more complex than others, and the SRB is working to further deepen the analysis that underpins the overall assessment.\u00a0As I noted above, the plan for most banks under the SRB remit is resolution and not insolvency. I have said in the past that resolution is for the few and not for the many. This is correct in the context of the more than 3,000 banks across the Banking Union. The SRB is the resolution authority for 128 banks/banking groups, the largest and most systemic banks operating in the Banking Union and certain cross-border groups. For these banks, in general, we expect and plan for the use of resolution tools. We should recall that resolution tools enable the SRB to manage the failure of a bank in an orderly way and rapidly restructure its balance sheet, or to take other resolution measures to preserve financial stability. At the same time, resolution will not offer resurrection to banks with failed or unsustainable business models.My second point is that the public interest assessment takes into account the circumstances present at the time when the bank is failing. The PIA carried out during resolution planning provides an annual static snapshot; while the assessment is run again when the bank is declared to be failing or likely to fail. This is because we need to be able to analyse the latest situation of the bank, which will obviously have deteriorated compared to the resolution-planning phase. We must also consider the economic environment and assess the impact of resolution versus insolvency at that specific point in time, re-assessing the impact of the bank\u2019s failure on the resolution objectives. Both the bank itself may have changed since our original assessment (e.g. discontinued or acquired critical functions), but also the economic environment in which we find ourselves. Of course, even given that the eventual decision will have to account for the circumstances at the time of failure, the careful assessment made during the resolution-planning phase is the foundation. Resolution planning is driven by the need to ensure that banks can be resolved, if necessary. Our core task is to ensure that the banks under our remit meet all the conditions to be resolvable, including MREL issuance.A public interest assessment may well give different results if the bank fails while the sun is shining or under storm clouds. The public interest assessment enables and requires us to take into account the macro-economic and market circumstances that surround a bank\u2019s failure, particularly when assessing against the objectives of preventing financial instability, and of preserving continuity of functions that are critical to the real economy. This holds true in general, but might be specifically important at a time where we prepare for the potential unfolding of the Covid-19 impact on the economy and banks.To conclude let me recap my main messages. First, to stress that the main plan for most SRB banks is resolution in order to safeguard the public interest. Therefore, these banks need to be resolvable and build the necessary MREL according to the SRB\u2019s preferred resolution strategy. Second, when deciding upon resolution or insolvency for a failing bank, the SRB takes into account the idiosyncratic and systemic circumstances at the point of failure of a bank, which gives us the flexibility to properly account for the economic circumstances at that point in time.\u00a0", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/1040"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0002", "date": "2020-07-10", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Brexit: get ready for changes", "text": "Over the past few months, there has been an understandable focus on dealing with the effects of the Covid-19 outbreak on our economies.

We also work closely with the Bank of England, and look forward to continuing our fruitful cooperation.The SRB has been working with the banks under its remit to prepare for this scenario for some time, and published its Brexit expectations document in November 2018. This document covers MREL eligibility, internal loss absorbency, operational continuity, access to FMIs and other matters. We communicated our expectations on an individual basis to banks. The SRB put a particular emphasis on issuances under UK law, raising awareness that they may become non-eligible for MREL.The SRB\u2019s Expectations for Banks document and the recently published MREL policy under the Banking Package also lay out measures applying to third countries, which will apply to the UK from 1 January 2021. This includes adding relevant clauses to contracts governed by third country law to ensure eligibility for MREL, enhance cross-border recognition of resolution actions or support operational continuity in resolution.As previously stated, the 2020 resolution planning cycle will take the impact of Brexit and the end of the transition period into account while continuing to make progress towards all banks being resolvable. What is clear is that there has been a significant lead-in time for Brexit and the SRB has been transparent on what we expect from banks. The time of uncertainty is now over.

While the European banking sector entered this crisis in much better shape than it was at the beginning of the previous one, the impact on the banking sector itself is not yet clear and will largely depend on the measures taken to support the real economy and how different industries fare during the crisis. It is realistic to expect that banks with less performing business models and low profitability will be under more pressure, and that non-performing loans will increase. This is why a strong resolution framework that prepares for and can manage bank failures is a key element in mitigating the negative impact of the current crisis.A major factor for resolvability are the minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL), the buffer each bank must hold to absorb losses and prevent use of public money if it fails. MREL plays a crucial role in ensuring that banks are resolvable, by which we mean that their failure can be managed in an orderly way, safeguarding financial stability, allowing critical functions to the economy to continue and guaranteeing that losses are borne by shareholders and bondholders, rather than the taxpayer.The SRB published its updated MREL policy last month. This policy implements the new requirements in the 2019 Banking Package, which introduced a number of risk-reducing measures for the financial sector. The updated policy introduces changes to MREL requirements for large global systemically important banks, integrating the global standard for total loss-absorbing capacity, known as TLAC. There are changes to the way it is calculated and in its quality (subordination). It also sets out dedicated rules for different business models, such as cooperatives, and resolution strategies, such as multiple-point-of-entry (MPE).A key change is to the deadlines for binding MREL targets. The SRB will decide on the level of MREL that institutions should hold in its 2020 resolution planning cycle. These decisions, which will be communicated to banks in early 2021, will include two binding MREL targets: the binding intermediate target to be met by 1 January 2022 and the MREL (final target) to be met by 1 January 2024. The decisions will reflect changing capital requirements, and will be calibrated taking the most recent information into account, where relevant.These new targets allow the SRB to take a forward-looking approach to banks that may face short-term difficulties in meeting the existing targets set in earlier cycles, due to the current crisis. We are committed to the continued build-up of MREL, while ensuring that short-term MREL constraints do not prevent banks from lending to businesses and households.We can see that MREL is being steadily built up in quantity and quality over time. While the Covid-19 crisis has caused market uncertainty and an increase in the cost of subordinated and senior debt, leading to severely reduced new issuances in March and April, there have been signs of recovery in recent weeks. Progress on MREL requirements means banks are more resolvable \u2013 and the process of resolution planning has ensured they are more crisis-ready than in the past.\u00a0The SRB aims to set ambitious but realistic objectives for the build-up of MREL quantity and quality, taking the situation of financial markets and market capacity into consideration where needed. This loss-absorbing capacity is vital for strengthening resolvability, and, in turn, financial stability.We will use the flexibility in the regulatory framework \u2013 where banking and resolution authorities enjoy discretion \u2013 to help the economy recover, while continuing to make progress in banks\u2019 resilience and resolvability.", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/1028"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0008", "date": "2020-07-03", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "The SRB's fifth anniversary in times of an unprecedented pandemia", "text": "Both because of its global scale and dramatic social and economic impact and because continued uncertainty regarding its ultimate scope and consequences, the crisis resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic is an unprecedented challenge being faced by global society.At an institutional level, this crisis teaches us two very important lessons: one, our limitations in terms of being able to reliably predict and prepare for the infinite types of risks we may encounter and two, the fragility, not only of our own lives, but also of our way of life and the foundations on which our institutions are built. When faced with challenges of this magnitude, we realise, yet again, like we did in the previous financial crisis, that the best defence mechanism is to have strong, yet flexible institutions, with the capacity to adapt to the changing realities, institutions that are unwavering in their goals, but flexible in their means to reach them.Overshadowed by the Covid-19, 2020 marks the fifth anniversary of the SRB\u2019s coming into being. A short but intense period of time in which a young institution has earned its place among Europe\u2019s most seasoned authorities. I am well aware of this since only two years after its creation, in Spain we witnessed firsthand how the SRB\u2019s decisive intervention in a bank failure was able to avoid damaging effects on depositors and public resources.The SRB\u2019s own track record is the best example of how much has been accomplished. We face the current situation in better conditions, from a prudential, resolution and institutional perspective. However, the health crisis we are experiencing also serves as a reminder that the SRB and the NRAs must continue working together to strengthen the resolution framework.I would like to highlight just a few of the challenges ahead at the level of the SRM.Flexibility in resolution planning. Commenting on the behaviour of the Bank of England in the 1825 crisis, Thomas Joplin said: \u201cThere are times when rules and precedents cannot be broken; others, when they cannot be adhered to with safety. In these circumstances, intervention is an art, not a science\u201d. Sometimes the success of institutions must indeed be measured by their resourcefulness and capacity to adapt.And all European and national authorities have stepped up to the task of adjusting their activity to soften the shock on the financial sector and the economy. In this vein the SRB, as its Chair already explained in this same blog, has offered relief measures in resolution planning to reduce the operational burden on banks and proposed a forward-looking approach with regards to MREL monitoring. This flexibility is important because we must not forget that resolution planning is not an end in itself but a means to achieve the ultimate objective of minimising the negative impact of a bank\u2019s failure.The SRB\u2019s challenge ahead will be to continue advancing in ensuring resolvability of banks across the Banking Union, while at the same time supporting economic recovery and the sector\u2019s stability, in particular providing the necessary flexibility in the entities\u2019 path to building up MREL. In this respect, it will be important to maintain the close dialogue with the banks to follow the evolution of their funding and balance sheet size, as well as to monitor market conditions.Focus on crisis preparedness and resolution execution. As I mentioned this crisis has highlighted our limited capacity to foresee all possible scenarios. Situations are constantly changing and as a Prussian general once put it \u201cno battle plan survives contact with the enemy\u201d. Now that work on plans is well advanced, it is important for the SRB and NRAs to prioritise crisis preparedness and the operationalisation of resolution strategies, including through dry runs and simulations which allow teams to learn from and prepare for potential real life situations, building resilience and capacity to adapt to any circumstance, no matter how unexpected. In other words, five years into the new framework, it is key for the SRB and NRAs to stay \u201cyoung\u201d, to avoid turning too bureaucratic or settling for a mere application of the rules. On the contrary, the SRM must continue to adequately prepare for any possible \u201cbattle\u201d, not only through the development of bail-in playbooks, national handbooks and the many instruments and policy documents under way but also through the consolidation of dynamic and multidisciplinary teams covering the entire process from the moment an entity experiences difficulties until the last loss is allocated or the last asset liquidated.European leadership in the debate on banking crisis management. A lot has been achieved in only five years in crisis management but more remains to be done and the SRB must be a leading voice in this reform. An effective and harmonised defense of financial stability, with a minimum cost for taxpayers across the Banking Union has yet to be achieved. Many issues must still be addressed, among them the absence of a common deposit guarantee system effectively supporting crisis management; the difference in treatment of bank failures between State aid and the resolution framework; or the lack of a harmonised insolvency regime at European level.The quality of our institutions is determined by their ability to respond to the challenges they encounter. In its only five years, the SRB has faced quite a few of them, and I am confident to say that, whatever the future may bring, we are better equipped to face it than ever before. We have come quite a long way together and I am proud of the work done by the SRB in close cooperation with the NRAs, as well as of all the expertise and knowledge generated and shared. As I approach the end on my mandate as FROB\u00b4s Chair, my great hope today is that the SRB will emerge from the current threat even stronger and wiser and duly empowered, at all levels, to defend European citizens\u2019 interests in the face of a banking crisis.

Together with the national resolution authorities it forms the Single Resolution Mechanism. The SRB works closely with the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the European Banking Authority and national authorities.

However, the resolution framework put in place after the financial crisis means we have a steadier hand on the tiller. Good planning, the basis of all crisis preparation, helps us to navigate the way forward. And, despite the current uncertainty, the 2020 resolution planning cycle is well on track.Resolution planning is about being prepared to deal with failing banks in a controlled way, in order to protect taxpayers and keep providing critical functions to the economy while preserving financial stability. That\u2019s why resolution plans are updated on an annual basis taking into account changes in the market and in banks themselves, to make sure that there are ready-to-go plans that can be immediately operational if needed.The goal is to ensure that, even if a bank fails, the financial sector remains stable and can keep lending to business and households. Beyond an active role in crisis times, resolution planning will also lead to a banking sector that is better prepared to prevent a crisis and provides incentives for sound bank lending.The 2020 cycle brings all the banks under the SRB\u2019s remit into the same 12-month timetable for the first time. This is in line with the new Banking Package (BRRD2/SRMR2), but it will also ease the process for banks, improve transparency and the quality of resolution plans.When it comes to data reporting for resolution planning, a one-size-fits-all approach doesn\u2019t work, given the complexity and diversity in business models. \u00a0Our reporting requirements include standardised and tailored requests. As a result, our approach to helping to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak also reflects this two-fold approach. I\u2019d like to recognise the efforts made by the banking industry to provide the necessary data for the planning cycle, even while facing the current challenges.The main standard reports needed for updating and improving resolution plans are: the liability data report (LDR); the critical functions report (CFR); the financial markets infrastructure report (FMIR); and the Commission Implementing Regulation (CIR) reports. Banks have submitted almost all of their liability data reports, which allow us to calculate MREL requirements. This is particularly important as the decisions on MREL targets taken in this cycle will be in line with the Banking Package. This means that, according to the transition period in SRMR2, the first binding intermediate target must be complied with by 1 January 2022 and the final target by 1 January 2024.Most banks have also submitted the other information already. Where needed, due to the current crisis, some banks have been given leeway in reporting deadlines (see our recent letter to bank CEOs). It is a good sign that there have not been many such requests from the banks in our remit, which are the largest in Europe. It shows that they are well prepared to continue such operations, even in such a large adverse shock.Updating and continuously improving resolution plans is a shared effort. As well as the contribution of banks themselves, national resolution authorities play a crucial role in the internal resolution teams (IRTs) that will analyse the data and prepare draft plans over the next months. The cycle will end on 31 March 2021, when the MREL target approval process \u2013 including a right-to-be-heard procedure with banks \u2013 and resolution plans are finalised. \u00a0Afterwards, the MREL target decisions and excerpts of the updated resolution plans are communicated to the banks.While the 2020 planning cycle is well under way, we still need to see progress in resolvability overall. We are calling on banks to continue their good work and to invest time and resources in this important aspect for the functioning of financial markets and economies \u2013 making resolvability part of their DNA. Our recently published \u2018Expectations for Banks\u2019 documents sets a phased roadmap towards achieving this.We know that we will not see plain sailing in the economy for some time, but this work sets a firm course towards a financial system that is better able to cope with bank failure. This crisis shows us just how much we need banks to channel resources to support the real economy. We need all hands on deck to maintain financial stability and help support the economic recovery.", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/981"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0013", "date": "2020-06-02", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Financial Institutions Conference by UniCredit - Speech by SRB Board Member Sebastiano Laviola", "text": "CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY IntroductionGood afternoon and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. Today\u2019s subject \u2013 The future of European Banking regulation in the aftermath of Covid-19 \u2013 is indeed a very important one. Making predictions has become even more challenging in the uncertain times we are living in. In my introductory remarks I will try to outline the response to date and possible implications for banks and regulators.1. The impact of Covid-19 on the economy and financial marketsCovid-19 can be represented as an exogenous and symmetric shock for global and EU economies.The Covid-19 shock has reverberated across financial markets; the Euro Stoxx 600 and the Euro Stoxx banks indices have respectively dropped by 20% and 41% since the third week of February. EU Bank share prices are currently priced 38% lower than in December 2019. The sharp increase in the cost of debt has been a driving factor in the reduction of issuances of euro area banks. In the first quarter of 2020, according to preliminary estimations, banks under the SRB remit issued about\u00a0 36.4 billion euro of MREL instruments, all in January and February. By comparison, in the same quarter of 2019 SRB banks had issued 112 billion euro of MREL instruments.According to the European Commission\u2019s 2020 baseline spring forecast, the euro area economy will contract by 7.7% in 2020 and will recover with a GDP growth of 6.3% in 2021. The ECB medium and severe scenarios are worse. \u00a0If this holds true, this would amount to a far deeper downturn compared to 2009, when euro area GDP had fallen by 4.5%.Although the shock is a symmetric one, it will have asymmetric consequences. Each country has been hit differently. Each country faced COVID-19 with its own economic situation, be it strong or weak; and each country has had its own tailor-made response.However, alongside these national responses, a coordinated European response from the various EU authorities is being put in place. Such a response is needed and will continue to be needed in order to maintain a level-playing field and find our way out of this crisis \u2013 together.\u00a0In short, the situation is serious, but we are not taking the economic impacts lying down. Steps have already and are being taken to overcome the economic shocks - at national and at EU level.Despite the severity of the crisis, we\u00a0 also see signs of green shoots.\u00a0 It is good to note that in more recent weeks bank issuances have restarted, although being in the bottom range of their \u201cnormal\u201d values. We also observed a recent issuance of an Additional Tier 1 instrument, which was missing on the market since the end of February. So, now let us look at the policy response to help encourage these green shoots and overcome the challenges ahead.2. The policy responsesAn unprecedented number of policy measures at national and EU level have been put in place since March. The policy responses to the pandemic outbreak were essential to preserve financial stability and support economic recovery.In the banking sector, there has been good coordination between regulators across the EU. The EBA and ECB banking supervision have played an important role; banks have been allowed to operate below the level of capital defined by the Pillar 2 guidance and encouraged to use their capital buffers. The SSM and EBA also recommended that, until at least October 2020, banks should not distribute dividends to shareholders for the 2019 and 2020 annual reporting periods, and refrain from share buy-backs aimed at remunerating shareholders. An amended approach in the application of the IFRS9 international accounting standard was also recommended, in order to avoid excessive volatility of loan loss provisioning.Several macroprudential authorities have also provided capital relief so that banks can also maintain the supply of credit to the real economy. Besides the release of the Countercyclical Capital Buffer, other buffers have been lowered across the Banking Union, in particular the Systemic Risk and O-SII Buffers.Furthermore, the European Commission recently proposed some modifications to the banking package aimed at facilitating lending during the Covid-19 crisis; a Communication clarified and encouraged the full use of the flexibility embedded in the regulatory and accounting framework as well as targeted amendments to the Capital Requirements Regulation.Clearly, there is much work ongoing in order to deal with the economic fallout from the virus.3. The SRB\u2019s responseThe SRB has also been playing its part. At the SRB, we have been carefully monitoring the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on banks and financial markets and have joined European and national competent authorities in their efforts to alleviate the immediate operational burden on banks.We have announced that we remain committed to working on the 2020 resolution plans and issuing 2020 MREL decisions according to the planned deadlines in early 2021. However, we have applied a pragmatic and flexible approach and postponed less urgent information or data requests, in line with the EBA\u2019s recommendations.The banking industry has achieved a lot in resolution planning in recent years and it is in our collective interest that this work continues. Good planning, the basis of crisis preparation, helps us to navigate the way forward and to continue making progress towards resolvability. In line with the new banking package, the 2020 planning cycle foresees that all SRB banks are subject to the same 12-month timetable. Notwithstanding the impact of the crisis and the remaining uncertainty, the 2020 cycle is well on track.\u00a0Turning to the minimum requirement on own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL), the banking industry has made substantial progress in building up MREL and is overall in a good position today. At the same time, we are committed to ensuring that short-term MREL constraints do not prevent banks from lending to businesses and the real economy.As regards existing binding targets, the SRB has announced that it will take a forward-looking approach to banks that may face difficulties in meeting those targets before new MREL decisions under the banking package take effect, with intermediate binding targets in 2022 and final targets in 2024. The SRB will continue to monitor carefully market conditions and will assess the potential impact on transition periods needed for the build-up of MREL. We are ready to use the flexibility allowed by the regulatory framework to adapt transition periods and interim targets applied to banking groups, as well as to adjust MREL targets in line with capital requirements, in particular with the changed capital buffers.We believe that this approach provides banks with the flexibility they may need in the coming months, as well as ensuring a level playing field. At the same time, our collective work on resolvability should carry on to preserve financial stability and protect taxpayers.4. Banks and regulatorsEuro area banks entered this crisis in a much better shape than they were at the beginning of the previous one. According to a recent report by the EBA, at the end of 2019 banks\u2019 common equity tier 1 was about 15% of risk weighted assets, from 9% in 2009; the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was well above the regulatory minimum of 100%, standing at around 150% on average; asset quality has constantly improved in the past years., with the Non-Performing-Loan (NPL) ratio decreasing to much lower levels. The progress made on MREL requirements provides banks with a greater degree of resolvability. Resolution plans have challenged banks to increase their crisis preparedness. Recent ECB data show that in this early phase of the crisis, banks, helped by their strengthened resilience, have faced the significant increase in the demand for loans without a sizeable tightening of credit standards compared with past crises[1].Nevertheless, the fallout from the pandemic will likely determine significant losses and exercise pressure on banks\u2019 profitability. A sensitivity analysis conducted by the EBA on the basis of the 2018 stress test indicates that credit risk losses could have an impact on EU banks\u2019 CET1 ratios ranging between around 230 basis points and 380\u00a0basis points[2]. Based on these preliminary results, the banking sector would still have on average enough capital after loss absorption of about 1.1% of RWAs above the overall capital requirements. Government guarantees on bank loans coupled with supervisory relief measures are also expected to soften the impact on credit risk.However, these results have to be interpreted with caution, given the overall uncertainty on the severity of the crisis, the length of the recession and the speed of the recovery, which will be uneven across countries and sectors. In particular, it is expected that NPLs will increase substantially notwithstanding all the support measures taken, although banks are certainly more resilient than in 2008. The impact of the crisis will also make more evident the problems of banks with unviable business models. We can say that this situation is not going to make banks that were already weak pre-Covid-19 any stronger. To be clear, the extraordinary support measures put in place by all the authorities are meant in the first place to support households and corporates, not to allow banks with unsound business models to survive. The requests to improve profitability, enhance cost efficiency, accelerate digitalisation become therefore even more important.As concerns the implications for regulators, in line with the principles developed by the Financial Stability Board[3] and endorsed by G20 Finance Ministers in April, European authorities have shown a remarkable degree of coordination on the various measures taken to mitigate the impact of the crisis and facilitate the recovery; they have also exploited in the best way the flexibility embodied in the current regulatory framework. Another implication concerns the importance of not rolling back the regulatory reforms or compromising on the underlying objectives of existing international standards. Indeed, the progress made with the introduction of tighter banking regulation since the last crisis a decade ago has proven vital in the current one; the greater resilience of the financial system is also the result of the lessons learnt with the great financial crisis.Conclusion \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, I am hopeful that the occurrence of such a sudden economic crisis on a large scale will bring new momentum to addressing some of the remaining gaps in the framework, such as the completion of the Banking Union and a genuine Capital Markets Union. This would allow bank lending to circulate on a truly cross-border basis.We need to establish a European deposit insurance in the first place. The present crisis, like the past one, again shows the need for decisive action towards harmonization to avoid ring-fencing and fragmentation along national lines. The enhancement of cross-border banking would improve private risk-sharing and access to low-cost banking services.Furthermore, we still lack a credible solution for liquidity in resolution and the operationalisation of the common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund, as well as an alignment between resolution and insolvency frameworks, including a European bank liquidation regime for small and medium size banks, similar, for example, to the administrative regime in place in the US.I am confident that by working together over the coming months we will keep our banking sector safe and sound.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your attention.[1] The euro area bank lending survey \u2013 First quarter of 2020, European Central Bank.

The consultation took place between 17 February and 6 March 2020. MREL is one of the key tools in resolvability, ensuring that banks maintain a minimum amount of equity and debt to support an effective resolution. In line with the new Banking Package (BRRD2/SRMR2), the policy covers: MREL requirements for Global Systemically Important institutions (G\u2011SIIs); Changes to the calibration of MREL, including introducing MREL based on the leverage ratio; Changes to the quality of MREL (subordination); Dedicated rules for certain business models, such as cooperatives, and for resolution strategies, such as multiple point of entry (MPE); Provisions on internal MREL Clarifications on third-country issuances; How these changes will be phased in.\u00a0 MREL decisions implementing the new framework will be taken based on this policy in the 2020 resolution planning cycle. The decisions will be communicated to banks in early 2021. These decisions will replace those issued under the previous legal framework. Each new decision will set out two binding MREL targets, including those for subordination: the binding intermediate target to be met by 1 January 2022 and the fully calibrated MREL (final target) to be met by 1 January 2024.\u00a0 Most comments to the consultation focused on MREL calibration. Respondents also asked for clarification on certain aspects, including the scope of entities for internal MREL, the scope of cooperatives and the eligibility of liabilities issued under third-country law. The feedback statement, also published today, provides clarification on these and other areas, as well as the SRB\u2019s responses to comments raised in the consultation. \u00a0 The SRB acknowledges the challenges that banks face in the current and unprecedented situation related to the Covid-19 pandemic, and that their focus is on business continuity and supporting the economy. For the existing binding MREL targets (set in the 2018 and 2019 cycles), the SRB will take a forward-looking approach for banks that may face difficulties meeting those targets, before new decisions take effect. \u00a0In the 2020 resolution planning cycle, MREL targets will be set according to the transition period in SRMR2, i.e. setting the first binding intermediate target for compliance by 2022 and the final target by 2024. The decisions will be based on recent MREL data, and reflect changing capital requirements.

These criteria are laid down in the SRM Regulation and the SRB has published its policy on its website. In a nutshell: resolution is for the few, not the many. For smaller, less significant banks, insolvency will be the procedure at play if and when they fail.Our experience to date has laid bare the need to find a solution for those medium-sized banks that are too \u201csmall\u201d to meet the PIA, but possibly too \u201clarge\u201d to be placed in insolvency.The SRB has been clear that the harmonization of insolvency regimes for banks is a necessary end-goal. However, it is unlikely to be achieved in the short-term. The creation of a centralized administrative liquidation tool may be more feasible in the short-medium term, and would address many of the issues identified for medium-sized banks, with insolvency tools remaining available for smaller banks.Such a liquidation tool could be created by amending the BRRD, SRMR and DGSD, and could provide for the powers to transfer (some) assets and liabilities in an orderly liquidation, much in line with current resolution tools. In the Banking Union, this could be entrusted to a central authority. As a first step, the SRB\u2019s toolbox could be enriched with a \u201cpre-liquidation tool\u201d, allowing the application of resolution tools to save the good part of a bank without entering into liquidation, or without requiring a specific liquidation regime at European level.The FDIC is a useful comparison, as it highlights the advantages of the purchase and assumption tool (P&A) for liquidation, which was used for the majority of US bank failures in the last decade. The FDIC\u2019s experience also shows the benefits of having a centralized authority with harmonized resolution and insolvency procedures, P&A tools and Deposit Guarantee competences.By contrast, in the current patchwork of DGSs operating in the Banking Union, only some allow transfers of deposits as \u201calternative measures\u201d to pay-outs, raising challenges around arbitrage, level-playing field and coordination.A centralized authority could enhance coordination across DGSs and enable a more effective management of bank failures. As the US experience shows, the use of transfer tools could reduce the cost of failure and overall impact on the DGS system.Finally, it would help reduce moral hazard, by removing the need for Member States to provide liquidation aid, thereby better protecting taxpayers\u2019 money. This does not come free. However, based on adequate capital levels and clear rules, authorities should be able to find solutions early enough to secure functions that are critical to the franchise and minimize losses.A centralized liquidation regime in the EU would address the current gap in the framework for medium-sized banks and improve the overall system: a further step towards the completion of the Banking Union that policymakers ought to explore further.", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/972"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0019", "date": "2020-05-05", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Speech by Elke K\u00f6nig to European Parliament ECON Committee", "text": "CHECK AGAINST DELIVERYIntroductionDear Chair, Honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, good morning;I want to thank you for the opportunity to address your committee, albeit remotely. First of all, I hope that you and your loved ones are safe and well at this time.The Context of COVID These are unprecedented times, as governments and parliaments take decisive measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 and save lives. Those measures are of course having a knock-on effect on other areas, including the economy. At this stage, we do not know the full and final impact on the economy. We do not know how long the pandemic will last, nor how quickly the economy will recover. COVID-19 and its economic impact in the medium term is a very large \u2018known-unknown\u2019.This is also true for the impact on the financial industry and, in particular, on banks.\u00a0 The good news is, we have much firmer foundations in place across Europe today than during the financial crisis a decade ago. We have built up a certain level of resilience and, like all financial regulatory authorities across the EU, we at the SRB are closely monitoring developments. The decisive actions taken by national governments, the European Commission, the ECB and the SRB in recent weeks should make us confident that the banking sector can stand the impact of COVID-19. That being said, this is an unprecedented and evolving situation, so together with the SSM we are carefully monitoring all of the banks under our remit. \u00a0While for the overall industry we cannot yet say precisely what the impact of COVID-19 will be, we can say that this situation is not going to make banks that were already weak pre-COVID-19 any stronger.Let me start with a personal and an operational comment first: I am really glad that the new Vice-Chair and the two new Board Members joined on March 1 so that we can tackle any challenge with a fully staffed board. The present situation has shown that the SRB is able to continue its work, even in exceptional circumstances, with almost all our staff working remotely for the best part of two months at this stage. Banks, too, have shown resilience. They are continuing to function in this unprecedented crisis-type environment. Despite the restrictions, the financial system continues to operate as normal, providing confidence to consumers and ensuring that essential services can continue to be provided.Just as the banks have continued to function, so, too, the SRB has been able to carry on with our normal activities, in order to strengthen the resolvability of the banking system. I\u2019d like to address a few of those activities before reflecting on COVID-19 related topics.\u00a0\u00a0Main SRB activities in recent monthsExpectations for Banks In early April, we published our \u201cExpectations for Banks\u201d document. This document is not a new set of policies, it simply compiles the SRB\u2019s work until today in a single document. It expresses clear and concrete expectations towards banks on how they should make themselves resolvable in various domains. As such it provides guidance, best practice and benchmarking - for the banks and for the SRB\u2019s assessment of banks\u2019 resolvability. Considering best practice in risk management and governance, it is fair to say that the requirements spelled out in the \u201cExpectations for Banks\u201d should not come as a surprise to any responsible bank management.Nevertheless it is a \u2018one-stop\u2019 guide for industry to help build resolvability. And let me re-iterate an earlier statement: it is for the banks to make themselves resolvable. Here the SRB is fully aligned with its international counterparts. It would be a myth to believe that a resolution authority could set and implement the relevant processes for each individual bank. The resolution authority can and will assess the adequacy of measures taken by banks, not more, not less.Priority letters Like in previous years the banks under our remit have received so-called SRB\u2019s priority letters, an annual tailor-made letter, which emphasises the priorities each bank should focus on individually in order to make themselves resolvable. These priority letters use the \u201cExpectations for Banks\u201d as a new reference point. The clear guidance expressed by the priority letters will be followed by our assessment of the progress made. Based on this assessment the SRB will - if need be - trigger substantive impediment procedures, in case banks do not make sufficient progress on becoming resolvable.To pre-empt a question that might be raised by you, let me explain why the SRB has not yet started a formal process to remove substantive impediments for any of the banks under our remit. We have always stated that resolvability is a multi-year-journey. The SRB thus started by pointing out concerns and asking banks to address these topics in their work programs step by step. In some areas we also have to acknowledge that relevant guidance first needed to be developed. So far we see the industry making reasonable progress in general, but rest assured that the SRB stands ready to use its powers where needed.SRF We continue working to build up the Single Resolution Fund. On the 15 April, the SRB Board decided that the amount to be collected for the 2020 ex-ante contributions from 3 066 institutions would be \u20ac9.1 billion. This means that by the end of next month, we will be on track to have collected about two-thirds of the final target amount of monies for the SRF, in total \u20ac42 billion. As a reminder, the target is approximately \u20ac60 billion plus by 31 December 2023.Resolution Planning Cycle & MREL A word now on the 2020 resolution planning cycle and why it is important in these unprecedented times. The 2020 cycle started last month. This year\u2019s cycle will align resolution planning for all banks under the remit of the SRB to the same 12-month cycle again. Not only does this change implement the new provisions of the Banking Package, but we also believe that it will facilitate the resolution planning process for banks and improve the quality of the resolution plans.\u00a0--------The SRB works closely together with all relevant authorities \u2013 the NRAs, the ECB and the Commission; but we are also working with our international counterparts in monitoring and addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.We have adopted a pragmatic common-sense approach as required by current circumstances by postponing less urgent reporting and thus providing operational relief. As regards existing MREL binding targets, the SRB is taking a forward-looking approach to banks that may face difficulties meeting those targets before new decisions, as part of the 2020 resolution cycle, take effect. While being vigilant on the implementation of the current MREL decisions, our focus thus, aims at upcoming 2020 decisions with the updated targets. We asked banks to continue to make efforts to provide the necessary data on MREL for the upcoming cycle. I\u2019m pleased to state that banks were able to comply. This approach regarding MREL binding targets is in line with decisions announced by other European authorities not to impede banks to continue supporting lending to households and firms and, therefore, the real economy in the middle of the pandemic.So far, so good but, as I stated, the impact of COVID-19 on the financial industry is a large \u201cknown \u2013 unknown\u201d today. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the \u2018imposition\u2019 of tighter banking regulations since the last crisis a decade ago will stand us in good stead. In particular, the resolution plans, that are now inbuilt into banks\u2019 business models, mean that overall the banking sector is more resilient. As stated in the past, resolution planning has a preventive component, too. With banks actively focussing on resolvability they will be far better equipped to weather a critical situation and thus avoid to fail.PIA\u00a0 In case a bank fails or is likely to fail the so called \u201cPublic Interest Assessment\u201d is decisive for the SRB\u2019s decision whether to resolve a bank. In the past the SRB decided in certain cases that banks that were failing should not be resolved and these banks were therefore subject to national insolvency procedures. These decisions were always based on case-specific reasoning, financial stability being a core consideration. It goes without saying that Covid-19 is an unprecedented situation and we will of course have to reflect it in our decisions, if need be.A robust framework The SRB tool box is sufficient to address failing banks and I firmly believe that the current resolution framework is fit for purpose \u2013 though of course nothing is so good that it cannot be improved. In any case, the SRB will always take a pragmatic approach to overcome new challenges. We are committed to ensuring that short-term constraints do not prevent banks from lending to households, business and the real economy while at the same time ensuring that banks make progress on the journey towards resolvability.There is much discussion at the moment about further aid to be considered if and when banks get under financial stress due to the current unprecedented situation. This also includes a discussion of so called \u201cprecautionary recapitalisation of banks\u201d. This tool has been used once in 2017 and triggered then some reflection to clarify and tighten it. Indeed, it is available within the legal framework, but only under strict conditions to avoid that it is given to banks without a sound business model to address legacy issues \u2013 it cannot and should not be turned into a bail-out in disguise. To be clear: the nature of the current crisis prompts extraordinary public support to the real economy. The need for such extraordinary public support being extended to the financial sector must be carefully assessed as a response to the adverse losses eventually caused directly by the sudden halt of the real economy without undermining the core objectives and features of our resolution framework.There seems to be also some discussion about the need for a European Bad Bank. This is a concept that was floated in 2017 and we were more than sceptical at that time, and this has not changed. The reasons are manifold: starting from valuation and not ending with questions of management and disposal of such a mixed basket. In recent years some national bad bank concepts have emerged that look more promising to me; but even here numerous questions remain.Outstanding issues Dear honourable members, dear Chair, in this time of crisis, there are still a number of areas I would urge you to promote and encourage.The occurrence of a sudden economic crisis on a large scale should be a vivid reminder that we must not lose sight of completing the Banking Union in so it can operate at its full potential. I\u2019m sure that the completion of the Banking Union would in itself also account for an efficient response to the unfolding crisis by allowing bank lending to circulate on a truly cross-border basis. This would thus amplify the cushion for those businesses and households most impacted by COVID-19.We still lack a European deposit insurance scheme and a credible solution for liquidity in resolution, while the operationalisation of the common backstop to the SRF is still pending. We also need to see the completion of the Capital Markets Union and a better alignment between the resolution framework and insolvency, including a common liquidation regime for banks under SRB remit and a harmonised procedure for withdrawing a banking licence. These are areas that need to be worked on and will help shore the European financial system in the medium to long term.Conclusion Dear honourable members, dear chair, we have seen the commitment and care shown by so many workers and volunteers right across Europe in these past few weeks as they work to save lives. Although our work is not comparable to that of those on the frontline, in our own way \u2013 we at the SRB, together with you \u2013 have a responsibility to the people of Europe to continue our work in a dedicated and diligent way. It is vital we continue with our work to promote financial stability and protect the taxpayer.\u00a0A firm foundation for financial stability is in place, but we have to continue our work to make sure that the foundation stays intact, in order to allow Europe\u2019s peoples to come out of this crisis and return to normal life as soon as possible.I wish you \u2013 and all of those listening or watching \u2013 good health.Thank you.", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/978"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0020", "date": "2020-04-24", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Eurofi article by Elke K\u00f6nig - Closer international cooperation as the basis for mutual trust", "text": "Trust among authorities is the main driver to overcome ring-fencing attemptsResolution strategies for banking groups with subsidiaries in several countries can follow either a single point of entry (SPE) or a multiple point of entry (MPE) approach. For groups with centralized structures, resolution authorities (RAs) will likely opt for an SPE approach and apply resolution tools at the parent level, while groups with a sufficiently decentralized structure may be subject to an MPE strategy.SPE relies on the concept that the parent, being the resolution entity, will be the object of any resolution action. This allows for the efficient allocation of resources within a group in going concern; in gone concern, the upstreaming of losses and downstreaming of resources from subsidiaries and maintaining critical functions must be secured.By contrast, an MPE strategy would be considered if a bank\u2019s structure is based on reasonably independent - in particular \u201cself-funded\u201d - entities or sub-groups. This would result in multiple, operationally independent resolution entities within a group that may be resolved without affecting the other entities or sub-groups. The prevention of contagion entails a challenging trade-off between banks not being fully decentralized in going concern for operational or supervisory reasons, but entirely separable in a resolution event, as outlined in a recent article by Antonio Carrascosa.The Banking Package strengthens the feasibility and credibility of implementing SPE, by requiring RAs to set internal MREL and TLAC requirements, which should facilitate loss absorption within a group. However, the new provisions also provide for a high level of pre-positioning of internal MREL, potentially leading to locked-in capital. It is too early to judge the consequences, but the SRB is concerned that this de facto ring-fencing within the EU might reduce substantially the needed financial flexibility at parent level.Ring-fencing can increase risks and hamper resolvability, by trapping funds in different parts of the group, thereby not allowing for the optimal allocation of capital, resources and bail-inable liabilities within a group. In contrast, host countries fear that they might have to foot the bill if the subsidiary of a foreign banking group in their jurisdiction were to fail.For this reason, we encourage policymakers to take forward concrete work on a legally enforceable group insolvency support mechanism for banking groups. These measures should apply to banking groups in Europe, but concrete solutions are also needed at FSB level. In the meantime, the SRB has made \u201cbail-in playbooks\u201d a priority of its work since 2018 and is focussing on credible and executable plans to upstream losses and downstream capital within a group, if need be.Moreover, the SRB strives to further enhancing mutual understanding among RAs in the Banking Union and beyond. We are dedicating considerable efforts to reaching joint decisions on MREL and involving not least NRAs outside the Banking Union with material subsidiaries in determining resolution strategies. Similarly, the SRB has enhanced cooperation with third countries through cooperation agreements, workshops and multilateral simulation exercises. We remain convinced that trust among authorities is the main driver to overcome ring-fencing attempts.", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/971"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0021", "date": "2020-03-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "SRB update: coronavirus mitigation measures", "text": "Following European Commission and Belgian government decisions, SRB staff is teleworking as from Monday, March 16 until further notice.

The decision has been published today on the SRB's website, while a summary of the decision will also be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\u201cThis decision now closes the process of analysing whether insolvency would have meant a better outcome for affected shareholders and creditors of BPE,\u201d said SRB Chair, Elke K\u00f6nig. \u201cIt is clear that this is not the case. I understand this will be disappointing for those who have lost out, however it proves that the resolution framework is effective and shielded the taxpayer from losses and financial instability.\u201dBPE was resolved on 7 June 2017, following the European Central Bank's (ECB) assessment that it was failing or likely to fail. The SRB decided that resolution was in the public interest in order to protect depositors and prevent instability in the financial system and the Spanish national resolution authority (FROB) implemented the decision at a national level. The bank was sold to Banco Santander, S.A.. The services provided by BPE to its customers continued as normal after resolution.A main principle of the European resolution framework is that no creditor should receive worse treatment than if the resolved bank was wound up under normal insolvency proceedings on the resolution date. An independent valuer analysed hypothetical insolvency scenarios in the so-called Valuation 3 report. It found that they would not have been better off if the bank had gone into insolvency proceedings on the same date.On 6 August 2018, the SRB published a preliminary decision that no compensation was required and opened a \u2018right to be heard' process allowing affected shareholders and creditors to express their views and provide reasoning as to why they may not agree with the preliminary decision and its underlying reasoning.The SRB reviewed 2,856 submissions from parties who registered and were verified to take part in the process. The independent valuer was also asked to provide its independent views on the comments related to the Valuation 3 report. As outlined in the decision, the comments included in these submissions covered a number of aspects, including the independence of the valuer and the content of the Valuation 3 report.Following this analysis, the SRB adopted its final decision, which was addressed to FROB, as the national resolution authority that implemented the resolution decision.

The pandemic is having a severe effect on people\u2019s health and the global economy. The SRB, like all other organisations and companies, is experiencing some of the impact of the situation first-hand, while continuing to carry out its work remotely.Likewise, I know that banks are working hard to ensure business continuity and services to their customers, focusing on core operations and critical functions, as well as on protecting their employees\u2019 health.Now more than ever, European and international coordination and collaboration is key. The SRB supports the steps that the ECB, SSM and national competent authorities are taking to help banks deliver their services to the real economy, and in particular to keep lending.This is a completely new experience for us all. However, we can take some heart that since the last financial crisis we have put in place stronger supervision and coordination to be able to respond together. The banking sector today relies on more robust capital and liquidity buffers, which allows it to be part of the solution for keeping the economy moving now and once the crisis ends.The SRB\u2019s approach is to support the banks where necessary with operational relief measures, using the flexibility in the resolution framework and building on the work done so far and the close contact between our teams and the banks under our remit. We can do this without compromising our ongoing focus on resolution planning, with the aim of making banks resolvable.That\u2019s why we are introducing measures to alleviate the immediate operational burden on the banks under our remit, to allow breathing room to focus their efforts on supporting the economy. We are taking these pragmatic and flexible measures following input from the industry and our financial stability peers, and they have been communicated to all banks under our remit.The SRB, together with the national resolution authorities, will postpone less urgent information or data requests related to the upcoming 2020 resolution planning cycle. In light of the challenges posed by resource constraints and adverse market conditions, we are ready to address any issues in relation to specific requirements with the banks under our remit on an individual basis.We also take note of the measures adopted by authorities to provide capital relief to banks in support of the economy. Of course, we will reflect this in our future MREL decisions. In addition, the SRB continues to carefully monitor the market conditions and will assess the potential impact on transition periods needed for the build-up of MREL.At the same time, the SRB\u2019s continued focus is on supporting financial stability and bank resolvability. It will continue its work on resolution planning and the preparation for issuing 2020 MREL decisions according to the set deadlines in early 2021. A clear picture of the banks\u2019 build-up of MREL continues to be key to resolvability. However, if needed, there will be more leeway on submission dates for some less urgent reports, such as those related to critical functions.Now more than ever, we need to continue to build on the progress that the industry and authorities have made towards resolvability in recent years. This makes our financial system more stable and stronger to cope with the crisis. The resolution framework and the build-up of MREL will be important tools to help support the economic recovery and a strong banking sector.", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/966"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0024", "date": "2020-04-01", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Letter to banks under the SRB's remit on potential operational relief measures related to the COVID-19 outbreak", "text": "Letter from SRB Chair Elke K\u00f6nig\u00a0to banks under the SRB's remit, outlining potential operational relief measures related to the COVID-19 outbreak.", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/965"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0025", "date": "2020-04-01", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "SRB publishes key bank resolution policy: Expectations for Banks", "text": "The Single Resolution Board (SRB) today publishes its final \u2018Expectations for Banks\u2019 document, along with an overview of SRB responses to the industry consultation.

That\u2019s a painful finding on various levels. Arguably the financial sector lost the trust of the general public during the crisis. But there is more to this. Nowadays, people, especially the young generations, have ample choice of where and how they get information and which sources they trust. Generally they trust those who speak to them in relatable language. Those who use unfamiliar technical jargon will not be understood and not be trusted.There is a clear co-relation between accessible information, good explanation and speaking people\u2019s language on one hand, and customers and businesses making informed decisions and confident choices on the other. Greater understanding leads to greater trust. That\u2019s why regulators and supervisors also need to explain and communicate what, why and how they do what they do beyond their immediate stakeholders\u2014banks, investors and markets. No doubt that is a challenge. Why would the general public need to know about\u2014let alone be interested in\u2014some new regulation or supervisory guidance for banks when the economy is humming along and the banking sector seems more or less stable? Many authorities assume that surely it is sufficient that the banks, investors and markets are informed. \u00a0But that\u2019s not enough.During the financial crisis, people not only lost confidence in the banks, but also in the regulatory and supervisory system. Events such as the Icesave crisis that hit UK and Dutch depositors particularly harsh or the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis that\u2014among others\u2014financially ruined \u00a0Norwegian municipalities, \u00a0made people doubt that the system was prepared for these global effects. The European Union responded by creating institutions on the European level to move toward a more harmonised and consistent system. It is now up to regulators and supervisors to explain the advantages of this system, the objectives and outcomes of their activities, and how it all benefits Europe\u2019s citizens.The public at large, which includes depositors, borrowers, savers, investors and entrepreneurs, should have a good understanding of how their banks are regulated, who keeps taps on them, and how. The more people generally understand how regulatory and supervisory institutions function, and what they do, the more they will understand what these \u2018watchdogs\u2019 are\u2014or should be\u2014doing during\u00a0 periods of crisis. And if these institutions function as they should during a crisis, then people will come to recognize that and continue to trust them.The often-cited appeal to \u201cmend the roof while the sun is shining\u201d, which in the first instance refers to policy action and crisis preparedness, can be extended to transparency and communications. Maintaining a steady flow of information and explanation to the public at large during non-crisis times, in accessible language and through engaging communications, will prepare the ground for more effective communications during periods of crisis.Incidentally, many authorities are doing exactly that with initiatives\u2014such as this blog by the SRB\u2014to provide an answer to the simple question of why people should care. Efforts range from regular features explaining topics in an accessible manner \u2013 with visuals and simple language \u2013 to close cooperation with schools and universities to improve financial literacy. Digital innovation offers ample opportunities to reach different audiences, especially the younger generation. For example, in ECB Banking Supervision, we are tailoring information to newcomers via our feature \u201cSupervision.Explained.\u201d\u00a0We also offer more contextual information to the banking industry through our \u201cSupervision Newsletter\u201d\u00a0and we provide detailed data, documents and disclosure for the experts via dedicated webpages on core tasks such as the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process.Most regulators and supervisors are legally required to be transparent and accountable, effective communications, however, goes beyond what is required. They need to make an effort to understand their audiences so they can make themselves understood. That will help build credibility and trust. Of course, the decisive ingredient for any authorities\u2019 credibility is its activities\u2014its policies and operations. So they should do what they say and say what they do. Because the more the public understands, the better it can engage\u2014whether it is through support or probing questions. Either way, we should welcome this engagement. Lifting public engagement on financial matters above the pain threshold of going to the dentist should be doable.About the SRB blog: The blog is a forum, purely for informational purpose, for the views of the Single Resolution Board\u2019s (SRB) Members , Staff (SRB) or other officials from the ECB, or EU institutions, etc. as well as of guest writers from academia, on current financial and policy issues.

Different voices, different opinions, all the more Insights.Back to basicsFinancial imbalances and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008, lead to a financial crisis of unprecedented scale. The public had to pay over a thousand billion euros to prop up failing banks. Concretely, losses between 2007 and 2010 were almost 1 trillion euros or 8% of the EU GDP (IMF) and the approved state aid measures in the form of recapitalisation and asset relief between 2008 and 2010, adding guarantees, amounted to 1.6 trillion or 13% of the EU GDP (Commission). And this was in the EU alone. Globally the sheer scale of the crisis was massive and repercussions last until today.As the financial crisis unfolded, it became clear that deeper integration of the banking system and a response to problems, such as ring fencing and the too-big-to-fail issue was needed to make the Eurozone viable for the long term. That is why the EU institutions agreed to establish a single supervisory mechanism (SSM) and a single resolution mechanism (SRM) for banks. The banking union applies to countries in the euro area. Non-euro area countries can also join and some are actually doing so already.Bank resolution is the orderly wind-down, restructuring, or disposal of a failing bank without financial support from the taxpayers and without significant economic repercussions at the expense of the bank\u2019s shareholders, creditors and the banking sector itself. In other words, those that own, fund or control a bank and benefitted from it in good times should also be the ones suffering the losses in bad times. Not all banks require resolution when they fail. Like other companies, most banks should be able to be wound down under normal insolvency procedures when they fail without dragging financial stability with them. \u00a0How do we actually make resolution work? \u00a0By doing several things:We implement new rules on resolution planning and capital requirementsWe have to clearly communicate with and monitor banks to prepare for their potential failure and put all the necessary work in place that enables us to handle a banks\u2019 potential failureAnd we have also to assess what is working, and what still needs fine-tuning in our framework, as this is a completely new area.Resolution planning and the readiness to execute the resolution strategy cannot be achieved on a \u201cone size fits all\u201d. Diversity of banks and its beneficial effect on economies requires the definition of tailored solutions for each bank \u2013 based on regulation and policies and while preserving proportionality.While we have one common European resolution framework, in the banking union we are faced with 19 different national insolvency laws when winding-down a (cross-border) bank. A set of common standards, practices and harmonised rules for the liquidation of banks would considerably facilitate resolution planning, increase predictability and prevent diverging outcomes in different member states.Not only would common standards ensure centralised decision-making, but also the application of a harmonised and effective toolbox supported by a European deposit insurance.As a further step to a fully-fledged banking union the Commission put forward a proposal for a European deposit insurance scheme (EDIS) in November 2015. This would provide stronger and more uniform insurance cover for all retail depositors in the banking union. This European deposit insurance scheme is the third, final and currently missing pillar of the banking union. It would significantly enhance and improve the framework and improve certainty for citizens across the banking union.A steady pace marathon All of this cannot be done overnight, at the flick of a switch. There is no silver bullet. Banks also need time to adjust to the new realities of resolution, but they must maintain a steady pace in order to reach the finish line. Regulators such as the SRB also need to advance at a steady pace. Our 2020 Work Programme feeds into precisely this.We, at the SRB, work very closely with a whole range of partners, including industry and the other institutions. We are experts in resolution, of course. But we do not have a monopoly on wisdom, so we really value the input and feedback we receive. In this way, we can make resolution work together.Looking aheadThe implementation of the recently adopted Banking Package will have a direct impact on day-to-day resolution planning as it fundamentally revises the MREL framework. Now is not the time to shy away from challenges but rather to take the opportunity and complete the resolution jigsaw while economic conditions are reasonably sound.Let\u2019s make sure we put in place the conditions to make resolution work so that every bank, should the need arise, may be resolved or wound down in a way that maintains financial stability and averts a repeat of the 2008 crisis.About the SRB blog: The blog is a forum, purely for informational purpose, for the views of the Single Resolution Board\u2019s (SRB) Members , Staff (SRB) or other officials from the ECB, or EU institutions, etc. as well as of guest writers from academia, on current financial and policy issues.

After that, they will be treated as third country liabilities and may need additional clauses.The impact of Brexit will be taken into consideration in the resolution planning work of the SRB, for the 2020 resolution planning cycle and beyond.Speaking in Brussels, the SRB Chair, Elke K\u00f6nig said: \u2018There has been a significant lead-in time for Brexit, so bonds issued since 2016 onwards should have relevant clauses included already.

Aptly titled \u201cBank Resolution: Turning Policy into Action\u201d, the conference explored rising challenges to practical resolvability.Pertinent issues identified included completing the Banking Union (BU); the lack of a functioning Capital Markets Union (CMU); the need for a more robust framework around liquidity in resolution; and newfound information technology (IT) issues that impede the efficiency of resolution and operational continuity. In comparing the EU to other jurisdictions, the lack of a European market was flagged repeatedly as cause for concern: With investors still viewing banks on national terms \u2014 i.e. \u201cGerman\u201d versus \u201cItalian\u201d instead of \u201cEuropean\u201d \u2014 the EU is not an appealing market to investors.Conference participants overall agreed that the task of \u201cturning policy into action\u201d is one that can only be achieved through a strong team effort.

On this basis, the SRB will carefully consider its final decision as to whether compensation needs to be granted to the affected shareholders and creditors. The SRB will strive to reach and announce its decision in the coming months.We will continue to provide further updates through our dedicated webpage.BackgroundOn 7 June 2017, the SRB transferred all shares of Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol S.A. (Banco Popular) to Banco Santander S.A (Santander), following the exercise of the write-down and conversion of capital instruments prior to the transfer. This means that Banco Popular continued to operate under normal business conditions as a solvent and liquid member of the Santander Group with immediate effect.Due to its stressed liquidity situation, the European Central Bank (ECB) had decided on 6 June 2017 that Banco Popular was \u201cfailing or likely to fail\u201d and notified the SRB accordingly. The SRB and the Spanish National Resolution Authority \u2013 FROB \u2013 decided that the sale was in the public interest as it protects all depositors of Banco Popular and ensures financial stability. The resolution scheme entered into force on the same day, following the endorsement by the European Commission.On 6 August 2018, the SRB published its preparatory act (SRB Notice) in which it took a preliminary decision that it is not required to compensate affected shareholders and creditors of Banco Popular based on the conclusions of the report of the independent valuer regarding the valuation of difference in treatment (\u201cValuation 3 report\u201d). At the same time, it opened the registration for the right to be heard process. This allowed affected shareholders and creditors to provide reasoning where they do not agree with the preliminary decision and to explain why they consider alternative approaches or assumptions for the normal insolvency proceedings should have been adopted and, if they had been, how in their view these would have affected the final outcome.The SRB collected 2,856 submissions from parties who registered and were verified to take part in the process.

As regulators of the banking sector, part of our remit is to assess and analyse risks, when drawing up resolution plans. Our overarching goal in the resolution field is to safeguard financial stability and at the same time protect the taxpayer from any future bail-outs of a bank that is deemed too big to fail.It is important to underline that financial risks, including those of banks, can be reduced, mitigated or diversified through adequate prudential and risk management rules, but they cannot be annulled at all times. Therefore, regulators and the banking sector have to be aware, understand and put in place adequate measures to mitigate and reduce them to a tolerable extent, including in a forward looking way. In the following remarks, I will take a look at some of the well known vulnerabilities and risks. They concern banks\u2019 profitability, interconnected exposures and exposures to property markets. I will then touch upon some of the issues stemming from the incompleteness of the regulatory and policy framework, in particular the missing pieces to complete the Banking Union.2. Vulnerabilities and risksBefore I get into the risks, a little reflection on the improvements achieved by the industry with respect to some years ago. Since the financial crisis, efforts to make the European banking sector more resilient and sound have clearly brought results. European banks continue to strengthen their capital ratios. In the EU, the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 14.7% in Q2 2019, reaching a new peak since 2014. Significant progress has also been achieved in cleaning up banks\u2019 balance sheets. Indeed, according to the EBA\u00a0 report released a few days ago, the stock of non-performing loans (NPLs) has been falling, with the average ratio of NPLs to total loans reaching its lowest level of about 3% in June 2019 with respect to 6% in June 2015. The average coverage ratio also slightly increased, by a little more than one percentage point (from 43.6% to 44.9%), over the same period. The work has however to be continued, as despite the significant improvement there is still wide dispersion of NPL ratios across countries.Funding challenges abated amid lower funding costs and improved bond market access. Banks\u2019 funding costs have declined year-to-date, driven by expectations of more accommodative monetary policy and receding risk aversion. Yet despite these progresses, the European banking sector remains exposed to old and new risks, with implications for resolution activities.A vulnerability for the euro area financial stability is related to the subdued profitability outlook of the banking sector. In particular, overcapacity and cost inefficiencies weigh on many banks\u2019 long term profitability prospects. In spite of the cyclical recovery observed after the crisis, in the past two years the Return on Equity of euro area banks was between 5 and 6%, a performance behind the returns observed in pre-crisis years and below that of some international peers, like US and Nordic banks; the ROE also falls short of the estimated cost of capital for many banks.The slow progress in improving bank\u2019s cost-efficiency, witnessed by the still high cost-to-income ratio, is one of the main factors behind the low profitability that we still observe. As the IMF and the ECB recently noted, profitability in the euro area is expected to remain low in the medium term also because operating costs for euro area tend to be around 65% of income on average, while Nordic peers continue to have costs close to 55% of income. In this context, the deteriorating growth outlook, the accommodative monetary policy and the associated \u201clower-for-longer\u201d interest rate environment exercise further downward pressure on margins, further restraining profitability. On the other hand, this setting is expected to bring positive effects on the macroeconomic outlook, in turn helping banks to keep impairments low, dispose of and restructure NPLs and increase lending volumes. In any case, the SRB needs banks to be profitable in order for resolvability to work.As a central component of an integrated financial system, EU banks are confronted with risks originated from their interconnection with other sectors of the economy. In particular, elevated levels of public and private sector indebtedness make banks vulnerable to a repricing in EU financial markets. In the event of shocks affecting the real economy (e.g. a recession) EU banks would be affected by higher impairments and losses. EU banks are also increasingly exposed to non-banking financial intermediaries. As an ESRB study found, the exposures of EU banks to shadow banking entities amount to over \u20ac1 trillion, 60% of which comes from entities domiciled outside the EU. For EU banks, this represents a channel for inward spill overs from third jurisdictions.A further aspect to consider relates to exposures to property markets. The maturing cycle in this sector constitutes a financial stability vulnerability for some countries, with risks for banks. Real estate price dynamics have gathered traction for some years and there are growing signs of overvaluation emerging, although the phenomenon is still relatively heterogeneous across countries. The ESRB has recently published a set of country-specific warnings and recommendations on medium-term vulnerabilities in the residential real estate sector. While it has not identified significant direct near-term risks arising from residential real estate exposures of the banking systems of the concerned countries, second-round effects are not excluded in the medium term.3. Completing the Banking Union and deepening the CMUMoving now to the missing pieces to complete the Banking Union - several years have now passed since the financial crisis, yet there are a number of areas that have been addressed only partially.Liquidity in resolution. This is an area where more work is clearly still needed in developing a robust framework. It is a key gap in the current resolution architecture. Yes, the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) could play a role in liquidity provisioning, but this role would of course be limited due to the SRF\u2019s size both during the transition period and even after the target level is reached. While the Common Backstop will cover all uses of the SRF, including liquidity in resolution, this would still not address the liquidity needs of a large bank. Therefore other solutions should be explored.The lack of a proper, harmonised EU liquidation regime is a major obstacle towards a fully-fledged Banking Union. The no-creditor-worse-off principle seeks to ensure that the treatment of creditors in resolution is not worse than the treatment they would have received under normal insolvency proceedings. Currently, with 19 different insolvency frameworks in the Banking Union, the analysis of the insolvency counterfactual for a cross-border bank in resolution is a challenge, and results in diverging outcomes depending on the home country of the institution. This is a risk we must try to overcome.In addition, the \u2018failing or likely to fail\u2019 assessment is not always aligned to the criteria for liquidation at national level and may also lead to different conclusions. At present, there is a type of uncertainty and the situation of the failing bank may end up in a limbo, therefore this needs to be corrected. Indeed, if we could bridge this harmonisation gap, we might see the creation of a European bank liquidation regime. Given the differences across national insolvency regimes, an EU administrative bank liquidation regime endowed with a range of tools - for example, like those of the FDIC \u2013 and with a Deposit Guarantee Scheme able to provide financial support on a least cost basis as an alternative to the pay-out of depositors would be a much more efficient solution. Not only would this ensure centralised decision-making, but it would also allow for the application of a harmonised and effective toolbox, paving the way for a European deposit insurance scheme. Proposals for harmonisation have encountered resistance and will be faced with a long decision-making process, but hopefully this is more about \u201cwhen\u201d than \u201cif\u201d. We are encouraged by recent policy proposals to move forward on bank insolvency harmonization and to break the deadlock on a European deposit insurance system. Therefore, \u00a0we strongly encourage the new Commission and the co-legislators to make this a priority.As well as completing the Banking Union, we must also deepen the Capital Markets Union. A wide range of legislative measures has been finalised in recent years and substantial progress has been achieved under the remit of the CMU Action Plan. These measures are a significant step towards deeper European capital markets and to overcome market fragmentation and structural barriers. However, despite the measures taken so far, EU capital markets are not yet fully integrated. Indeed, they lag behind when compared to certain non-EU jurisdictions, leading to a heavy reliance on bank funding within the EU and a more limited choice for businesses, in particular SMEs, institutional investors and consumers as well as to limited private risk sharing. As a consequence, Member States and the Commission have shown a political desire to push for a further deepening of the CMU, resulting in more developed and integrated capital markets. Efforts should be concentrated in enhancing the access to finance for European companies, especially SMEs; reducing the \u00a0barriers to the efficient functioning of an EU-wide capital market and to increased cross-border capital flows; providing incentives to enable retail savers to invest in capital markets, in particular in long-term investment products, while maintaining a high and proportionate level of investor and consumer protection; supporting the transition to sustainable economies; promoting the harmonization of insolvency legislation.From the SRB\u2019s perspective, it is evident that deep and integrated capital markets would complement the Banking Union contributing positively to a more efficient and resilient financial system, increasing the shock absorbing capacity of the Union due to private risk sharing and diversification of financing channels. By making available a greater pool of resources, this should facilitate the financing of bank capital and other eligible liabilities needed to maintain MREL, the requirement that ensures loss absorbing and recapitalization capacity to restore the banks\u2019 capital position after resolution. In this regard, the new banking package introduces significant innovation to the MREL framework, concerning the quality and quantity of loss-absorbing resources. The framework is not cost-neutral for banks, therefore the compliance with the requirements may constitute an additional challenge, particularly for those banks which are not used to issuing debt in wholesale markets. They should therefore profit of the favourable market conditions to issue MREL compliant liabilities.Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, in the past four years we have made progress and put many of the policies of our political masters into action. By working with the industry, with other public bodies at Member State, EU and international level, we have been successfully reducing the vulnerabilities in the financial sector \u2013 however there are still risks remaining on the horizon.I am confident that by continuing to work together we can tackle the risks and challenges I have outlined, in order to maintain financial stability and protect the taxpayer from bank bail-outs.\u00a0I look forward to our conversation and to taking any questions you may have.Thank you for your attention.\u00a0", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/876"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0037", "date": "2019-11-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Launch of Resolution Reporting Q&A process", "text": "The SRB has set up a dedicated solution for raising questions on the Resolution Reporting.The Q&A process aims at providing support to National Resolution Authorities and institutions subject to the resolution reporting requirements.Details on how to raise questions and access the Q&A Archives are provided on the dedicated webpage.", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/868"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0038", "date": "2019-11-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "SRB statement on European Court judgments annulling 2016 ex-ante contributions decisions for three banks", "text": "The Single Resolution Board (SRB) takes note of yesterday\u2019s judgments of the General Court of the European Union annulling the SRB\u2019s decisions on the 2016 ex-ante contributions of Banco Cooperativo Espa\u00f1ol, Portigon, and Hypo Vorarlberg Bank to the Single Resolution Fund.

We have a key question before us today: How to make resolution work? There is no one answer to this question, there is no silver bullet. However, I am sure that given the range and quality of the panellists this afternoon, we will have some \u2018food for thought\u2019 as we continue the process of making every bank resolvable.The SRB Chair, Elke K\u00f6nig has often said that resolution planning is a marathon, not a sprint. This is very true. It is not something that we can expect banks to do overnight, at the flick of a switch. It takes time \u2013 banks need time to adjust to the new realities of resolution, but they must maintain a steady pace in order to reach the finish line. Regulators such as the SRB also need to advance at a steady pace.To make resolution work, we have to do several things:we have to get on with the job of implementing the rules that our political masters have set out for us.We have to clearly communicate with banks what is coming down the line, and I think at this stage, banks know the direction of travel.And then we have also to assess what is working, and what still needs fine-tuning.We work very closely with a whole range of partners, including industry and the other institutions. We are experts in resolution, sure. But we do not have a monopoly on wisdom, so we really value the input and feedback we receive. In this way, we can make resolution work together.Theme of the Panel So in this session, we have to deal with three items.legal loopholes,institutional implementation challenges andimpediments to practiceLadies and gentlemen, I\u2019m conscious that we have an excellent panel of speakers this afternoon, so I don\u2019t want to take too much time. If I may, I want to touch on just a few points that are important for the SRB in order to make resolution a reality.Harmonisation The first point concerns the need for further harmonisation of insolvency law in the European Union and for an EU administrative bank liquidation framework. the lack of a harmonised EU liquidation regime is an obstacle towards a fully-fledged Banking Union. With nineteen different insolvency frameworks in the Banking Union, the analysis of the insolvency counterfactual for a cross-border bank in resolution is a challenge, and results in diverging outcomes depending on the home country of the institution.Liquidity in Resolution The second point I want to make is on liquidity in resolution. The lack of a liquidity facility to finance banks in resolution is a key gap in the current resolution architecture. Following the resolution weekend, banks are going to be well-capitalised but could possibly lack adequate collateral to enter into secured-financing operations, which are going to be the only source of external liquidity for a resolved bank.While the Common Backstop will cover all uses of the SRF, including liquidity in resolution, this would still not address the liquidity needs of a large bank \u2013 let me be clear about that.We must look at eventually creating a new resolution liquidity framework for the Banking Union.Improving resolvability from a financial continuity perspective is only one of the several dimensions of resolvability covered in SRB Expectations for Banks. This draft document was launched for public consultation last week, and I would encourage you to give your feedback through the SRB website, up until the 4th of December. MREL / Banking Package My third and final point indeed relates to those expectations - what banks themselves need to do in order to become resolvable. There are many strands of work, that we\u2019ll no doubt touch in in the discussion in\u00a0 a moment, but one important area is that of MREL - Loss absorbing and recapitalisation capacity.Among the resolvability elements, the Loss Absorbing Capacity represents the key one to a successful implementation of a resolution strategy. Every year the SRB set a bank-specific level of MREL \u2013 the requirement that ensures sufficient loss absorbing and recapitalization capacity to restore the banks\u2019 capital position after resolution.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The implementation of the recently adopted Banking Package will have a direct impact on day-to-day resolution planning as it fundamentally revises the MREL framework. The Banking Package\u2019s overhaul of the MREL framework brings significant changes to the quality and quantity of loss-absorbing resources, and so the SRB will update its policy accordingly, while working with our stakeholders.The SRB intends to publish by the first quarter of 2020 its final SRMR2/ BRRD2 MREL policy, which will form the basis for MREL setting under the new framework.The MREL framework is not cost-neutral for the banks, as they may need to restructure themselves or their funding structure to comply with the requirements. In particular, building-up MREL could be particularly challenging for banks that have no history in issuing unsecured debt in the wholesale markets. The SRB is fully aware of these challenges and has therefore consistently pursued a gradual approach to MREL \u2013 again in line with the \u2018marathon not a sprint\u2019 analogy. Our approach is to set appropriate transition periods tailored on each banks\u2019 funding ability. Overall, we report that banks are taking opportunity of the favorable market conditions to issue MREL eligible liabilities. So the message to banks is clear - Do it now, while rates are favourable, because you are going to have to get in line soon anyway[1].\u00a0 Conclusions Ensuring resolvability is a process that takes time. The SRB needs solid, profitable banks in order to ensure solid resolution plans. However, we are now 11 years after the crisis, and we see that there is still much work to be done in order to get to the stage where we can confidently say that every bank is resolvable.Thank you for your attention and I look forward to the discussion.\u00a0[1] In the first half of 2019 the gross amount of MREL issued at consolidated level reached \u20ac187bn [source: internal quarterly MREL monitoring].", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/873"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0040", "date": "2019-12-03", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Speech by Elke K\u00f6nig to European Parliament ECON Committee", "text": "Check against delivery\u00a0IntroductionDear Chair, Honourable Members, Ladies and Gentlemen,Thank you for the invitation, and congratulations dear Chair on your recent election. We have a shared vested interest in making sure that Europe\u2019s resolution regime is as strong and as effective as possible \u2013 a resolution regime that works to protect the European taxpayer.\u00a0I\u2019d like to start with a look at the current areas of priority for the SRB, and then speak a little about the SRB\u2019s priorities for 2020 as we move into a new decade in little over a month\u2019s time.The Banking Package Dear Chair, honourable members, a word on the Banking Package. The implementation of this package will be a major priority for the months ahead.\u00a0We are finalising the 2018/19 planning cycle under the BRRD1. By the year-end, nearly all banks will have binding targets at group level, and where relevant at entity level too.The Banking Package strengthens the resolution framework, but also poses implementation challenges for the SRB. The package introduced the Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirement of the Financial Stability Board into European Union Law. This new requirement applies to G-SIIs, and aligns the MREL framework with the FSB\u2019s TLAC minimum requirements.G-SIIs, \u201cTop Tier banks\u201d with total assets exceeding \u20ac100bn, as well as certain other banks chosen by the respective national resolution authority will need to hold a minimum part of their MREL in subordinated resources. All other banks are not subject to mandatory minimum levels of subordination, but the SRB may require an amount of subordination in order to avoid a breach of the No-Creditor-Worse-Off principle. Please let\u2019s keep in mind that all banks under our remit have to become resolvable.The new legislation requires banks to move from individual to internal MREL requirements. Subsidiaries should issue eligible instruments within the resolution group, directly or indirectly to the resolution entity. These instruments would be written down or converted into equity, and losses of these subsidiaries would thus be up-streamed to the resolution entity when the non-resolution entities reach the point of non-viability, without formally placing these entities into resolution. This only applies to non-resolution entities and mainly in the context of Single Point of Entry or SPE, the main concept for G-SIIs or other significant banks.The building up of MREL is of course very important for our resolution planning. MREL is possibly the most well-known condition for making banks resolvable by ensuring they have sufficient funds to absorb losses and be recapitalised - thereby replacing the need for a taxpayer-funded bail-out with a privately financed \u201cbail-in\u201d. That is why it is one of our most important policies. The SRB has taken a gradual, multi-year approach to MREL, with the goal of maintaining proportionality in the system while preserving a level playing field and upholding high resolution standards across the Banking Union.The lack of sufficient MREL could, of course, be an important barrier to executing the preferred resolution strategy. Therefore I want to give you a few figures:MREL targets represent on average 25.2% TREA or Total Risk Exposure Amount and on aggregate are equal to \u20ac1759 billion (1.759 trillion) in Q4 2018, compared to \u20ac1722 billion (1.722 trillion) in Q4 2017. The SRB also requires - or expects, for banks without colleges during the 2018 planning cycle -\u00a0 an average amount of 17.8% TREA to be met, with subordinated instruments. This is \u20ac1243 billion (1.243 trillion) in Q4 2018 compared to \u20ac1213 billion (1.213 trillion) in Q4 2017. The average MREL shortfall equalled 2.0% TREA in Q4 2018. In absolute amounts, the total shortfall equalled \u20ac137.1 billion (0.137 trillion) in Q4 2018.In the last two resolution planning cycles,[1] the SRB has taken binding MREL-decisions at consolidated and individual levels. By the end of this year, the SRB will have adopted decisions with MREL targets at consolidated level for approximately 83% of the banks with resolution plans.Policy workEven though the BRRD2 and SRMR2 only kick in from 28 December 2020 - so just over a year\u2019s time - the SRB has already advanced in revising its MREL policy with a view to discuss new policy elements with the SRM\u2019s participants, and with a view to consulting industry in early 2020. The goal is to have the new MREL policy ready by Q2 2020. This would allow the SRB to start applying it in the course of the 2020 resolution planning cycle and to take MREL decisions based on the new legal framework in Q1/Q2 2021, when SRMR2 will be applicable and when Member States should have transposed the BRRD2.Challenges There is much work ongoing, but it might not be all plain sailing. We do face challenges in implementing this new Banking Package. The new framework requires banks to continue their path towards resolvability, but also to follow stricter rules for MREL. I\u2019d like to mention just three examples:the new framework introduces firmer conditions for instruments to be considered MREL eligible;it requires a number of banks to meet higher subordination requirements, and;it calls for banking groups to comply with internal MREL requirements.All of this is clearly in the interest of resolvability. But the new legislation is also extremely complex. The SRB is working with National Resolution Authorities and is in touch with the European Commission, as well as with the European Central Bank and the European Banking Authority. Recent experience shows, however, that it will inevitably take some time for authorities to overcome interpretation and implementation issues. This is another argument for the step-by-step introduction of the new framework, since it is already clear that the EBA\u2019s level two texts will be delayed.Another challenging task which is very high on our agenda, is the resolvability assessment. For this important topic, we have a number of ongoing workstreams. Firstly, we have published our \u2018Expectations for Banks\u2019 document which is open for public consultation until tomorrow. This document is not a new set of policies, but rather it sets out in a single document what we expect banks to do in order to make themselves resolvable. Thus it provides guidance, best practice and benchmarking - for the banks and for our assessment.This document is in addition to what we call the \u2018priority letters\u2019, which is an annual tailor-made letter for each bank, stating where their priorities should be in terms of making themselves resolvable. Here we give clear guidance for the banks\u2019 individual work programs. It will be followed by the SRB\u2019s assessment of the progress made - a bit like a report card that tells them where they should now focus their energies in order to improve. On this basis, if need be, the SRB will trigger impediments procedures if banks just don\u2019t make sufficient progress.Based on these ongoing efforts, we are currently revising our internal policy on resolvability assessment, in order to integrate an overall consistent resolvability assessment into the upcoming resolution planning cycle for 2020.Concretely, we envisage the creation of a \u2018heat-map\u2019 classifying banks in accordance with progress made on each resolvability condition, and the relative impact this progress has on the feasibility of the preferred resolution strategy. Let me clarify once more that the responsibility is best achieved by banks implementing the targeted work programme. The impediments procedure is simply a last resort, not the first choice. So far, we are making good progress.The end goal for all of this is clear \u2013 to improve resolvability, and thus ensure financial stability.We have learnt lessons, too, from past decisions not to resolve banks. The latest decision was taken in August this year. An area where improvements need to be made is the need for a better alignment between resolution and insolvency, including a bank liquidation regime or harmonised license withdrawal process. Dear members, I am happy to explain this more for those who may be interested. \u00a0Other issues for 2020 and beyond Let me briefly mention some of the other topics of importance for the SRB over the next year or so.We hope that an agreement can be reached on the third and final pillar of the Banking Union. There seems to be some positive momentum building around a European deposit insurance scheme so let us hope that this can be finalised during this parliamentary term.The SRB would also like to see more work to complete and strengthen the Capital Markets Union and I was pleased to hear\u00a0 Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis mention this topic recently, too. A stronger, European capital market is in everyone\u2019s interest \u2013 for investors, enterprises and last but not least for financial institutions.Unfortunately a solution for liquidity in resolution is still not in sight. Let\u2019s hope that the new year will bring new solutions. In 2020, we\u2019ll continue to increase the SRF, while we also hope that the details around the backstop to the Fund can be worked out and hopefully progress can be made soon \u2013 perhaps even in tomorrow\u2019s meeting of the EuroGroup.Conclusion Dear Chair, honourable members, I am coming to a close to allow for some time to answer your questions. We have made very good progress in the past four years, and as we celebrate our fifth anniversary in 2020, I hope that we will further strengthen Europe\u2019s resolution regime.It is in all our interests to work together in order to ensure that we complete the Banking Union framework so that we can promote financial stability and protect the taxpayer. \u00a0", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/885"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0041", "date": "2019-11-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "SRB launches public consultation on its 'Expectations for Banks'", "text": "The Single Resolution Board (SRB) today launches its first public consultation on its \u2018Expectations for Banks\u2019 document, which outlines best practice on key aspects of resolvability.

And in line with the EU\u2019s often glacial pace of introducing new policies, the Banking Union, true to form, is still not complete.Yes, we have pillar one, the Single Supervisory Mechanism.Yes, we have pillar two, the Single Resolution Mechanism, which of course the SRB belongs to.But, we still lack a common European scheme to protect deposits, but we hope progress can be made soon on this.[Purpose of the SRB]So, what is the purpose of the SRB? Our mandate is to ensure the resolvability of banks in Europe, following the crash over a decade ago.The very reason the European Union exists is for society\u2019s stability. \u00a0The very reason we exist is for financial stability\u2026 So our work is very much in line with the basic values and aims of the European Union \u2013 which is to promote peace and stability.\u00a0And if the SRB exists for financial stability, we exist also to protect the taxpayer. We exist so that ordinary people will not have to bail-out banks and pay for the mistakes of bank management. We exist so that pensioners can hope to have a pension and so that our young people can hope to have a job.We saw what happened in 2008, with mass emigration, soaring unemployment, private debts becoming public debt - all because our banks were deemed too big to fail.Now ladies and gentlemen, I don\u2019t want to dwell on the past, but in order to know where we are going, we have to understand where have we come from. Today, we have made very good progress on securing our financial system in order to protect the taxpayer from bail-out and to protect the wider economy from collapse, even though there is still more to do.[Why resolvability is important]Achieving resolvability of systemically important banks is very important for the wider European economy.Resolvability means that banks are resolvable at all times \u2013 and not only at quarter/year-end. So we need to have reliable, up-to-date data that we can interpret, quite literally at the \u2018flick of a switch\u2019.And that is the main message of my speech here today \u2013 we cannot have resolution, with up-to-date, reliable data available to us instantly.So now, I want to take a look at data information requirements from a resolution perspective. There are three main chapters to follow. [Data System Requirements]First, I\u2019m going to take a look back at what we have required in terms of data reporting so far and what has been achieved;Then, in the second part of my speech, I will focus on our ongoing work at the SRB and the resulting data requirements; The third and final part of my speech will look at what\u2019s ahead in the coming months.\u00a0[1. What data we have required to date]So to the first point, what we have required so far. The SRB can require banks under its remit, as well as their employees or third parties to which information has been outsourced, to provide the information for resolution.The SRB has also the power to access information of entities under its remit that is available to the European Central Bank or national competent authorities. And exchanges of information with the SRB shall not be deemed to infringe any requirement of professional secrecy.However, those that are the subject of an SRB\u2019s decision are entitled to access the relevant SRB's file, according to the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation. The exercise of this right by those who are subject to an SRB\u2019s decision, however, is limited by the legitimate interest in the protection of business secrets. As a consequence, the right to access the file does not cover confidential information or internal preparatory documents of the SRB.In general, Management Information Systems or MIS remains a key issue, as the ability to retrieve good quality data in a timely manner is crucial, amongst others, for valuation purposes and for bail-in implementation.A bank\u2019s MIS is essential before, during and after a resolution to provide the SRB with information. This data feeds into valuations that are pivotal elements of the resolution process, deciding whether or not a resolution is required and which resolution tool should be used, if\u00a0 a resolution is needed. Of course this requires bank management to invest in the necessary IT infrastructure, but expenditure can also help the banks day to day operations become more efficient.[Differences in data requirements under the SSM and the SRM]So, why don\u2019t all the EU institutions ask for all their data together at once to cut down on data reporting requirements? The short answer is that we require different sets of data and at different times. There are some important differences on data requirements between the SSM and the SRM.Bank supervisors look at banks from a going-concern perspective and traditionally focus on the asset side in order to identify potential solvability risks, whereas;Resolution authorities focus on the gone-concern perspective and in particular on the banks\u2019 liabilities side. Before the SRM started its work, the available information on banks\u2019 liabilities structure and, for instance, their ranking according to the national insolvency code was limited. As a first step, it was therefore necessary to define SRB\u2019s reporting needs and to develop a set of standardised data reports to prepare the grounds for bank-specific resolution planning in Europe.For instance, the SRB requires banks to report granular data as regards their liabilities side based on our Liability Data Report, or LDR for short. This template is very important for resolution planning and allows for detailed information on bail-inable eligible liabilities. The LDR also serves as a basis for the definition of MREL targets. \u00a0\u00a0Another standardised template we have created is related to the identification of critical functions, where banks provide information on their economic functions. This self-assessment is required by EU law.After the banks\u2019 self assessment, the Internal Resolution Teams (IRTs) have to perform a critical review and, finally, decide whether a bank has critical functions for a specific country that have to be maintained in case of a bank failure. The information provided to us helps us determine whether a bank has critical functions, and of course we have to be able to assess that information to ensure consistency and coherence across approaches used by individual institutions in the Banking Union.Another standard template for our resolution planning aims to provide a detailed overview of banks\u2019 participation in financial market infrastructures (FMIs). It represents the minimum information needs concerning qualitative and quantitative information on banks\u2019 use of FMIs and data necessary to facilitate bank resolution and FMI access. It is important for the SRB to obtain these data, for instance, in order to further understand the conditions for maintaining access to FMIs during bank resolution.So far, we put a focus on the reporting of standard resolution templates on a year-end basis. in the futrue however, banks will be required to ensure their capability to provide these data upon request. Thus, banks have to further adjust their data information systems.\u00a0So, we have made good progress in just four short years, and we have received very good cooperation from the banking industry - but of course there is always room for improvement, in particular with the quality and timely delivery of such data. We hope therefore that in future years, these issues can be addressed. Now I want to move onto the second part of my speech, which is focused on ongoing work at the SRB and the resulting data reporting requirements. \u00a0\u00a0[2. Current work at the SRB and the Data Reporting Requirements that flow from that] Fours years into the SRB\u2019s existence, we are now focussing on enhancing the content of every resolution plan. Alongside this, there are two major things happening that are changing the type and amount of data that is required.The first major element is the recent revision of the legal framework of the EU resolution regime by law-makers. Our further work on achieving banks\u2019 resolvability across all Member States will be framed by the so-called Banking Package. This package will trigger substantial changes of the SRB\u2019s reporting needs and will therefore have an impact on data system requirements.The BRRD2, part of the package, will introduce new reporting requirements, for which the European Banking Authority (EBA) is developing technical standards on uniform reporting templates. We expect that the EBA will finalise them by around mid-2020.The SRB however needs to bridge the gap in the transitional period in order to facilitate a timely and effective transition towards the application of the new reporting framework. This means, we will frontload future EBA\u2019s Implementing Technical Standards templates by launching a new data collection exercise in the transitional period. For instance, we will request additional data on loss absorbing capacity and on internal MREL, e.g. in order to set intermediate MREL targets. As such, 2020 will see a further development of regulatory standards, implementing acts and, notably, the preparation by the SRB, the NRAs and the banks under its remit for the application of the new rules.\u00a0The second major element that will impact our work is our decision to move from the 2 stage resolution planning process 2018/19 to a new steady-state process. What does this mean?In 2020, the SRB will re-align all banks under its remit to a uniform 12-month resolution planning cycle.This new cycle will start in April, with banks\u2018 regular data reporting based on 2019 year end data, and finish in March of the following year, with the approval of the resolution plan, including MREL decisions, followed by communication to the banks. This was necessary in order to take into account the new legal framework from 2020 with respect to our aim to ensure \u201cfully-fledged resolution plans\u201d and MREL decisions.So the Banking Package and the new 12-month resolution planning cycle are two major changes that will impact on reporting requirements.* * *Now, back to our current priorities and the operationalisation of our bank-specific resolution strategies. Ensuring banks\u2019 resolvability and the application of resolution tools at all times, necessitates additional requirements on data systems which cannot be captured by standardised data reports.Resolution planning is an individual process that has to take into account banks\u2019 characteristics and country-specific peculiarities to ensure that resolution strategies are feasible and credible and, furthermore, that the regulatory burden on banks is reduced, as far as possible.Consequently, banks themselves are responsible and have to be proactive to adjust their data systems and bank-internal processes based on our guidance. Once established, banks have to provide evidence that their data systems are resolution-proof and that we receive all information we need in order to apply our resolution tools at all times.It is difficult for this to happen overnight.\u00a0 The full operationalisation of our resolution strategies requires continuous improvements of banks\u2019 data systems. In order to frame this process, the SRB has defined a general approach that will guide banks in the right direction.As we increase our focus on the operationalisation of resolution strategies, we are currently also refining our quality assurance processes to ensure the consistent implementation and application of our policies, right across the Banking Union.\u00a0[3. Looking to the future]Before I come to a close, I want to take a look at the future. What will be the SRB\u2019s priorities moving forward?[Expectations for Banks Document]Well, the SRB will shortly publish a new document called \u2018Expectations for Banks\u2019. The name says it all \u2013 it is a document that outline what we at the SRB expect banks to do.It sets out the actions banks under our remit are expected to undertake, in order to ensure an appropriate level of resolvability. This document will be published shortly and will then go for public consultation. We would very much appreciate your input once, the public consultation is launched in the coming weeks.We want to provide banks with sufficient flexibility to improve their internal processes and data systems in a cost-efficient manner, so our \u2018expectations\u2019 will be phased-in over time through the definition of operational priorities.For the 2020 resolution planning cycle, the phasing-in foresees three operational priorities for all SRB banks. These are: operationalisation of the bail-in tool,ensuring operational continuity in resolution, andmaintaining access to financial market infrastructures and their intermediaries ahead of, and during resolution.In the coming weeks, the SRB will communicate further information on these three priorities. Based on that and the general expectations, banks will have to start their work and adjust their IT systems.For the operationalisation of bank-individual resolution strategies we will not rely on standardised templates. We will only communicate the general expectations and operational objectives which the data information systems have to fulfil.\u00a0To be even more precise on what this means for data information system requirements, I would like to provide an example:The bail-in is a key resolution tool for us which is also a priority in 2019. The bail-in allows to write down debt \u2013 and thereby to absorb losses \u2013 and to convert debt into equity in order to recapitalize a bank which performs critical functions or which has to be maintained due to its relevance for financial stability.In principle, we need two things:On the one hand, we need sufficient bail-in eligible liabilities which can be \u201ceasily\u201d bailed-in. This we ensure through setting appropriate MREL targets. On the other hand, we also have to make sure that banks can implement the bail-in tool and report complete, accurate and up-to-date bail-in data at very short notice. That means, if a bank fails on Friday close of business, the banks must submit all required bail-in data during the weekend. This is crucial, amongst others, to thoroughly prepare the SRB resolution scheme and the national implementing act.Closely related to that is our requirement that banks have to draft bail-in playbooks which are internal documents that describe the operational steps to be performed by the bank in order to practically implement a bail-in decision, irrespective of whether the bail-in tool is used in combination with other tools such as the sale of business tool, the bridge institution tool or the asset separation tool.It describes how a specific bank established its internal systems and infrastructure and how it defines the roles and responsibilities of the bank as well as the interaction with the resolution authorities and external stakeholders, such as the external bail-in implementation via FMIs.Now, one could ask why the SRB does not define a standard template for all SRB banks? \u00a0The bail-in implementation is a good example where we cannot formulate standardised data requests based on templates.At the end of this year, we expect the first draft bail-in playbooks from all SRB banks. And we will continue this work in 2020.At a later stage, we will request banks to perform dry runs on bail-in implementation in order to test, in particular, the readiness of banks\u2019 data information systems.The example \u201cBail-in Playbook\u201c should provide you with some background as to why we have chosen the approach I described beforehand.In the end, only banks can ensure resolvability. And therefore they have to do their homework. We, as resolution authorities, can only set the framework and evaluate whether there are substantive impediments to resolution that have to be removed.[Conclusion]Ladies and gentlemen, I am coming to a close.\u00a0Lunchtime is slowly coming into view, don\u2019t worry!We recognise that any regulation, and with it, the requirement to report data is a cost to industry. We recognise that, and we understand that banks have to establish additional internal processes and to adjust their IT infrastructure. We will be as flexible as possible, both in terms of timing and in specification, so banks should be wise and use that time to find a solution that best suits them.Resolution planning is a bank-specific task and that we cannot achieve banks\u2019 resolvability based on a one-size-fits-all solution.Ladies and gentlemen, for good quality resolution decisions, we need up-to-date, reliable data available to us instantly.\u00a0\u00a0Our end goal is simple. Quality, reliable data, that is delivered in a timely manner, or in the case of a resolution, that can be delivered at the flick of a switch. And speaking of which, I think it is time to flick the switch on this microphone and give way for the closing remarks.

The SRB\u2019s \u2018Expectations for Banks\u2019 document, which was published for public consultation on 23 October 2019, sets out the general capabilities the SRB expects banks to demonstrate in order to show that they are resolvable.Other important priorities will be operationalising the political agreements on the backstop reached in 2019, as well as increasing preparedness for potential new Banking Union members with regard to SRF contributions. The year will also see the SRB operate at full staff capacity for the first time, with close to 400 colleagues on hand to deliver the SRB\u2019s ambitious programme.\u201cAs we reach the end of this current multiannual programme, the next one is already being prepared. The 2021-2024 programme has particular salience considering the link with the end of the transition period of the SRF.

It is encouraging to see a wide number of people attending today\u2019s Conference, ranging from public and private bodies, European and international. This interest and cooperation is very important as we continue to work together to make the theory and policies of resolvability, a reality. I would also like to thank the press: your work, in communicating the role of the SRB \u2013 as a promoter of financial stability and as a protector of the taxpayer \u2013 is widely appreciated.\u00a0 Many interesting points and ideas have been advanced and already discussed today, so I will be brief in making my concluding remarks. I will just pick up on three points: The first is liquidity in resolution. This is an area where more work is clearly still needed in developing a robust framework. It is a key gap in the current resolution architecture. Yes, the SRF could play a role in liquidity provisioning, but this role would of course be limited due to the SRF\u2019s size both during the transition period and even after the target level is reached. While the Common Backstop, discussed in detail by Dominique and Fernando Restoy, will cover all uses of the SRF, including liquidity in resolution, this would still not address the liquidity needs of a large bank \u2013 let me be clear about that. Of course, liquidity needs will be very different depending on the size of a bank, the assets remaining and so on. I want to pick up on a point Sean Berrigan made in the second panel on the backstop \u2013 the larger the backstop, and the more accessible it is, the less likely it is that it will need to be used. It is seems perhaps like a paradox, but he is right. Progress is on-going at European level to address the limitations in the current framework. Any solution is likely to envisage a key role for the Eurosystem; the final goal should be the creation of a new resolution liquidity framework for the Banking Union. In any case, it is also essential that banks prepare themselves to ensure that private sector means are used to the maximum extent before any public sector tool has to be activated. In this regard, it is crucial that banks have in place robust methodologies to estimate the liquidity and funding needs for the implementation of the resolution strategy. They must also have adequate information systems and IT tools to identify and enhance the readiness to mobilise collateral. As mentioned earlier today, the Expectations for Banks document coming later this month, will contain further information on these aspects. The second area is harmonisation. It was addressed by Elke and by Guntram Wolff among others earlier today. The no-creditor-worse-off principle seeks to ensure that the treatment of creditors in resolution is not worse than the treatment they would have received under normal insolvency proceedings. Currently, with nineteen different insolvency frameworks in the Banking Union, the analysis of the insolvency counterfactual for a cross-border bank in resolution is a challenge, and results in diverging outcomes depending on the home country of the institution. In addition, the \u2018failing or likely to fail\u2019 assessment is not always aligned to the criteria for liquidation at national level and may also lead to different conclusions. At present, there is a type of uncertainty and a failing bank may end up in a limbo, therefore this needs to be corrected. Indeed, if we could bridge this harmonisation gap, we might see the creation of a European bank liquidation regime. Given the differences across national insolvency regimes, an EU administrative bank liquidation regime endowed with a range of tools - for example, like those of the FDIC \u2013 and with a Deposit Guarantee Scheme able to provide financial support on a least cost basis as an alternative to the pay-out of depositors would be a much more efficient solution. Not only would this ensure centralised decision-making, but it would also allow for the application of a harmonised and effective toolbox, paving the way for a European deposit insurance. Proposals for harmonisation will inevitably encounter resistance. We only have to look to the remarks of Jean-Pierre Mustier this morning! Yet we as policy-makers know that EDIS may help decrease fragmentation in the market. The third point that I think was very strong today was that of the need to invest in Communication. At the SRB, we have to continue to work ensure we build, coordinate and align our communication together with banks and national authorities. As Sharon Donnery pointed out eloquently earlier on, communication is crucial in a time of resolution in order to give confidence to the markets. We have the technical policies in place now, but as we turn that policy into action, putting more of a focus on communication strategies will be important. And we very much value the work of our journalists \u2013 patiently waiting for the press conference that follows - in that task. Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, in the past four years we have put many of the policies of our political masters into action, and as I said at the outset, we have enjoyed very positive cooperation with our stakeholders. Although there are still more policies to be developed, we are very much in the implementation phase for the existing ones. However, we also know that we may need to fine-tune our implementation to be as effective as possible. Therefore your feedback and close contact are vital. Going forward, we want to involve our stakeholders even more, through various forms of public consultations - as we go about implementing the rules that the co-legislators have set out. We have a duty to ensure the resolvability of all SRB banks, so that we protect the taxpayer and promote financial stability. In just four years, we have made very substantial progress, and we will continue on this path. I look forward to seeing you all next year, as in 2020 we mark five years of the SRB\u2019s existence. Thank you very much for your attention. Grazie Mille!

The annual event brings together industry, public authorities and key stakeholders in bank resolution to assess progress and priorities for action. The theme this year reflects the SRB\u2019s even greater emphasis on the implementation of the policies and guidance it has developed. The onus is now on the industry to work towards resolvability. In the context of the second Banking Package, discussions will also focus on the progress made in resolution, the liquidity available should a bank fail and operational continuity. The event will be opened by SRB Chair Elke K\u00f6nig, Competition Commissioner, and the Executive Vice President-designate - Europe fit for the Digital Age, Margrethe Vestager and UniCredit CEO, Jean-Pierre Mustier. Other speakers include high-level representatives of banks, central banks and European and international institutions.The end of 2019 will also be marked by the SRB\u2019s first public consultation, which will centre around its \u2018Expectations for Banks\u2019 publication. The draft document sets out what the SRB expects banks to demonstrate to show they are resolvable and prepared for crisis management. The consultation will be launched soon. More details will be available on the SRB website. Meanwhile, the SRB conference of today can be watched online by following this link. The conference features opening addresses and keynotes from:Elke K\u00f6nig, Chair of the Single Resolution Board: \u201cThe area of banking resolution is still a relatively new topic. Often, it is only by doing that we learn what works and what still needs to be fine-tuned. We appreciate the feedback and cooperation of industry, and our regulatory partners across the Banking Union and further afield. This month, we will launch a public consultation on our \u2018Expectations for Banks\u2019 document and are looking forward to more valuable input.\u201dSasha Mills, Executive Director, Bank of England: \u201cThe final major piece in the UK resolution regime for banks is making firms accountable for their own resolvability under the recently published Resolvability Assessment Framework \u2013 \u201cturning policy into action\u201d.Jean Pierre Mustier, CEO, Unicredit:\"The EU framework on resolution is broadly in place. Authorities and banks are working hard to make it more operational. We still need two things: first, temporary liquidity to banks in resolution, without further burdening the banking system. Second, a level playing field with other jurisdictions, such as the US, supporting EU banks competitiveness. More generally, the EU should perform a proper and coordinated study on the full impact of all regulatory measures on banks, including the market\u2019s ability to absorb new MREL instruments issuances.\u201dENDS Further Information To follow the event through the live web-stream, download the agenda, or learn more, go to the\u00a0SRB Conference homepage.

I want to wholeheartedly welcome each of you to this, the fourth Annual SRB Conference. Today, we are lucky once again to have so many high-level and distinguished guests as part of our panels and as speakers.The theme of this year\u2019s conference is \u2018Turning Policy into Action\u2019. Let us reflect on that as we open today\u2019s proceedings. Two years ago in 2017, we focussed on \u201cBuilding resolvability together\u201d; the shift in our theme is reflects the fact that we are now in a phase where the SRB is focussing on the implementation of policies that have already been put in place. We put them in place together with the NRAs; the implementation means that banks will have a greater role to play in making themselves resolvable. \u00a0The message, is that it is not only important to develop policies, legislation and regulation, but it is equally important to ensure that those policies are implemented and become part of banks\u2019 DNA. This way, we turn policy into action! We constantly assess and monitor the impact of our policies and adjust them proportionately when necessary.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Through the effective implementation of policies, we can ensure resolvability of every institution, and thus we can promote financial stability. We must also keep in mind that there will always be damage when dealing with a failing bank. Resolution is simply a way of restricting the spill over of that damage. \u00a0Examples of turning policy into action The SRB has been busy in the past year, working with industry and our National Resolution Authorities in order to implement a number of policies in the spirit of cooperation and transparency. I\u2019m going to mention just a few here this morning: The\u00a0latest SRB MREL policy, published in January, enhances the quality and quantity of MREL by introducing a series of new features to strengthen banks\u2019 resolvability.In February this year, we published our Framework for Valuation. This Framework is about ensuring the consistency of the valuation reports which inform the decisions of the Single Resolution Board. Though directed at the independent valuation experts, the institutions will also benefit from a better understanding of valuation in resolution which will help them to increase its preparedness for resolution, ultimately improving their resolvability. As you may be aware, the EBA is currently finalising its work on data requirements or valuation in which the SRB participated. This summer, we published a paper outlining our approach to an important element of the resolution framework, the Public Interest Assessment. The document gives clarity to the factors the SRB takes into account when conducting a PIA, and explains how the SRB applies the criteria as set out in EU law. The publication of the methodology is aimed at providing more transparency and certainty for banks and the markets. The resolution framework as an exception to normal insolvency sets strict conditions and the Public Interest Assessment is a core element in this context.Soon, we will publish our Expectations for Banks document,\u00a0 on which you will be consulted, in line with our drive to work with industry in a transparent manner. These \u2018Expectations\u2019 will be our benchmark and guidance\u00a0 on what are the considerations for being resolvable in general terms. And of course our focus is as before on cooperation within Europe but also internationally. Banks are active cross-border and there is no alternative to cross-border-cooperation of resolution authorities. We have put into action a number of international cooperation agreements. I\u2019m pleased to announce that tomorrow, we will formally finalise a new arrangement with our friends in Japan[1], the JFSA. Finally in terms of action, we have already had to deal with a number of crisis cases in the past four years \u2013 with the most recent being in August this year - and the experience gained in these cases is of course very useful for the SRB\u2019s actions going forward.\u00a0 Other areas where work is still needed Although we have been very busy putting policy into action, there is room to do more on the policy side! The backstop to the SRF had been a long-running debate, but hopefully it will cross the finishing line very soon. The backstop will be an important buffer in giving the markets confidence in a time of crisis or resolution.Liquidity in resolution is a key gap in the framework.\u00a0The SRF could play a role in liquidity provisioning as a last resort, but this role will be limited due to the SRF\u2019s size both during the transitionary period and after the target level is reached, even when we add the Common Backstop. Addressing this issue will materially enhance financial stability.\u00a0Let\u2019s hope for progress on this soon. Another area I have mentioned many time before, is that of the need for harmonised insolvency regimes. At present with 19 different insolvency regimes, we have different counterfactuals to resolution across the member states and perhaps even worse there is no harmonised answer as to how to deal with banks for which resolution is not the solution. Here a harmonised administrative insolvency regime, perhaps something similar to the FDIC system, is the way forward. We are also hoping for the establishment of a deposit insurance scheme at EU level. Again, this is another issue that has been on the boil for some time -\u00a0 its time to rethink and complete it! Talking of completing unions \u2013 the creation and completion of a fully functioning Capital Markets Union will allow capital to flow from one member state into another, without difficulty. We know it is on the agenda of the new Commission and we clearly see the benefits for the build up of MREL. I also welcome Commissioner Dombrovskis\u2019 commitment to the Capital Markets Union earlier this week in his European Parliament hearing, and I was pleased he received the support of the Committee to continue in his role as Commissioner. The Panels We are going to look in more detail at the progress that is being made in resolution in Panel One this morning. Later in Panel Two, we\u2019ll examine the issue of liquidity in resolution, which is of course a very important area for resolvability. Panel Three this afternoon will discuss the issues surrounding operational continuity. Melinda will introduce the panels in more detail later on this morning. Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, I won\u2019t say much more than that - we have a wonderful line-up of speakers today, with a great mix of heavyweights from both industry and the public sector. I hope you will find today\u2019s event useful not only for the ideas you will be exposed to, but I hope it will be a valuable networking opportunity to engage with those involved in resolution in Europe and further afield. I have said it often before, but it\u2019s worth stressing once again \u2013 we rely on the cooperation of all parties involved, national authorities and banks foremost, in order to ensure we achieve resolvability. So with that, I now declare the conference open, and handover the floor to a woman needing little introduction. She has been a stand-out commissioner in the last Commission, and given her stellar performance at the European Parliament on Tuesday, I am sure she will be equally impressive in the Von der Leyon Commission. It give me great pleasure to introduce to you the current\u00a0Competition Commissioner, and the Executive Vice President-designate - Europe fit for the Digital Age, Margrethe Vestager [1] Exchange of letters on Cooperation in the area of banking resolution between the Single Resolution Board and the Financial Services Agency\u00a0", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/841"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0050", "date": "2019-10-04", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Elke K\u00f6nig - Ma\u00dfnahmen und Unterschiede in der Bankenabwicklung in Europa und den USA", "text": "Es gilt das gesprochene Wort\u00a0Sehr geehrter Magister Ettl,sehr geehrter Magister Kumpfm\u00fcller,meine sehr geehrten Damen und Herren, ich bin sehr gerne in Wien und es ist mir eine au\u00dferordentliche Freude erneut auf der Aufsichtskonferenz der \u00f6sterreichischen\u00a0Finanzmarktaufsichtsbeh\u00f6rde (FMA) zu reden. \u00a0Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) und Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) bilden die beiden S\u00e4ulen der Bankenunion, Andrea und mich verbindet deshalb eine sehr intensive Arbeitsbeziehung. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) und Single Resolution Board (SRB) stehen ebenfalls in sehr engem Kontakt. Jelena und ich kooperieren aktiv, insbesondere angesichts der acht global\u00a0systemrelevanten\u00a0Banken\u00a0 (G-SIBs), die einen gemeinsamen Fu\u00dfabdruck in den Vereinigten Staaten (USA) und in der Eurozone haben. Und nat\u00fcrlich ist die FMA eine wichtige Stimme im SSM und SRM und ich kann Ihnen versichern, dass sie geh\u00f6rt wird.Wohlwissend, dass es in der anschlie\u00dfenden Diskussion um das \u201egro\u00dfe Ganze\u201c gehen soll, werde ich mich kurz halten und den Schwerpunkt auf zwei Themenbl\u00f6cke legen.Zun\u00e4chst m\u00f6chte ich auf die nach der Krise ergriffenen Ma\u00dfnahmen zur Vermeidung von Bankenrettungen auf Kosten der Allgemeinheit eingehen und eine kurze kritische Einsch\u00e4tzung zum Umsetzungstand in der Bankenunion geben. Danach m\u00f6chte ich die aus meiner Sicht erforderlichen n\u00e4chsten Schritte zur Vollendung der Bankenunion diskutieren.Global in Life, national in death \u2013 also global zu Lebzeiten, national im Krisen- bzw. Todesfall. Zu dieser oft zitierten Einsch\u00e4tzung in Bezug auf die Gesch\u00e4ftst\u00e4tigkeit komplexer internationaler Banken gelangte bekanntlich Mervyn King, ehemaliger Gouverneur der Bank of England. Diese Einsch\u00e4tzung war n\u00fcchtern, und zugleich treffend, allerdings liegt die Bemerkung nunmehr fast zehn Jahre zur\u00fcck. Seitdem ist viel Wasser die Donau hinuntergeflossen und umfangreiche Regulierunginitiativen wurden auf den Weg gebracht, um die \u201eToo-Big-To-Fail\u201c Problematik zu adressieren.Unter keinen Umst\u00e4nden m\u00f6chte ich behaupten, dass Institute heute weniger komplex geworden sind. Aber die systemische Relevanz der gr\u00f6\u00dften Banken hat in den letzten Jahren vergleichsweise abgenommen und damit einhergehend das Risiko, das diese Institute ausstrahlen. Eine j\u00fcngst ver\u00f6ffentlichte Studie[1] der Bank\u00a0f\u00fcr\u00a0Internationalen Zahlungsausgleich unterstreicht diese These.Zudem ist als Reaktion auf die Finanzkrise die Handlungsf\u00e4higkeit des Systems gest\u00e4rkt worden. Mit dem Fall Lehmann Brothers r\u00fcckte das zuvor nur wenig beachtete Thema \u201eBankenabwicklung\u201c 2008 in den Fokus der \u00d6ffentlichkeit. Denn auf keine der Herausforderungen in der Finanzkrise waren Staaten weniger vorbereitet als auf das unkontrollierte Scheitern systemischer Banken. Aufgrund fehlender anderer M\u00f6glichkeiten erfolgte eine Rettung von Kreditinstituten unter Einsatz \u00f6ffentlicher Mittel; Verstaatlichung aus Mangel an Alternativen. \u00a0Bekanntlich wurden weitreichende Konsequenzen gezogen. Mit Blick auf Europa und sehr abstrakt gesprochen, lassen sich diese in zwei gro\u00dfe Teile gliedern, die jeweils durch den SSM und SRM umgesetzt werden.Zum einen wurde mit strengeren und einheitlichen Anforderungen daf\u00fcr gesorgt, dass Banken widerstandsf\u00e4higer und robuster werden; mit anderen Worten, die Eintrittswahrscheinlichkeit der n\u00e4chsten Bankpleite wurde reduziert. Auf der anderen Seite wurden Ma\u00dfnahmen ergriffen, um die negativen Auswirkungen f\u00fcr Realwirtschaft und Steuerzahler zu begrenzen, sollte es trotz reduzierter Eintrittswahrscheinlichkeit dennoch zum Ausfall kommen.Wo stehen wir heute in Europa? Mit dem Single Rulebook gelten in Europa seit 2014 einheitliche und striktere aufsichtsrechtliche Anforderungen f\u00fcr Banken. Mit Basel III wurden die Definitionen von risikogewichteten Aktiva und Kapital versch\u00e4rft. Infolgedessen haben sich die Kapitalanforderungen an Banken prozentual fast verdreifacht und stehen bei rund 11.5 prozent\u00a0hartem Kernkapital in der Eurozone.Der einheitliche Aufsichtsmechanismus unter dem Dach der EZB stellt eine neue Struktur in der Bankenaufsicht dar und setzt die Anforderungen konsistent um. Die Banken k\u00f6nnen diese Anforderungen erf\u00fcllen. Die Kapitalquoten von Banken in der Eurozone sind deutlich gestiegen. F\u00fcr die Eurozone ist seit 2008 ein Anstieg um rund f\u00fcnf Prozentpunkte von knapp neun Prozent Kernkapital auf \u00fcber 14 Prozent CET1 zu beobachten. Positiv hat sich ebenfalls die Verschuldungsquote entwickelt.\u00a0So hat sich das Verh\u00e4ltnis vom Kapital zur Bilanzsumme, das \u201eLeverage Ratio\u201c \u00a0mit sechs Prozent seit 2008 in der Eurozone im Mittel verdoppelt.[2]Die Einf\u00fchrung des einheitlichen Bankenabwicklungsmechanismus ist die zweite weitreichende Neuerung in Europa. Der SRM, unter F\u00fchrung des SRB, hat zum Ziel, die Rettung von systemischen Banken mit Steuergeldern auszuschlie\u00dfen. Wichtigstes Instrument daf\u00fcr ist der Bail-In, welcher die Gl\u00e4ubigerhaftung wieder in den Vordergrund stellt. Im Krisenfall werden Eigen- und Fremdkapital abgeschrieben bzw. umgewandelt, um Verluste zu absorbieren und die Bank mit privaten Mitteln zu rekapitalisieren. Nach fast f\u00fcnf Jahren haben SRB und Nationale Abwicklungsbeh\u00f6rden viel erreicht, es liegt aber auch noch ein weiter Weg vor uns. Um die volle Abwicklungsf\u00e4higkeit f\u00fcr alle Institute unter unserer Verantwortung sicherzustellen, werden wir einen Marathon, keinen Sprint laufen m\u00fcssen. F\u00fcr die komplexeren grenz\u00fcberschreitenden Institute existieren detaillierte Abwicklungsstrategien einschlie\u00dflich quantitativer und qualitativer MREL-Anforderungen, die sicherstellen sollen, dass im Abwicklungsfall hinreichende Mittel zur Rekapitalisierung oder Restrukturierung verf\u00fcgbar sind. Die gute Nachricht: Diese Anforderungen werden von Geldh\u00e4usern zum Teil heute schon erf\u00fcllt. Es ist unser Ziel, im n\u00e4chsten Jahr \u00fcber 100 Abwicklungspl\u00e4ne f\u00fcr SRB Banken zu finalisieren und 450 MREL Entscheidungen zu treffen. In enger Zusammenarbeit mit der FMA gilt das auch f\u00fcr alle wesentlichen \u00f6sterreichischen Institute bzw. Gruppen. Das entsprechende Arbeitsprogramm 2020 wurde in der gestrigen SRB Plenarsitzung verabschiedet und wird in den n\u00e4chsten Tagen ver\u00f6ffentlicht. Es bleibt aber nicht nur bei einem allgemeinen Arbeitsprogramm. Alle Banken kennen ihr individuelles\u00a0 Arbeitsprogram, das im Dialog zwischen Abwicklungsteams und den jeweiligen Banken entwickelt wird und sehr konkrete Schritte enth\u00e4lt, um \u201eAbwicklungsf\u00e4higkeit\u201c zu gew\u00e4hrleisten.Aus der gemeinsamen Arbeit in der Abwicklungsplanung l\u00e4sst sich \u2013 davon bin ich \u00fcberzeugt \u2013 auch Nutzen f\u00fcr die\u00a0 Banken schlagen. Im Fall von strategischen Neuausrichtungen oder Restrukturierung d\u00fcrften kritische Funktionen eine wichtige Rolle spielen. Anforderungen an die Bank-IT zur raschen und vollst\u00e4ndigen Identifizierung von Verm\u00f6genswerten, Kapital und Verbindlichkeiten sind zur Steuerung der Bank unverzichtbar.Das Resultat unserer Arbeit? Der Steuerzahler ist weiter aus der Schusslinie ger\u00fcckt. Im Fall der F\u00e4lle, k\u00f6nnten Kosten im Abwicklungsprozess in letzter Instanz durch den Abwicklungsfonds SRF getragen werden. Der durch Bankabgaben privatfinanzierte SRF hat derzeit ein Volumen von EUR 33 Mrd, die Zielgr\u00f6\u00dfe liegt bei etwa EUR 65 Mrd.Der SRF ist ein wichtiges Element zur Sicherung der Finanzmarktstabilit\u00e4t im Abwicklungskontext. Zugleich ist er ein zentraler Unterschied zum US-amerikanischen System. Der Orderly Liquidation Fund (OLF) auf amerikanischer Seite ist im Gegensatz zum SRF nicht vorfinanziert. Bei Finanzierungsengp\u00e4ssen springt in den USA unter sehr strengen Auflagen das US Finanzministerium durch Notkredite und B\u00fcrgschaften ein. Verluste, Kosten und Ertr\u00e4ge werden saldiert und im Nachgang durch Sonderbeitr\u00e4ge von Banken erstattet um fiskalische Neutralit\u00e4t herzustellen.Ein weiterer wichtiger Unterschied zum europ\u00e4ischen System ist, dass Abwicklungskonzepte vornehmlich von Banken selbst erstellt werden. Die so-genannten Testamente (nach Title 1 des Dodd-Frank Acts) beschreiben Abwicklungsszenarien nach dem U.S.-amerikanischen Insolvenzrecht (oder Bankruptcy Code), sie werden von der Aufsicht genehmigt und sind zum Teil \u00f6ffentlich zug\u00e4nglich.Bei allem Respekt vor US-amerikanischen Richtern (denn die Expertise nach Chapter Eleven des Bankruptcy Code\u2018s ist hoch), aber eine geordnete Abwicklung eines G-SIBs mit Implikationen f\u00fcr Finanzmarktstabilit\u00e4t ist im Gerichtsaal nur schwer vorstellbar. Aus diesem Grund erstellt die FDIC zus\u00e4tzlich Notfallpl\u00e4ne (nach Title 2). Ist Chapter Eleven keine Option, \u00fcbernimmt die FDIC die Kontrolle \u00fcber das Geldhaus, f\u00fchrt Bail-in mittels TLAC (dem \u00c4quivalent zu MREL) aus, \u00fcbertr\u00e4gt s\u00e4mtliche Gesch\u00e4ftsaktivit\u00e4ten und kritische Funktionen auf ein Br\u00fcckeninstitute und so weiter.Die Rahmenwerke in Europa und in den USA folgen den Prinzipien des Financial Stability Boards, den Key Attributes von 2011. Unterschiede bestehen lediglich hinsichtlich der Ausgestaltung der konkreten Abwicklungsregime nach nationalem Recht. Einen wichtigen Unterschied darf man nicht ausblenden: Die USA sind ein Staat; die EU hat 28 Mitgliedsstaaten, die Bankenunion setzt sich derzeit aus 19 Staaten zusammen. Bisher, und gl\u00fccklicherweise, ist die FDIC in ihrer neuen Funktion nicht auf die Probe gestellt worden, wohingegen der SRB bereits in einigen Krisenf\u00e4llen Entscheidungen treffen musste. Das Regelwerk des Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive/ der Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation (BRRD/SRMR) wurde seit 2016 sechs Mal angewandt, wobei jeder einzelne Fall interessante Einblicke bot.Im Juni 2017, vollzog die italienische Regierung gem\u00e4\u00df BRRD eine vorsorgliche Rekapitalisierung, um die \u00e4lteste Bank der Welt, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, zu retten. Im gleichen Monat musste dann Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol nach den Regeln der BRRD/SRMR abgewickelt werden. Ein offenkundig gelungener Abwicklungsfall, der dank sehr enger und guter Kooperation mit der spanischen Abwicklungsbeh\u00f6rde FROB erfolgreich durchgef\u00fchrt wurde; die kritischen Funktionen der Bank wurden durch den Verkauf transferiert, der Einsatz \u00f6ffentlicher Mittel war nicht erforderlich und auch der Finanzmarkt insgesamt blieb ungest\u00f6rt.Ebenfalls im Juni 2017, scheiterten zeitgleich zwei venezianische Banken. Da die Banken weder kritische Funktionen besa\u00dfen, noch eine Bedrohung f\u00fcr Finanzmarkstabilit\u00e4t in Italien oder der Union insgesamt darstellten (nach einer langen Periode der Bilanzverk\u00fcrzung), entschied sich der SRB gegen eine Abwicklung gem\u00e4\u00df BRRD/SRMR. Die Banken wurden folglich nach nationalem Insolvenzrecht abgewickelt werden sollen. In in zwei weiteren F\u00e4llen kam der SRB 2018 und 2019 zum Schluss, dass eine Abwicklung nach BRRD/SRMR nicht von \u201e\u00f6ffentlichem Interesse\u201c ist. Die lettischen Banken AS\u00a0PNB\u00a0Banka and ABLV Bank, sowie deren luxemburgische Tochter wurden und nach nationalem Insolvenzrecht abgewickelt. Fazit: Die Arbeit in den vergangenen Jahren hat gezeigt, dass das Too-Big-To-Fail Problem deutlich begrenzt wurde, sowohl theoretisch durch die Erstellung von Abwicklungsszenarien und den Aufbau von haftendem Kapital, Zudem hat der Fall Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol gezeigt, dass das Abwicklungsregime wirksam eingesetzt werden kann.Auch andere Finanzmarktakteure sind sensibilisiert. So haben beispielsweise Ratingagenturen die \u00dcnterst\u00fctzung der Ratings von Banken durch vermeintliche Staatshilfen in ihren Einsch\u00e4tzungen korrigiert und die Ratings im Schnitt um ein bis zwei Notches gesenkt.Gleichwohl besteht weiterer Handlungsbedarf, damit das europ\u00e4ische Abwicklungsregime sein volles Potenzial entfalten kann. Erlauben sie mir hierzu einige Kommentare.1. Die im Fall Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena vorgenommene vorsorgliche Rekapitalisierung ist Teil des in der SRMR vorgesehenen Werkzeugkoffers und sollte es auch bleiben. Wichtige Grundvoraussetzung bleibt aber die strikte Konditionalit\u00e4t. Aus Sicht des SRB muss die Operationalisierung dieser Bedingungen vorangetrieben werden. Dazu geh\u00f6ren zeitnahe Asset-quality-reviews und Stresstests, um auszuschlie\u00dfen, dass ein Bail-out oder Beihilfe f\u00fcr eingetretene oder zu erwartende Verluste durch die Hintert\u00fcr erfolgen. Und nicht zu vergessen: die vorsorgliche Rekapitalisierung ist tempor\u00e4r befristet und muss zur\u00fcckgezahlt werden. 2. Die \u201eBankenkommunikation der Europ\u00e4ischen Kommission\u201c erm\u00f6glicht staatliche Beihilfe f\u00fcr Banken im Krisenfall. Besagte Kommunikation stammt aus dem Jahr 2013 und muss angesichts der Einf\u00fchrung des einheitlichen Abwicklungsregimes 2015 \u00fcberarbeitet werden. Das sollte eine vorrangige Aufgabe der neuen Kommission sein. Die Existenz von zwei Parallelsystemen, die die Restrukturierung von bestandsgef\u00e4hrdeten Banken betreffen und unterschiedliche Implikationen zur Lastentragung haben, ist aus meiner Sicht fraglich und birgt das Risiko von Fehlanreizen.3. Dar\u00fcber hinaus besteht beim Thema \u201eLiquidit\u00e4t in der Abwicklung\u201c eine offene Flanke. Der Liquidit\u00e4tsbedarf sehr gro\u00dfer Banken, insbesondere von G-SIBs, kann unter adversen Gesichtspunkten die Mittel des SRF und die der Letztsicherung durch den European Stability Mechanism (ESM), des \u201eBackstops\u201c, \u00fcbersteigen.Aktuell werden verschiedene L\u00f6sungsoptionen diskutiert, an denen der SRB konstruktiv arbeitet. Wir hegen gro\u00dfe Sympathien f\u00fcr ein Garantiemodell, das Liquidit\u00e4t des Eurosystems erm\u00f6glicht und Kosten ex-post erstattet, sofern diese denn \u00fcberhaupt anfallen.4. Die europ\u00e4ische Bankenunion ruht auf drei S\u00e4ulen. Mit einheitlicher Aufsicht und Abwicklung sind die ersten beiden S\u00e4ulen errichtet; die dritte S\u00e4ule, die einheitliche Bankeneinlagensicherung, muss nun angegangen werden. Die Risiken im Finanzsystem haben sich verringert, aber das System Bankenunion ist noch nicht wetterfest. Findet Europa keine Antwort auf die Frage EDIS, sehe ich das Projekt \u201eBankenunion\u201c nur bedingt handlungsf\u00e4hig hinsichtlich seines eigentlichen Ziels (Banken geordnet und ohne Staatsmittel abwickeln zu k\u00f6nnen).5. Die Harmonisierung des Insolvenzrechts f\u00fcr Banken, bzw. ein einheitliches Verfahren zur Liquidation von Banken, ist in diesem Zusammenhang zentral. Vor jeder Abwicklungsentscheidung stellt sich die Frage, ob eine Abwicklung gem\u00e4\u00df SRMR eine bessere Option gegen\u00fcber dem nationalen Insolvenzrecht darstellt. Angesicht einer fragmentierten Landschaft im Insolvenzrecht mit \u00fcber 19 verschiedenen Systemen, ist diese komplexe Frage nur schwer bzw. unterschiedlich je nach Herkunftsland der Bank zu beantworten.Da eine rasche Vereinheitlichung des Insolvenzrechts vermutlich Wunschdenken ist, k\u00f6nnte das amerikanische System und die Kompetenzen der FDIC Anregung f\u00fcr einen wesentlichen Schritt in die richtige Richtung sein. Die FDIC hat weitreichende Kompetenzen um Banken administrativ und zentral in allen Bundesstaaten abzuwickeln. Dies f\u00fchrte in den letzten Jahre zu unz\u00e4hligen Verkaufstransaktionen, immer unter Wahrung der Kosteneffizienz Ein \u201ezentrales administratives Liquidationstool\u201c k\u00f6nnte den bestehenden SRMR-Instrumentenkoffer erg\u00e4nzend hinzugef\u00fcgt werden und h\u00e4tte den Vorteil, dass Banken die den \u201e\u00d6ffentlichkeitstest\u201c nicht bestehen, dennoch vom SRB liquidiert werden. Im Schlaglicht st\u00fcnden vornehmlich kleine SRB Banken, sowie gr\u00f6\u00dfere \u201eweniger bedeutende Kreditinstitute\" (LSIs). Ein Thema, dass die neue Kommission hoffentlich aufgreift, nicht zuletzt als Lehre aus den Erfahrungen des SRB.6. Zum Abschluss, ein paar Worte zur Kapitalmarktunion. Im Vergleich zu den USA spielen Kapitalmarktfinanzierungen in Europa weiterhin eine untergeordnete Rolle, denn europ\u00e4ische Unternehmen sind vorrangig bankfinanziert. Diversifizierte Finanzierungsquellen b\u00f6ten Perspektiven f\u00fcr Unternehmen und Investoren gleicherma\u00dfen und k\u00f6nnten die Abh\u00e4ngigkeit vom Bankensektor mindern. Ein einheitlicher Kapitalmarkt w\u00e4re auch f\u00fcr Banken vorteilhaft, nicht zuletzt profitieren Banken vom erleichterten Wertpapierhandel, insbesondere bei der Emission eigner Papiere und dem Aufbau von MREL mit grenz\u00fcbergreifendem Zugang zu Anlegern. Die Kapitalmarktunion war ein Kernthema der scheidene Kommission und wird auf der Agenda bleiben. Themen wie ein harmonisiertes Insolvenzrecht werden auch hier zu adressieren sein. Meine Damen und Herren, ich halte fest: In den vergangenen Jahren wurden in Europa und den USA weitreichende Ma\u00dfnahmen getroffen, um die geordnete Abwicklung von kriselnden Banken sicherzustellen und den Einsatz \u00f6ffentlicher Mittel zu vermeiden. Die Abwicklungsregime in den USA und Europa fu\u00dfen auf denselben globalen Standards, unterscheiden sich jedoch in ihrer Ausgestaltung nach nationalem Recht. Die FDIC kam im Gegensatz zum SRB in ihrer neuen Rolle noch nicht zum Einsatz, ihre weitreichenden Kompetenzen bieten jedoch hinreichend Inspiration, um die Handlungsf\u00e4higkeit des europ\u00e4ische Abwicklungsregime zu steigern. Die europ\u00e4ische Bankenunion muss entschlossen und zeitnah zu Ende gedacht werden. Die Kapitalmarkunion ist wichtige und logische Erg\u00e4nzung der Bankenunion, von der mittelfristig Unternehmen, Banken und Investoren profitieren k\u00f6nnen.Vielen Dank.[1] BIS paper: Playing it safe: global systemically important banks after the crisis[2] Kapitalausstattung der Banken:\u00a0BaFin-R\u00fcckschau zehn Jahre nach der Finanzkrise", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/840"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0051", "date": "2019-10-15", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "European banking \u2013 there is strength in diversity - Eurofi article by Elke K\u00f6nig", "text": "If the European Union\u2019s motto is \u2018United in Diversity\u2019, then perhaps the Banking Union\u2019s motto should be something along the lines of \u2018Strength in Diversity\u2019. The Banking Union is a diverse mosaic of small and complex financial institutions. In some states, the banking market is dominated by foreign operators. In others it is small banks that have the lion\u2019s share of the market. And in others still, the market is largely made up of just a few large banks. The structure of individual markets within the Banking Union varies hugely reflecting not least different traditional development. This diversity in structures is not necessarily a bad thing. For example, a large bank poses a serious risk to financial stability if it cannot be made resolvable; smaller banks may not have the economies of scale to be viable in the long-term. There are pros and cons to each model \u2013 the important thing from a financial stability point of view is that small banks and big banks have sustainable business models. Regulation and supervision have to cope with the variety of business models. Just to name two points: Regulation has to be proportionate, there is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d and in a single market the diversity in national rules has to be overcome to facilitate mergers and acquisitions.A good regulatory framework can facilitate this, but of course, the role of the regulator is not to ensure every bank can make a profit. Every bank, big and small, must be in a position to comply with regulatory standards and bear the cost that is inherent in the safety net that regulation provides to society. That said, the regulatory landscape should facilitate as much as possible the natural behavior of a free market in the European banking sector. The challenge for regulation has always been to recognize that one size does not fit all, while also balancing the need for a level-playing field.However, it is not just about regulation for the financial industry. A fully functioning Capital Markets Union, which allowed for investment to flow easily across the euro area, is much needed and would do much to ensure that banks have an enlarged \u201chome market for capitalization and investment\u201d. A proper, fully functioning capital markets union in Europe would allow for greater integration of investment, allowing for the possibility of more consolidation, creating banks ready to operate right across the 19 Eurozone countries. This would introduce competition for the consumer, but it would also diversify the banking market within many member states, which would be a good thing. Unlike the Banking Union however, the Capital Markets Union is more of a concept, and idea or a notion, rather than a concrete legislative framework.There is also work to be done in harmonising insolvency procedures. In the Banking Union itself we have 19 different insolvency procedures, so banks and their investors will have to contend with and learn about many different legal systems just to invest in a market that is outside their home member state. The single market has still a way to go.It is also true that completing the Banking Union and having all European deposits protected at EU level, in a harmonized way, would promote stability and confidence if and when the next crisis strikes.There probably is a need for consolidation in the European banking market in order to remove overcapacity and ensure greater profitability overall. Some banks will simply have to exit the market; mergers and acquisitions can play a significant role in consolidation. In any case, a completed Banking Union and a full Capital Markets Union would be a solid framework so that the markets can be left to play their part, strengthening the sector going forward and thus helping to promote financial stability.This article first\u00a0appeared in Views, the magazine of the Eurofi forum\u00a0held in Helsinki in September 2019.", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/834"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0052", "date": "2019-09-23", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "A common set of rules for liquidation for small and medium-sized banks - Eurofi article by Elke K\u00f6nig", "text": "The definition of a bank\u2019s size as small, medium or big is relative. The Banking Union (BU) established a definition for significant institutions and a dedicated framework. However, there are many other institutions as well as significant institutions, which are not small but for which resolution will not be the option in case of failure. The EU framework makes clear and we have repeatedly stressed that resolution is for the few, not the many. The decision to put a failing institution into resolution depends on the outcome of a \u201cpublic interest assessment\u201d (PIA), determining if the preservation of a bank\u2019s critical functions is required to maintain financial stability. If the PIA\u2019s outcome is negative, a failing bank will be sent into national insolvency. In order to increase transparency the SRB recently published a paper on PIA presenting the methodology and how the SRB assesses the criteria set out by EU law. In due consideration of proportionality in resolution planning, the loss absorption requirements for each institution are carefully adjusted to the choice of resolution tools. Banks, for which in case of failure no resolution is foreseen, do not have to build up Minimum Requirement for own funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL) on top of their supervisory capital requirements for going concern. Hence, those banks do not face further costs apart from the regular costs for supervisory compliance and basic recovery and resolution planning. In contrast, for banks, whose preferred strategy is resolution, the SRB\u2019s MREL policy and its expectations for resolvability provide for certain adjustments to allow for proportionality as well. The SRB can also grant transitional periods for banks, based on features such as market conditions or a bank\u2019s liability structure or market access, in order to allow for a gradual build-up of MREL requirements. However, the rules require, that before using the SRF significant losses must be absorbed by the bank\u2019s equity- and bondholders. And it is undisputed that sufficient MREL is needed to implement any resolution strategy. In this regard the SRB must strike a careful balance between feasibility of the build-up of MREL and the credibility of the resolution strategy. Building up the capital buffers may be challenging for smaller fully deposit funded banks. For this reason, a common set of rules for winding down such banks could be beneficial - for some SRB banks and all less significant banks. While we have one common European resolution scheme, in the BU we are faced with 19 different national insolvency laws when winding-down a (cross-border) bank. A set of common standards, practices and harmonised rules for the liquidation of banks would considerably facilitate resolution planning, increase predictability and prevent diverging outcomes in different member states. Needless to say that administrative procedures might be preferable to judicial procedures. At the end of this process might stand the creation of a European bank liquidation regime - a European FDIC. Not only would this ensure centralised decision-making, but also the application of a harmonized and effective toolbox supported by a European deposit insurance. With this being a long decision-making process, legislators should wait no longer.

First and foremost I want to say congratulations to each and every one of you. Not only have the peoples of Europe put their trust in you to be their representative at the European Parliament, but you have also managed to be elected onto one of the most dynamic and interesting committees in Parliament. Mr Chair, I\u2019d like to congratulate you, also, on your reappointment to this role.I look forward to working with you in the coming mandate. Together, we can build financial stability in the EU, while ensuring that our taxpayers never again have to foot the bill for a bank bail-out.Dear Chair, if I may, I\u2019d like to start - on this, my seventeenth visit to the ECON committee - with an overview of what the SRB does. Then, I\u2019d like to give a brief synopsis of some of the areas where we have made good progress to date. Then, to finish, I will look at ongoing files and forward, to the key priorities and challenges for the SRB \u2013 although some of this information was in our recently published annual report, which no doubt you have read from cover to cover![The SRB\u2019s Mission]First a word on the SRB itself.The creation of the Banking Union was the cornerstone of the EU response to the crash of 2008. The Banking Union contains three pillars, the first being the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), the second being the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) and the third, which is still not in place, is to be a common scheme to protect deposits of European citizens, harmonised across the continent.The Single Resolution Board (SRB) is part of the second pillar, the SRM, and we are governed by the provisions of the BRRD and the SRMR. The recent Banking Package improves that framework.I\u2019ll come back to our work in a moment, but first I want to say a word or two on the concept of resolution.The idea of resolution is, put simply, to ensure that a bank that runs into trouble can be dealt with effectively, having the smallest possible impact on the taxpayer - in other words, no more bail-outs - and at the same time, causing the least amount of damage to the wider economy.Most banks will fall under normal national insolvency proceedings in the same manner as any other failing business is dealt with. However, for what we call \u2018systemically important\u2019 banks - whose failure would have a ripple effect on the rest of the economy - we have the new concept of resolution. But it is the exception, not the rule.Resolution is for the few, not the many.Right from the beginning it\u2019s important to note that resolution is not some kind of panacea to take away all the damage inherent in failing banks. Our job, as the Single Resolution Board, is to make sure that this process is managed fairly and that the damage caused by a mismanaged bank is kept to a minimum. Bail-outs are preventable with the right tools.Indeed, the resolution of Banco Popular is proof of this.[A brief look back at the main achievements]We successfully dealt with our first Resolution case in 2017 with Banco Popular \u2013 protecting the Spanish taxpayer and ensuring stability in the financial system. In summer last year, we began the Right to be Heard process \u2013 which is still ongoing - in order to ensure full transparency.Another achievement is the ongoing build-up of the Single Resolution Fund \u2013 a fund to ensure taxpayers won\u2019t have to bail the banks and their bondholders out.\u00a0 The Fund today stands at just under \u20ac33 billion. It is on target to reach 1% of covered deposits by 2023, which would be somewhere around \u20ac60 billion. \u00a0Thirdly, we have developed resolution plans for all the relevant banking groups under our remit and we continue the work to strengthen and update those plans to ensure that banks become resolvable.[Implementing the Framework]More generally, now that the framework for the SRB is broadly in place, we are moving from policy development to action and implementation. We have worked with industry and the national authorities, putting in place policies and guidance documents to operationalise the resolution framework. In terms of ensuring banks make themselves resolvable, we focus on a number of core topics.MREL is possibly the best known condition to making banks resolvable. Our MREL policy ensures that banks have sufficient funds to absorb losses and be recapitalised - thereby replacing the need for a taxpayer-funded bail-out with a privately financed \u201cbail-in\u201d. Ensuring sufficient MREL is one of our most important policies, but it is not the only thing necessary for resolution.Other potential obstacles to resolution include:Group structures and operations \u2013 especially when they are complex and cross border.The lack of efficient and well connected IT systems to ensure the timely flow of accurate data.The issue of operational continuity \u2013 how can we make sure that there is continuity of operations in a resolution case?The lack of clear governance and communication. It is important that both internal and external communication is fine-tuned so that everyone understands what is happening \u2013 but all this requires time and resources.Of course, these are issues at a macro level. The SRB\u2019s work is also focused on issuing specific, tailored guidance to individual banks. The current resolution planning cycle runs over 2018 and 2019, but from next year, as we strive to get to the \u2018steady state\u2019, the cycle will be annual, even if the long consultation processes required under the rules make this a serious challenge. Our resolution teams have already communicated individual priorities for each bank as part of the 2018 / 2019 cycle. In the autumn, we also expect to set out a more general and comprehensive public outline of what are our resolvability expectations for all banks, which should further the general understanding of resolvability. \u00a0[Improving the Framework Going Forward]Dear Chair, Honourable members,As I said at the start, our very reason for existing as an organisation \u2013 our raison d\u2019etre - is to promote financial stability, while protecting the European taxpayer. In the years to come, we want to continue that work \u2013 so what would our \u2018wish list\u2019 look like, in terms of improving the framework for financial stability?First off, we\u2019d like to see the completion of the CMU. This is no doubt a core piece for the single market, but it is also key for the SRB. Banks need to strengthen their capital as well as issuing and maintaining the needed MREL. Banks have already come a long way, but still need to issue a considerable amount of liabilities to meet their MREL targets. This should be doable in a deep and liquid capital market in Euro, not just US Dollars. \u00a0In terms of improving the financial stability framework \u2013 a word on the Risk Reduction Package. While this package contains many features that strengthen resolvability, such as the requirements regarding the quality and quantity of MREL, there are also certain provisions that have the potential to lead to frictions. The implementation of these highly complex new provisions will constitute a major field of activity in the near future. Nothing is so good that it cannot be improved. Our guiding principle should be clear competencies and strengthening the framework.In upcoming legislation, the Commission may undertake a review of the existing legislation, as envisaged by the legal text. In this case, we would count on all of you to support our cause in further strengthening the resolution framework and sharpen the tools in our toolbox.Next on the list we\u2019d like to see the promised third pillar of the Banking Union become a reality. Reducing or ending the divergence of national insolvency laws is important, at the least having harmonised administrative procedures for banks going into insolvency. Within this context, the depositor guarantee scheme should provide the needed tools to liquidate banks, as well as being truly European. And to be ambitious: the FDIC model is one we might need to take a very close look at in Europe \u2013 it would be the logical next step.Liquidity in resolution is another area we\u2019d like to see dealt with. It is a key gap in the current framework. The SRF could play a role in liquidity provisioning, but this role will be limited due to the SRF\u2019s size both during the transitionary period and after the target level is reached. While the Common Backstop will cover all uses of the SRF, including liquidity in resolution, this would still not address the liquidity needs of a large bank. Here concerted solutions that include central banks are needed.And last but not least on our \u2018wish list\u2019\u2013 we would like to see the development of a resolution framework for CCPs, as the largest banks under our remit are often clearing members of these CCPs and are therefore exposed to their tail-risk. This file should not be forgotten.[Conclusion]Dear Chair, Honourable Members,We have made good progress, but there is much more to do. I am confident that we can work together to ensure we have a stable financial system in Europe and that we protect our taxpayers from any future bail-out. In the near future we also hope to welcome Bulgaria and Croatia to the Banking Union. This is proof that the Banking Union is working and desirable, even for those not part of the euro.I am very much looking forward to working with you over the next five years.I now look forward to questions from the Honourable Members.", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/807"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0056", "date": "2019-07-02", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Banco Popular Right To Be Heard Update", "text": "SRB Update on the Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol Right To Be Heard ProcessIn light of the questions received by the SRB via e-mail in relation to Valuation 3 and the \u2018right to be heard\u2019 process, the SRB would like to inform you that it is currently assessing the comments received from the shareholders and creditors affected by the resolution actions concerning Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol S.A.

In 2018, the SRB differentiated between banks active entirely in the Banking Union, i.e. banks without a resolution college, and the most complex, internationally active banks, i.e. banks with resolution colleges, for which the planning cycle reaches well into 2019. The resolution planning cycle for 2018/2019 marks a type of transition phase in order to get to accelerate work and get to the steady state for resolution planning.\u00a0The SRB intends to use the transition phase to implement the new provisions of the risk reduction package, which was agreed upon by EU lawmakers in 2018. Political agreement on the Common Backstop marked another important milestone for the SRB\u2019s work.As part of its commitment to be ever more transparent, the SRB published its detailed MREL policy and communicated extensively with the banks under its remit to reach its goal to have fully-fledged resolution plans for all banking groups under its remit by 2020.Speaking at the launch of the report, SRB Chair Elke K\u00f6nig said \u20182018 marked ten years since the economic crash, but it also marked the beginning of a new phase for the SRB. We now move our focus from establishing the broad policies to implementing them and thus making banks truly resolvable.

If not, resolution actions would not be taken and national insolvency procedures would apply.\u00a0The document gives clarity to the factors the SRB takes into account when conducting a PIA, and explains how the SRB applies the criteria as set out in EU law. The publication of the methodology is aimed at providing more transparency and certainty for banks and the markets.Speaking in Brussels, the Chair of the SRB, Dr. Elke K\u00f6nig commented, \u2018The resolution framework as an exception to normal insolvency sets strict conditions and the Public Interest Assessment is a core element in this context. Today\u2019s SRB\u2019s publication aims to provide clarity and transparency to all stakeholders.\u201dThe approach was developed by the SRB and national resolution authorities, in consultation with the ECB and the EBA, to ensure a common understanding across the Banking Union. It is one of the key policies underpinning the work of the SRB.Background: The Public Interest Assessment (PIA)When the SRB considers whether to plan for or to take resolution action \u2013 both at the resolution planning stage and after a failing or likely to fail (FOLTF) declaration \u2013 it performs a PIA. The conclusion of the PIA drives the decision as to whether resolution is to be considered as the preferred option in resolution planning respectively a resolution decision taken and not normal insolvency proceedings pursued in case of a failing bank. The PIA ensures that, in the case of resolution action, it would achieve one or more of the resolution objectives better than would be the case with a national insolvency procedure. The resolutions objectives are, inter alia, avoiding significant adverse effects on financial stability, protecting depositors covered by Directive 2014/49/EU (on Deposit Guarantee Schemes) and safeguarding public funds by minimising reliance on extraordinary public financial support.", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/799"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0061", "date": "2019-05-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Banking Union financial integration: time to consolidate trust - Eurofi Article by Elke K\u00f6nig", "text": "Extensive literature exists on the benefits of financial integration and consolidation of banks. From the perspective of the Single Resolution Board, whose mandate focuses on achieving banks\u2019 resolvability, having strong European banks is a natural aspiration. Where there is a solid business case, consolidation can bring economies of scale and increase profitability. It can improve diversification of risks within banking groups. It can also increase banks\u2019 access to capital markets and decrease their funding cost, ultimately facilitating their build-up of loss absorption capacity to meet the so-called Minimum Requirement of Eligible Liabilities (MREL).Moreover, like cross-border capital markets, cross-border banks can play the important role of reducing risks through private risk sharing within the Banking Union. Indeed, cross-border banks are better equipped to withstand and absorb idiosyncratic shocks that may affect one or another Member State. Beyond the perspective of banks and Member States, it is important to look at this topic from the perspective of the investor too. Financial integration could lead to more efficient markets and provide financial services users with better choices.This being said, consolidation within the banking sector should not be seen as a panacea or a short cut to avoid necessary reforms. In this sense, it is crucial for a resolution authority that consolidation facilitates rather than hinders the resolvability of a bank, in line with the Single Resolution Board\u2019s resolvability expectations.Overall, the advantages of banks\u2019 consolidation seem therefore evident. In addition, the establishment of the institutional infrastructure of the Banking Union can also be seen as a favourable element: although the third pillar, common deposit insurance, is yet to be built, a single supervisory mechanism and a single resolution mechanism are up and running.In spite of all of this, financial integration within the Banking Union is still lagging behind. Several studies have found multiple causes behind this trend. Market factors surely play a prominent role. However, there are also challenges that could be addressed by policy-makers and regulators.Among these, EU legislators and regulators should keep up the momentum on the clean-up of banks\u2019 balance sheets. The harmonisation of relevant legislation, such as insolvency proceedings, could also contribute to remove barriers for the cross-border consolidation of banks.\u00a0Finally, yet importantly, rule-makers and regulators should resist the temptation of ring-fencing capital and liquidity resources, as this can lead to suboptimal location and rigidity in the deployment of such resources. Regrettably, the recently agreed banking package does not mark a step forward on this aspect. Rather, it runs the risks of, first, fragmenting decision-making within the Banking Union on external MREL, and second, ring-fencing of internal MREL. The Single Resolution Board already invests and will continue to invest significant resources to reach joint decisions with national authorities on resolution plans, calibration and location of MREL, and bail-in playbooks. Such day-to-day cooperation should increase mutual trust within the Banking Union, and ultimately be reflected in a future revised regulatory framework.In a word, Rome was not built in a day. Just like in the United States, where financial integration took decades, it is not surprising that the road for Banking Union integration is still long and winding. However, the direction of travel should remain clear, and the need to consolidate trust along the way should be high on everybody\u2019s agenda.\u00a0", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/758"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0062", "date": "2019-05-07", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Resolution and Liquidation: closing the gaps - Eurofi Article by Elke K\u00f6nig", "text": "As the mandate of the current European Commission and Parliament draws to an end, it is worth reflecting on the progress made, as well as the priorities on the resolution framework for the next EU legislature.From the perspective of the Single Resolution Board (SRB), the finalisation of the Banking Package represents a milestone in further strengthening the framework. The partial harmonisation of the creditor hierarchy was another step forward. Building on these achievements, the SRB is hopeful that the next legislature will deliver on the implementation, review and completion of the resolution framework.The lingering asymmetries between the EU resolution regime and national insolvency frameworks are one of the areas where further progress is needed. The problems are well known and the SRB, as well as other authorities, academics and the industry, have made their case more than once.To recall, the assessment of the no-creditor-worse-off principle (comparing the treatment of creditors in resolution to the one they would have received under insolvency proceedings) is complicated by the co-existence of nineteen different insolvency frameworks in the Banking Union. This results in diverging outcomes depending on where a bank entity is located.Moreover, the conditions to determine that a bank is \u2018failing or likely to fail\u2019 are not necessarily aligned to the criteria for liquidation at national level, which also poses challenges.Furthermore, the requirements for burden sharing under the European Commission\u2019s 2013 Banking Communication, which apply in cases of precautionary recapitalisation and liquidation aid, are not entirely in line with those for bail-in under the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation (SRMR), potentially giving wrong incentives when compared to resolution.Finally, the ranking of creditors in insolvency was only partially harmonised: Directive 2017/2399 focused only on unsecured debt instruments in the hierarchy, while national differences remain on the ranking of the rest of the creditors, leading also to divergences in the protection of creditors and uneven loss absorption.In the next mandate, legislators could focus on these issues to complete the framework. This could be done gradually: the review of Directive 2017/2399 could be an opportunity to fully harmonise the creditor hierarchy, while BRRD/SRMR and the 2013 Banking Communication could be revised to align incentives and close the gaps between the EU resolution framework and the insolvency rules for banks. In this sense, the set up and experience of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the US offers a number of lessons, as recently highlighted by a study from the European Parliament Think Tank.It is not only authorities and credit institutions \u2013 particularly the ones less likely to pass the public interest test and therefore be resolved \u2013 that would gain from a common and upgraded insolvency regime. Investors and creditors (including households) would also greatly benefit from a stable underlying legal framework that provides the same degree of certainty in liquidation as in resolution.\u00a0It is often emphasised that deepening the EU\u2019s Economic and Monetary Union requires the completion of the Banking Union and of the Capital Markets Union. A common framework for banks\u2019 insolvency would constitute a significant advance on both paths. In turn, both the Banking Union and a strong, truly European capital market can play an important role in the creation of the needed liquidity for capital instruments and MREL. Therefore, work on those files must continue to progress in the new EU legislature.", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/759"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0063", "date": "2019-05-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "SRB announces the appointment of new  Board Member Sebastiano Laviola", "text": "The Single Resolution Board (SRB) announces the appointment of Mr Sebastiano Laviola as Member of the Board and Director of Resolution Strategy and Cooperation.

It is hard to believe it, but this is the sixteenth and last time I will be here in front of you in this European Parliament period \u2013 tempus fugit!\u00a0A brief look back at the main achievementsIn the past five years, we have made good progress. Too much for me to mention in one speech, but I\u2019d like to touch briefly on some of the highlights.In May 2014, the BRRD came into being, putting in place a framework to allow bail-in to replace bail-out in case of bank failure. In July 2014, the SRMR came into effect, laying the ground for the establishment of the SRB. The adoption of the Banking Package just before Christmas last year is another important milestone.For the SRB itself, we too have been busy over this past parliamentary mandate. We successfully dealt with our first Resolution case in Banco Popular \u2013 protecting the Spanish taxpayer and ensuring stability in the financial system, while ensuring that critical functions continued unhindered.But let me be clear here. In any resolution or insolvency, losses have to be allocated. It is always going to cause some people to lose money, and in this case, concretely shareholders and bondholders. But we can say that we have dealt with Spain\u2019s sixth largest bank very effectively and without an impact on financial stability.The SRB is steadily building up the SRF and it is well on the road to reaching the target of 1% of covered deposits by 2023.Over the past few years, we have developed resolution plans for all the banking groups under our remit and we continue the work to strengthen those plans.The SRB itself has grown from zero staff to hopefully close to 400 full-time staff by the end of this year.\u00a0Implementing the FrameworkThe focus of the SRB has moved gradually from policy development to implementing the framework that has been put in place.\u00a0 We have been working closely with the NRAs and with the Banks on developing a number of polices in order to make the resolution framework a reality. Banks know very well the direction of travel and responsible management teams are already doing the work to make themselves resolvable.However, where banks are not cooperating as they should, I have a clear message: the SRB will intervene if it has to. No one can avoid the task of making their bank resolvable, postponing is not an option.\u00a0[MREL]MREL is possibly the most well-known condition to making banks resolvable by ensuring they have sufficient funds to absorb losses and be recapitalised - thereby replacing the need for a taxpayer-funded bail-out with a privately financed \u201cbail-in\u201d. That is why it is one of our most important policies. The SRB has taken a gradual, multi-year approach to MREL. We also strive to facilitate the transition for banks towards the upcoming new rules, which provide for a minimum statutory requirement for subordinated liabilities and a framework for setting internal MREL.The latest SRB policy, published in January, enhances the quality and quantity of MREL by introducing a series of new features to strengthen banks\u2019 resolvability.The lack of sufficient MREL could, of course, be an important barrier to executing the resolution strategy, but it is not the only one.The findings from our first resolution planning cycles have revealed the following areas as potential obstacles to resolution:group structures and operations, (ii) management information systems; (iii) operational continuity; (iv) communication.\u00a0Let\u2019s take them one by one:Group structures and operationsBanks, and particularly large cross-border ones, are characterised by complex group structures, which can pose barriers to their resolvability. A resolution authority must, therefore, ensure that these would not hinder but rather facilitate the execution of the preferred resolution strategy.The funding structure is equally a key element, which links back to MREL. Plans to meet MREL targets need to be developed by banks, and there should be no barrier to the down-streaming of resources and upstreaming of losses within the group. These two things are needed: \u00a0National handbooks and Playbooks for bail-in. Management information systemsA key resolvability element is the ability of banks to deliver complete and accurate information in a timely fashion. This is the case for resolution planning purposes - but even more importantly in a crisis scenario, with tight timelines and more data needs.In February this year, the SRB published its Framework for Valuation, which describes our expectations regarding the principles and methodologies for (the so-called second and third) valuation reports to be carried out by independent valuers as set out in the legal framework. This Framework is not directed at banks, but it should already be useful for them as an indication of the information that the valuer may need to conduct any valuations. Further work is ongoing by the SRB, together with the European Banking Authority, to define the expectations for valuation information.Operational continuityAnother important aspect for achieving resolvability is ensuring operational continuity in resolution and maintaining access to financial market infrastructures or FMIs and FMI intermediaries ahead of, and during resolution. This requires banks to identify and map all services necessary for the provision of critical functions and critical business lines.Governance and communicationAs a further aspect, banks need to have clearly defined governance procedures to support timely decision-making in resolution and a clear plan to communicate to internal and external stakeholders.\u00a0The SRB\u2019s key priorities for 2019Dear Chair, Honourable members,Let me briefly mention our internal priorities for this year, bearing in mind that resolution planning remains our core task. The SRB continues to work hard on its 2019 resolution planning cycle. Our resolution teams have of course already communicated the 2019 individual priorities for each bank.We have been working internally on updating \u2013 or rather collating \u2013 the various policies in an updated resolution planning manual to be used by our IRTs and the NRAs. This autumn, we also expect to set out a more comprehensive outline of what are our resolvability expectations towards all banks, which should help public understanding. And last, but not least, we are preparing for the implementation of BRRD II and SRMR II.[ \u201cRequests\u201d for changes \u2013 food for thought]When I look to the wider context, let me recall that the SRB\u2019s purpose is to promote financial stability, while protecting the European taxpayer. We want to continue that work, and play our part to ensure Europe develops, deepens and strengthens the Banking Union and the Capital Markets Union. \u00a0[Completion of the CMU]From the SRB\u2019s perspective it is evident that the EU needs a stronger and more harmonised capital market. Banks need to strengthen their capital as well as issuing and maintaining the needed MREL. This should be doable in a deep and liquid European capital market in Euro, not just US Dollars.\u00a0[Implementing EDIS & completing the 3rd pillar] The much discussed EDIS project remains a priority for the SRB. I share with many of you the frustration in the Banking Union still not being complete. That said, it remains on our \u2018shopping list\u2019 and so we continue to highlight its benefits and hope it will come into being. The third and final pillar of the Banking Union is vital, let\u2019s hope we see movement on it as soon as possible.[Insolvency law harmonisation]This is not the first time I have raised the issue of insolvency laws, although it may be the last time I raise it in this current Parliament cycle.The divergence of national insolvency laws is a major obstacle towards a fully-fledged Banking Union. The safeguard that no creditor shall be worse off in resolution than in insolvency is an important protection provided for in the regulation. However, there might be different results in different countries depending on the national insolvency regime, which could negatively impact on the resolution procedure.[Liquidity and the Fund]\u00a0 Dare I mention the word \u2018backstop\u2019 in Brussels these days! I am of course speaking of the SRF backstop, not the Irish one. This will be an important buffer in giving the markets confidence in a time of crisis or resolution.Liquidity in resolution is a key gap in the framework. The SRF could play a role in liquidity provisioning as a last resort, but this role will be limited due to the SRF\u2019s size both during the transitionary period and after the target level is reached, even when we add the Common Backstop. Addressing this issue will materially enhance financial stability. Let\u2019s hope for progress in the Council discussion.\u00a0ConclusionDear Mr Chair, Honourable Members, I am drawing to a close. Together, we have achieved a lot, but there is much more to come.It goes without saying that the Banking Union has made a difference. Banks are sounder and safer than some years ago, with better quality and quantity of capital. Also the work on making them resolvable is progressing \u2013 but this is a marathon, not a sprint.I want to thank each of you, and your teams for your cooperation and support during this mandate of Parliament. I wish all those running for the European elections the very best next month.I now look forward to questions from the Honourable Members", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/744"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0069", "date": "2019-03-26", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Press Breakfast Speech by Dr Elke K\u00f6nig", "text": "CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY[Introduction] Ladies and Gentlemen,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for joining us this morning and a very warm welcome to the Single Resolution Board.Many of you are familiar with the SRB building at this stage whether at this event or through our regular technical briefings, or getting in touch with our communications team, but regardless of whether it is your first or fiftieth time here \u2013 you are welcome! \u00a0I will be as brief as possible in order to allow you time to ask questions to the board gathered here this morning.[2018 Overview]2018 was another busy year for the SRB. We continued our policies to ensure that we promote financial stability while ensuring that the taxpayer is protected. This year there was no resolution case to be managed, perhaps due to our good work on recovery and resolution planning!In order to ensure resolvability for significant institutions under our remit, but also less significant institutions, the SRB continued its close and successful cooperation with the National Resolution Authorities through internal resolution teams.We worked on 109 resolution plans for the 2018 resolution planning cycle, which has been split into two waves. The first wave consists of banks with no activity in non-Banking Union Member States while the second wave comprises the more complex, internationally active banks. For this second group, resolution colleges with the non Banking Union countries need to be organised and the process takes longer. But this is also the group that had already binding MREL targets and now these are being refined with more stringent features.\u00a0When it comes to resolution planning, the SRB updated its resolution planning manual which incorporates the latest array of tools and policies, a public version of which shall be available later in the year, clearly spelling out our expectations towards banks.Banks themselves should be clear by now on what they have to do to make themselves resolvable due to the ongoing interaction with our teams. However, this manual will hopefully give further external visibility of the topic.To move on with the stocktake, the SRB continued to provide its technical expertise during the negotiations on the Risk Reduction Package and the fiscal backstop which thankfully saw an agreement in December.We also concluded an additional four bilateral cooperation arrangements \u2014 with the Central Bank of Brazil, the National Bank of Serbia, the Bank of Albania and Mexico\u2019s Institute for the Protection of Bank Savings. I hope there will be many more to come.Concerning crisis preparedness, the SRB continued its internal work on important projects such as the valuation project and the creation of a dedicated Resolution Tactical Team in order to optimise crisis workflows. In addition, three dry-run exercises were carried out together with the other relevant institutions. In 2018, the Single Resolution Fund collected EUR 7.5 billion of ex-ante contributions to achieve the target level of the fund in 2024. The amount held in the SRF is now EUR 24.9 billion. We\u00a0\u00a0 expect to further build up the SRF to over 30 billion this year with contributions due by 30 June 2019.Last but not least, in 2018 the SRB further intensified its communication with the banks under its remit in numerous presentations, dedicated workshops and two industry dialogues. This is all with the aim of ensuring banks know what is expected from them to be considered resolvable.[SRB \u2013 More to do]We have made good progress, but there is still much more to do. As I have said before, the journey to resolvability is a marathon, not a sprint.Looking forward on our MREL policy, as you know the SRB has taken a gradual, multi-year approach to MREL. The goal is to maintain proportionality in the system while preserving a level playing field and upholding high resolution standards across the Banking Union. We have gradually moved from setting informative to binding MREL targets for banking groups under our remit. MREL cannot be built-up over night by the banks, so the SRB allows for transitional periods to meet the targets where necessary.The latest SRB policy for the most complex banks, published in January, enhances the quality and quantity of MREL by introducing a series of new features to strengthen banks\u2019 resolvability. Just to mention some new elements: stricter eligibility of instruments for consolidated MREL-targets, an increased minimum requirement of subordinated liabilities, an introduction of binding MREL targets at individual level that can be met with intra-group liabilities.This latest policy is, of course, grounded on the currently applicable legal framework. But it also strives to facilitate, to the extent possible, the transition for banks towards upcoming new rules which indeed provide for, inter alia, a minimum statutory requirement for subordinated liabilities and a framework for setting internal MREL. In the resolution planning cycle of 2019, the SRB expects to adopt more than 100 group-level MREL decisions, and to determine MREL targets for over 530 individual entities.The lack of sufficient MREL can be an important barrier to executing the resolution strategy, but it is not the only necessary condition for resolvability. Availability of data, legal structures and operational continuity remain key topics.Another area of policy work which might be a longer term project relates to the improvement and harmonisation of insolvency laws in the EU.While the backstop to the SRF is now agreed in principle, a framework for liquidity in resolution still needs to be developed. And of course the third pillar of the Banking Union, the European Deposit Insurance Scheme is missing. How far we are from that becoming a reality is anyone\u2019s guess.[2019: A period of transition awaits the SRB]So far we have built good foundations in resolution planning. 2019 sees the SRB enter into the second year of our multi-annual plan, published at the end of 2017, which - as a reminder - contains five key priority areas. These are:1. Strengthening resolvability for SRB entities and less significant institutions, in other words, the smaller banks;2. Fostering a robust resolution framework;3. Preparing and carrying out effective crisis management;4. Operationalising the Single Resolution Fund, and5. Ensuring the SRB is an efficient organisation.Progress has been made in all five areas. It has perhaps not always been as speedy as one would like, but these are very complex topics.Now, we are moving from the stage of setting up the framework and the foundations of resolution planning, to the implementation phase \u2013 the nitty gritty if you like. As time moves on, adjustments are being made to the framework to help the SRB be as effective as possible in our work promoting financial stability while protecting the taxpayer.\u00a0 And of course we are preparing to adapt to the new regime under BRRD2. Here the good news is that it will strengthen MREL in general and that it will be a continuation of our MREL policy to be built on step-by-step.To leave you with a simplified picture: the SRB\u2019s role is to set policies, analyse the bank and point towards steps to be taken to make them resolvable.The banks\u2019 role is to make themselves resolvable, with the SRB monitoring their progress.The NRAs, on their part, are to propose national handbooks to prepare implementation of decisions.[Brexit] Let me add some comments on Brexit before finishing.The SRB is closely watching the events in the UK in relation to whether and under what arrangements the UK will leave the EU. All stakeholders in financial regulation are keeping the situation continuously under review and are working together for the common cause of financial stability. Preparations have been made, so the situation appears manageable. There may be volatility but given the level of preparedness there should be no imminent risk to financial stability.The SRB has consistently maintained its expectations in relation to resolvability in the context of Brexit, reiterated clearly in the Brexit Position Paper published in November 2018, aligned with the EBA\u2019s opinions. This included expectations for banks relocating to the EU27. The relevant internal resolution teams have been working closely with individual banks to implement these expectations, in preparation for any market instability.So, as I said, we are watching developments as closely as everyone else, and we wait to see what comes out of Westminster this week.\u00a0[Conclusion]I have said it before, but it\u2019s worth repeating - Resolution planning is a process not a product. There is always something new to deal with and plan for, but I suppose that is what keeps the topic interesting.I want to thank you for your interest, thank you for getting in touch with our communications team over the past year \u2013 without you we cannot continue to emphasise the important role the SRB plays in promoting financial stability while protecting the taxpayer.Now I will stop there so that you have a chance to speak and ask questions of us as a Board. \u00a0Thank you.", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/739"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0070", "date": "2019-05-24", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Brexit: SRB expectations", "text": "The SRB has the mandate to ensure resolvability of all the banks under its remit.

The need for a harmonised European Deposit Insurance Scheme, as well as a backstop to the Single Resolution Fund, was emphasised, alongside the necessity of overcoming\u00a0inconsistencies\u00a0in national insolvency proceedings and of addressing transparency. Further, more technical\u00a0questions were raised this year as the SRB\u2019s resolution planning continued; are Management Information Systems (MIS) organised and accessible enough to allow for efficient resolution? Can backstop funds be accessed quickly enough? What about cyber-security risks? The progress made in resolution thus far encouraged the consideration of such novel topics\u2014evidence of the fact that the quest for resolvability is always changing and that the\u00a0concept of resolvability itself is evolving.Across all the topics discussed, there was certain\u00a0consensus on one issue: the need to fight against complacency.

The SRB continues to develop its MREL policy, step-by-step. This gives banks the clarity needed on the SRB\u2019s requirements for them to build up MREL.Concretely, in order to increase the quantity and quality of MREL, this second part of the 2018 MREL policy introduces a series of new features to strengthen banks\u2019 resolvability within the Banking Union. Among them, the main new ones are: a refined approach for eligible instruments for consolidated MREL-targets, increased binding subordination requirements and, last but not least, the introduction of binding MREL targets at individual level. \u00a0The SRB will continue to develop its MREL policy going forward. After the adoption of the Banking Package, the SRB policy will need to be adapted to address in particular the TLAC implementation and the new internal MREL requirements.ENDS See the policy hereVisit the MREL page hereFurther Information on the main new features: A Point-of-Entry approach will now apply to liabilities other than own funds instruments to meet consolidated MREL targets. Only liabilities issued directly by the resolution entity will be considered eligible to meet consolidated targets on the ground that resolution tools will be applied only to this entity in resolution.Subordination levels will now be set based on a combination of a general level and take into account of the bank-specific nature of the assessment of No-Creditor-Worse-Off risk in the senior layer. A general level of 16% risk weighted assets (RWA) plus the combined buffer requirement (CBR) will apply for global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs), and of 14% RWA plus CBR for other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs) and other resolution entities.The SRB will determine binding targets at the individual level for subsidiaries of banking groups, prioritising the most relevant entities for this wave of decisions, with a view to ensuring a sufficient quantum of loss absorbing capacity in all parts of the resolution group.About the Single Resolution Board The Single Resolution Board (SRB) is the central resolution authority within the Banking Union (BU). Together with the national resolution authorities of participating Member States it forms the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). The SRB works closely with the European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB), the European Banking Authority (EBA) and national competent authorities (NCAs). Its mission is to ensure an orderly resolution of failing banks with minimum impact on the real economy and public finances of the participating Member States and beyond.Media Contact details: E-mail:\u00a0 Sean.DE-BURCA@srb.europa.euPhone number: +3224903710Switchboard: +32 2 490 3000Mobile phone: +32477028710Website: https://srb.europa.eu/Twitter: @EU_SRB", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/708"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0075", "date": "2019-01-22", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Speech to the BPFI in Dublin by Elke K\u00f6nig \"Developments in the SRB: Setting MREL and Safeguarding Operational Continuity\"", "text": "IntroductionLadies and Gentlemen, Mr Tuohy, \u00a0Good morning and thank you for the invitation to be here in Dublin once again. I was here just two months ago, and next month the SRB has been invited to speak at the European Financial Forum in Dublin Castle. I am very pleased to be here, especially during these important times given the happenings across the Irish Sea.And it is with great pleasure that I come here \u2013 Ireland is set for an uncertain few months and I think it is important to show - through actions and words - that whatever happens in the coming months, we will work with Ireland \u2013 and with you, the representatives of its finance industry - to ensure stability well into the future \u2013 no matter what actually transpires on March 29th. Sabine has already elaborated on Brexit, and you can rest assured that the SSM and the SRM are working hand-in-hand with the national authorities as this issue develops.Coming back to today\u2019s event \u2013 this title of which is the future supervisory landscape, which of course is not something that is always easy to predict. Although humans can\u2019t easily predict the future, we are hopefully able to shape it.At the SRB, we are tasked with helping to shape the future. We are here to help shape a future that protects the taxpayer from any future bail-out, while ensuring financial stability in the European Union and beyond. We are here to work with the finance industry to make sure it becomes more responsible in the decisions it makes. We are here to end the concept of \u2018too-big to fail\u2019.\u00a0 And I think that the future we are helping to shape, is a future that will benefit citizens and industry, a future that contrasts with the events that took this country to the cliff-edge just over a decade ago. Those events have been well recounted, so I will not dwell on them too much, other than to say this: I am aware, as you are, of the disruption and suffering caused to both the Irish economy and to Irish society because of the financial crisis. Let us all work to ensure that this does not happen again.\u00a0A decade on from the crash, the European Union is still putting in place its response, which, as you may know, is the Banking Union. It is made up of three pillars \u2013 the Single Supervisory Mechanism, that Sabine has so eloquently covered, the Single Resolution Mechanism \u2013 where the SRB lies - and the third pillar, the European Deposit Insurance Scheme, which, we all hope (!) will be part of the future supervisory landscape at EU level in the not too distant future.If I may, I first want to look at the role of the SRB, and give a little context as to where we fit into the overall regulatory structure in the EU, before moving onto some concrete policy areas for 2019.\u00a0Role of the SRB and the shift of the past decade\u00a0 The SRB was set up in 2015 in order to create a single European authority responsible for developing and implementing resolution plans for banking groups in the euro area. The whole concept of resolution is a relatively new term. In fact, just ten years ago, the term \u2018resolution\u2019 had not even been coined, if you\u2019ll pardon the pun!A resolution was something you made at the start of the new year, but by around this stage of the year \u2013 two weeks in \u2013 resolutions would have already been forgotten! But let me reassure you, for us, resolution is here to stay. This year, all year, and for many years to come! Now that we have created the concept of resolution, the work of the SRB is really about developing and strengthening our resolution planning, and making sure that all plans are constantly as fine-tuned and up-to-date as possible.\u00a0Failure is normal In assessing the role of the Single Resolution Board, it is important to note that if a bank fails, this must not be seen as a failure of the system. On the contrary, banks should be able to fail; the exit of failing firms in a free market system is normal and ending the concept of \u2018too big to fail\u2019 is one of the SRB\u2019s key priorities.However while banks might be private businesses in the free market system, we of course recognise the difference between them and other businesses in the free market economy because of their underlying roles in areas such as credit flow to other businesses. Therefore we must have measures in place to ensure that the \u2018domino effect\u2019 is minimised as far as possible \u2013 every financial institution must be resolvable, and in accordance with free market principles, it should be banks\u2019 investors who bear the brunt of any failure \u2013 not the ordinary citizen. That might not be an immediately popular concept for industry, and there is of course a cost to the sector, but the result is far greater stability, which is good for the economy. I might also add that greater stability provides greater certainty for investors in the sector going forward. It\u2019s important to have balance \u2013 balance between agile banks and clear regulation to ensure financial stability. Even though it is crucial that all banks are resolvable, we must remember that resolution is for the few, not the many. In most cases, insolvency will be the procedure at play.Europe has seen a paradigm shift in the past decade; from taxpayer-funded bail-out \u2013 due to lack of alternatives \u2013 to the financially responsible tool of bail-in.\u00a0Role of the Industry in Making Banks ResolvableThe SRB is here to provide guidance to banks so that they can become resolvable. The industry over the past decade has become more responsible too, thanks to the new rules. It is you people, working in financial institutions, that know your institution best. You know how best to make it resolvable. We want to work with you \u2013 we do not want to impose a \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 type of regime \u2013 what is important for us is that we achieve resolvability for every institution.The SRB sets the direction, but the banks that are responsible have already taken steps to make their bank resolvable. Yes, we issue guidance and monitor the progress being made across all of the institutions under our remit. But let me be clear, banks in Europe are being given the chance and the responsibility to make themselves resolvable. However, if they ignore this chance, the SRB will have no choice but to intervene. I am pleased to say that on the whole, the Irish have been playing their part. In the end, this means that you are choosing the most efficient way to become resolvable, since you are listening to our guidance, and then identifying and handling obstacles yourselves, rather than waiting for an outside force, such as the SRB to dictate the steps to be taken.MREL \u2013 Latest Developments\u00a0 I want to be clear: there is no silver bullet, no one element that will make banks resolvable. It is only a suite of measures combined that will make every bank resolvable. However, one of the fundamentals in making banks resolvable is of course the building up of loss absorption capacity. Only yesterday, the SRB published a new policy document with regard to MREL. In 2018, the SRB split the cycle for resolution planning into two waves. This has followed a transitional two-step approach to the MREL-setting process. This policy applies to the second wave of resolution plans which are those of the most complex groups. The first part of this two-wave process was published in November 2018. The first part covered banks that did not have binding targets \u2013 those without presence outside the Banking Union. We published the second part yesterday, and I want to say a few words on this now.While this policy on MREL is based on the current legislative framework, the SRB is raising the bar in terms of banks\u2019 resolvability and MREL targets to prepare the ground for future regulatory changes in the context of the \u201cBanking Package\u201d , recently agreed upon but not yet formally adopted by the co-legislators back in Brussels.The SRB will therefore review its policy for MREL setting for further updates in 2019 on the basis of the publication of the Banking Package in the Official Journal of the EU, with the aim of charting a consistent path and preparing banks to transition to the new regime, as well as to reflect any change necessary due to those requirements potentially coming into force in 2019.While the 2018 SRB policy follows a number of the elements defined in the 2017 policy, some new elements are added into the 2018 policy. There are three elements of note:1. Location of eligible resources2. Subordination3. Setting of MREL at individual levelI\u2019ll take a look at each of these in turn.\u00a0Location of eligible resourcesFirst up \u2013 the location of eligible resources. Progressing from the consolidated approach counting all liabilities issued from entities of the same resolution group in the 2017 policy, a Point-of-Entry approach will now apply for liabilities other than own funds instruments. Only liabilities issued directly by the resolution entity will be considered eligible to meet consolidated targets. The amount of own funds instruments issued by the resolution entity or the subsidiaries within the resolution group that are recognised for meeting the consolidated CRR prudential requirements will continue to be included in MREL calculations taking into account the loss-absorbing capacity of own funds instruments located outside the resolution entity.SubordinationSubordination is instrumental for making resolution strategies more credible and feasible. In order to improve resolvability by addressing \u2018No Creditor Worse Off\u2019 risk and to support banks in effectively planning their funding needs, the SRB now moves from informative benchmarks in previous policy towards determining binding subordination requirements for all banks with a consolidated target, at increased levels.Subordination levels will be set based on a combination of a general level, applicable buffer requirements and a metric, taking account of the bank-specific nature of the assessment of \u2018No Creditor Worse Off\u2019 risk in the senior layer of liabilities.Introducing MREL at individual levelFinally on the policy published yesterday, with a view to ensuring a sufficient quantum of loss absorbing capacity in all parts of the resolution group, the SRB starts issuing binding targets at the individual level to subsidiaries of banking groups, prioritising the most relevant entities. Calibration of individual targets generally follows the methodology for consolidated targets, taking into account the applicability of individual components of prudential requirements of the default formula at individual level, as well as specificities in subsequent adjustments.While standard BRRD eligibility criteria apply, supplementary informative guidance on achieving internal MREL, aligned as closely as possible with eligibility for internal MREL as foreseen in the forthcoming Banking Package, is given to banks to enhance the internal loss absorbing capacity within the resolution groups and preparing banks for the future legal framework. Just to be clear: Banks need to build up the required MREL but they also need to develop the playbook on how to operationalise a write-down or bail-in.Operational Continuity Before I come to a close, just a few words on operational continuity. To ensure continuity of a banking group\u2019s critical economic functions and core business lines, which is one of the key resolution objectives, it is necessary to maintain the parallel continuity of the services and contracts that underpin them, including the continuity ofaccess to FMIs services for example payment systems, securities settlement systems and;(ii) financial contracts for example OTC derivatives, securities financing contracts.Any resolution of a failing bank would fall to the first obstacle if the interruption of critical services cannot be prevented upon the bank is put in resolution.Therefore, part of our resolution planning involves making sure that in times of crisis, operations can continue in as normal a fashion as possible. Irrespective of the service delivery model adopted, banking group are expected to structure their operational arrangements to facilitate the continuity of critical services in resolution. This, in particular, requires:Undertake a comprehensive identification and mapping of critical services to critical functions and core business lines and an adequate documenting of contractual arrangements and service-level agreements;Maintaining access to key operational assets (e.g. IT infrastructure) and mitigating key staff departing;Achieving resolution-resilient contractual service provisions;Ensuring financial resilience of service provision;Ensuring appropriate governance arrangements.Now that we have resolution plans in place for all of our institutions, the work of the SRB has also begun to focus on fine-tuning each plan so that it is truly ready to be sprung into action at short notice. In this context operational continuity has been considered one of the priorities of 2018 resolution planning cycle.With specific regard to the Irish context, it is worthwhile to mention that there are some domestic banks which have UK subsidiaries for which the PRA requirements on operational continuity apply since January 1st, 2019. However, the banks have taken an overarching group-wide approach in order to meet also the SRB expectations on operational continuity. The same approach is followed by UK banks with subsidiaries in Ireland where the SRB is the host authority, in order to ensure that operational continuity in resolution will be achieved on a group-wide basis and not just for group entities in the UK.Conclusion Ladies and Gentlemen,I have given you a flavour of the work of the SRB in terms of MREL. I suppose there are other topics I could have addressed too, such as Brexit, although Sabine has already given you a good overview into that one. The third pillar of the Banking Union, the Backstop to the Fund or the need to harmonise our 19 different insolvency regimes would be other areas I would have addressed had time allowed, but perhaps we will get to some of those in the Q&A.

It is my third and final appearance before ECON this year. Since my appointment I have been invited to speak fifteen times in this committee.As the year is ending, it is important to reflect upon not only our achievements, but also our future work. Since we last met in July, the Single Resolution Board (SRB) adopted its Work Programme 2019. In my introductory remarks today, I would therefore like to touch upon our upcoming priorities to achieve resolvability. I would also like to use the opportunity and share with you my view regarding a few policy topics that affect the SRB\u2019s mandate.\u00a0Resolution planning: a process not a productResolution planning is an essential element for achieving resolvability of banks and without doubt, it constitutes the bulk of our activity involving concentrated efforts, resources and time.Last month, the SRB published its 2019 Work Programme. Together with National Resolution Authorities (NRAs), it is our ambition to draft bank-specific resolution plans covering all \u00a0banking groups under the SRB\u2019s remit. For the first time, there will be a detailed assessment for all banking groups within our responsibility regarding their specific critical functions and whether resolution action would meet the objective of \u201cpublic interest\u201d.When it comes to the drafting of resolution plans, we distinguish between two types of banks depending on whether the group is active in and outside the Banking Union, i.e. does it have a Resolution College or not? Due to coordination with relevant authorities, including the ECB, this results in different timelines for the drafting of resolution plans. The planning cycles are staggered and \u2013 unfortunately - exceed the calendar year. Whereas plans for so called \u201cnon-College banks\u201d can be finalised towards the end of each year, the drafting and adoption of plans for more complex, so-called \u201cCollege banks\u201d started only in September and ends at best after twelve to fifteen months.In 2018, the focus has consequently been on non-College banks while our work for the most complex banks will go well into the second half of next year. The good news is that it allows for more detailed work concerning complex banks, for example in the area of enhancing MREL setting.Resolution planning is a process, not a product. It will therefore require time. In line with the SRB\u2019s iterative and multi-year approach, the quality of resolution plans will be improved progressively until 2020, but to be clear: The implementation of MREL and the removal of impediments will be an ongoing and ambitious task for banks and our message to banks remains unchanged: the sooner you start, the better.A crucial input for this work is the development of internal policies that guide our resolution units within the Single Resolution Mechanism in the planning for resolution. We envisage finalising the bulk of our policy work next year. In the interest of transparency, the SRB expects to publish a version of the Resolution Planning Manual in early 2019. The manual aggregates the relevant SRB policies and it will clearly spell out our expectations towards banks. Nothing of this will come as a surprise for banks as we are in ongoing dialogue with them.Joint efforts to address impediments to resolvabilityAnother priority next year will be the operationalisation of resolution strategies and in particular our work concerning the identification and removal of impediments to resolvability. We began working on impediments to resolvability in detail this year. We will continue this work moving forward as the implementation of corrective measures takes time. In this context, I would like to stress the role of banks. Building resolvability is a joint effort or to be clear: the SRB expects all banks to demonstrate that they are resolvable. Banks are best placed to provide information on their own structure and functioning. It is the responsibility of banks to make themselves resolvable; it is the SRB\u2019s job to set the direction and to ensure it actually happens.It is only when this \u201cjoint approach\u201d does not work, that the SRB would use its authority to set in motion formal procedures to remove impediments. So far our experience has been positive, but to be fair, it is early days and the heavy lifting is only just beginning.Sizable progress defining MREL targets2019 will also see sizable progress regarding the definition of Minimum Requirement for Own Funds & Eligible Liabilities or MREL. MREL is a key achievement of the Banking Union as it aligns risk-taking and reward-taking and it is a key tool to achieve resolvability. The enhanced and more ambitious definition of MREL targets will consequently represent a high priority next year. In the 2018/19 cycle, the SRB expects to adopt more than 100 group-level MREL decisions, and to determine MREL targets for over 500 individual entities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0In this context and in the interest of transparency, we have published in November our 2018 MREL policy for the first wave of resolution plans; this applies mainly to banks that last year did not have binding MREL targets. A strengthened policy covering the second wave - i.e. banks with Resolution Colleges that already had binding targets at group level in 2017/18 - will follow in the coming days.SRB banks are making progress in issuing new MREL eligible liabilities. In 2018, the seven largest Banking Union banks \u2013 which qualify as G-SIIs \u2013 issued EUR 53bn of TLAC like instruments, coming closer to full compliance with their international commitments.With regard to MREL, the SRB back-tested its MREL policy like in previous years. In this context, a global shortfall of around \u20ac170bn for SRB banks has been estimated. These figures were assessed under a strengthened policy with conservative assumptions and a wider scope compared to 2017. The increased requirements were largely compensated by new issuances. Overall, this is reassuring. The shortfall remains concentrated within five Member States counting for almost 80 percent of the shortfall.MREL-gaps will need to be closed going forward to ensure resolvability. To this end, the SRB will actively engage with relevant banks. It is the banks\u2019 responsibility to build up sufficient bail-inable instruments within the timeframe defined by the SRB and NRAs. There is no alternative if we want to create resolvable banks.Leaps forward for resolution planning of LSIsNext, allow me a short outlook on resolution planning of Less Significant Institutions or LSIs. Here primary responsibility rests with NRAs, whereas the SRB maintains an oversight role.Here too we are starting to see progress. While clearly work focused on Significant Institutions in the beginning, NRAs are now also preparing for LSIs, where in the vast majority insolvency would be the primary route to take, if a bank fails.Fully operationalising the SRFLet me now turn to the Single Resolution Fund (or SRF). The SRF is a last resort measure and an important line-of-defence when it comes to protecting EU taxpayers from the costs of bank failure. The SRF stands at EUR 25 billion now and is expected to reach a financial capacity of just under EUR 33 billion next year. The fund will be gradually built up until 2023 to reach the target level of at least 1% of the amounts of covered deposits within the Banking Union or approximately EUR 60 billion.Completing the Banking Union & the banking packageBefore ending, let me briefly mention some policy dossiers, which are important since they will directly affect our work in the medium-term. We have made extraordinary progress to date establishing the Banking Union with the Single Supervisory Mechanism & Single Resolution Mechanism in place and the EU crisis management regime applied successfully into practice already.We need to maintain this momentum. The SRB and National Resolution Authorities will need to continue their work to achieve resolvability. On the regulatory agenda, we must build on our achievements to complete the Banking Union.There are still missing elements necessary to underpin the credibility of the resolution regime: While the backstop to the SRF is now agreed in principle, a framework for liquidity in resolution still needs to be developed. And of course the third pillar of the Banking Union, the European Deposit Insurance Scheme is missing. Another area of policy work, which will likely take a longer perspective, relates to the improvement and harmonisation of insolvency laws in the EU. Just to reiterate: we need a harmonised as well as efficient and effective insolvency regime for financial institutions in the Banking Union.Finally, a few words on the banking package. First of all, I would like to start by congratulating this Committee for achieving a political agreement on the package.A stable regulatory framework is key for the authorities as well as for the banks that need to apply the rules. Let me add that we consider the efforts to polish the legal texts also very important, to improve legal clarity and avoid ambiguities: this will ease the application, and increase predictability for investors and the public.Regarding the content, it seems regrettable that the package does not reflect all of the progress made in the Banking Union. The so-called \u201cfishing option\u201d and the provisions on internal MREL risk to lead, respectively, to fragmentation of powers within the Banking Union, and the potential ring-fencing of loss absorption capacity within banking groups. It will be important to monitor the impact of these provisions and consider, in the future, whether they warrant revisions. We are fully aware of the necessary balance between home and host countries; it should however be for the SRB to address these.\u00a0\u00a0On a more positive note, we believe the overall package will indeed contribute to reducing risk in the banking sector, particularly insofar as it introduces a solid minimum amount of subordinated debt for the most systemic banks. This should be appreciated when discussing the need to progress in parallel on risk reduction and risk sharing.Concluding remarksFinally Honourable Members, I want to thank the European Parliament for their continued support and cooperation. I will end my opening remarks at this point and look forward to answering any questions you may have.\u00a0", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/695"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0080", "date": "2018-11-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EU Financial Markets: East Meets West by Elke K\u00f6nig", "text": "CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY[Introduction]Good morning ladies and gentlemen,It is a pleasure to be here with you today in the capital of Poland, one of the largest member states of the European Union.The title of today\u2019s event reads \u201cEast meets West\u201d and I am glad to be invited. Financial markets are deeply inter-connected in Europe. The Single Market and its extension of 2004 and 2007 certainly contributed to this step of integration.While there are upsides and downsides of cross-border banking, we should always keep in mind that cross-border issues require cross-border solutions. The European crisis management framework is a perfect example of how the downsides of banking are mutually managed in the EU.The SRB is directly responsible for resolution planning for over 20 banking groups with a footprint in Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries, including a large number of G-SIBs. Although you do not see me too often here in person, rest assured that close cooperation is taking place concerning these banking groups among all EU authorities.I\u2019d like to start my keynote today by taking stock of where we are on the road to ending too-big-to-fail and how far we still have to go in order to make our banks resolvable. It is a fitting time to take a look back, given that this autumn we are marking ten years since the financial crisis struck and large-scale taxpayer bail-outs of banks were triggered.Finally, I would also like to touch upon the topic of home-host cooperation of EU authorities. \u00a0[Achievements to date] The Banking Union is currently made up of 19 Member States - although any country in the EU can join it. In the Banking Union, supervision is centralised within the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) \u2013 and resolution in the Single Resolution Mechanism. These two pillars are a key part of the European response to the crash of 2008. The third pillar, the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS), is still in the making.[Ten Years Ago]Ladies and gentlemen, the past ten years have seen a paradigm shift which has led us from the concept of bail-out due to lack of alternatives, to bail-in. Risk-taking and Reward-taking have been aligned more closely \u2013 just like in any other industry.Indeed, ten years ago the very concept of banking resolution did not really exist. A resolution was something people made on New Year\u2019s Eve, and it had normally faded into a distant memory a month later! Banking resolution is different, it will be here next month, next year and in ten years-time.[Priorities / Challenges to overcome]My colleagues and I do not just sit and wait for a bank to fail or come close to failing!Our job is to ensure that all banks under our remit are resolvable. This means that we can deal with a failing or likely to fail institution in an orderly and structured manner, while trying to limit any spill over effect of a banks\u2019 failure. Banking Union authorities are working with the industry to achieve resolvability. By doing so, we also minimise the risk of their failure. \u00a0Making banks resolvable is a journey, and it will take a number of years. It is also a joint effort. We, at the SRB, cannot build resolvability by ourselves. We work closely with the national authorities within and outside the Banking Union - such as the Polish Bank Guarantee Fund - but crucially with the industry itself. The SRB can set out a clear direction to achieve resolvability but it is banks\u2019 responsibility to make themselves resolvable.So what are our goals and targets in achieving resolvability of the banks under our remit?The year 2019 will see significant progress in resolution planning, both in the scope of banks covered by resolution plans and in the content of these plans.I am pleased to say to you here this morning, that for the first time since the inception of the Board, all SRB banking groups will be covered by a resolution plan in 2019. Our tasks will increasingly focus on tailoring resolution strategies to a bank\u2019s structure and business model, and on identifying and addressing impediments to resolvability.With regard to content of resolution plans, all plans will be further substantiated reflecting the development of new or updated internal SRB policies.And of course, 2019 will see sizeable progress in the SRB\u2019s definition of binding MREL requirements, including the internal location of MREL and its quality. MREL is a rather technical term, and I know you are not all resolution experts here this morning, so just to remind you briefly what it means. MREL stands for Minimum Requirement for Own Funds & Eligible Liabilities and it is basically the EU standard for \u2018bail-in\u2019 capital. Funds that in case of failure can be quickly activated to stabilise the failing institution over a weekend.Going forward, banks will be responsible for meeting their individual targets. And resolution authorities will be responsible for the operationalisation of the Bail-in Tool in national law, in case resolution action requires a write-down and conversion of these instruments.A working priority also presents the identification and \u201cobstacles to resolution\u201d and their removal. Obstacles could include, inter alia, lack of adequate availability of data, in particular but not just detailed liability information, and inadequate IT systems, overly complex legal structures, lack of sufficient safeguards to guarantee continuity of access to financial market infrastructures, funding in resolution, etc.Though not all these obstacles are for the banks to address, banks do not have to wait for the SRB\u2019s decisions on impediments. They can and should work on making improvements immediately.Please allow me a few words about the Single Resolution Fund or SRF: The SRF is composed of contributions from credit institutions and certain investment firms in the 19 participating Member States within the Banking Union.It ensures that the financial industry, as a whole, finances the stabilisation of the financial system. It will be used only when bail-in isn\u2019t enough to stabilise an institution in resolution and generally under two key conditions, namely:First, a minimum of 8% loss absorption took place;Second, a contribution from the SRF in principle cannot exceed 5% of total liabilities and own funds.So far, we have collected through the NRAs around 25 billion euros and we expect the SRF to grow to just short of EUR 33 billion in 2019. The amounts are invested to ensure value protection and high liquidity.The SRB is keen to see progress made on common the backstop to the Single Resolution Fund. An increase of the SRB\u2019s financial capacity to handle bank failure will provide further confidence to markets in the Banking Union and across Europe.In this context it must be kept in mind that the provision of the backstop is a last resort measure for the SRB in case a resolution decision can only be implemented with the means of the SRF and the backstop.With regard to the regulatory agenda, it is important to move forward with the BRRD-II package. The finalisation will have a direct impact on day-to-day resolution planning for all resolution authorities in the EU. Legislative changes will need to be taken into account in future iterations of resolution plans.Brexit is going to be another challenge facing many sectors in the coming year, and it will no doubt make an impact on our core business. Yesterday, we published a short guidance on our website, which includes the SRB\u2019s expectation vis-\u00e0-vis all banks active in the Banking Union to meet a specific set of resolvability conditions. The guidance focuses on six main areas: MREL eligibility, internal loss absorbency, operational continuity, access to FMIs, governance and management information systems.Close cooperation with the European Central Bank, National Competent Authorities, NRAs, our international counterparts and last but not least, banks, will need to remain strong to absorb the impact of Brexit.[A word on home-host specificities]Before I end, a word on some specific files relating to the cooperation between home and host countries in Europe.Given the cross-border nature of the financial markets in the EU, the SRB maintains very close relations with authorities within and outside the Eurozone.An important forum where authorities of non-BU countries and the SRB work closely together are Resolution Colleges. These \u201cColleges\u201d concern banking groups operating across the EU. They represent a space where resolution authorities prepare and take decisions related to resolution planning.The BRRD requires group-level resolution authorities (home resolution authorities) to set up a Resolution College for each cross-border banking group. But how does a Resolution College work in practice?In practice, it is the responsibility of the Group Level Resolution Authority to set up a Resolution College and prepare the group resolution plan covering the parent entity and subsidiaries that are part of the group. This is the case for the 20 SRB groups operating in CEE countries that I briefly mentioned in my introduction.A set of written arrangements are in place between the home and host authorities on the functioning of the resolution college. These arrangements address the sharing of information, holding in-person meetings, the coordination of activities including the joint-decision timeline and procedures, as well as communication to the bank. Critically, it also includes arrangements for cooperation and coordination in emergency situations, especially of systemic nature, which may pose threats to the viability of any of the group entities.Resolution planning is an essential element of effective resolution and close cooperation between home and host inside the EU and outside the Banking Union is absolutely necessary for significant progress.In the next cycle, we are looking at taking individual MREL decisions for major entities. This is subject to the completion of important analytical work underway and agreements reached through the joint-decision process among all members of the Resolution College. It is vital that all resolution authorities do their utmost to reach agreement on the resolution plan and setting of MREL requirements. Otherwise, progress on the resolvability of banking subsidiaries and the risks to the local economy will remain as real risks.[Conclusion] Events such as today\u2019s that bring together experts from different legal jurisdiction are crucial to deliver on European objectives. That is one of the reasons I try to visit as many capitals in the European Union as I can, as regularly as I can.We have put in place the foundations in Europe, in the Banking Union, to make banks resolvable \u2013 but there are still many areas of work. We saw the effects of a lack of an effective and efficient resolution regime right across the globe ten years ago, and we realised then that financial crashes know no borders.Let me apologise for ending on such dramatic note. But quoting a fellow Board Member, working in bank resolution we are paid to be pessimistic. This said, let me stop here and wish you interesting discussions today in panels focusing on the prospects and opportunities of financial markets across the EU.\u00a0Thank you.", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/687"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0081", "date": "2018-11-07", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Single Resolution Board Enters into New Arrangements with Mexico\u2019s Institute for the Protection of Bank Savings (IPAB) & the Bank of Albania", "text": "The Single Resolution Board (SRB) has signed Cooperation Arrangements with Mexico\u2019s Institute for the Protection of Bank Savings (IPAB) and the Bank of Albania.The new arrangements further strengthen existing close cooperation in order to maintain financial stability.

Together with the NRAs of participating Member States it forms the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). The SRB works closely with the European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB), the European Banking Authority (EBA) and national competent authorities (NCAs). Its mission is to ensure an orderly resolution of failing banks with minimum impact on the real economy and public finances of the participating Member States and beyond.Media Contact details: Camille De RedeE-mail: Camille.De-Rede[at]srb.europa.euPhone number: +32 2 490 3530Switchboard: +32 2 490 3000Mobile phone: +32 477 028 530\u00a0Se\u00e1n de B\u00farcaE-mail: Sean.de-Burca[at]srb.europa.euPhone number: +32 2 490 3710Switchboard: +32 2 490 3000Mobile phone: +32 477 02 87 10\u00a0\u00a0Website: http://srb.europa.eu/Twitter: @EU_SRB", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/671"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0082", "date": "2018-11-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol (BPE) Resolution: Registered shareholders and creditors deemed eligible can submit their written comments until 26 November 2018", "text": "As previously announced, the SRB is opening the second phase of the right to be heard process.

The\u00a0ESM was agreed\u00a0as the provider of the Common Backstop by the Euro Summit in June 2018.The Common Backstop would be available only as a last resort and, in case of use, it would be repaid by the Banking Sector.It is important that the Common Backstop\u2019s design provides for rapid and effect decision-making by the ESM and aligns to the resolution objectives. Over-complexity should be avoided.IntroductionOne of the biggest changes demanded by policy makers and politicians in the wake of the financial crisis ten years ago was to address the moral hazard of \u201ctoo-big-to-fail\u201d banks and find a way to deal with failing systemic banks without widespread spill-over effects to the financial system, the economy and public finances, and without the taxpayer having to foot the bill. In Europe, there was clear agreement that the bail-outs of the last decade, with the use of public funds, had to be consigned to history. Thus, the principle of \u201cresolving\u201d systemically important banks with a \u201cbail-in\u201d instead of a \u201cbail-out\u201d was put into legislation and can now be applied in practice[1]. This term covers the way we deal with failing banks today.Creation of the Banking UnionIn the EU, new rules on the recovery and resolution of banks were agreed. For the Banking Union, the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) have been established, with the Single Resolution Board (SRB) created as the supranational resolution authority in the Banking Union. The Banking Union currently covers the 19 Eurozone countries, but it is also open to other Member States of the EU.Importantly, different resolution tools were created to address bank failures, and the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) was created to ensure the effective application of resolution actions by the SRB, where necessary and subject to strict criteria. The SRF is funded through ex-ante contributions (i.e. contributions collected annually in advance) from the banking sector, ensuring that the cost of failures will be borne by existing creditors and the banking sector. The SRF now holds 24.9bn euro and it is being built up over a period of 8 years to 1% of covered deposits (an amount close to 60bn euro based on recent projections)[2]. To further strengthen the Banking Union, Member States agreed in 2013, and further in 2016 to develop a Common Backstop (the \u201cBackstop\u201d) to the SRF which should become operational by the latest at the end of the transitional period, i.e. end 2023.Why is the Backstop so important? Market confidence in a time of crisis is key. For credibility, the existence of a Backstop to the SRF is crucial, in particular for situations where the SRF might not be able to provide sufficient funds or those financial means are not readily available. It is to be used only as a last resort and it will ensure the SRB will always have access to sufficient funds to address even a severe systemic crisis and thereby secure financial stability when this is most needed. Indeed, the Backstop\u2019s very existence would boost confidence in markets in a time of crisis, and therefore the need to actually use such a Backstop could be greatly reduced. The Backstop also ensures a level playing field with other jurisdictions that already have put in place a similar mechanism.Recently, the Euro Area Member States agreed that the Backstop would be provided by the European Stability Mechanism (\u2018ESM\u2019), for which the size would be aligned to the target level of the SRF.Fiscally-neutral for the taxpayer The Backstop will be provided by the ESM in form of a credit line and its design will ensure that last resort funding will be available for the SRF. The Backstop will not be a burden on the public purse, because in the medium term the banking sector will cover the cost of any Backstop use, via contributions collected afterwards (via ex-post contributions) ensuring fiscal neutrality.How should the Backstop function?Access to the Backstop should be aligned with the rules for the use of the SRF to take full advantage of synergies with the existing framework. The SRM Regulation already sets out a series of conditions, which materially limit the risk to which the SRF and thereby the Backstop could be exposed. A contribution from the SRF to recapitalisation may only be made under two key conditions: the bail-in of at least 8% of total liabilities including own funds (TLOF), and a contribution of a maximum of 5% of TLOF. Furthermore, the use of the SRF would be assessed by the Commission to ensure it complies with State aid rules. Additional conditions are not needed to protect taxpayers. To meet these objectives, the SRB, as an independent European Union Agency, works closely with the National Resolution Authorities (NRAs), the Commission and the SSM.Before the SRB adopts a resolution scheme involving use of the Backstop, it needs confirmation from the ESM that funds from the Backstop would be provided. The use of the SRF and thus also the Backstop by the SRB would always have to be included in the resolution scheme. Clarity around the framework is therefore necessary for the SRB to ensure that it will have an understanding of whether it will be able to access the Backstop for a given resolution case. Furthermore, particularly in a crisis situation, the possibility for conflicts between the SRB and the ESM on questions related to the resolution scheme have to be reduced to a minimum, not only in view of time constraints, but also to allow the SRB to perform its tasks as the resolution authority in the Banking Union, ensuring an orderly resolution in the interest of financial stability and managing a mutualised fund provided for by all banks of the Banking Union.State of Play Discussions are ongoing on the end state of the Backstop, but consideration has also been given to an early introduction of the Backstop before 2023. For the SRB, it is important that any early introduction avoids an over-complicated interaction with the current non-mutualised arrangements. Therefore, if Member States wish to press ahead and implement the Backstop early, then it might be considered to bring forward the full mutualisation of the SRF once the vast majority of funds are mutualised.ConclusionsImplementing the Backstop and moving towards completion of the Banking Union will further enhance the credibility of the SRB as the resolution authority in the Banking Union. The Backstop will further strengthen the SRB\u2019s resolution actions to ensure financial stability, and minimise the damage that a failing bank could cause to the financial system and the economy overall. It is important that we push ahead and make progress on the Backstop, ensuring it is well-designed, credible and ready to be called into action as a last resort should the need arise.\u00a0[1] In a bail-out the bank would receive support from external parties, whereas in a bail-in the bank\u2019s creditors would be written down and converted into capital in order to recapitalise the bank.[2] In order to provide sufficient firepower already from the start of the SRF, the participating Member States of the Banking Union have signed bilateral bridge financing agreements in form of national credit lines with the SRB, covering the respective national compartment within the SRF during the transitional period, until the SRF is fully mutualised by 1 January 2024.\u00a0", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/664"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0084", "date": "2018-10-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol (BPE) Resolution: SRB announces next steps in right to be heard process", "text": "Registered shareholders and creditors deemed eligible will be invited to submit their written comments to the SRB from 6 November 2018The Single Resolution Board (SRB) is currently finalising its preparations so that affected shareholders and creditors can exercise their right to be heard.

(BPE) to be failing or likely to fail. The ECB notified the SRB accordingly.On 7 June 2017, the SRB adopted a resolution decision for BPE, Spain\u2019s 6th largest bank. After the write-down and/or conversion of subordinated liabilities into new shares, all shares and capital of BPE were transferred to Banco Santander S.A. The SRB and the Spanish Executive Resolution Authority (FROB) decided that the sale was in the public interest as it ensured financial stability, while protecting all depositors of BPE. The resolution scheme entered into force on the same day, following the endorsement of the European Commission. The resolution scheme was implemented by FROB.The SRB published on 2 February 2018, among other documents, a non-confidential version of the Resolution Decision in respect of BPE, the Valuation 1 and 2 Reports, annexed to the Resolution Decision, and the 2016 Resolution Plan for Banco Popular Group.On 13 June 2018, the SRB announced that it had received the final \u2018Valuation 3\u2019 report. On 6 August 2018, the SRB published a non-confidential version of the Valuation 3 report together with its preliminary decision that it does not intend to compensate former shareholders and creditors of BPE based on the conclusions of the report. On the same date the SRB opened the registration for the right to be heard procedure. The registration phase remained open until 14 September 2018 at 12.00 CET.About the Single Resolution Board and the Single Resolution MechanismThe Single Resolution Board (SRB) is the resolution authority within the Banking Union and, as part of the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), is at its centre. It works closely with, in particular, the national resolution authorities (NRAs) of participating Member States, the European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB) and national competent authorities (NCAs). Its mission is to ensure an orderly resolution of failing banks with minimum impact on the real economy and public finances of the participating Member States and beyond.The SRM regulation (SRMR) establishes the framework for the resolution of banks in EU countries participating in the Banking Union.The bank recovery and resolution directive (BRRD) requires banks to prepare recovery plans to overcome financial distress. It also grants national authorities powers to ensure an orderly resolution of failing banks with minimal costs for taxpayers.\u00a0Resoluci\u00f3n de Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol (BPE): la JUR anuncia las pr\u00f3ximas etapas en el proceso del derecho de audiencia\u00a0Los accionistas y acreedores del BPE registrados a los que se considere elegibles ser\u00e1n invitados a proporcionar sus comentarios a partir del 6 de noviembre de 2018 La Junta \u00danica de Resoluci\u00f3n (JUR) est\u00e1 ultimando los preparativos para asegurar que los accionistas y acreedores afectados puedan ejercer su derecho de audiencia.

The SRB\u2019s main duty is to ensure that every bank is resolvable and thus help contribute to financial stability in Europe and across the world.Last year, the SRB presented its first ever\u00a0multi-annual programming document, which set out clear goals and targets to achieve resolvability of the banks under SRB remit by 2020. The\u00a0Work Programme for 2019\u00a0feeds into this ambitious vision, as the SRB continues its work to build resolvability in close cooperation with EU institution, with banks as well as the National Resolution Authorities.\u201cUltimately, it is the banks\u2019 own responsibility to make themselves resolvable; it is the SRB\u2019s job, through its Work Programme and continuous dialogue with the banks, to set the direction and to ensure that this actually happens,\u201d\u00a0said Dr Elke K\u00f6nig, Chair of the SRB.\u00a0In 2019, the SRB\u2019s tasks will focus on tailoring resolution strategies and identifying and addressing impediments to resolvability, MREL is a key tool in this regard. The 2019 Programme forecasts sizeable progress in the definition of binding MREL requirements, including its quality the internal location of MREL within groups. These elements will be put in place to strengthen resolution plans. The year 2019 will also see significant progress in resolution planning, both in the scope of banks covered by plans and in their content. Banking groups previously not covered will be addressed by new plans, leading to the adoption of a total of 113 resolution plans in the 2019 resolution planning cycle. All plans will be further substantiated reflecting the development of new or updated internal SRB policies.The SRB together with its partners at national and international level is committed to carrying out its mission, i.e. making banks resolvable, going forward.Read SRB's 2019 Work ProgrammeAbout the Single Resolution Board and the Single Resolution MechanismThe Single Resolution Board (SRB) is the resolution authority within the Banking Union and, as part of the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), is at its centre.

It is a period that allows all of us involved in the financial sector to pause and reflect. We reflect on the causes of the last financial crisis and we take stock of all the work that has been done in the intervening decade to prevent a future crisis; but we should also use this moment to consider what else still needs to be done in order to ensure financial stability.\u00a0The era of \u2018light-touch\u2019 Casting our minds back ten years, the United States was first hit with the subprime crisis following a decline in the real estate market, which affected the related securities, not least those held by the banks.The eventual bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008 had a ripple effect right throughout the world. In the years prior, banks and other financial institutions had seen profits rise on the back of financial innovation and \u2018light-touch\u2019 regulation. Liquidity was taken for granted and available at any time in the market. Credit had been flowing and the world economy was growing. All the signs were that things were going in the right direction. Of course, what happened next was easy to predict in hindsight. Indeed, it was Keynes who had said many years prior that \u2018the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent,\u2019 and that is exactly what came to pass.The ripple effect - from the US big banks down to the ordinary European The effects of what was happening in the US began to be felt right across the globe. Contagion was rife because banks were ill-prepared to deal with any bump in the road. Trust is central to the banking sector; but trust is hard-won but easily and quickly lost. This quick loss of trust meant an even quicker loss of funding for banks. Extraordinary events in the financial industry, meant that ordinary people, through their governments, were left to foot the bill for banks and institutions deemed \u2018too big to fail\u2019. \u00a0The effects of mismanagement in the financial industry and light touch regulation led to recession, rising unemployment and an enormous bill for the taxpayer.Between October 2008 and October 2011, the European Commission approved \u20ac4.5 trillion - equivalent to 37% of EU GDP at the time - in state-aid measures to financial institutions.The status quo was no longer an option and policymakers accepted the need to reform the financial and regulatory system to end the era of implicit taxpayer guarantees & bail outs.Response to the Crisis Ten years on, the jigsaw that is the European response, as part of a coordinated international response thanks to the 2011 recommendations of the Financial Stability Board, is still not complete. That said, we have come some a long way. The first two pillars of the Banking Union, the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the Single Resolution Mechanism are already in place and operational.Two pieces of legislation were designed by the European institutions to incorporate the international principles in European law and build a single mechanism to manage bank failure at the level of the Banking Union: the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive and the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation.Single Resolution Board As the name suggests, the Single Resolution Board is part of the Single Resolution Mechanism in the Banking Union. We were set up in 2015 in order to create a single European authority responsible for developing and implementing resolution plans for banking groups in the euro area. \u00a0The Single Resolution Board is an EU regulatory organisation funded by banks, not the public purse. Ten years ago, the term \u2018resolution\u2019 had not even been invented and this held true globally.In assessing the role of the Single Resolution Board, it is important to note that if a bank fails this must not be seen as a failure of the system. On the contrary, banks should be able to fail; the exit of failing firms in a free market system is normal. Part of the SRB\u2019s raison d'\u00eatre is to ensure that we end the concept of \u2018too big to fail\u2019. However while banks might be private businesses in the free market system, we must recognise the difference between them and other businesses in the free market economy because of their underlying role in areas such as credit flow to other businesses. Therefore we must have measures in place to ensure that the \u2018domino effect\u2019 is minimised as far as possible \u2013 every financial institution must be resolvable, and in accordance with free market principles, it should be banks\u2019 investors who bear the brunt of any failure \u2013 not the ordinary citizen. The failure of a bank will hopefully be a rare event. Preparing resolution plans is the core task for the SRB and National Resolution Authorities (NRAs). As part of this work, the SRB also sets Minimum Requirements for Eligible liabilities (MREL) for banks. This \u00a0is one of the SRB\u2019s key tools for achieving the resolvability of the banks under its remit. MREL targets set the level of eligible liabilities that a bank must maintain, to ensure that banks have sufficient loss absorbing and recapitalisation capacity to be resolved. In addition, the SRB addresses any concern regarding resolvability ranging from data availability to structural complexities. \u00a0Of course the SRB provides direction, but it is banks themselves that know best what needs to be done to make themselves resolvable, and it is them that have to provide solutions that work.\u00a0In 2017 we had our first resolution case. On 7 June that year, the SRB resolved Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol, the 6th largest bank in Spain, transferring all shares to Banco Santander. The SRB and the Spanish National Resolution Authority \u2013 FROB \u2013 decided that the sale was in the public interest as it protected all depositors of Banco Popular and ensures financial stability. The SRB, by its decision, managed to avoid adverse effects on financial stability and the real economy, without using any public funds. This showed the new regime works \u2013 but of course, there is always room for fine-tuning, and the Banking Union is still not complete.More to do For the SRB, it is important to press ahead and complete the Banking Union. The development of the European Deposit Insurance Scheme, the third and final pillar of the Banking Union remains important. For the proper functioning of a Banking Union, there should be no difference in the strength of protection available to depositors in the individual Member States, and a failure should not fall on the public coffers.Common Backstop We have also begun building up the Single Resolution Fund, which today is stands at 24.9 billion euro, and we are building this fund progressively until 2023. Implementing the Common Backstop for the Fund is also critical. \u00a0A well designed Backstop, available as a last resort, will give markets the confidence that resolution will work even for large, complex banks, and reduce stress on the financial system in the event of a bank failure.Harmonisation is essential The harmonisation of insolvency regimes remains essential. Currently, the SRM framework for resolution is faced with 19 or more different insolvency procedures. While it is challenging to reconsider long-standing national jurisprudence, only by harmonising national bank insolvency procedures can we ensure a smooth functioning of the framework.Time to build on our progress It is also important to avoid weakening the standards already agreed. Following the crisis, there was a material enhancement of regulation. When memories of the crisis fade, it is important that the regulatory system is not weakened. Instead, the authorities should take advantage of positive market conditions to push forward with finalising reforms. It is important to further strengthen the Banking Union through both risk-reduction and risk-sharing measures. This will ensure the authorities are able to manage future bank failures without use of taxpayer funds.Could we withstand a new crisis? A recurring question these days is whether we would be able to withstand a similar crisis to the one we experienced in 2008? I suppose the truth is that nobody knows. But we do know that much of the architecture of the Banking Union is in place, even if not complete. At some point, we may have another crisis, but we have put solid measures in place to deal with failing banks. The SRB together with its partners at national and international level is committed to that work going forward.Deregulation on the cards? We know that European supervision is working. It has provided better transparency and banks are far better capitalised today \u2013 in both quantity and quality.The SRB\u2019s mission is to make every bank resolvable and contribute to financial stability. Some call this past decade the lost decade, but instead let us see the past decade as one where tough lessons were learnt, and robust solutions were put in place, putting our financial system today on a much better footing than before the crisis.", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/632"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0087", "date": "2018-11-07", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "SRB Enters into New Arrangements with Central Bank of Brazil & National Bank of Serbia", "text": "The Single Resolution Board (SRB) has signed Cooperation Arrangements with the Central Bank of Brazil and the National Bank of Serbia.The new arrangements further strengthen existing close cooperation in order to maintain financial stability.

Extraordinary events in the financial industry meant that taxpayers, through their governments, were left to foot the bill for banks and institutions deemed \u2018too big to fail\u2019.\u00a0Ten years on, the forceful, swift European response saw in particular two pieces put in place: the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive and the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation.

The third pillar of the Banking Union, the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS), and harmonisation of insolvency laws are still missing.The conference features opening addresses and keynote speeches from:Valdis Dombrovskis,\u00a0Vice-President of the European Commission responsible for the Euro and Social Dialogue, also in charge of Financial Stability, Financial Services and the Capital Markets Union, speaking on the future of resolution and the Banking Union: \u201cThe Single Resolution Board is essential for turning the letter of the law of our Banking Union into improved financial stability on the ground. In a resolution, their work is supported by the bank-financed Single Resolution Fund. But to manage a crisis with minimum impact on financial stability and taxpayers, this fund needs a common backstop. The Commission strongly supports the ongoing work in the Council for a backstop that can act with swiftness and with certainty\u201d.Elke K\u00f6nig, Chair of the Single Resolution Board: \u201cA recurring question these days is whether we would be able to withstand a similar crisis to the one we experienced in 2008? I suppose the truth is that nobody knows. But we do know that much of the architecture of the Banking Union is in place, even if not complete. At some point, we may have another crisis, but we have put solid measures in place to deal with failing banks. The SRB together with its partners at national and international level is committed to that work going forward\u201d.Jelena McWilliams, Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation: \"Given the cross-border activities of our G-SIBs, resolution preparedness requires international coordination based on strong working relationships\u2026The work we do together gives us more confidence in the resolution process.\u00a0 The FDIC places enormous value on these relationships and I look forward to continuing this work in the years ahead\".Burkhard Balz, Member of the Executive Board - Deutsche Bundesbank,: \"The previous resolution cases underpin that each case is different. Thus we cannot generalize easily. Small loopholes may suffice to maintain former deficiencies. Therefore, only if all components of the new regime are working properly and are credible, we can speak of a success\".The Conference features panel discussions with industry officials, regulators and supervisors focused on the completion of the Banking Union, loss absorbing capacity, funding in resolution, and critical functions & impediments to resolution.ENDS Further Information To follow the event through the live web-stream, download the agenda, or learn more, go to the SRB Conference homepage.

Together with the national resolution authorities of participating Member States it forms the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). The SRB works closely with the European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB), the European Banking Authority (EBA) and national competent authorities (NCAs). Its mission is to ensure an orderly resolution of failing banks with minimum impact on the real economy and public finances of the participating Member States and beyond.Media Contact details:Camille De Rede E-mail: Camille.De-Rede@srb.europa.euPhone number: +32 2 490 3530Switchboard: +32 2 490 3000Mobile phone: +32 477 028 530Sean De BurcaE-mail:\u00a0 Sean.DE-BURCA@srb.europa.euPhone number: +3224903710Switchboard: +32 2 490 3000Mobile phone: +32477028710Website: https://srb.europa.eu/Twitter: @EU_SRB", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/651"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0089", "date": "2018-09-18", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "VIDEO: 10 Years After The Financial Crisis: where are we now?", "text": "Single Resolution Board Chair Elke K\u00f6nig discusses progress made 10 years after the financial crisis.\u00a0", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/631"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0090", "date": "2018-10-15", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "SRB Conference 2018 - Welcome Speech by SRB Chair, Elke K\u00f6nig", "text": "CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY [Introduction]Good morning ladies and gentlemen,I would like to welcome you to the third Single Resolution Board Conference. \u00a0Thank you for joining us here in Brussels.On behalf of the Single Resolution Board \u2013 as well as my fellow Board Members present today \u2013 I wish to welcome each and every one of you to this event. Some of you have participated in previous editions of this conference while many of you are here taking part for the very first time.\u00a0May I also welcome in particular our panellists and our speakers at today\u2019s conference. Vice-President of the European Commission, Valdis Dombrovskis will be present with us later in the day, as he is currently flying in from Indonesia to be with us and deliver a keynote speech. We will also hear from Mr Burkhard Balz, former MEP and ECON Committee Coordinator, who recently joined the executive board of the German Bundesbank. He too joins us straight from the IMF meetings. Ms Jelena McWilliams, Chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will be our first keynote speaker, in line with our tradition of having the Chair of the FDIC address the conference. Unfortunately she had a last minute conflict in her schedule, so we also stick to this conference\u2019s tradition of having one keynote address by video!\u00a0[Ten Years On] All of the newspapers have referred to the financial crisis in recent weeks and months and clearly the Banking Union, and in particular the SRB, are part of the European response to that banking crisis.Casting our minds back to 2008, our economy was in turmoil, the financial industry was in meltdown, and headlines of bank bail-outs were to be seen across the continent. There was little talk back then of \u2018bank resolution\u2019 or \u2018bail-in\u2019, yet in just 10 years, these are terms that are part and parcel of the financial and banking sectors today. These are more than just terms however; they are crucial elements in the SRB\u2019s work to preserve financial stability and ensure that taxpayers\u2019 money remains protected when handling the failure of systemically important banks.Ladies and gentlemen, those who were present here just over 12 months ago, will perhaps remember that the title of last year\u2019s conference was \u2018Building Resolvability Together\u2019. This year, we are not putting that theme to one side, since resolvability can only happen with the cooperation of all of our stakeholders \u2013 industry, the national resolution authorities and the European and international institutions \u2013 but rather we are adding to that theme, and asking the following question:Ten years after the crisis, and four years after the setting up of the SRB, are banks now resolvable? Well, it is clear that we are in a better place today than we were five years ago, but there is no clear-cut answer to that question.We have had one resolution case to date, and I will come back to that in a moment. What is clear, is that the finance world is constantly evolving \u2013 resolution planning is a long term project; it is a marathon, not a sprint. We have to pace ourselves to ensure we stay the course. When necessary, we have to take pit stops, refuel, rehydrate and make sure we are going in the right direction so that we can arrive \u00a0at the finish line \u2013 that is, to make all banks resolvable.[Focus for 2019]As we continue that marathon or journey towards making banks resolvable I want to share with you some of the priorities of our work in the coming year.In 2019, we will carry on the work to strengthen resolution plans. With the exception of one group that is currently under restructuring, I am pleased to say to you here this morning, that for the first time since the inception of the Board, all SRB banking groups will be covered by a resolution plan in 2019. Our tasks will increasingly focus on tailoring resolution strategies to a bank\u2019s structure and business model, and identifying and addressing impediments to resolvability. A key tool to achieve resolvability is, and will continue to be, MREL. 2019 will see sizeable progress in the definition of MREL requirements, including the location of MREL.This year, we will continue to determine MREL targets at the consolidated level, and we will set individual targets. We will also continue the work on identifying impediments and developing solutions together with the industry and with the NRAs.With regard to resolution planning for less significant institutions or LSIs, where the SRB has an oversight role, the SRB expects the NRAs to identify and thus foresee a notable increase of notifications from NRAs concerning the adoption of LSI resolution plans in 2019. Ensuring consistency and close cooperation with NRAs will be of essence to achieve progress in this area next year.The Single Resolution Fund or SRF will continue to grow to just short of 33 billion in 2019. The amounts will be invested to ensure value protection and high liquidity.The SRB is also confident and hopeful that progress can be made on the important third pillar of a harmonised deposit guarantee scheme (EDIS) in order to complete the Banking Union. The harmonisation of insolvency regimes remains essential. Currently, the SRM framework for resolution is faced with 19 or more different insolvency procedures in the Banking Union. While it is challenging to reconsider long-standing national jurisprudence, it is only by harmonising national bank insolvency procedures that can we ensure a smooth functioning of the framework.[2019: Brexit]And now to the \u2018B\u2019-word: Brexit. This is going to be another challenge in the coming year, and it will no doubt have an impact on our core business.Brexit will see all bond issuances under UK law move to 3rd country issuances. Only if there are adequate contractual clauses will these instruments be MREL eligible in the future.Incoming banks \u2013 that is those that set up as a legal structure in the Banking Union - need to ensure that their EU operations are sufficiently equipped to be resolvable in case of crisis. The SRB is closely following the political negotiations and no matter what the outcome is, we stand ready to work hard to ensure financial stability is maintained in the year ahead.[Banco Popular] And now ladies and gentlemen, to another \u2018B\u2019-word. Banco Popular.\u00a0The post-resolution work in the Banco Popular case is ongoing.As you may be aware, in August we launched the first phase of the \u2018right to be heard\u2019 procedure. This phase allowed those affected by the resolution wishing to submit comments on our preliminary decision, to register for an eligibility check. In total, we received about 12,000 [twelve thousand] expressions of interest in this phase.This morning, I am pleased to announce that Phase 2 \u2013 in which eligible parties can provide their comments - will open on November 6th and will run for a period of three weeks. Further information on the second phase will be available tomorrow morning on the SRB\u2019s website.[Conclusion]In these weeks, as we mark the ten year anniversary of the financial crash, a recurring question is \u2018whether we would be able to withstand a similar crisis to the one we experienced in 2008?\u2019I suppose the truth is that nobody knows. However we do know that much of the architecture of the Banking Union is in place, even if it is not yet complete. At some point, we may have another crisis, but we have put solid measures in place to deal with failing banks. The SRB together with its partners at national and international level is committed to that work going forward.And speaking of going forward, we now have to move on with today\u2019s agenda. I have the pleasure to introduce you to our host, Mrs Melinda Crane who once again will act as our moderator for the day.Not only is she an experienced moderator, well capable of inciting dynamic debate, but Mrs Crane is also, during her day-to-day work, the Chief Political Correspondent at Deutsche Welle television. Her academic qualifications are in law and political economy. She has given numerous speeches, moderated events and discussions for a wide range of international organisations and firms, and she is of course familiar to many of you from previous years\u2019 conferences.I am sure that Mrs Crane will not only be able to spark interest in our conversations today - but she will also use her journalistic skills to ensure that we provide all of you present here today with a rich insight into the state of play in making all banks resolvable.Mrs Crane, the floor is yours.\u00a0", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/652"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0091", "date": "2018-09-05", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Eurofi Article by Elke K\u00f6nig - Gaps in the Banking Union regarding funding in resolution and how to close them", "text": "A key task of resolution authorities (RA) is to ensure financial stability and continuity of critical services of a failed bank so that it can meet all obligations due after resolution. To achieve this RA have been given a number of tools. However, while the bail-in of creditors and restructuring measures will restore and improve a bank\u2019s solvency and viability, it is reasonable to expect that a resolved bank will experience liquidity stress after the resolution weekend.By definition a recapitalised bank that has absorbed losses will be solvent and have better access to funding. However, given that analysts and creditors will likely require time to re-assess the financial position, the return to market funding will be a process rather than a one-off fix. Addressing the risk of banks having insufficient liquidity following resolution action therefore presents a crucial task in resolution planning.It is important that RA follow fundamental principles, but at the same time adopt a flexible approach to ensure an orderly transition to private funding. According to FSB guidance, the way is clear: first, the bank\u2019s own resources are expected to contribute. From a market discipline perspective it is important to rely on the bank\u2019s assets and secured financing. However, the availability of collateral is not static. In fact, we expect limited and decreasing collateral approaching the point of non-viability. This situation is exacerbated if a failure is caused by a deteriorating liquidity position and recovery options are exhausted. Close monitoring of asset encumbrance and a timely FOLTF are a must, but will not solve all problems.While private measures are expected to narrow gaps, the impact must be seen against the backdrop of potential sizes of liquidity needs. Looking at historic cases, support to individual banks in stress easily count triple billion figures. Precisely for this reason, FSB guidance recommends establishing temporary public backstop funding mechanisms. Such a tool currently does not exist in the Banking Union (BU), which is a missing piece in the overall framework. While the SRF can play a role in providing liquidity, the role can only be limited, given the SRF\u2019s size, even if secured by a common backstop. We should however be mindful that the SRF was primarily designed for capital restauration.Other solutions therefore need to be explored, particularly with central banks. When designing a credible tool some fundamentals must be fulfilled: first, all pre-conditions must be clear and RA should have certainty they can rely on the tool for finalizing all features of the resolution scheme, including funding, i.e. liquidity on day 1. Second, the scale must be sizable and flexible enough to support the effective implementation of any resolution strategy. It goes without saying, that only viable and solvent institutions in resolution should be supported with funding. Finally, the creation of a new sovereign-bank nexus should be avoided. Provided these objectives are met, the tool would address open issues in the current system and put the BU framework at equal footing with other jurisdictions such as the US or UK. A credible temporary public solution will provide markets with the needed confidence and allow fast return to private funding.Vienna 2018 | Views: The Eurofi Magazine", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/621"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0092", "date": "2018-09-05", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Eurofi Article by Elke K\u00f6nig - Why we need an EU liquidation regime for banks", "text": "The resolution of banks is a specific insolvency procedure, introduced as an alternative to liquidation under national laws. Under the EU regulatory framework, resolution only applies where resolving a failing bank is in the public interest \u2013 be it out of financial stability concerns or because of the critical functions performed by the bank. Resolution is for the few, not the many: insolvency remains the primary route for failing banks, even for those that are under SSM and SRB remit. However, while the legal framework for resolution has been harmonised and developed to be suitable for the specific challenges of banking failures at EU level, insolvency regimes remain national.The lack of an EU liquidation regime is a major obstacle towards a fully-fledged Banking Union. The SRB\u2019s assessment of the no-creditor-worse-off principle seeks to ensure that the treatment of creditors in resolution is not worse than the one they would have received under normal insolvency proceedings. Currently, with nineteen different insolvency frameworks in the Banking Union, the analysis of the insolvency counterfactual for a cross-border bank in resolution is a challenge, and results in diverging outcomes depending on the home country of the institution. Moreover, the \u2018failing or likely to fail\u2019 assessment is not always aligned to the criteria for liquidation at national level and may similarly lead to different conclusions.Bank insolvency procedures should be subject to common standards and practices at EU level. The ideal solution would be EU-wide rules on insolvency proceedings for the banking sector. This harmonisation would have a number of advantages: it would facilitate resolution planning for cross-border banking groups; level the playing field and eliminate wrong incentives; and provide the industry and investors with the same level of certainty in liquidation as in resolution. An efficient and effective insolvency framework also contributes to addressing legacy assets and avoiding the build-up of new non-performing loans. Furthermore, a harmonised system would also benefit the Capital Markets Union, by providing investors with greater clarity.These ideas are not new. Already in 2010, the European Commission\u2019s Communication on an EU Framework for Crisis Management called in the medium term for \u201cfurther harmonisation of bank insolvency regimes, with the aim of resolving and liquidating banks under the same procedural and substantive insolvency rules.\u201dThe SRB is currently working within the Single Resolution Mechanism on National Handbooks to define how to implement resolution schemes in each country, as well as national implementation steps for a decision not to adopt resolution. This is a step in the right direction, but is only a \u2018second best\u2019 option and not comparable to a harmonisation of bank insolvency procedures \u2013 something only legislators can deliver.Proposals for harmonisation across the board will inevitably be fraught with political perils and resistance. An incremental approach \u2013 such as the one exemplified by the recent harmonisation of the ranking of unsecured debt instruments in insolvency \u2013 may be a more palatable solution. The ultimate goal, however, must be to have in place an EU liquidation regime alongside an EU resolution regime.Vienna 2018 | Views: The Eurofi Magazine", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/622"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0093", "date": "2018-07-24", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Banking Union \u2013 Single Resolution Board collects \u20ac7.5 billion in annual ex-ante contributions to the Single Resolution Fund, now reaching \u20ac24.9 billion in total", "text": "As of 30 June 2018, the Single Resolution Board (SRB) had collected \u20ac7.5 billion from 3,315 institutions in annual ex-ante contributions to the Single Resolution Fund (SRF). In total, the SRF now holds an amount of \u20ac24.9 billion.\u00a0The target size of the SRF is intended to be at least 1% of covered deposits by end 2023. The SRF pools contributions raised on an annual basis at national level from credit institutions and certain investment firms within the 19 participating Member States. These contributions are calculated based on the methodology set out in the regulations and are collected via the National Resolution Authorities (NRAs). The SRF is being built-up over a period of eight years (2016-2023).\u201cThe SRF is gradually being built up and will ensure that the SRB can apply its resolution tools effectively and efficiently; as covered deposits are rising, so are the contributions to the SRF for 2018\u201d. \u00a0- Elke K\u00f6nig, Chair of the Single Resolution Board 2018 ex-ante contributions Factsheet and Q&A in all EU languages\u00a0Background: The Single Resolution Fund: was established by the SRM Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 and is owned by the Single Resolution Board (SRB).ensures uniform practice in the financing of resolutions within the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM);pools contributions raised at national level from institutions within the SRB\u2019s remit in each of the 19 Member States within the Banking Union;is built up over eight years (2016-2023) to reach the target level of at least 1% of covered deposits of all credit institutions authorised in the participating Member States;\u00a0Use of the SRF: Within a resolution scheme, the SRF may be used only to the extent necessary to ensure the effective application of the resolution tools, as a last resort, inter alia:to guarantee the assets or liabilities of the institution under resolution;to make loans to, or to purchase assets of, the institution under resolution;to purchase assets of the institution under resolution;to make contributions to a bridge institution and an asset management vehicle;to pay compensation to shareholders or creditors who incurred greater losses than under normal insolvency proceedings and;to make a contribution to the institution under resolution in lieu of the write-down or conversion of liabilities of certain creditors under specific conditions.\u00a0The SRF shall not be used directly to absorb losses or to recapitalise an institution. In exceptional circumstances, where an eligible liability or class of liabilities is excluded or partially excluded from bail-in, a contribution from the SRF may be made to the institution under resolution under two key conditions, namely:Bail-in of at least 8%: a contribution to loss absorption and recapitalisation totalling not less than 8% of the total liabilities including own funds of the institution under resolution has already been made by shareholders, the holders of relevant capital instruments and other eligible liabilities through write-down, conversion or otherwiseContribution from the SRF of maximum 5%: the SRF contribution does not exceed 5% of the total liabilities including own funds of the institution under resolution.\u00a0About the Single Resolution Board The Single Resolution Board (SRB) is the central resolution authority within the Banking Union (BU). Together with the NRAs of participating Member States it forms the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). The SRB works closely with the European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB), the European Banking Authority (EBA) and national competent authorities (NCAs).

The SRB now opens the registration for the previously announced \u2018Right to be heard\u2019 procedure. The registration phase for the procedure will remain open until 14 September 2018 (12:00 noon, Brussels time).\u00a0In the Single Resolution Board\u2019s (SRB\u2019s) preparatory act, i.e. \u2018SRB Notice\u2019, published today, the SRB preliminarily decides, based on the findings of the \u2018Valuation 3\u2019 report, that it does not intend to pay compensation to former shareholders and creditors of BPE whose interests were affected as a result of the resolution decision. Before the SRB takes a final decision on whether compensation needs to be granted, the SRB is now launching a \u2018Right to be heard\u2019 procedure.According to the resolution framework, the \u2018Valuation 3\u2019 determines whether affected shareholders and creditors would have received better treatment if the bank had been wound up under normal insolvency proceedings. This report has to be prepared by an independent expert. In the case of BPE, the \u2018Valuation 3\u2019 report was carried out by Deloitte.The \u2018Valuation 3\u2019 report comes to the conclusion that under normal insolvency proceedings the overall losses would have been substantially higher than the losses that were realised in resolution. The shareholders and creditors whose instruments were written down or converted and transferred in resolution would not have received a better treatment if BPE had been wound up under normal insolvency proceedings. Thus, based on the report, the SRB preliminarily decides that it is not required to pay compensation to affected shareholders and creditors.The SRB today opens the first phase of the right to be heard procedure, i.e. the registration phase. Affected shareholders and creditors who wish to exercise their right to be heard with the submission of written comments in the second phase should now register to prove their eligibility, i.e. to prove that they have been affected by the resolution because the instruments they held were written down or converted and transferred. Eligibility will have to be proven by submitting a valid proof of identity and an accepted proof of ownership of the written down or converted and transferred instruments. The registration phase will remain open until 14 September 2018 at 12:00 noon (Brussels time).The second phase will be open to those whose eligibility has been verified by the SRB in phase one, once the SRB has assessed all registrations. During the second phase, affected shareholders and creditors will have the right to express in writing their views in relation to the SRB\u2019s preliminary decision that compensation would not need to be granted and the underlying reasoning, through a dedicated electronic platform. Further details will be released ahead of the opening of phase two of the procedure.All comments provided in the second phase will be duly assessed and taken into account when preparing the SRB\u2019s final decision on whether compensation needs to be granted.The SRB Notice and the non-confidential version of the \u2018Valuation 3\u2019 report can be found here\u00a0Affected shareholders and creditors are now able to register at the following dedicated website where more information on the registration procedure\u00a0Explanatory note on the Valuation 3 Report\u00a0\u00a0BackgroundOn 6 June 2017, the European Central Bank (ECB) determined Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol S.A. (BPE) to be failing or likely to fail. The ECB notified the SRB accordingly. On 7 June 2017, the SRB adopted a resolution decision for BPE, Spain\u2019s 6th largest bank. After the write-down and/or conversion of subordinated liabilities into new shares, all shares of BPE were transferred to Banco Santander S.A. The SRB and the Spanish National Resolution Authority (FROB) decided that the sale was in the public interest as it ensured financial stability, while protecting all depositors of BPE. The resolution scheme entered into force on the same day, following the endorsement of the European Commission. The resolution scheme was implemented by FROB.\u00a0The SRB published on 2 February 2018, among other documents, a non-confidential version of the Resolution Decision in respect of BPE, the Valuation 1 and 2 Reports, annexed to the Resolution Decision, and the 2016 Resolution Plan for Banco Popular Group. On 13 June 2018, the SRB announced that it had received the final \u2018Valuation 3\u2019 report. \u00a0About the Single Resolution Board and the Single Resolution Mechanism\u00a0The Single Resolution Board (SRB) is the resolution authority within the Banking Union and, as part of the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), is at its centre. It works closely with, in particular, the national resolution authorities (NRAs) of participating Member States, the European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB) and national competent authorities (NCAs). Its mission is to ensure an orderly resolution of failing banks with minimum impact on the real economy and public finances of the participating Member States and beyond.\u00a0The SRM regulation (SRMR) establishes the framework for the resolution of banks in EU countries participating in the Banking Union.

Just after the agreement on the risk reduction package in the ECON committee and before the European Parliament will go into its summer recess, it is that time of the year when I am invited to this committee to present to you the SRB\u2019s Annual Activity Report for 2017. The Annual Report is the main document of accountability towards the public and the European Parliament. It is thus a good opportunity to look back at an overall successful year 2017, but also to look at the challenges ahead of us, in order to continue to safeguard financial stability and protect the taxpayers in the Banking Union.In my introductory remarks today, I would like to touch upon our main achievements in 2017, before looking to times more present - what we have achieved and still strive to achieve - in the current year. Then, I would like to make some comments on the ongoing discussions on the risk reduction package, to which so many of you actively contributed, and finally conclude by highlighting some other policy topics.Annual Report:But let me first highlight some of our achievements in 2017 as outlined in the Annual Report:Our first resolution case, the resolution of Banco Popular in Spain on 6 June 2017, can be seen as a key event. It proved that the SRB is able to effectively apply the existing rules and carry out its mandate to ensure an orderly resolution with minimum impact on the real economy, the financial system and the public finances of the respective Member State and beyond.At the same time, we made further progress in our resolution planning activities for the banking groups under our remit in close cooperation with the National Resolution Authorities, thus advancing in our mandate: ensuring that banks become truly resolvable. At the end of 2017 we published our MREL policy, which gave clear indications to the relevant stakeholders on what to expect over the coming years. Moreover, we developed additional policies and internal guidelines to ensure consistency in resolution planning.For the first time we set binding MREL targets at consolidated level for the most important banking groups, while informative targets have been communicated to the remaining banks.Besides, we continued to further build-up and operationalise the Single Resolution Fund. By \u00a030 June \u00a0NRAs had transferred ex-ante-contributions of EUR 7.5 bn to the SRF, which by now comprises around EUR 25 bn in total. It should be noted that this year the contributions increased, because the amount of covered deposits grew by 3%. If this trend continues, we can thus expect that by 2024 the target level of the SRF will lie well above the initially estimated EUR 55 bn.Also regarding our staffing we have transitioned from a start-up to a well-established agency. Intensified recruiting efforts in 2017 ensured that by the end of this year our envisaged target level for staffing can be reached.Deliverables in 2018:Of course our work did not stop in 2017 - Where do we stand now? Let me first make a remark on the case of Banco Popular:As we announced on 13 June 2018, the SRB has received the final \u2018Valuation 3\u2019 report, which determines whether shareholders and creditors would have received a better treatment if the institution had been wound up under normal insolvency proceedings. We have been since preparing for the next steps, notably to provide affected shareholders and creditors with the right to be heard, alongside the publication of the SRB\u2019s draft decision and the non-confidential version of the \u2018Valuation 3\u2019 report.I can tell you today that the SRB will launch a registration process for the \u2018right to be heard\u2019 in early August. This will allow former shareholders and creditors of BPE, whose instruments were affected by the resolution action, to express their interest in exercising their right to be heard and submit supporting documentation proving their eligibility. The registration period will run until mid-September. The preparatory act and non-confidential valuation 3 report will be ready then. In a second phase, persons whose eligibility has been verified by the SRB will be able to submit their comments. This second phase will open after the registration phase has been finalised.Always bearing in mind that resolution planning is a multi-year process, for 2018 we have worked and will work towards the completion of resolution plans for all banks under our remit until 2020, as stated in our Multiannual Work Programme.Moreover, we are constantly developing and updating our internal policies and guidelines, which in turn will feed into the next resolution planning cycle.For example, in June the SRB published its approach to critical functions. This approach has been developed since early 2016 and benefitted from lessons learned from the first resolution planning cycles. It is an essential component for determining whether a failing bank has to be put into resolution as well as for the selection of the preferred resolution strategy. This approach provides transparency to the banks and also enhances the consistency in the identification of critical functions by the banks and has been published on our website.Moreover, the SRB is making progress in developing policies on\u00a0resolution planning: in recent months we have finalised internal guidance on the bridge bank tool, the bail-in tool and the asset separation tool and are currently finalising guidance on the sale-of-business tool. All this will feed into an updated public manual in autumn, too.Similarly, we are making further progress on the \u201ccore pieces\u201d of resolution planning: MREL and the resolvability assessment. Thus, we are currently updating and expanding last year\u2019s MREL policy and phasing in our resolvability assessment policy. The finalisation of both of these policies is envisaged in autumn.Besides, our current work on policy topics also covers numerous other domains, such as valuation, liquidity and funding, operational continuity and separability.Despite the resolution plans still evolving, no bank with a responsible management has to wait for us to send them concrete instructions. We have communicated very clearly our expectations and our work programme for 2018 to the banks\u2019 managements and we will continue to do so and of course follow-up. In this way the banks are aware of the direction we are heading to and they should start their work on MREL and ensuring their resolvability as soon as possible, now that the economic situation is good.Risk-reduction packageRegarding the risk reduction package, and in particular the review of the BRRD and SRMR, we have entered a decisive phase, now that both the EP and the Council have adopted their respective positions. At this point, I would like to thank those MEPs who worked hard on this important file and contributed to the consensus-building. I am hopeful that a good agreement in trilogue can be found before the end of the current legislative term. The earlier we reach an agreement here, the sooner there will be clarity for our resolution planning activities and for all market participants alike.Let me at this point also comment on certain provisions of the Parliament\u2019s position:We appreciate the Parliament\u2019s efforts towards simplicity on the provisions around the calibration of MREL. Avoiding complexity is key to give the necessary transparency and predictability for credit institutions and investors.Secondly, we believe that the amount of MREL ought to be tailored to the resolution strategy of each credit institution. Equally, the extent to which MREL should be subordinated mustbe set to improve resolvability and limit the risk of breaching the No Creditor Worse Off safeguard,increase the degree of certainty for taking resolution actions, andensure a clear priority and transparency to investors.In this regard, the Council text is in our view to be preferred, as it allows for a solid layer of subordinated MREL.Resolution Authorities need discretion on the quantity (=amount) and quality (=subordination) of MREL of each institution. This discretion is what we understand by proportionality \u2013 a principle that is widely supported in the European Parliament.Similarly, Resolution Authorities should be able to assess the need, the amount, as well as the possible type of internal MREL instruments, entity by entity within each banking group. The need for internal MREL within banking groups is undisputed but it should also be closely monitored that the resolution strategy is not contradicted by potential national measures creating additional barriers. \u00a0Finally, we welcome the new moratorium tool which can be applied after an institution is deemed failing or likely to fail. However, we do not support the possibility to use the current stay power only 10 business days after using the new moratorium tool, as the Parliament\u2019s text suggests. This seems unnecessary, if not counter-productive: If market participants have the expectation that an additional stay (under current powers) could be applied 10 days after the application of the moratorium tool, this might undermine market confidence in the resolved entity.Other policy topics:There are also other ongoing policy files, where in our view progress is urgently required: Let me start by briefly mentioning EDIS. Unfortunately, there has been hardly any progress in the last year. However, we strongly believe that EDIS as the third pillar of the Banking Union must become a reality as soon as possible, and we count on you and the Austrian Council Presidency to advance also on this file.The recent European Council has revealed once again that there seems to be a political consensus on the need for a Common Backstop to the SRF. The Member States should thus make quick progress to agree on the practical and organisational provisions in more detail. It is important that in case of need the additional support offered by the backstop can be provided without delay. The fact that the Backstop is fiscally neutral and only used as a last resort ensures that the taxpayers will remain protected, even if the loans provided by the backstop are being used.We must however remain mindful that the provision of funding in resolution remains an unsolved issue. It is likely that the SRF, even if secured by a backstop, might not be sizable enough to provide funding when a major and complex institution is resolved. We must therefore continue to explore alternative options, particularly in cooperation with the national central banks and the ECB.Our experience in recent cases highlighted the prevailing need for an eventual harmonisation of national insolvency laws. The failing or likely to fail (FOLTF) assessment does not automatically link to the criteria for insolvency/liquidation. Similarly, the assessment regarding the \u201cno-creditor-worse-off\u201d principle uses insolvency as the counterfactual scenario. Only by establishing harmonised standards in this regard we can ensure identical outcomes in all Member States of the Banking Union for these evaluations.Within the SRM, we continue to work on National Handbooks. This exercise aims to define how resolution schemes are implemented in each country, but also to understand what are the procedural steps in each Member State in case there is a decision not to send a bank into resolution. National handbooks are certainly a step in the right direction, but they cannot remove the need for harmonised insolvency laws. In this regard, we can only re-iterate our concerns and encourage the legislators to undertake next steps.While Europe is facing a number of challenges simultaneously, there are currently many plans and initiatives looking to strengthen the Euro area, while taking advantage of the overall good economic development. The European Parliament, the Commission and the Council are playing a key role; the SRB stands ready to carry out the tasks and mandate that legislators entrust it with. We are both united by the same objective: To maintain financial stability and protect taxpayers in case of a bank failure. I am looking forward to continuing our work together with you.I will end my opening remarks at this point and I am looking forward to answer your questions, not only on our Annual Report but also on many other aspects of our work in the Q&A session.Thank you very much for your attention!", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/600"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0099", "date": "2019-11-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "SRB Publishes 2017 Annual Report", "text": "The Chair of the Single Resolution Board (SRB), Elke K\u00f6nig today presents the SRB\u2019s 2017 Annual Report at the European Parliament\u2019s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in Brussels.\u00a0 The report takes stock of the work and the progress made in 2017. The first resolution decision, the resolution of Banco Popular in Spain on 6 June 2017, was a key event in 2017. It proved that the SRB, together with the National Resolution Authorities (NRAs), is able to effectively apply the existing rules and carry out its mandate to ensure an orderly resolution with minimum impact on the real economy, while maintaining financial stability and protecting the tax payer. The main focus of the SRB\u2019s work is and remains forward-looking. Thus, in the past year the SRB enhanced resolution plans, developed resolution strategies and policies and set for the first time binding MREL targets for the most important banks. In the coming years, the SRB will build on this work and continue to pursue the clear roadmap on resolution planning set by the Multi-annual Work Programme.Speaking ahead of the publication of the SRB\u2019s Annual Report for 2017, SRB Chair Elke K\u00f6nig said \u2018A key component for successful resolution planning is the close cooperation with the NRAs and the interaction and clear communication with the industry. In this way, the banks\u2019 management teams know the SRB\u2019s expectations well in advance. Responsible bank managers can and they should move forward, in order to become truly resolvable and build up the needed MREL buffers.\u2019Elke K\u00f6nig, Chair of the Single Resolution Board, presents the Annual Report to the European Parliament\u2019s ECON Committee at a public hearing this afternoon, July 11th, 2018 at 14:30.Read the SRB 2017 Annual Report (Below)Watch Elke K\u00f6nig\u2019s speech live from 14.30 HERE\u00a0NOTE TO EDITOR:About the Single Resolution Board The Single Resolution Board (SRB) is the central resolution authority within the Banking Union (BU).

Resolution is the restructuring of a bank by a resolution authority, using resolution tools to safeguard public interests. This includes the continuity of the bank\u2019s critical functions, financial stability and ensuring the taxpayer is better protected from having to pay for failing banks, as happened during the financial crisis.

The SRB is currently analysing these decisions and assessing the steps that need to be taken to implement them. On 19 June 2018, the SRB Appeal Panel released its decisions in the cases 44/17-54/17, 56/17, 1/18 and 7/18. These cases related to the review of the amended decisions of the SRB on access to a wide range of SRB documents with respect to the Banco Popular case, taking into account also the Appeal Panel\u2019s decisions of 28 November 2017 and the disclosure of additional elements by the SRB in February 2018.The documents assessed by the SRB Appeal Panel include documents previously assessed in its decisions of 28 November 2017, such as the SRB Decision concerning the adoption of a resolution scheme in respect of Banco Popular, the related Valuation Reports and the 2016 Resolution Plan. The SRB Appeal Panel also assessed other documents, including the offer submitted by Banco Santander, the sale purchase agreement, the 2017 Liability Data report and the 2017 Critical Functions Report.The SRB Appeal Panel, after balancing the interests involved, has upheld the stance of the SRB with respect to most of the requested documents, confirming that the SRB assessment was \u201cdone in compliance with the applicable procedural rules, that the duty to state reasons has been complied with and there has not been a manifest error of assessment or misuse of power\u201d. However, for certain documents, such as the Valuation Reports, the 2016 Resolution Plan and the 2017 Critical Functions Report, the SRB Appeal Panel has remitted the decisions to the Board to ensure compliance with the findings provided in its decisions regarding the respective documents.\u00a0Background:More about the Appeal PanelThe SRB Appeal Panel decisions of 28 November 2017Banco Popular Resolution\u00a0Media Contact details: E-mail: Camille.De-Rede@srb.europa.euPhone number: +32 2 490 3530Switchboard: +32 2 490 3000Mobile phone: +32 460 766 704\u00a0E-mail: \u00a0Sean.DE-BURCA@srb.europa.euPhone number: +3224903710Switchboard: +32 2 490 3000Mobile phone: +32477028710\u00a0Website: http://srb.europa.eu/Twitter: @EU_SRB", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/574"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0101", "date": "2018-06-01", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "SRB Conference 2018 - Registrations now open!", "text": "See full programme, speakers on the Conference websiteRegister for the event\u00a0", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/561"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0102", "date": "2018-06-21", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "SRB\u2019s Appeal Panel rendered decisions in cases 44 to 54/17, 56/17 and 1 and 7/18", "text": "On 19 June 2019, the SRB\u2019s Appeal Panel rendered decisions in cases 44 to 54/17, 56/17 and 1 and 7/18.

In this regard, a so-called \u2018Valuation 3\u2019 needs to be performed by an independent person as soon as possible after the resolution actions have been effected. This valuation determines whether shareholders and creditors would have received a better treatment if the institution had been wound up under normal insolvency proceedings.\u00a0In this regard, the SRB confirms that the independent valuer for the Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol (BPE) case, Deloitte, provided it with the final \u2018Valuation 3\u2019 report, in line with the terms agreed between the SRB and the independent valuer. Following the receipt of this report, the SRB is preparing its decision. To this end, all essential procedural steps will be taken. One of these steps involves providing affected shareholders and creditors with the right to be heard, before the SRB adopts its final decision. With a view to ensuring an effective exercise of the right to be heard, the SRB will publish its draft decision, together with a non-confidential version of the \u2018Valuation 3\u2019 report.\u00a0The right to be heard is a fundamental right provided under EU law to persons affected by an individual measure of an EU body. In this specific proceeding, the process will be undertaken in two phases. In the first phase, the SRB will allow the concerned former BPE shareholders and creditors, to register, thereby expressing their interest in exercising their right to be heard on the SRB\u2019s draft decision. After the registration period, the SRB will announce details of the second phase, in which the registered shareholders and creditors will be invited to submit their comments. After reviewing the submitted comments, the SRB will adopt its final decision on whether compensation needs to be granted to the affected shareholders and creditors.\u00a0The SRB will now take all needed procedural steps and will communicate the expected timeline by mid-July, with the publication of the SRB draft decision and the \u2018Valuation 3\u2019 report soon after.\u00a0Background\u00a0On 6 June 2017, the European Central Bank (ECB) determined Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol S.A. (BPE) to be failing or likely to fail. The ECB notified the SRB accordingly.\u00a0On 7 June 2017, the SRB adopted a resolution decision for BPE, Spain\u2019s 6th largest bank. All shares and capital of BPE were transferred to Banco Santander S.A. The SRB and the Spanish National Resolution Authority (FROB) decided that the sale was in the public interest as it ensured financial stability, while protecting all depositors of BPE. The resolution scheme entered into force on the same day, following the endorsement of the European Commission. The resolution scheme was implemented by FROB.\u00a0The SRB has published, among other documents, a non-confidential version of the Resolution Decision in respect of BPE, the Valuation 1 and 2 Reports, annexed to the Resolution Decision, and the 2016 Resolution Plan for Banco Popular Group.\u00a0About the Single Resolution Board and the Single Resolution Mechanism\u00a0The Single Resolution Board (SRB) is the resolution authority within the Banking Union and, as part of the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), is at its centre. It works closely with, in particular, the national resolution authorities (NRAs) of participating Member States, the European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB) and national competent authorities (NCAs). Its mission is to ensure an orderly resolution of failing banks with minimum impact on the real economy and public finances of the participating Member States and beyond.\u00a0The SRM regulation (SRMR) establishes the framework for the resolution of banks in EU countries participating in the Banking Union. \u00a0The bank recovery and resolution directive (BRRD) requires banks to prepare recovery plans to overcome financial distress. It also grants national authorities powers to ensure an orderly resolution of failing banks with minimal costs for taxpayers.\u00a0Resoluci\u00f3n del Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol: La JUR, tras haber recibido el informe de \u201cValoraci\u00f3n 3\u201d final, est\u00e1 preparando las pr\u00f3ximas etapas, entre las que se incluye una consulta.\u00a0Tras cualquier acci\u00f3n de resoluci\u00f3n, la Junta \u00danica de Resoluci\u00f3n (JUR) tiene que asegurar que se respeta el principio de evitar perjuicios superiores a los acreedores (o no creditor worse off). Para ello, despu\u00e9s de que las acciones de resoluci\u00f3n se hayan llevado a cabo, se tiene que realizar la llamada \u201cValoraci\u00f3n 3\u201d por una persona independiente lo antes posible. Esta valoraci\u00f3n determina si los accionistas y acreedores habr\u00edan recibido un tratamiento mejor si la instituci\u00f3n hubiera sido liquidada con arreglo a los procedimientos de insolvencia ordinarios.\u00a0A este respecto, la JUR confirma que el valorador independiente del caso Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol (BPE), Deloitte, ha proporcionado el informe final de \u201cValoraci\u00f3n 3\u201d en los t\u00e9rminos convenidos entre la JUR y el valorador independiente. Tras recibir el informe, la JUR est\u00e1 preparando su decisi\u00f3n, para lo cual se han de respetar una serie de etapas procesales esenciales, siendo una de ellas el conceder derecho de audiencia a los accionistas y acreedores afectados. Posteriormente la JUR adoptar\u00e1 su decisi\u00f3n final. Con el fin de asegurar el ejercicio efectivo del derecho de audiencia, la JUR publicar\u00e1 su propuesta de decisi\u00f3n y una versi\u00f3n no confidencial del informe de \u201cValoraci\u00f3n 3\u201d final.\u00a0El derecho de audiencia es un derecho fundamental en Derecho Europeo que se otorga a las personas afectadas por una medida individual de un \u00f3rgano de la UE. En este procedimiento en particular, el proceso se realizar\u00e1 en dos fases. En una primera fase, la JUR abrir\u00e1 un proceso de registro en el que todos los antiguos accionistas y acreedores de BPE concernidos podr\u00e1n mostrar su inter\u00e9s en ejercitar el derecho de audiencia con respecto a la propuesta de decisi\u00f3n de la JUR. Tras el periodo de registro, la JUR anunciar\u00e1 los detalles de la segunda fase, en la que los accionistas y acreedores que se hayan registrado ser\u00e1n invitados a proporcionar sus comentarios. Despu\u00e9s de analizar los comentarios aportados, la JUR adoptar\u00e1 una decisi\u00f3n final sobre la necesidad de compensar a los accionistas y acreedores afectados.\u00a0La JUR va a seguir todas las etapas procesales necesarias y comunicar\u00e1 los plazos previstos a mediados de julio. Posteriormente, poco despu\u00e9s, la JUR publicar\u00e1 su propuesta de decisi\u00f3n y el informe de \u201cValoraci\u00f3n 3\u201d.\u00a0Antecedentes\u00a0El 6 de junio de 2017 el Banco Central Europeo (BCE) determin\u00f3 que Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol S.A. (BPE) estaba en graves dificultades o exist\u00eda la probabilidad de que fuera a estarlo. El BCE se lo notific\u00f3 debidamente a la JUR.\u00a0El 7 de junio de 2017 la JUR adopt\u00f3 la decisi\u00f3n de resoluci\u00f3n de BPE, el sexto banco de Espa\u00f1a. Todas las acciones y el capital de BPE fueron transferidos al Banco Santander S.A.

It is a journey with a clear destination \u2013 to ensure banks\u2019 resolvability, thereby strengthening financial stability and safeguarding taxpayers\u2019 money. The SRB is not alone on this journey. Alongside the national resolution authorities (NRAs), we engage closely with the industry to illustrate the envisaged methodology, seek feedback and define step by step the final policy.In December 2017 the SRB published its MREL policy for 2017, detailing the progress made and the work awaiting us. The SRB has taken a gradual, multi-year approach to MREL, that takes into account the specificities of the banks under its remit, with the goal of maintaining proportionality in the system while preserving a level playing field and upholding high resolution standards across the Banking Union.The SRB, together with the Banking Union NRAs, started to develop its MREL approach in 2016, with informative targets that sought to enable banks to prepare for their future MREL requirements. For the 2017 resolution planning cycle, the SRB moved from informative targets to bank-specific, binding consolidated MREL targets for the majority of the largest and most complex banks in the euro area, including all global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs).As in 2016, the 2017 MREL is calculated at consolidated level as the sum of a loss absorption amount and a recapitalisation amount, complemented by a market confidence charge. As a new feature, some bank-specific adjustments were introduced for the recapitalisation amount and the market confidence charge, by referring to the effect of balance sheet depletion, the use of recovery options, or restructuring plan divestments and sales.The SRB has also moved forward with respect to the quality of MREL, by introducing a first subordination benchmark for other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs) in addition to the subordination for G-SIIs introduced in 2016. In concrete terms, G-SIIs will be required to meet a minimum subordination level equal to 13.5% RWA plus the combined buffer requirement (CBR); for O-SIIs, the benchmark is set at 12% of RWA plus the CBR.Regarding the eligibility of liabilities, the SRB has clarified that non-covered non-preferred deposits are excluded unless there is evidence that they cannot be withdrawn within a one-year period. The SRB also took a cautious approach towards liabilities governed by the laws of a country outside the EU, which are generally excluded, unless there is evidence that the write-down or bail-in of those liabilities by the SRB would be recognised by the courts of that country.For other banks within its remit, the SRB considered that an iterative process, without taking an immediate binding decision on MREL, is preferable. For the less significant institutions that are not within its remit, the SRB will act through its oversight function and assess the conformity of draft resolution measures for LSIs that NRAs notify us, in accordance with the SRM Regulation. These include resolution measures to be adopted, such as draft resolution plans, MREL and resolvability assessment, as well as decisions to apply simplified obligations.MREL will continue to be one of the key areas of work for the SRB in 2018. To underpin resolution planning, the SRB will develop guidance for the Internal Resolution Teams on solo/internal MREL and MREL calibration under transfer strategies. Internal loss-absorbing capacity is crucial to ensure that, within a group, losses are passed from the entities where they originate to those entities where resolution action is coordinated. The SRB will also work further on defining the need for subordination, not least in light of assessing any challenges from the NCWO principle.The SRB will develop its approach based on the current legislative framework, and strive to implement internal MREL for banking groups with resolution colleges during the 2018 planning cycle. At the same time, we are following closely the ongoing negotiations on the revision of the BRRD and SRMR to prepare for a revision of our MREL policy, including on bank-specific targets and transition periods.MREL is a crucial tool to improve banks\u2019 resolvability.

These proposals also suggest partially waiving certain cross-border capital and liquidity requirements to address the fragmentation of national banking markets. The SRB welcomes the Commission\u2019s efforts to make progress on the completion of the Banking Union and to enhance resolvability of big banks with the implementation of TLAC and the introduction of a creditor hierarchy. At this point, we should take a step back and identify further elements, which impede the completion of a fully-fledged Banking Union. The Single Supervisory Mechanism tasked with reducing the occurrence of crises ex-ante and the Single Resolution Mechanism equipped with common rules for the orderly wind-down of a failing bank ex-post have proven to be two important pillars of Banking Union. The missing third pillar, a common European Deposit Insurance Scheme with appropriate safeguards is a pre-requisite for the completion of the Banking Union, as it would harmonize the level of depositor protection throughout all Member States. However, efforts are also needed in other domains. In this context, the divergence of national insolvency laws is a major obstacle towards a fully-fledged Banking Union. In the current system, the counterfactual of no-creditor-worse off (NCWO) might produce different results in different countries depending on the national insolvency regime and thus negatively impact on the orderly wind-down of a bank. The SRB therefore strongly encourages legislators to harmonise national insolvency laws, in order to create a level-playing field. This harmonisation would facilitate resolution planning for cross-border banking groups within the Banking Union. For these banking institutions, the SRB\u2019s Internal Resolution Teams (IRT), assess a bank\u2019s critical functions and business model as a whole. Based on this assessment, the SRB determines the preferred resolution strategy and the appropriate amount of MREL for the banking group as a whole and at entity level to allow for potential internal upstreaming of losses and downstreaming of capital. However, we must be aware, that in the current framework insolvency is clearly entity-specific as is NCWO. It is crucial to bear in mind that without statutory or at least contractual changes to this framework, the focus during the resolution of banking groups will have to remain at entity level and thus limit the scope of national or cross-border waivers. In this domain, the legislators are clearly in the driving seat. At the same time, we should explore alternative means of internal loss absorption with appropriate safeguards, so that a single-point-of-entry strategy across Banking Union Member States could be effectively carried out. While harmonised rules certainly help to ensure effective supervision and resolution, the consistent enforcement of these rules and close coordination and cooperation among authorities are equally decisive for the functioning of the Banking Union. Hence, the cooperation of ECB and SRB must be improved even further, and the updated Memorandum of Understanding will help in this regard. Moreover, the cooperation and monitoring between the individual national competent and resolution authorities and their interaction with the European level requires further intensified efforts. In this way, it can be expected that the trust of national authorities in the effectiveness of the European supervisory and resolution regime would be considerably strengthened. Overcoming the outlined obstacles to the fragmentation of the Banking Union can be a major contributor to financial stability, enhance resolvability and depositor protection and help build trust and confidence in the functioning of the Banking Union among the different national authorities. Once the Banking Union has been completed with the full potential of all three pillars realised, Member States and their respective supervisory and regulatory authorities would have little reason to maintain any ring-fencing practice or to erect barriers to the free movement of capital and liquidity across national borders within the Banking Union.", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/544"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0109", "date": "2018-07-30", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Combat of Money Laundering in the EU Banking Sector: Remarks by Mauro Grande, SRB Board Member", "text": "CHECK AGAINST DELIVERYPublic Hearing: \u2018Combat of Money Laundering in the EU Banking Sector\u2019 of the European Parliament\u2019s Special Committee on Financial Crimes, Tax Evasion and Tax Avoidance, 26 April 2018\u00a0Mr Chairman,Honourable Members of the European Parliament,Thank you for inviting me to discuss the important topic of how to strengthen checks and controls to reduce money-laundering risks in the banking system.The mission of the Single Resolution Board is to ensure an orderly resolution of failing banks with minimum impact on the real economy, the financial system, and the public finances of the participating Member States and beyond. This does not mean that we wait for resolution cases to handle. Our role is proactive: we focus on resolution planning and preparation, to ensure resolvability of banks under our remit and minimise the potential negative impact of a bank failure.As such, it is clearly not within the mandate of the SRB to detect and tackle money laundering. This said, the SRB has a natural interest in the topic, given the impact that money laundering, and related allegations can have on a bank\u2019s viability.We are therefore happy to share the lessons we drew from the recent case of ABLV (discussed in the first panel): my introductory remarks today will focus on ABLV, and present reflections from the perspective of a resolution authority.On 13 February 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking to prohibit the opening or maintaining of a correspondent account in the US for, or on behalf of, ABLV. FinCEN proposed this measure based on its finding that ABLV is \u201ca financial institution of primary money laundering concern\u201d. [This was communicated to the ECB, which then informed the SRB, only shortly before publication of the notice.]The announcement by FinCEN gave rise to a sudden wave of deposit withdrawals and requests for withdrawals; and a lack of access to US Dollars funding, which resulted in ABLV being unable to make payments in US dollars. To stop the liquidity outflow, on 18 February, the National Competent Authorities of the parent company in Latvia and of the subsidiary in Luxembourg, instructed by the ECB, suspended all payments by the banks.On 23 February, the ECB reached the conclusion that ABLV Latvia and ABLV Luxembourg were deemed to be failing or likely to fail (FOLTF): the significant deterioration of their liquidity position was making them unable to pay their debts or other liabilities as they fell due. Following this development, the SRB concluded that for these two banks resolution action was not in the public interest, as they did not provide critical functions for the economy of one or more Member States and their failure was not expected to have a significant adverse impact on financial stability in Latvia, Luxembourg or other Member States.We have already discussed this case with members from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and our views on how it highlights the need to harmonise national bank insolvency proceedings and align them with the FOLTF criteria. These are important lessons learnt for us and for legislators but are not the topic of this hearing.With regard to \u201cmoney laundering risks\u201d, for us the ABLV case is a reminder that when these risks materialise, similar to other operational risks, they can lead to an immediate loss of trust in the bank. This can trigger sudden and significant outflows of liquidity, and make the bank fail in a very short time-frame. This leaves the SRB with an extremely narrow window to assess whether it is in the public interest to resolve the bank, and, if so, to adopt an appropriate resolution scheme.As such, from our perspective as resolution authority, this case recalled the importance of taking into due account different types of operational risks, including reputational risk, as part of our resolution planning and particularly in our dialogue with the supervisor.The first lessons we can draw is that, to inform this dialogue between us and the supervisors, it is key that relevant information on AML risks is communicated to the supervisors, and to us, as soon as possible. In our view, the fifth review of the Anti-Money Laundering Directive makes some progress in this respect, as it clarifies the basis for exchange of information between the national authorities responsible for AML and prudential supervisors. Enforcement and operationalisation of such exchange of information is key.Secondly, once information is improved, the dialogue with supervisor could better assess business models more \u201csusceptible\u201d to reputational risk, and take this into account when considering the possible scenarios of failure of the banks under SRB remit (in light of the specific speed of failures due to materialisation of reputational risks).Beyond these lessons learnt from the specific perspective of resolution authority, let me share some more general thoughts on the AML policy framework and enforcement.AML rules in the EU are still subject to only a minimum harmonisation, through a Directive rather than a Regulation. Moreover, the enforcement of these rules is notably entrusted to different national authorities across the EU Member States. Legislators should assess whether not only the exchange of information, but also the level of harmonisation of AML rules, and the split of competences is still fit for purpose or if, for instance, a Regulation rather than a Directive, and a centralised enforcement with a separate EU authority would improve the consistency and effectiveness of the framework. This is why we welcome the provision of AMLD 5 requiring the European Commission to consider proposing the establishment of a European FIU in future.Coming to a conclusion, trust is a key premise of the banking sector. When trust is eroded, the financial situation of an institution can very quickly deteriorate. ABLV is the only the most recent reminder of this theorem. While we stand ready to minimize the negative repercussions of a bank failure - which can indeed be due to the materialisation of operational risks such as money-laundering activities \u2013 it is in everybody\u2019s interest to address risks before they can materialise.Therefore, we support any attempt to ensure that the EU is equipped with a sound, up-to-date legislative framework, rigorously enforced to prevent, detect and address not only money-laundering risks \u2013 but other operational risks as well.", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/546"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0110", "date": "2018-04-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "SRB Conference - 15 October 2018 - Save The Date!", "text": "The Third Single Resolution Board (SRB) Conference, hosted by the Chair of the SRB, Ms Elke K\u00f6nig, will take place in Brussels on 15 October 2018.

Accountability is a key value for the SRB, particularly as our mission is to the benefit of European citizens, which this Parliament represents. I always appreciate your interest and candid debate.In my introductory remarks today, I would like to touch upon, among other things, the European Court of Auditors report, the release of the non-confidential version of documents related to the resolution of Banco Popular, and the recent case of ABLV Bank. Finally, I will share some views on the amendments to BRRD-SRMR, CRR and CRD, which many of you are working on, I am sure.ECA recommendations and SRB progressOur programme for 2018 was published in November and we had already the chance to discuss it in December. Two weeks after, the Court of Auditors published a number of recommendations for the SRB as consequence of their audit of SRB activities up to the end of January 2017.We had a very constructive cooperation with the ECA throughout the audit and we welcomed their set of the recommendations. More than this, we are capitalising on them. Concretely, we mapped the recommendations vis a vis our 2017 resolution planning cycle (which was not covered by the audit) and with our multiannual programme 2018-2020: we were glad to note many matchings.For instance, as regards the recommendation on staffing, in 2017 an enhanced HR department allowed us to accelerate recruitment bringing us on track with the agreed staffing plan. Another ECA recommendation already partially fulfilled is the development of a policy on MREL: our 2017 MREL approach is public and has been applied in the 2017 resolution planning cycle. But clearly more has to come and 2018 will see a clear focus on determining MREL for all banking groups and significant entities within banking groups.Several other recommendations are actually deliverables planned for 2018-2020 in our multiannual programme. This includes the work on substantive impediments to resolvability, the ongoing revision of our cooperation agreement with NRAs and of the Memorandum of Understanding with the ECB, an update to our resolution planning manual and, notably, the completion of fully compliant resolution plans for all SRB banks by 2020 by the latest. I know that for some of you this train is moving too slowly. But let me reiterate that resolution planning is a multi-year project. At the same time, no responsible bank management needs to wait for the SRB decisions: building MREL and addressing data, legal and organisational obstacles should happen now. The sun is shining; no reason to wait. This is a message my colleagues and I are constantly conveying to banks.Recent casesTurning to recent SRB decisions, let me first briefly comment on the recent extended publication related to our first resolution case.At the beginning of February, we published extensive additional information on the Banco Popular case. This includes non-confidential parts of: the Resolution Decision, the so-called Valuation 2 and the 2016 Resolution Plan. In doing so, we actually went beyond the decision by the SRB Appeal Panel of November 2017. And we did so because we are determined to be as transparent as we can.We shall be equally clear in stating that some parts of these documents need to remain confidential. This is the case for information that comes from the ECB and where the ECB refuses publication, and this is the case when the disclosure would: (a) undermine the protection of public interests [as regards the financial, monetary or economic policy]; or (b) undermine commercial interests of BPE and/or its purchaser; or (c) affect the still on-going valuation 3. This is the valuation to determine whether former shareholders or creditors of Banco Popular would have received a better treatment under normal insolvency proceedings. The SRB is obliged to respect the independence of the valuer, Deloitte, and give the necessary time to complete the valuation. Therefore, we are waiting like other interested parties in this regard.Moving on to the most recent case, as you know, the SRB decided on February 24th that resolution action was not necessary for the Latvian bank ABLV and its subsidiary in Luxembourg and therefore, the banks should be\u00a0wound up under Latvian and Luxembourgish laws.This case is still fresh and rather peculiar, thus we shall be careful in drawing lessons at this stage, and even more in generalising them. However, we already made some observations, which I would like you to take away.First, this case is a vivid reminder of the fact that insolvency remains the primary route for many banks, even if they are under SSM and SRB remit. The route to take of course depends on the assessment of public interest first and foremost. For ABLV, the SRB\u2019s resolution plan 2017 already indicated the lack of critical functions for the Member States or the Union as well as the absence of public interest and, therefore, insolvency as the preferred strategy.More notably, this case highlighted the importance of harmonising banks\u2019 insolvency laws. The common SRM framework for resolution is faced with 19 or more different insolvency procedures. The failing or likely to fail (FOLTF) assessment does not automatically link to the criteria for insolvency/liquidation. Only by raising national bank insolvency procedures to a common standard we can clarify the line between resolution and insolvency and eliminate wrong incentives. In addition, the \u201cno-creditor-worse-off\u201d evaluation, where -as I mentioned earlier- it is verified if shareholders or creditors would have received a better treatment under insolvency proceedings than in resolution,\u00a0should provide the same outcome in all Banking Union Member States.Within the Single Resolution Mechanism, we are working on National Handbooks, first to define how to implement resolution schemes in each country, but also looking at the national implementation steps for a decision not to adopt resolution, as in the Latvian case. This is a very complex work, which requires the utmost cooperation by National Resolution Authorities. And it will anyway not be comparable to a harmonisation of national insolvency practices, something that only legislators can deliver.Banking packageFinally, I wish to comment on the ongoing amendments to the resolution framework based on the SRB experience. We follow attentively the debates by this Committee on the banking package. And we noticed at least one common theme, albeit conjugated in different ways, and this is proportionality.We undersign this principle, and follow it in our application of the resolution framework. Undeniably, it is indeed through legislation that the work of Resolution Authorities can and shall be steered and framed. However, we shall be clear that, if you want us to be proportionate, we need to have the necessary discretion. This applies in a number of areas: the quantity and quality of MREL, the deadline to comply with it, even the way to remedy the breaches of MREL.The starting point for Resolution Authorities when assessing these elements is the resolution strategy and, even more, the resolvability of each individual bank in our remit. This is our key aim, what we measure, and what we get measured against.While it is natural to expect us to be proportionate and explain our choices (which are developed with NRAs and explained to banks in bank-specific workshops), it would be dangerous to constrain the ability to tailor to the specific situation of each bank how much subordinated and/or non-subordinated MREL the bank needs, and by when. It would run contrary to the objective of proportionality and achieving resolvability.As long as the necessary flexibility (e.g. to address risks to resolvability) is retained in the calibration of MREL requirement, without caps or constraints, and Resolution Authorities are empowered to tailor the remedies to breaches of MREL case-by-case, without automaticity, then we could agree on removing MREL guidance; this would also avoid further complicating the framework.When it comes to streamlining the framework for setting MREL, we recommend to move from the current two-tier process, whereby the SRB determines MREL targets but then NRAs need to implement the SRB decision, to a one-tier approach, to enable the SRB to address decisions directly to banks. The two-tier approach does not add any room for discretion for NRAs, while it de facto leads to delays in the implementation of the decisions, different rights and obligations in different Member States, and the possibility to challenge the SRB\u2019s decisions. Moving to a one-tier approach would increase operational efficiency of the SRBV and protect it from additional challenges. This, by the way, holds true for any decision on impediments to resolvability too.Another key topic is the new moratorium tool for Resolution Authorities proposed by the European Commission. This is also included among the recommendations by the Court of Auditors. We recognise the need to minimise possible negative implications, but we think this is possible and the benefit of a new tool is clear. We see it as a \u201cbridge\" between determination of failing or likely to fail (FOLTF) and resolution, to be used onlyas an exception. It would help to reduce the first mover advantage sparking bank runs and to provide time to prepare a resolution scheme, where necessary (for instance to get to the weekend). Also, it would help to harmonise existing tools across the EU and avoid future divergent national moratoria. But let\u2019s be clear, this tool would help addressing challenges only if it has a broad scope by including covered deposits.Coming to a conclusion, the recent audit and cases show that we stand on much more solid grounds today, but challenges remain for the resolution framework and its application. In terms of policy, time did not allow me to touch on other key issues, such as the need for EDIS and common backstop, the very important topic of liquidity in resolution, etcetera. But I am sure there will be the chance to come back on these issues in the Q&A session now and in the weeks ahead, when you can expect the SRB to be ready to support the work of this Committee.Thank you very much for your attention!", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/508"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0115", "date": "2018-07-30", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "SRB Press breakfast - Speech of Elke K\u00f6nig, Chair of the Single Resolution Board", "text": "CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ladies and Gentlemen,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for joining us today and a very warm welcome to the Single Resolution Board.Although we normally try to host this event in January, it was difficult to find a slot for us all to be present together. This means I have a little more ground to cover since we last held this event 15 months ago! But don\u2019t worry; I will be as brief as possible in order to allow you time to ask questions.2017 was another significant year for the SRB. We developed resolution plans, and started setting binding MREL targets. In the beginning of June last year, we had our very first resolution case, Banco Popular. I don\u2019t want to go over the details again but I think its fair to say that we have shown that the SRB is ready to successfully handle resolution cases should the need arise. That said, our first resolution case was one from which we can draw valuable lessons in order to improve the process of resolution going forward.One of the lessons we learnt is that close cooperation between supervisory and resolution authorities is essential for the successful handling of crisis cases.The ad-hoc availability of good quality data is crucial to obtain a full picture of the situation and to allow the resolution authority take appropriate action. This is a collective undertaking: While the SRB needs to determine data requirements, banks need to invest significantly and build the relevant IT infrastructure to provide this kind of data at the push of a button in times of crisis. The industry is beginning to work on this, but much more needs to be done in this area.We have always stated that resolution must remain the exception, not the rule. This was proven in three other instances, Banca Popolare di Vicenza, Veneto Banca and ABLV. In these cases, the SRB took a decision that there was no need to enter into the resolution process, because there would be no significant adverse impact on the financial stability of the Member States concerned as well as for the EU as a whole, and none of these banks provided critical functions for the Member States. Therefore, these cases were subject to normal \u2013 national - insolvency procedures.I want to speak briefly about the most recent of these three cases \u2013 ABLV. The case is still fresh and rather unique, thus we shall be careful in drawing lessons at this stage, and even more so in generalising them. However, let me share some observations with you.\u00a0First, this case is a vivid reminder of the fact that insolvency or winding down remains the primary route for many banks, even if they are under SSM and SRB remit. For ABLV, the SRB\u2019s resolution plan of 2017 already indicated the lack of critical functions for the Member States or the EU as well as the absence of public interest and, therefore, insolvency was the preferred strategy in case the bank were to fail. More notably, this case highlighted once again the importance of harmonising banks\u2019 insolvency laws. The common Single Resolution Mechanism Framework is faced with 19 or more different insolvency procedures. The failing or likely to fail (FOLTF) assessment does not automatically link to the criteria for insolvency/liquidation. It is only by raising national bank insolvency procedures to a common standard, that we can clarify the line between resolution and insolvency and eliminate incorrect incentives.As long as insolvency laws, corporate laws and administrative laws are not harmonised in Europe, we will be faced with multiple national differences. Therefore, there is a need for tailor-made national approaches to be able to implement a resolution decision or a decision not to implement a resolution. The national resolution authorities have to finalise their handbooks for this as a priority in 2018.That was the recent past \u2013 however, as you know, our work is forward-looking. \u00a0When we were set up, many expected that our main work would be in resolution, but that is not the reality. We don\u2019t just simply sit and wait for a bank to fail and then resolve it - most of our work is preventive. In English, there is an expression \u2013 \u2018a stitch in time saves nine\u2019, and I think that captures the very essence of our work.While we have built good foundations in resolution planning to date, resolution planning is a process not a product. There is still much more to do, and there will always be need to \u2018fine-tune\u2019 the plans going forward. A word of caution however, while our resolution plans are solid and provide an excellent framework, we must also allow enough flexibility to quickly adapt a resolution plan\u2019s theory to the reality of the situation we find ourselves in. While the sale of business may for example lead to a good outcome in resolution, it is something that is difficult to plan for.Making banks resolvable is a multi-year project, and it cannot happen overnight. The SRB Work Programme for 2018 has five key priority areas. These are:1. Strengthening resolvability for SRB entities and less significant institutions, in other words, the smaller banks;2. Fostering a robust resolution framework;3. Preparing and carrying out effective crisis management;4. Operationalising the Single Resolution Fund, and5. Ensuring the SRB is an efficient organisation.A key objective for the SRB in 2018 is to adopt resolution plans for the majority of the banking groups under SRB remit. Sufficient MREL in quantity and quality is a key feature to make banks resolvable. This year we aim to determine binding MREL targets at consolidated level for all relevant banking groups, but we will also kick off work on MREL targets at material entity level.\u00a0To underpin resolution planning we will develop guidance for the Internal Resolution Teams on a number of areas in addition to MREL.The SRB 2017 policy on MREL was released at the end of last year and presented at the SRB industry dialogue in November. This was our second MREL policy statement \u2013 and it will be revised and updated again at the end of 2018. However, whereas the 2016 approach was the basis for informative targets, the 2017 policy also served to set binding targets in 2018 \u2013 a new departure \u2013 and there is more to come in 2018 and 2019. Another priority, central to the SRB\u2019s work in 2018, is a first identification of substantive impediments to resolution. Obstacles to resolution could include, the lack of adequate availability of data, in particular but not just detailed liability information, and adequate IT systems, overly complex legal structures, lack of sufficient safeguards to guarantee continuity of access to financial market infrastructures, lack of funding in resolution, etc. None of these topics come as a surprise to banks. The SRB teams have addressed them already in 2016 and 2017.\u00a0 Prior to defining these as substantive impediments, we will analyse in detail whether the actions planned or already taken by a bank are sufficient to avoid initiating formal procedures.Though not all these obstacles are for the banks to address, banks do not have to wait for the SRB\u2019s decisions on impediments. They can and should work on making improvements immediately. Like on MREL, though the final goal might not be 100% clear yet, the direction of travel is very clear and there is no reason to wait until the SRB issues formal decisions.To safeguard the resolution framework, the SRB will closely cooperate with its partners on a national and EU level. Looking at the largest banks under our remit international cooperation \u2013 not least with the US \u2013 is important and progressing well. We have also revised the MoU between the SRB and the ECB in light of the experience gained since 2016.Just a word regarding Brexit: Clearly, banks must plan for any possible outcome in the ongoing negotiations and we are closely monitoring their plans. One topic will be the question of how to deal with bonds issues by Euro area banks under UK law. These will become third country issues and might no longer be eligible for MREL going forward.Now just a word on the Fund. This is the third year that the SRB is calculating ex-ante contributions. On 1 May 2018, 3315 institutions will be notified by respective NRAs of the ex-ante amounts due. By 30 June 2018, the NRAs are expected to transfer contributions to the SRF. Covered deposits in the Euro area grew by more than 3% in 2017 when compared with 2016. Therefore the SRB, in order to be able to fulfil its mandate - that is collect, at least, 1% of the total amount of covered deposits at the end of the transitional period, meaning the end of 2023 - \u00a0has decided to increase the annual target level, vis-\u00e0-vis last year. We expect to collect about \u20ac7.5 billion in contributions to the fund in June this year.In terms of policy, time did not allow me to touch on other key issues, such as the BRRD II Package, or the need for EDIS and the common backstop, the very important topic of liquidity in resolution, etcetera. However, I am sure there will be the chance to come back on these issues in the Q&A session in a moment.So, to conclude: The SRB has gone from start-up to grown-up in a little over 3 years \u2013 but of course, there is always more to be done. There are challenges that remain. I have said it before, but it\u2019s worth repeating - Resolution planning is a process not a product. It is a dynamic process that is constantly evolving and adapting to changes in the industry - which is one of the things that keeps resolution so interesting, and of course, its dynamic nature will probably help to provide many - hopefully positive - stories for you to cover in the months ahead!Thank you.\u00a0", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/521"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0116", "date": "2018-03-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "2018 Administrative Contributions", "text": "On 8 January 2018, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2361/2017 of 14 September 2017 on the final system of contributions to the administrative expenditures of the SRB came into force.

To make as much information publicly available as possible, the SRB has decided to publish additional documents relating to the resolution process. On 28 November 2017, the SRB Appeal Panel confirmed that full disclosure of certain documents related to the resolution of Banco Popular would raise financial stability concerns. Taking into account the time that has elapsed since the resolution action and after careful consideration of potential financial stability concerns, following consultation of the relevant stakeholders, the SRB decided to disclose additional parts of the Resolution Decision, and parts of the Valuation Reports as well as of the 2016 Resolution Plan, which are considered to be of a non-confidential nature. In line with this approach, the SRB has released two additional documents related to the resolution action, namely the Marketing Decision as well as the Sale Process Letter.Certain parts of these documents remain confidential. These parts mainly contain information whose disclosure could (a) undermine the protection of public interests as regards the financial, monetary or economic policy, or (b) undermine commercial interests of BPE and/or its purchaser, or (c) affect the still on-going valuation process which is carried out in order to determine whether former shareholders or creditors of BPE would have received a better treatment under normal insolvency proceedings (Valuation 3).Accordingly, the non-confidential version of the following documents is available as of today:The 2016 Resolution Plan drawn up in respect of Banco Popular;The Marketing Decision, i.e. the SRB Decision of 3 June 2017 concerning the marketing of Banco Popular;The Sale Process Letter of FROB dated 6 June 2017;The Valuation Report prepared by the SRB to assess whether Banco Popular was failing or likely to fail (Valuation 1);The Valuation Report and its annexes prepared by the independent expert, Deloitte, in the context of the resolution action (Valuation 2); and,The Resolution Decision, i.e. the SRB Decision of 7 June 2017 concerning the adoption of a resolution scheme in respect of Banco Popular.\u00a0Please see the section 'Resolution Cases'\u00a0in order to consult these documents.Pursuant to Article 20(16) of Regulation 806/2014, a valuation for the purposes of assessing whether former shareholders and creditors of Banco Popular would have received better treatment if the bank had entered into normal insolvency proceedings (Valuation 3) is currently prepared by Deloitte.\u00a0About the Single Resolution Board The Single Resolution Board (SRB) is the central resolution authority within the Banking Union (BU).

Officials from the SRB and CDIC are continuously coordinating with other resolution authorities, tackling the challenges of bank resolution and preparing for effective cross border resolution, if needed. Cooperation among resolution authorities is important to help ensure that Global Systemically Important Banks (GSIBs) can fail without major systemic consequences. Bilateral arrangements signed between resolution authorities to underpin this cooperation are an important ingredient for building resolvability together and for advance planning for resolution. Particularly, the Cooperation Arrangement will allow them to better protect depositors and taxpayers through enhanced cooperation when an SRB member institution or a connected CDIC-regulated entity encounters serious financial difficulties. \u00a0\u00a0The CDIC and the SRB have therefore concluded a Cooperation Arrangement, following similar arrangements established between the SRB and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in September 2017. The purpose of this arrangement is to provide a basis for the exchange of information and cooperation in resolution planning and the implementation of such planning for financial institutions with operations in the Banking Union and Canada. The CDIC and SRB confirm, through this arrangement, their commitment to strengthen cross border resolvability by enhancing communication and cooperation, and to work together in planning and conducting an orderly cross border resolution.

Officials from the SRB and FDIC are continuously coordinating with other resolution authorities, tackling the challenges of bank resolution and preparing for effective cross border resolution, if needed. Cooperation among resolution authorities is important to help ensure that Global Systemically Important Banks (GSIBs) can fail without major systemic consequences. Bilateral arrangements signed between resolution authorities to underpin this cooperation are an important ingredient for building resolvability together and for advance planning for resolution. \u00a0\u00a0The FDIC and the SRB have therefore concluded a Cooperation Arrangement. The purpose of this arrangement is to provide a basis for the exchange of information and cooperation in resolution planning and the implementation of such planning for financial institutions with operations in the Banking Union as well as the United States of America. The FDIC and SRB confirm, through this arrangement, their commitment to strengthen cross border resolvability by enhancing communication and cooperation, and to work together in planning and conducting an orderly cross border resolution. The goal is to facilitate the resolution of banks present across the respective jurisdictions while maintaining financial stability in the United States and the European Union.\u00a0About the Single Resolution Board The Single Resolution Board (SRB) is the central resolution authority within the Banking Union (BU). Together with the NRAs of participating Member States it forms the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). The SRB works closely with the European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB), the European Banking Authority (EBA) and national competent authorities (NCAs). Its mission is to ensure an orderly resolution of failing banks with minimum impact on the real economy and public finances of the participating Member States and beyond.\u00a0Media Contact details: Camille De Rede - Communication OfficerE-mail: Camille.De-Rede@srb.europa.euPhone number: +32 2 490 3530Switchboard: +32 2 490 3000Mobile phone: +32 460 766 704\u00a0Maria Hormaeche - Seconded National ExpertE-mail: Maria.HORMAECHE-LAZCANO@srb.europa.euPhone number: +32 2 490 3702Mobile phone: +32 477 028 702Website: https://srb.europa.eu/Twitter: @EU_SRB\u00a0About the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)The U.S. Congress created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1933 to restore public con\ufb01dence in the nation\u2019s banking system.

I address all of you as representatives of the sovereignty of Spain and therefore as custodians of the public interest.Before focusing on the Banco Popular resolution case, I would like to take this opportunity to present you the Single Resolution Mechanism, the work accomplished, as well as the work ahead of us as I did already with several National Parliaments. A core lesson of the financial crisis was that legislators needed to introduce rules to avoid that taxpayers have to bail out failing banks in lack of any better option. With this in mind, the Single Resolution Mechanism was built as the second pillar within the framework of the Banking Union; the Single Supervisory Mechanism being the first pillar.The mission of the SRB is to ensure an orderly resolution of failing banks with minimum impact on the real economy, the financial system, and the public finances of the participating Member States and beyond. Together with the National Resolution Authorities (\u201cNRAs\u201d) of participating Member States, the SRB forms the Single Resolution Mechanism.The SRB works closely not only with the NRAs, but also with the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the European Banking Authority and national competent authorities.The SRM framework and its decision-making process, when addressing resolution topics, requires the involvement of the relevant national resolution authority. In today\u2019s discussion, in line with the SRM Regulation, FROB is represented by Mr. Ponce, as Chair of the Spanish resolution authority and in his capacity as a member of the Plenary and \u2013 where appropriate \u2013 the Executive Sessions of the SRB.The SRB has 142 banks or banking groups under its direct remit. The SRB aims to build their resolvability by designing resolution plans for these groups and thereby fostering preparedness for the management of a potential future crisis affecting a bank. To this end, the SRB is continuously coordinating with other resolution authorities, both within the EU and globally.The ultimate task of the SRB is to intervene when a bank is \u2018Failing or Likely to Fail\u2019, and such intervention is necessary for the achievement of the resolution objectives; in particular, to prevent severe negative effects on the stability of the financial system and to protect critical functions.Resolution is a specific procedure, which was introduced as an alternative to the national insolvency regimes in order to serve the public interest in particular circumstances. When a bank is declared \u2018Failing or Likely to Fail\u2019 and there are no private solutions available to prevent that failure, that bank \u2013 like any other enterprise - would enter into normal insolvency proceedings. However, since a liquidation of a bank may have severe consequences for financial stability and the real economy, a dedicated resolution framework was put in place; the BRRD and the SRMR.It is an illusion to think that resolution can eliminate the cost, which is inherent in the failure of a bank. But the resolution framework for the Banking Union introduces an orderly and fair distribution of the cost of the resolution; ensuring that shareholders will bear losses first and creditors bear losses after shareholders, in the order of their priority.This framework is based on the principle of acknowledgement of chances and risk in the purchase of shares and debt instruments. Chances and risks have to stay aligned. Shareholders and bondholders are aware of the intrinsic risk that the purchase of said instruments entails.It goes without saying that a resolution action \u2013 as any insolvency proceedings \u2013 is by nature \u2018intrusive\u2019. However, resolution provides the tools to tackle negative external effects of the failure of a bank, if the insolvency proceedings cannot sufficiently safeguard the public interest in the specific circumstances. In particular, the resolution framework is designed to enable the resolution authorities to intervene swiftly, to allocate the cost of failure appropriately and avoid that taxpayers face the cost of a bank failure. Bail-in and not bail-out has to be the norm.Let me explain the conditions that must be met to put an entity into resolution: The entity is \u2018Failing or Likely to Fail\u2019. There are no supervisory or private sector measures that could restore the bank to viability within the available timeframe. And: Resolution is necessary in the public interest, which means that the resolution objectives would not be met to the same extent if the bank were wound up under normal insolvency proceedings.The BRRD and the SRM Regulation set the following resolution objectives:\u2022 to ensure the continuity of critical functions;\u2022 to avoid significant adverse effects on financial stability;\u2022 to protect public funds by minimising reliance on extraordinary public financial support;\u2022 to protect covered depositors and covered investors and;\u2022 to protect client funds and client assets.The SRB shall also take into account these resolution objectives when choosing the resolution tools and resolution powers to be applied. Therefore, when taking a resolution decision the SRB has to weigh all arguments to choose the tool(s) that best achieve(s) these objectives.In addition to the above resolution objectives, the resolution framework contains safeguards in order to ensure that, in any case, creditors cannot be worse off in resolution than in insolvency. In other words, the framework is designed in such a way that it ensures that creditors cannot incur greater losses than they would have incurred under a counterfactual insolvency proceeding.With this in mind, let me now move to the SRB\u2019s first resolution decision, the sale of Banco Popular to Banco Santander.BPE was failing on the evening of 6 June 2017, as the bank had experienced serious outflows of liquidity in the previous weeks or even months, and had to acknowledge on that evening that it would not be in a position to match its liquidity outflows on the next day. There was simply no liquidity left. On 6 June the ECB concluded that BPE was failing and also BPE itself communicated to the ECB that it considered it was \u2018Failing or likely to Fail\u2019.Since there were no alternative measures available that could have prevented BPE\u2019s failure within the available timeframe, the SRB, as the resolution authority, in cooperation with FROB and with the European Commission, had to act swiftly. In particular, the SRB had to decide between the two options I talked about earlier: to intervene by taking resolution action or, to let the bank enter into normal insolvency proceedings under Spanish law.The Board, in close consultation with FROB and also Bank of Portugal, decided that it was in the public interest to take resolution action.I would like to stress that, if the SRB had not taken resolution action, BPE\u2019s banking license would have been withdrawn and BPE would no longer have been able to continue its banking activities:- BPE would no longer have been able to grant loans,- nor would it have been able to carry out payment and cash services.This would have affected not only large enterprises, but also a large number of small and medium-sized companies (\u201cSMEs\u201d) that play an important role in Spain\u2019s economy, as well as families and individuals. If functions of BPE \u2013 which are essential for the real economy in Spain \u2013 had been suddenly interrupted due to the start of insolvency proceedings, this would likely have had a material negative effect on BPE\u2019s clients and a knock on effect on the real economy of Spain. It could have led to contagion to other banks and to an increased uncertainty and mistrust in the financial system. This could have been the case not only in Spain but also beyond: BPE\u2019s subsidiary in Portugal was most likely to be negatively affected in case of a liquidation of BPE.Every resolution action is unique. After analysing the available resolution tools and combinations of tools, the SRB Board \u2013 together with FROB and also Bank of Portugal - considered that in the given situation, the sale of business tool would be the most effective tool to reach the resolution objectives.The rapid outflow of liquidity required swift action to protect the continuity of the bank\u2019s critical functions and to prevent risks to financial stability. We considered it essential to apply a resolution tool that could preserve financial stability in an effective manner by immediately restoring sufficient trust in the bank, and that would ensure that BPE would be able to continue to provide services, which were essential for the real economy.Due to the good preparation and cooperation between the relevant institutions (first and foremost FROB, but also the ECB, Bank of Portugal and the European Commission) ahead of the decision, we felt confident that we could take the resolution action successfully overnight.FROB participated fully in the decision making process in line with the SRM Regulation, and was subsequently responsible for the implementation of the resolution decision. The close cooperation between the SRB and FROB was crucial for the successful outcome. Of utmost importance was not only the precise coordination, but also the expertise and excellent preparedness that FROB demonstrated. It was not only key for the efficient decision making process, but also for the swift implementation of the resolution scheme at national level.By selling BPE to a strong banking group like Banco Santander that was in the position to immediately inject sufficient liquidity, BPE could continue operating under normal business conditions.The bank opened on the morning of 7 June, and people were able to deposit and draw money from BPE and to receive loans like on any other day. By applying the sale of business tool, the SRB managed to protect the depositors, senior bondholders and clients of the bank and safeguarded financial stability in Spain and beyond, without using any State aid.In line with the BRRD and the SRM Regulation, the resolution scheme was developed in close cooperation with the relevant national authorities, adopted by the SRB\u2019s Board and endorsed by the European Commission.When preparing for resolution, the SRB is required by the SRM Regulation to contract an independent valuer to perform a valuation with the purpose of facilitating and informing the SRB\u2019s resolution actions. If need be, the decision of the resolution authority can be based on a provisional report prepared either by an independent expert or by the SRB itself.In the case of BPE, the SRB hired Deloitte as an independent expert to provide it with a valuation report. Deloitte is a reputable valuation expert of international standing; it was selected following a clear process under rigorous procurement rules. When procuring the relevant valuation services, the rules for avoiding conflicts of interest foreseen in the EU law have been strictly followed. With a view to cover the diverse expertise needed at the time of resolution, the SRB launched in October 2015 an open call for tenders for valuation services. Following this procurement procedure, in April 2016, a panel of six firms with valuation expertise was established. Deloitte is one of our panel firms. Since then, each time there is a need to hire one of these firms for a specific assignment, the SRB follows a clear process under the procurement rules. This procedure ensures that the SRB does not act arbitrarily: First, the SRB checks whether the contractors are not in a conflict of interest regarding the relevant bank; the law contains specific requirements pertaining to the independence of the valuer. Thereafter, the SRB sends the request for services to all non-conflicted contractors and asks them to submit an offer with respect to the specific assignment. The submitted offers are evaluated according to pre-established criteria and the contract is awarded to the bidder presenting the best offer.The independent valuer prepares the valuation report, which is a document that informs the SRB of the economic value of the assets and liabilities of the bank under conservative assumptions. The purpose of the valuation differs depending on the resolution tool. When the sale of business tool is considered, as was the case for BPE, the valuation report informs the SRB\u2019s understanding of what would constitute commercial terms for the sale of business tool through an open, fair, and competitive sale process.To be clear, the valuation must be distinguished from the purchase price. This price is not established by the SRB on the basis of the valuation report, but by the buyer on the basis of a competitive marketing process. The price offered by the buyer is a reflection of the market\u2019s perception with regard to the value of transferred instruments; this determines any consideration to be paid to the previous owners of the instruments.The SRB, in cooperation with FROB, ensured that the marketing process was carried out in an appropriate manner. In particular, the SRB and FROB decided to contact the five potential purchasers who had expressed their initial interest during the private sale process conducted by the bank. The bank\u2019s previous attempts to find a buyer were a solid base for the SRB and FROB to build on.Out of the five potential purchasers, only two continued the process and were granted access to the virtual data room of the bank and in the end only Banco Santander submitted an offer. The offered price of 1 EUR took into account that prior to the transfer, the SRB would exercise its powers:- to write down the existing shares of BPE, to convert the Additional Tier 1 instruments of BPE into shares, and write them down and- to convert the Tier 2 instruments to new shares of BPE. These new shares were then transferred for 1 EUR.The offered price of 1 EUR was considered to be in line with the commercial terms that were appropriate in light of the valuation performed by the independent valuer and the circumstances of the case.On the day of the acquisition, Santander injected several billions of liquidity. This was necessary to restore the confidence of the market in BPE and to comply with its regulatory liquidity requirements. And subsequently Santander had to inject a substantial amount of capital into BPE in order to comply with its solvency requirements.Lastly \u2013 as mentioned before - it has to be kept in mind that the NCWO principle is intrinsic in the BRRD and the SRM Regulation, i.e. that no creditor incurs greater losses than he would have incurred in case of insolvency. An ex post valuation 3, the so called \u2018No creditors worse off\u2019 valuation, is currently being conducted by the independent expert. It is expected to be available in early 2018.If the valuation 3 concludes that shareholders and creditors were worse off in resolution than they would have been in case of insolvency, the SRB is required by law to provide for compensation of the difference.Resolution is intrusive and inevitably leads to legal actions. It is, as we can see now, a feast for lawyers, who challenge not only the legal actions of the EU and national authorities involved in such a decision but also the legality of the EU resolution framework as a whole. It is ultimately for the European Courts to decide on such actions directed against the SRB\u2019s resolution scheme.One of the main issues arising in the post resolution development was the appropriate level of public access to the relevant documents underpinning the above decision. The SRB respected the SRM Regulation when publishing immediately after the decision a short version of it, summing up its main elements. Thereafter we published a redacted version of the resolution decision.When assessing the issue, the SRB had due regard to the protection of the public interest as regards the stability of the financial system of the Banking Union and the financial or economic policy of the Union and beyond, including the policy relating to the resolution of credit institutions. In this regard, we considered that the resolution decision and the valuation report contain information the disclosure of which could undermine the above public interest. In particular, sections of the resolution decision referring to elements of resolution planning and the choice of the resolution strategy, as well as considerations relating to the assessment of the conditions for resolution, could give rise to adverse market reactions.It should also be noted that documents such as the resolution decision and the valuation report contain business information of BPE which remain confidential as the entity is still active, now as part of Grupo Santander.Regarding the disclosure of documents, the independent Appeal Panel of the SRB decided about 10 days ago, that the SRB\u2019s prudent stance was justified but that the SRB should nevertheless publish certain non-sensitive parts of the valuation report. We are currently assessing the Appeal Panel\u2019s decisions with a view to publish on our website, hopefully before year end, a redacted version of the valuation report and some additional features of our resolution decision.The treatment of these documents with regard to their confidential nature is also among the issues currently being assessed in judicial proceedings at the European level.Today we can conclude that the situation of the banking sector is much stronger. As reported in the recent Surveillance report of the European Commission, the resolution scheme for Banco Popular has been successfully implemented. The decision added to the stability of the Spanish financial sector and demonstrated that the new European resolution framework is functioning. The bank was resolved in a proper and timely manner within a very short timeframe, with no losses for depositors or taxpayers and with good coordination among all the national and EU authorities involved. Most importantly, stability in the Spanish financial sector was not endangered.Furthermore, safeguarding the existence of the bank now integrated into a larger group such as Santander, in addition to protecting deposits, clients and senior bondholders, has meant maintaining the employment of a large number of people. Additionally, the SMEs and companies that were clients of Banco Popular have been able to continue their daily operations.Resolution should remain the exception \u2013 I think we all agree. The role of the SRB is primarily preventive and proactive, focusing on resolution planning and preparation with a forward-looking mind-set. Banks that are well prepared for critical situations will generally be more resilient in the first place.Concretely, at the latest by 2020, the SRB will have developed complete resolution plans for all the banking groups under its direct remit, plans with the highest degree of sophistication under our framework. Until then, the SRB envisages intermediate stages for resolution plans which will be gradually refined until they reach the ultimate stage. Let me be clear that we already have plans for the vast majority of our banks \u2013 it is now about enhancing and enriching them with more detail \u2013, for example tackling possible impediments to resolvability. Let me also add that a resolution plan is by essence a living document and has to be reviewed yearly to take into account all the changes coming from the bank itself and its environment, including the regulatory evolutions. In that sense, the resolution plans will never be final.The resolution framework requires banks to comply with the \u2018minimum requirements of own funds and eligible liabilities\u2019 the so called MREL, in order to be able to absorb losses and restore capital levels so that the entity can continue to perform its critical functions during and after its crisis. Setting MREL is thus an integral part of the resolution planning task. MREL is key to achieving the resolvability of entities.The SRB has taken a proportionate, multi-year approach to MREL setting. In 2017 we are setting binding MREL targets for the largest and most complex groups under our remit on a consolidated level, and we will continue to enhance our MREL policy in 2018, in line with the rules set out in the SRM Regulation and the Commission\u2019s Delegated Regulation on MREL. In 2018, for those banks for which binding targets have already been set at consolidated level, the SRB will determine targets at individual level. For other banks, we will set binding MREL targets at consolidated level. The approach being taken ensures that banks are able to manage the transition to meeting MREL requirements without significant impact on financial stability or the real economy.By the latest in 2020, our resolution plans will comprise binding targets for MREL at consolidated and solo level and \u2013 another important aspect \u2013 they will reflect our findings about the removal of impediments to resolution.Let me conclude with this thought: Since the start of the financial crisis in 2008/9 a lot has happened. But there is clearly still much to do. Although bank resolution is still a rather new concept, we can affirm that today banks are in by far better shape now than they were ten years ago. Banks are sounder, safer and less leveraged today. And we as authorities have the tools at hand to resolve a bank in case of failure. This means that the European financial system is more resilient to economic shocks today.A lot has been achieved but the Banking Union has not delivered on all of its promises, yet. We cannot yet declare mission accomplished, in part because the framework is young and in part because it is incomplete; we are still awaiting MREL to be built up and the third pillar of the Banking Union \u2013 EDIS - to be established, just to mention two aspects. Overall, however, the journey that began only three years ago has progressed fast.Let me stress this: if failure is unavoidable then it is essential to be well prepared with a forward-looking mind-set to avoid the potential negative impact of a bank failure on the economy and on financial stability.Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak to you today. I will try to respond to the questions you may have.If your questions refer to the implementation of the decision, I will leave them to Mr. Ponce for his future hearing.* * *", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/452"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0125", "date": "2017-12-21", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "The SRB is currently preparing a non-confidential version of the Valuation Report of Banco Popular", "text": "The SRB is currently preparing a non-confidential version of the Valuation Report made by an independent expert and of certain other documents related to the resolution of Banco Popular.In its recent decisions on cases 38/17 to 43/17, the SRB Appeal Panel\u00a0confirmed that full disclosure of certain documents related to the resolution of Banco Popular would raise financial stability concerns.

At the same time, it decided that the SRB should make public elements of the Valuation Report it considers to be of a non-confidential nature.The SRB is now analysing the steps that need to be taken in the coming days following 6 decisions of the SRB Appeal Panel.On 28 November 2017, the Appeal Panel of the SRB released its decisions on the cases 38/17 to 43/17. These cases related to the review of decisions of the SRB with respect to the Appellants\u2019 requests for access to SRB documents, including the SRB Decision concerning the adoption of a resolution scheme in respect of Banco Popular, the related Valuation Report, the 2016 version of the Resolution Plan in respect of Banco Popular, documents emanating from the ECB concerning the situation of Banco Popular, internal SRB documents, as well as documents relating to the competitive process for the sale of Banco Popular.The SRB Appeal Panel, after balancing the interests involved, has decided that certain further parts of the Resolution Decision could be disclosed, although it welcomed the publication of a non-confidential version of the Resolution Decision by the SRB. In addition, the SRB Appeal Panel upheld the stance of the SRB that the disclosure of parts of the Valuation Report could \u201cpose a threat to such protected interests\u201d, \u201ccould have an impact on other market participants and/or resolution actions in the future\u201d and \u201ccould objectively raise actual concerns either of financial stability or of protection of commercial interests\u201d. Nevertheless, the SRB Appeal Panel stressed the need for the SRB to identify the non-confidential content of the Valuation Report that shall be disclosed. With respect to the 2016 Resolution Plan for Banco Popular, the SRB Appeal Panel considered that since disclosure of this Resolution Plan would now take place several months after the adoption of the Resolution Decision, some parts of this Resolution Plan could be made public. In the view of the SRB Appeal Panel, in preparing the non-confidential versions of these documents, the SRB \u201cenjoys significant discretion, provided that it complies, mutatis mutandis, with the principles stated in [its] decision[s]\u201d. As regards other internal SRB documents, the SRB Appeal Panel stated that access to such documents can be legitimately refused by the SRB to the extent that the Appellants did not show an overriding public interest in the disclosure of the documents. With respect to documents emanating from the ECB, the SRB Appeal Panel confirmed the SRB\u2019s stance regarding the non-disclosure of such documents. Finally, the SRB Appeal Panel considered that the refusal to provide full access to documents relating to the competitive process for the sale of Banco Popular \u201cwas duly substantiated and was duly justified by the applicable exceptions invoked by the Board\u201d.More about the Appel Panel\u00a0Contact details:Camille De Rede \u2013\u00a0 Communication OfficerCamille.De-Rede@srb.europa.euPhone number: +32 2 490 3530Switchboard: +32 2 490 3000Mobile phone: +32 477 028 530\u00a0Maria Hormaeche Lazcano - Seconded National ExpertMaria.HORMAECHE-LAZCANO@srb.europa.euPhone number: +32 2 490 3702Switchboard: +32 2 490 3000Mobile phone: +32 477 028 702Website: https://srb.europa.eu/Twitter: @EU_SRB", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/442"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0128", "date": "2018-07-30", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "European Parliament Public Hearing - SRB Chair Elke K\u00f6nig's speech", "text": "\u00a0CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY\u00a0Brussels, 4 December 2017Mr Chairman,Honourable Members of Parliament,It is a pleasure to be here to address you and to talk with you about the achievements attained by the SRB so far under my chairmanship and the elements that I consider important for the SRB going forward. Transparency and public responsibility are key for the work of the SRB. In my role as the SRB Chair I have attended several closed and open hearings here in the European Parliament and have always valued the opportunity to work closely with you, as well as with the Commission and Council.I have also held introductory visits in the participating Member States and I have attended meetings with some national parliaments, upon their invitation. Overall, it is critical for legislators across the EU to understand the work of the SRB in making banks resolvable and its challenging nature, given the direct positive impact the execution of the SRB\u2019s mission can have on the EU and its citizens.Ladies and Gentlemen, we have just published our first multi-annual programme for the next three years, including our work programme for 2018 today and already we can say that the second pillar of the Banking Union stands on solid ground, but we have to keep up the momentum and deliver the ambitious objectives set out by the co-legislators. By no means can we declare \u201cmission accomplished\u201d yet.Since the inception of the Banking Union a lot has been achieved and among those achievements there was the establishment of the SRB. The SRB has come from being a start-up with a very small number of diverse staff, to today\u2019s situation of an independent EU-agency with around 300 staff. The first three years in the SRB\u2019s life represent a very challenging period, not least for the SRB\u2019s staff members that contributed to meeting those challenges and made the SRB\u2019s mission become a reality. Today, I see the SRB moving to become a solid and mature institution. As any new organisation we are still facing a number of issues to address, but we can now say that, having managed successfully our first resolution, we are up and running.Over the next years and beyond, the SRB will continue to set the conditions for ensuring an orderly resolution of failing banks with minimum impact on the real economy, the financial system and public finances. This is our mission and it is in every sense a multi-year project given its many angles and complexities.Concretely, by the latest by 2020, the SRB will have developed complete resolution plans for all its banking groups, plans with the highest degree of sophistication under our framework. The SRB envisages intermediate stages for resolution plans which will be gradually refined until they reach this ultimate stage. Let me be clear that we already have plans for the vast majority of our banks \u2013 it is now about enhancing and enriching them with more detail. We must tackle for example possible impediments in more detail, and like elsewhere in life \u2013 a plan is only as good as far as it is able to accommodate an unknown reality. Plans are forward-looking, but inevitably need to be adapted to the circumstances of each concrete situation if and when they need to be turned into a resolution scheme.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Over the coming cycles and by the latest in 2020, our resolution plans will comprise binding targets for minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) at consolidated and solo level and \u2013 another important aspect \u2013 they will reflect our findings about the removal of impediments to resolution.For banking groups with a resolution college, the plans for 2017 will comprise binding MREL targets at consolidated level as well as an initial discussion of MREL targets at individual level. For banks without a resolution college, we will determine MREL targets at consolidated level for most of them. We held extensive workshops / hearings with the individual banks and have proactively communicated our general approach to the market, through two industry dialogues in 2017.The SRB has taken a proportionate, multi-year approach to MREL setting, and will continue to enhance its MREL policy in 2018, in line with the rules set out in the SRMR and the Commission\u2019s Delegated Regulation on MREL. We are completely transparent in our approach to setting MREL, following the legal framework and providing relevant information to the industry and the general public.In 2018, for those banks for which binding targets have already been set at consolidated level, the SRB will determine targets at individual level. For other banks, we will set binding MREL targets at consolidated level. The approach being taken ensures that banks are able to manage the transition to meeting MREL requirements without significant impact on financial stability or the real economy.When the resolution framework was designed, there was a general consensus to rule out a repetition of what happened in the financial crisis: using taxpayers\u2019 money to rescue banks due to lack of better options. Therefore the BRRD and SRMR were designed as an appropriate way to allocate the costs of failure. The resolution framework provides for the general principle - in resolution and insolvency - that shareholders bear losses first and creditors should bear losses after shareholders, in the order of their priority. This general principle is based on the principle of acknowledgement of risk in the purchase of such instruments, namely shares and debt instruments.It is important that we acknowledge that credible and sufficient MREL is part of the cor cordium, the very heart of what we have been trying to achieve since the financial crisis of 2008. We can choose to make a future crisis less likely OR to keep the level of bail-in-able capital at banks low. Both are not possible at the same time. And the developments in the banks vindicate our approach: even without having taken any formal MREL decision so far, Banking Union banks issued significantly more Additional Tier 1, Tier 2 and Senior Unsecured bonds in the first half of 2017 (around 86 bn EUR) than in the second half of 2016 (around 32.5 bn EUR).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The SRB will advance its common resolution policies and standards in key areas throughout 2018. We will for example develop policies on internal MREL, MREL calibration under transfer strategies, and liquidity in resolution. A policy on identifying and addressing substantive impediments to resolvability is also in the pipeline and, next year, we will conduct an identification of such impediments in parallel to our work on policy development. Further guidance will have to be developed on the use of the different resolution tools and on the assessment of public interest in resolution. More can be found in the just published Multi Annual Programming document.Carrying out resolution action requires a master plan for varying scenarios. We just had our first case last June, when, following the ECB\u2019s assessment that Banco Popular is failing or likely to fail, the SRB, together with Spanish National Resolution authority, unanimously decided to take resolution action with regard to Banco Popular. This decision was then endorsed by the European Commission. The SRB will, together with the European Commission and the ECB, take account of the lessons learned from this experience.However, whatever crisis model the best experts may elaborate \u2013 and it is indispensable to do so \u2013 the reality will always be different and in any case, the SRB will be ready to act with skill and flexibility. When it comes to resolving failing banks, there is no second chance!Take the case of Banco Popular as an example. Of course the resolution strategy foreseen in the resolution plan cannot assume the availability of a potential buyer for the entire bank, but if, as was the case here, this is the most effective solution for the preservation of financial stability and indeed the protection of investors then we must do our utmost to enable such a favourable outcome. Deviation from the plan must always be considered if it delivers a better outcome.Resolution inevitably results in losses for equity holders and potentially bondholders. It is, as we can see now, also a feast for lawyers, who challenge not only the actions of the EU and national authorities involved in the adoption of such decision but also the legality of the EU resolution framework as a whole.Let me now briefly turn from our operational objectives to the regulatory framework that is guiding our daily work. As you will be aware, the BRRD and the SRMR are currently undergoing a thorough review and will see some crucial changes in the next years \u2013 changes that you will decide on.Indeed, bank resolution is still a rather novel concept and it can be useful to amend the applicable rules, taking account of the experience and insight gained as long as it does not lead to a regulatory backslide.Given this, the SRB and other resolution authorities are advancing our work based on the current standards like on MREL, while being mindful about the potential changes to come.Regarding the risk reduction proposals launched by the European Commission in 2016, we welcome the political decision to fasten the introduction of a common and comprehensive creditor hierarchy. This will create a level-playing field and provide legal certainty across the European Union.In this spirit, we also look forward to a decision on the other parts of the risk reduction package as it is of such importance for our mandate and work. We hope it will reinforce the resolution framework and provide clarity for the years to come.Let me just recall that implementing the Common Backstop for the Single Resolution Fund is of course important, and to that end we are supporting the efforts of Member States to put in place an effective common backstop. And last but definitely not least, the completion of the Banking Union requires it also to address the third pillar, EDIS. More broadly, I would also remind Member states of the needed work to address legacy issues and enhance their legal framework, in particular their insolvency laws.As the Chair of the SRB, I view it as critically important to consolidate the work already done in resolution planning, and to further deepen our analysis \u2013 both on resolution planning and policy development.To sum up, a huge amount of work had been done within a short period of time, and yet much work remains still ahead of us before we can declare \u201cmission accomplished\u201d.I look forward to continuing this work together with the SRB Board Members and the dedicated SRB staff and to strengthening our contributions, in collaboration with our national and international partners and, of course, with the European Parliament and the other European Institutions.Thank you very much for your attention!", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/444"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0129", "date": "2018-11-12", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Single Resolution Board publishes first Multi-Annual Programming document, including its Work Programme 2018", "text": "\u00a0Brussels \u2013 4 December 2017Today, the Single Resolution Board (SRB) publishes its first multi-annual programming document, including its Work Programme 2018.

The SRB\u2019s focus is on making banks easier to resolve, counting on and fostering a strong cooperation with all its stakeholders. Since the financial crisis much has happened: banks are stronger, safer and less leveraged today. But more progress still remains to be made by banks, enhancing their preparedness for resolution, and by the authorities developing and enhancing Resolution Plans, setting minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) and more generally addressing barriers to resolution. This work will require seamless cooperation across all stakeholders.\u00a0\u201cThe Single Resolution Board, together with the National Resolution Authorities of the Banking Union, focuses on resolution planning and preparation with a forward-looking mindset to avoid the potential negative impact of a bank failure on the economy and on financial stability. 2017 has seen the first experience with the resolution framework.

The new framework designed in response to the crisis has been put into practice at a rapid speed. Under this framework, the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) is responsible for minimising the probability of a crisis ex-ante, while the SRB strives to limit the damage to the public should a failure be inevitable in spite of increased prudential measures.The successful resolution of Banco Popular, the precautionary recapitalisation of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) and the liquidation of two smaller regional banks in Italy occurred almost exactly five years after the first proposal for the Banking Union in June 2012.\u00a0The solutions found for these cases varied substantially and this provides the opportunity and necessity to take stock of the crisis framework and to draw lessons to be learned.The resolution of Banco Popular proved the new system effective, whereas the outcomes for the three Italian banks highlighted the need for further harmonisation, in particular concerning the regulation\u2019s objective of breaking the link between public finances and bank losses.\u00a0In the case of Banco Popular the SRB used the \u201csale-of-business-tool\u201cand decided upon resolution within the framework of the BRRD and SRM-R. \u201cPrecautionary Recapitalisation\u201d, the route chosen for MPS, is an option for governments to aid troubled, yet solvent, banks explicitly foreseen in the regulation. It is the exception \u2013 under tight constraints \u2013 to the rule that state aid will lead to determining a bank \u201cfailing or likely to fail\u201d. Similarly, the liquidation of the two smaller banks under national insolvency law is the legal consequence of the SRB determining that there was no public interest in resolution. But it also shows that the public can still be exposed to the costs of bank failure at the decision of a MS.In this context, it has to be considered that the Commission\u2019s Banking Communication from 2013 needs to be reviewed against the progress made in the resolution framework. In addition, harmonising national insolvency laws would be needed to achieve a level playing field.The SRB will focus on making banks resolvable through resolution planning, including setting an adequate level of MREL. This will enhance the chances for private solutions and, in case of failure, minimise taxpayers' exposures.The resolution of Banco Popular vividly illustrated the importance of funding in resolution. Eventually, the bank\u2019s liquidity issue was resolved by selling the entity to a buyer that had the means and willingness to provide the needed funding. To prepare for a return to markets shortly after resolution and in absence of a strong buyer, the work on identifying private and public sources of funding, including the capabilities and limits of the SRF, the Central Banks and MS will be of priority. Other important operational aspects that we were confronted with \u2013 from data availability to peculiarities of the national law \u2013 will be taken into account in the next resolution planning cycle as well.The cases highlighted also another critical detail: Although the decisions differed, the four banks shared a common denominator that added to their precarious situations. All banks saw themselves confronted with the same legacy issue. Ten years after the start of the crisis some EU banks still suffer under the weight of NPLs. While the forecasted economic upturn in Europe will certainly contribute to the improvement of balance sheets, authorities must find ways to swiftly address this issue, remembering that seemingly similar exposures may in practice be very different, depending on the underlying and the different legal frameworks in MS that affect recovery values.We should all be realistic: By definition, losses will emerge in the management of NPLs and portfolios cannot be whitewashed. Increased transparency and the development of a frictionless secondary market would mark steps in the correct direction. There is no time to lose.\u00a0Elke K\u00f6nig, Chair of the Single Resolution BoardRead the article on Eurofi's websiteMREL \u2013 The way ahead\u00a0Adequate levels of MREL are crucial to ensure the resolvability of banks. They contribute not only to the resolvability of individual banks, but also to financial stability as a whole and are a key instrument to replace bail-outs with bail-ins and safeguard taxpayers\u2019 money. The SRB is making good progress in refining its MREL policy and developing MREL targets for the banks under its remit.MREL targets are individually tailored to each bank, and the SRB has taken a number of measures to inform banks about the MREL process. In 2016, the SRB organised numerous workshops with banks, including discussion of informative (non-binding) MREL targets. We also published a document setting out the approach taken to MREL in 2016 and the way forward, and more is planned and already communicated for 2017.The SRB aims to strike the right balance between flexibility and hard requirements in setting MREL. Banks differ in their business model, operational structure, risk profile and other factors. These specificities are taken into account by the SRB when drawing up resolution plans. Rather than a \u201cone-size-fits-all solution\u201d, final MREL levels as part of the resolution plan will be a function of each institution\u2019s resolvability assessment, and will be designed to support implementing the specific resolution strategy, if need be.MREL requirements are set on the basis of the current legal framework. In 2017, the SRB has started to develop binding targets for major banking groups, which resolution colleges will discuss in the fourth quarter. The SRB aims to develop MREL requirements for these groups in late 2017/early 2018. MREL of not less than 8% - but on a case by case basis possibly well above \u2013 will generally be required for the largest banks. In case of a resolution the Single Resolution Fund requires a minimum level of burden sharing and if a bank enters resolution it is important that there are enough bail-inable liabilities to attain the required level of burden sharing.Our policy decisions will be in line with the applicable legislation and, in this context, we of course carefully monitor the developments on the Commission\u2019s proposed banking package from November 2016. Among other changes, the Commission has proposed to implement the TLAC standard as a Pillar 1 requirement for G-SIBs. It is important to keep in mind the differences between TLAC and MREL: TLAC sets minimum requirements for G-SIBs, while MREL is a broader concept that applies to all banks. As mentioned, MREL requirements are set on a bank-specific basis and also potentially provide for a wider set of eligible liabilities (TLAC-eligible instruments must be unsecured and subordinated, with few exceptions). It has to be noted that G-SIBs and other systemic institutions compete in the same markets and might have similar systemic footprints; therefore a level playing field needs to be ensured and cliff effects avoided. The SRB therefore favoured a Pillar 1 requirement for both. Moreover, the SRB urges finalisation of the reform of the creditor hierarchy and eligibility criteria. It is also critically important for the final proposal to maintain flexibility for the resolution authority to take timely action to address breaches of MREL where necessary and to make sure that only liabilities that can really be bailed-in count towards MREL.Overall, MREL implementation is a multi year process that is proceeding well in spite of the regulatory uncertainty. The next years will be crucial for developing binding MREL targets and ensuring that they are met.Elke K\u00f6nig, Chair of the Single Resolution Board\u00a0Read the article on Eurofi's website", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/374"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0134", "date": "2017-09-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Single Resolution Board announces change in the composition of its Board", "text": "Brussels \u2013 22 August 2017The Single Resolution Board (SRB) announces the decision of Ms Joanne Kellermann, Board Member and Director of Resolution Planning and Decisions, to leave the SRB.Ms Joanne Kellermann, Board Member and Director of Resolution Planning and Decisions, who joined the SRB since its very beginning in March 2015, has notified the Chair of the SRB, Ms Elke K\u00f6nig, and the European Commission, of her intention to leave her Board Member position once a successor has been appointed.\u201cThe SRB has achieved a lot in over 2 years since its inception.

In exceptional circumstances, where an eligible liability or class of liabilities is excluded or partially excluded from bail-in, a contribution from the SRF may be made to the institution under resolution under two key conditions, namely:Bail-in of at least 8%: a contribution to loss absorption and recapitalisation totalling not less than 8% of the total liabilities including own funds of the institution under resolution has already been made by shareholders, the holders of relevant capital instruments and other eligible liabilities through write-down, conversion or otherwiseContribution from the SRF of maximum 5%: the SRF contribution does not exceed 5% of the total liabilities including own funds of the institution under resolution.More information:Read more information about the Single Resolution FundBANK RECOVERY AND RESOLUTION DIRECTIVE (BRRD) 2014/59/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 15 May 2014 establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firmsSINGLE RESOLUTION MECHANISM REGULATION (SRMR) (EU) No 806/2014 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 15 July 2014 establishing uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit institutions and certain investment firms in the framework of a Single Resolution Mechanism and a Single Resolution FundEuropean Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/63 and Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/81.About the Single Resolution Board The Single Resolution Board (SRB) is the central resolution authority within the Banking Union (BU). Together with the NRAs of participating Member States it forms the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). The SRB works closely with the European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB), the European Banking Authority (EBA) and national competent authorities (NCAs). Its mission is to ensure an orderly resolution of failing banks with minimum impact on the real economy and public finances of the participating Member States and beyond.Media Contact details: Camille De Rede - Communication Officer\u00a0E-mail: Camille.De-Rede@srb.europa.euPhone number: +32 2 490 3530Switchboard: +32 2 490 3000Mobile phone: +32 460 766 704\u00a0Maria Hormaeche - Seconded National ExpertE-mail: Maria.HORMAECHE-LAZCANO@srb.europa.euPhone number: +32 2 490 3702Mobile phone: +32 477 028 702\u00a0Website: https://srb.europa.euTwitter: @EU_SRB", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/362"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0136", "date": "2018-07-30", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ECON Public Hearing on 2016 SRB Annual Report - Elke K\u00f6nig, SRB Chair", "text": "[CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY]\u00a0Mr Chairman,Honourable Members of Parliament,It is a pleasure for me to speak to you today and present the Annual Report of the Single Resolution Board (SRB) for 2016.Enhancing the resolution readiness for approximately 140 banks under our remit was in 2016 and still is our key responsibility. It cannot be achieved in one year, but with the support of the National Resolution Authorities the SRB drafted and adopted 92 resolution plans in 2016, thereby covering the majority of banking groups in the Banking Union.Effective resolution planning depends on up-to date data from banks, in particular regarding the bank\u2019s liability structure. In 2016, the SRB collected relevant data from all major banking groups by using a specific Liability Data Template. The granular data collected is supporting our determination of the minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (\u201cMREL\u201d) and for making the bail-in resolution tool operational.In 2016, the SRB adopted a preliminary approach on MREL, taking into account \u2013 among other factors \u2013 that the European regulation for MREL is still evolving. I am of course referring to the Commission\u2019s legislative proposal to integrate the international Total Loss Absorbance Capacity Standard of the FSB into the BRRD and to create a Two Pillar MREL system distinguishing between G-SIBs and other banks, among a number of other proposed changes to the BRRD.A word of caution in this regard. MREL needs to be built up and banks and markets require clarity on the legal framework, particularly when it comes to eligibility and hierarchy of instruments. There is no reason to \u201cwait and see\u201d, the earlier banks can start building up MREL the less likely tax-payer funded bail-outs become.We therefore calculated informative and non-binding MREL target levels in 2016 for the major banking groups. We communicate intensely and constructively with banks on this and other resolvability topics and try wherever possible to adapt a gradual approach. This will enable banks to prepare and adjust.Of course our work on resolution planning is not limited to MREL, work on the identification of critical functions, access to FMIs, IT systems etc. are all being worked on by our staff.Our cooperation with the NRAs is crucial and the joint development of horizontal policies and best practices within the SRM is progressing well.\u00a0Let me now turn to our progress within the Single Resolution Fund, the \u201cSRF\u201d. Since last year, the SRB has been responsible for the calculation of ex-ante contributions and I am pleased to report that the funds held by the SRF currently amount to approx. to EUR\u00a017.4\u00a0billion. In addition we have LFAs with all Member States in place and are supporting the efforts of Member States to put in place an effective common backstop.Looking at 2017 and beyond, our work in all the areas I have just mentioned is evidently going on and deepening:We are focusing on the operationalization of resolution plans. To ensure they will work in reality, we are conducting more analytical work on the preferred resolution strategy and tools, on critical functions and material impediments to resolvability.Preparing for effective cross-border resolution is another ongoing priority. We will continue our exercises, be they dry runs in the Banking Union, table-top discussions with non-Banking Union Member State authorities or our international work in the context of trilateral exercises with the US and UK.In 2017, our objective is to start developing binding MREL targets at consolidated level for all major banking groups and to address the quality of MREL within a group. We will base any policy decision on the legislation in force while we are closely following the negotiations in respect of the EC\u2019s legislative package.And of course, our work will take into account our most recent experiences with resolution cases. As you are aware, on June 7 the SRB adopted its first resolution decision, triggering the sale of Banco Popular to Banco Santander for the price of EUR 1. The Spanish Executive Resolution Authority FROB is responsible for the implementation of the resolution scheme.\u00a0This text-book like resolution case benefited greatly from the close cooperation of both European and national authorities, the commitment of the bank itself and the ongoing private sale process which the SRB could build on in our resolution role.The situation of the two small Italian banks in the Veneto region which were declared failing or likely to fail (FOLTF) on the 23rd June by the ECB was different.The deterioration of the banks over the last two years meant that they have shrunk significantly in terms of size and interconnectedness, and at the same time their only remaining critical function \u2013 taking deposits \u2013 was also available from almost 30 other banks in the region. The SRB therefore concluded that resolution action was not warranted in the public interest for these banks individually, but also taken together and that they could instead enter into the normal Italian insolvency proceedings without measurable risks to financial markets or the real economy. The Italian authorities then decided about the future course of action.Last week (4 July), the European Commission authorised the precautionary recapitalisation of Monte dei Paschi di Siena \u2013 the first time after the BRRD entered into force. A rule explicitly foreseen in the BRRD; which the co-legislators may reconsider during the upcoming BRRD review of next year.\u00a0While the first resolution decision \u2013 Banco Popular \u2013 has proven the effectiveness of the EU resolution framework, we also identified some areas for improvement and gained valuable experience that will influence our work and that might also have policy implications. We are still analysing the cases in detail but some takeaways are already evident at this stage:There are strong advantages to a Moratorium Tool covering all liabilities to buy time if need be or to take us to the weekend in case a bank is declared FOLTF by the SSM mid-week again.Ad-hoc availability of liability data is crucial to obtain a full picture of the situation and to allow the resolution authority to take appropriate action. This will be a collective undertaking: While the SRB needs to determine data requirements, banks need to invest significantly and build the relevant IT infrastructure to provide this kind of data at the push of a button in times of crisis.As supported by the case of Banco Popular, the question of \u201cfunding or liquidity in resolution\u201d remains. Here, we will need to explore possible solutions with, in particular, the ECB and national central banks. There might not always be a strong buyer and open bank bail-in is only viable with liquidity support.Cross-border co-operation with third countries is of vital importance; even in this mainly European case we worked with the US authorities effectively to ensure that the resolution was smooth. For firms with more cross-border links, this co-operation will be all the more important.Last but most certainly not least, we need to ensure that incentives are set correctly. The Commission\u2019s 2013 banking communication should be reviewed and checked against the progress made in the implementation of the new resolution framework \u2013 it is July 2017!\u00a0Let me conclude by saying that while a lot of work still needs to be done to strengthen resolution readiness in the Banking Union, the SRB \u2013 in any event \u2013 is prepared to handle a resolution.I now leave the floor to you and any questions you may have and thank you very much for your attention!\u00a0", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/359"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0137", "date": "2017-06-30", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Annual List of Contracts and Order Forms awarded by the SRB", "text": "NULL", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/343"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0138", "date": "2017-12-12", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "The Single Resolution Board adopts resolution decision  for Banco Popular", "text": "\u00a0Brussels \u2013 7 June 2017Today, the Single Resolution Board (SRB) has transferred all shares and capital instruments of Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol S.A.

I will only discuss resolution issues in my comments.The SRB welcomes the European Commission\u2019s revision of MREL and implementation of TLAC, and we\u2019d like to begin by thanking the Commission for their hard work on this file. The European Commission\u2019s proposal will give clarity around how the international TLAC standard will be applied in a European context.On the Commission\u2019s proposed implementation of the international TLAC-standard as Pillar 1 MREL, with additional MREL being a Pillar 2 requirement, it is important that we avoid any cliff effect between G-SIBs and other institutions which are systemic in Europe. We have previously highlighted the importance of treating D-SIBs of equal systemic importance to the Banking Union on a level footing to G-SIBs. In that context we welcome that the package on MREL very clearly sets out the importance of a level playing field between G-SIIs and other comparable institutions with systemic relevance within the Union.We therefore have great sympathy for the EBA recommendation to extend the possibility of mandatory subordination to other systemic institutions with adequate transition periods and more generally we would support a Pillar 1 requirement for other systemic institutions. I believe it would be helpful for the European Parliament to consider this topic, too.It is also important to give or at least maintain the existing flexibility, as well as enforceability, for resolution authorities to tailor the MREL level, quality and location to the resolution strategy and the resolvability of the institution.For G-SIBs, the transition period for Pillar 1 MREL should be set to ensure the EU meets international requirements, i.e. in 2019 and 2022. For Pillar 2 MREL, resolution authorities will need the flexibility to set appropriate transition periods, with an adequate balance to avoid having an endless phase-in period given the risks of a prolonged transition should a bank be put in resolution.On the creditor hierarchy, the SRB welcomes the decision to prioritise this file, and views that rapid progress would provide needed certainty around junior debt issuance. It is important that the proposal is sufficiently robust and no ambiguity be left in the proposal with respect to the treatment of successful national approaches.On the moratorium tool, we view this as sitting at the interface of going- and gone-concern. The scope of the tool is a key consideration; too narrow a scope could make the tool less useful to the authorities and allow for significant liabilities leaving an institution even under a moratorium.In general, the SRB has the preference to maintain the resolution moratorium, and we see the potential difficulties in returning a firm to the market after applying a supervisory moratorium, given it is very likely the firm will enter resolution if a supervisory moratorium is applied. If both moratorium tools are maintained, then it will be essential for the resolution authority and competent authority to co-operate effectively.On stay powers, more generally, we view there as being a benefit to implementing an EU-wide harmonisation of the recognition of stays. The BRRD does not yet require contract language in this regard while banks should be required to include clauses that make their counterparties accept their home resolution regime.Finally, the SRB is also supportive of the Intermediate Parent Undertaking proposal, and we recently prepared a joint position with the ECB.If implemented properly, the Commission\u2019s risk reduction package will make banks even sounder and benefit the economy as a whole, making taxpayers even better protected against bank failures. It is important not to weaken the resolution framework, but instead to take the opportunity provided by the Commission proposal to further strengthen the European frameworkI look forward to any questions you may have.", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/273"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0143", "date": "2017-04-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Eurofi articles: MREL & Fragmentation", "text": "The EU Resolution Framework\u2013 for more reliable and competitive banksElke K\u00f6nig, Chair of the Single Resolution BoardIn the European Union the BRRD and the SRMR provide a solid basis for successful resolution. They provide a broad range of tools and allows resolution authorities to collect the data needed to analyse a bank\u2019s structures and operations, to identify and segregate critical functions, to remove impediments to resolution and to make the owners and creditors of an institution pay for its resolution rather than the taxpayer. Having said that, nothing is so good that it cannot be improved.Triggered by the need to transpose TLAC, which will enter into force in 2019, into the European Resolution Framework, the European Commission has just launched a legislative proposal that will amend the BRRD and the SRMR.While TLAC and MREL have the same purpose, there are important differences in the scope of these instruments. The Commission has therefore proposed to create a two pillar-system. Pillar 1 MREL would implement TLAC by establishing a harmonized minimum standard exclusively for GSIBs with components of mandatory subordination. Pillar 2 MREL, where no mandatory subordination is foreseen, would be determined individually for the remaining banks, similar to what is currently foreseen. For GSIBs, according to the proposal, an additional Pillar 2 MREL could be required by the resolution authorities on top of the Pillar 1 requirement. Our first experiences over the last two years show that sufficient resolution authority discretion is paramount in determining MREL effectively and we hope that the new legal framework once finalised will reflect this. MREL is a key tool to achieve resolvability of banks.From another angle, it could pose difficulties if subordination, as foreseen under Pillar 1 MREL, would only be applicable to GSIBs. Cliff effects may arise, in particular with respect to other systemically important banks that do not qualify as GSIBs but often have similar characteristics and a similar footprint and compete in the same markets.Resolution authorities must be in a position to define bank specific subordination requirements to ensure that instruments are bail-in-able with legal and operational certainty and with sufficient discretion and flexibility.A workable solution to the subordination conundrum will also help to honour the no creditor worth off principle in resolution and ensure a fast and safe bail-in-procedure both in operational and legal terms. The SRB would of course welcome any workable subordination solution, provided it supports a flexible resolution strategy and ensures MREL is of adequate quality.It must be noted that, as the BRRD and SRMR are already applicable law, when we anticipate their revision introducing additional requirements, a feasible mode of transition must be found. Whatever the final MREL targets will be, they should be attained as fast as possible, bearing in mind feasibility. We are, however, mindful of the challenges in individual cases.However, there is no need for any specific changes to the BRRD and the SRMR with the aim of addressing persistent \u201clegacy problems\u201d, a term often cited against the backdrop of current concerns about non-performing loans (NPLs) in certain institutions and markets.Here, efforts to clean up are indeed needed and any European impulse to support this by providing an infrastructure for asset management companies and the like can be helpful.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And in this context, we should recall that the concept of precautionary recapitalisation under the BRRD and the SRMR is not a tool to avoid resolution or liquidation where a bank is failing or likely to fail. It is \u2013 as the name rightly states \u2013 a valid but exceptional measure to restore confidence and remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State with the aim of preserving financial stability. It is meant to be a precautionary and temporary measure, reserved for solvent entities and shall not be used to offset losses that the entity has incurred or \u2013 and this is crucial \u2013 is likely to incur in the near future. It is subject to approval under the Union State aid framework \u2013 which serves as a safeguard against any misinterpretation.Taken as a whole, the BRRD and the SRMR provide for a resolution framework that safeguards financial stability without using taxpayer\u2019s money in case a bank fails.Has fragmentation in the Banking Union reduced and what further work is needed?While fragmentation has undoubtedly decreased from a regulatory perspective since the implementation of the Banking Union, there still remain issues to address. Most of these issues are not rooted in financial regulation but have economic reasons and there is undoubtedly a divergence between Member States in the core and periphery.The BRRD is a significant step towards harmonised crisis management across the EU, but significant work remains to be done, for example on insolvency law harmonisation, on subordination, on ensuring there are effective deposit guarantee schemes across the Banking Union and on EDIS.Regarding the importance of insolvency laws, it should be remembered that when taking a decision to apply resolution tools, the resolution authority needs to carry out a counterfactual insolvency (NCWO) analysis. While the BRRD provides a basic creditor hierarchy current and proposed national laws have set priorities for similar creditors sometimes differently. A common creditor hierarchy across Member States would remove an important source of discrepancies impacting NCWO, make implementation of the resolution process easier, and improve market transparency and pricing of instruments. A clear European-wide solution in this area would be most welcome, and in this context we welcome the intention of the European co-legislators to take this file forward quickly.As regards national discretion within the Banking Union, the SRB will work with national resolution authorities across the Banking Union to ensure that the different authorities also take a harmonised approach on the so-called Less Significant Institutions. It is important that resolution authorities are able to coordinate effectively, and there is not a wide divergence of practices across the Banking Union.Within the Banking Union, it is important to have a robust framework for determining the allocation of MREL within cross-border banking groups within the EU in a way that facilitates the resolution of these banking groups with the aim of preventing contagion in a crisis. An effective system for allocating internal MREL across different subsidiaries should reinforce financial stability within the EU, and align to the resolution strategy for the different banks. Internal TLAC sets the international standards for this area, helping to support international co-operation, and facilitating the resolution of G-SIBs.There will always be differences across Member States. National policymaking on areas that fall within Member State prerogatives will naturally reflect the different preferences of national electorates. But the Banking Union reduces the level of fragmentation by providing for harmonised supervision\u00a0and a harmonised resolution framework. However, a harmonised insolvency framework is still lacking, and while different Member States still have different insolvency systems fragmentation will remain an issue.Read the Eurofi Magazine where both articles have been published\u00a0", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/263"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0144", "date": "2017-05-23", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Ex-ante publicity notice - negotiated procurement procedure (SRB/NEG/18/2017)", "text": "NULL", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/309"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0145", "date": "2018-07-30", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ECON Public Hearing with Mrs Elke K\u00f6nig, Chair of the Single Resolution Board", "text": "\u00a0Read Mrs Elke K\u00f6nig's\u00a0speech on\u00a0Central Counterparty Clearing Houses (CCPs)Read Mrs Elke K\u00f6nig's speech on resolution issuesRead the European Parliament's briefing", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/246"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0146", "date": "2017-03-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Provision of Benchmarks for portfolio Management - Procurement Procedure SRB/NEG/9/2017", "text": "NULL", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/241"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0147", "date": "2017-02-17", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "MREL : Approach taken in 2016 and next steps", "text": "ContextThe Single Resolution Board (SRB) is the resolution authority for participating Member States within the Banking Union (BU).

Put together, the variety of new rules and regulations since 2008 form a common set of rules for all the banks within the EU, setting out enhanced prudential rules for banks, harmonised and better depositor protection, and providing for the resolution of failing banks, just to mention some key changes. In this new regulatory architecture, the Single Resolution Board, the SRB, is the resolution authority in the Banking Union and one of the pillars of the Banking Union.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bank bashing is popular today, but banks are a necessary part of the economy. Banks improve our economies. They intermediate funds between those with excess savings to those demanding them. However, in this process discrepancies arise between the resources they have (assets) compared to the commitments they acquire (liabilities).Quantitatively, if a bank is solvent, the value of its commitments in euros matches the value of its resources in euros. However, commitments made by a bank generally do not match qualitatively one-to-one to the resources it has available. In the process they are creating money and capital, and they are like a financial \u201cpower plant\u201d for society. This is also why financial regulation is needed.So far so good\u2026in \u2018normal\u2019 times.However, what happens in crisis times? Why do we say that a bank \u201cfails\u201d? EU legislation specifically defines what a bank failure is. A working definition, for the purposes of this speech, is that a bank fails when mismatches between its assets and liabilities are such that it can no longer honour its commitments; it will not meet the requirements for ongoing authorisation; and any private measures to return to a sound and solvent balance sheet are not, or are no longer available. It\u2019s that simple.If a bank fails this is not a failure of the system. Banks should be able to fail; the exit of firms in a market system is a natural part of the system. Let me be absolutely clear, financial regulation is not there to avoid any failure of financial institutions. But if an institution fails this should both be manageable and well managed. History proves: bank failures do not have to be threats to financial stability.But clearly the turmoil of the last financial crisis highlighted the limitations of the regulatory framework to handle a bank failure. During this crisis, the size, the complexity and interconnectedness of the banks, the financial situation of the markets and the necessity to react quickly forced the public authorities to inject huge amounts of public money in their banking system.Since the crisis, supervision has been strengthened and aligned, capital requirements raised, a whole new resolution regime introduced. Central-Counterparty clearing has been put in place: derivatives are now cleared on transparent platforms to avoid widespread contagion. We are not only better prepared for a bank failure, but much more importantly, we can also confidently say that the failure of most banks today would probably not entail a threat to financial stability. We are working hard to be confident to say this applies to for all banks, including international firms.This cannot be stressed enough. Most banks are now in such a shape that we can say with confidence that their failure would not endanger financial stability and that they can be resolved if they fail - like any other business in the market economy \u2013 through regular insolvency procedures. Indeed, here in Belgium there was the recent Optima Bank case. The bank was liquidated without needing public support or causing financial stability concerns. The same holds true for other Member States.The extra safety net of resolution is only for the few, not the many.But let us now look at the rules on resolution, and how these came clearly after the 2008 financial crisis.The financial crisis demonstrated the need for better regulation and supervision of the EU financial sector, both outside and in the euro area. Rescuing ailing banks with public money shifted the burden of the failures and of the losses to the taxpayers, triggering tensions on the sovereign bond markets and more specifically, challenging the coherence and the robustness of the euro area. It stressed the need to set a new institutional and legislative framework to deal with failing banks by cutting the link between the banks and the States.In 2011, the Financial Stability Board set out its \u201cKey Attributes\u201d to handle bank failure and set the basis of a new framework to resolve financial institutions in an orderly manner without taxpayer\u2019s exposure to losses while maintaining continuity of their vital economic functions. Two pieces of legislation were designed by the European institutions to incorporate the international principles in European law and build a single mechanism to manage bank failures at the level of the Banking Union:\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, the BRRD, set the new legislative framework to handle a bank crisis either in going concern (a recovery action) or in gone concern (a resolution action).\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation, the SRMR, set up the specific institutional framework for resolution action at the Banking Union level.The SRB, as I have said in my introduction, is one of the pillars of the Banking Union, next to the Single Supervisory Mechanism, in the European Central Bank.We, together with the National Resolution Authorities (the NRAs), form the SRM. The role of the SRM is not limited to acting in case of a bank failure. Its objective is to anticipate possible difficulties in handling a bank failure, and to restore the viability of the bank after a resolution action to maintain the critical functions. The SRM is primarily focused on preventive and preparatory measures through drawing up resolution plans.The BRRD gave new powers to resolution authorities, in particular the bail-in tool. This tool allows the absorption of the losses beyond the own funds through the write-down of certain liabilities in order to stabilise or restructure a bank and rather than just winding it down or sending it into insolvency. Once the losses are absorbed, the bank\u2019s capital could be reconstituted by the conversion of all or part of the remaining eligible liabilities into equity.All these measures mean that the European financial system is more resilient to economic shocks and EU citizens are better protected.Since 2008/9 a lot of real change has happened as a result of these reforms\u2026 banks are stronger, safer, less leveraged today.The establishment of the Banking Union was deemed the best way to address one of the key challenges in Europe: weakness and mistrust in the banking sector. And I firmly believe that creating the Banking Union was a step in the right direction. Now we need to complete it. Like when rowing upstream on a river, letting up now would mean moving backwards.The SRB is the resolution authority for the significant and cross border banking groups established in participating Member States. In the context of the SRM, it works in close cooperation with the NRAs. Within the Banking Union, the SRB cooperates, with the European Central Bank, the European Commission, as well as other European and international institutions. Its mission is to ensure an orderly resolution of failing banks with minimum impact on the real economy and on public finances of the participating Member States and beyond.The SRB is continually coordinating effectively with other resolution authorities, both within the EU and globally, and will act to ensure that G-SIBs, and other international banks, operating in the Banking Union can fail without major systemic consequences. For participating Member States, a centralised power of resolution is entrusted to the SRB, with resolution schemes executed by its partners, the NRAs.In just two years after our set-up - following the newly implemented rules such as the BRRD and the SRMR - we at the SRB have truly come a long way. The full set of rules under the BRRD became effective in January 2016, giving resolution authorities the needed toolkit. \u00a0By the end of 2016, we had developed around 65 Resolution Plans and around 30 so-called Transitional Resolution Plans \u2013 which include a less detailed analysis - for banks, meaning that these plans were prepared, both internally and in resolution colleges, and are now in the final process of being approved. This was a huge step forward, but this is does not yet mean \u201cmission accomplished\u201d.I have stated numerous times, the SRB\u2019s work is forward-looking: thanks to our planning, banks will be resolved without having significant adverse impact on financial stability. The SRB\u2019s work will not just end bail-outs, but also incentivise private sector creditors to find a solution without use of public funds. This is clearly starting to happen. In the UK, which is subject to the BRRD, the Co-operative Bank restructured its balance sheet in the market, rather than using public sector support. Other cases could also be cited, including the Atlante initiative.Setting Minimum Requirement for own funds and Eligible Liabilities or MREL, is an integral part of the SRB\u2019s work on resolution planning. MREL is the SRB\u2019s key tool to achieve resolvability of banks. Only by setting an adequate MREL we can ensure that banks will have sufficient loss-absorbing capacity at the point of resolution to enable resolution authorities to effectively protect critical economic functions without use of taxpayers\u2019 money.In 2016, we made progress on enhancing resolvability by identifying barriers to resolution and by starting to provide guidance on ways to remove them, as well as starting to develop guidance on MREL.There is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d. MREL is a bank-by-bank decision and the SRB follows the methodology spelled out in the recently adopted Delegated Act. Let me stress the importance of the resolution authority being able to apply sufficient discretion and judgement when determining MREL.MREL of not less than 8% of total liabilities - but on a case-by-case basis possibly well above \u2013 will generally be required for the largest banks in the Banking Union. In case of a resolution the Single Resolution Fund requires a minimum level of burden sharing and none of us wants to be in a position of realising when entering into a resolution that there are simply not enough bail-inable liabilities left to attain the required level of burden sharing.The main take-away from the SRB\u2019s work on MREL so far is clearly that, as of today, following detailed analysis based on a sample of banks, the Euro area banks show a significant, though manageable, shortfall. It will be by no means as high as some experts have estimated. The \u201c8%\u201d \u2013 considered as a benchmark - would be a real issue for less than a handful of banks. In most cases, the application of the delegated act would get you to higher requirements based on the underlying capital requirements.We are aware of the challenges related to meeting the MREL targets in certain markets and for certain banks and we will take them into account, in particular when determining the timing for implementing MREL. Setting MREL and implementing Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) in the EU must lead to a stronger, more credible resolution regime; it is not the time to weaken the MREL framework.The SRB will continue to refine its policies on consolidated MREL targets in 2017 and will start developing MREL at entity level within banking groups in the SRB\u2019s remit. At the same time we will also start to address the quality and location of MREL within banking groups.We are also currently analysing the European Commission\u2019s proposal on the implementation of the TLAC international standard into EU legislation. Until that proposal is finalised and passed into law, the current legislative framework stands and we will implement the key features of TLAC in our coming binding MREL targets. And let me reiterate that this is possible in the current legal framework.One of our Board Members keeps saying that setting MREL is a journey or a process, not a product \u2013 and he is entirely right. This holds true for resolution planning in general.\u00a0 Sufficient loss-absorbing capacity - that is all MREL is meant to be - is central to changing the answer to the \u201cwho pays?\u201d question from taxpayers \u2026. to shareholders and creditors.Going forward, bail-in rather than bail-out will be the rule of the game.However, beyond MREL setting and the implementation of the bail-in tool, the resolution authorities will have to work on other aspects of resolution planning. Resolution planning is not limited to the assessment of loss absorbing capacity.The resolution authorities will also have to take care of the operational continuity of critical services after the resolution. The banks\u2019 capacity to raise funding, the access to financial market infrastructures or the mere restoration of the market confidence in the resolved banks are also key elements to take into consideration. And these topics are definitely on the SRB\u2019s agenda for this year.On top of resolution tools, as last resort, the SRB also has financial resources available, the Single Resolution Fund or SRF. The SRF is financed from ex-ante contributions paid annually by all banks and some investment firms established in the 19 Member States that have adopted the Euro as currency. The SRB is responsible for calculating these ex-ante contributions in accordance with legislation ensuring harmonised rules; they are collected by the NRAs.The SRF is being built up during eight years starting from last year: it is going to represent at least 1% of Euro area banks\u2019 covered deposits, which, of course, are a fraction of total liabilities.But keep in mind: it can only be accessed after at least 8% of total liabilities of a failing bank have been bailed-in. We have collected so far a little over 10 billion euros to the SRF, with the next annual contribution due on the first of July.A lot has been achieved up to now, and the SRB\u2019s focus on addressing \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d will remain unchanged for 2017. Sound resolution planning and resolution readiness, as well as an efficient management of the SRF, remain key priorities.We have to make progress on developing bank specific preferred resolution strategies; we need to operationalise the identified strategies and ways forward for banks.In addition, the oversight function of the SRB over Less Significant Institutions (LSIs) will also gradually be developed.The regulatory framework is still developing and the SRB will \u2013 just like in the past - contribute to all policy and legislative initiatives that can potentially impact on its activities. More concretely, the SRB will: (i) contribute to the revision of the BRRD and SRMR, (ii) contribute to the transposition of TLAC into EU legislation, (iii) provide expertise in the European Deposit Insurance Scheme discussion and (iv) contribute to the development of a resolution framework for financial market infrastructures \u2013 just to mention the most important topics.Since the crisis a vast amount of work has gone into ensuring that banks are no longer too big to fail. And a lot has been achieved. We have a realistic chance to make bail outs a thing of the past. Through effective planning and resolution work, we can make sure that we continue to strengthen the Banking Union and contribute to financial stability.A well-developed and fully functioning Banking Union with operational resolution tools such as bail-in will ensure the overall stability of the financial system in the euro area and will help rebuild confidence in banks, with a positive impact on the real economy and citizens\u2019 welfare.Thank you for your attention.\u00a0*\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/193"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0156", "date": "2016-11-28", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Single Resolution Board publishes 2017 Work Programme", "text": "Brussels \u2013 28 November 2016Today, the Single Resolution Board (SRB) publishes its 2017 Work Programme. This Work Programme sets out the strategic goals and objectives of the SRB and of the Single Resolution Mechanism as a whole. Its key focus is on resolution planning and resolution readiness and on ensuring that the significant and cross-border banks of the Euro area are resolvable with minimum impact on the real economy and on the public finances of the participating Member States. In addition, the SRB, as the manager of the Single Resolution Fund (SRF), will invest and administer the fund soundly and securely. A lot has been achieved in the Single Resolution Mechanism\u2019s first full year, and\u00a0the SRB\u2019s focus on addressing \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d is unchanged. Sound resolution planning and resolution readiness, as well as an efficient management of the SRF, remain key priorities.\u00a0\u201dResolution readiness, as well as SRF operations, require a sound framework for the SRB to be an effective authority. In 2017, the SRB will therefore continue to foster the cooperation with its main partners. The SRB is committed to carrying out its mission as outlined in the Work Programme 2017 in the interest of a safer and sounder financial market\u201d, said Elke K\u00f6nig, Chair of the Single Resolution Board.In 2017, the SRB will focus on four main operational areas:Resolution readiness by sound resolution planningThe Single Resolution Fund Policy and cooperationSRB resources in human resources, finance, procurement and information technologyStrengthening resolution readiness is a key operational area for the SRB in 2017, when it will focus on achieving further progress in completing resolution plans for major banking groups. The focus will be on operationalising resolution strategies for these banking groups, bail-in execution and identifying obstacles to resolvability, and of course, further work on Minimum Requirements for own funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL).Based on the experience gathered to date, the SRB will update its existing internal documentation as well as policies and procedures. This includes the further development of documentation regarding the process and procedure for any resolution action, as well as the updating of the Resolution Planning Manual and the Crisis Management Manual in light of the experience gained in resolution planning. In order to promote a level playing field for resolution plans across the banking union, the SRB will also conduct horizontal benchmarking exercises.The credibility of resolution actions is also determined by the SRF and its ability to support resolution actions financially, if necessary. The main priorities in 2017 relating to the SRF will be development of the contribution mechanism, development and implementation of the investment policy and continuation of work with respect to funding options. As an ongoing activity, the SRF will ensure the timely collection of SRM contributions.Resolution readiness and SRF operations require a strong resolution framework for the SRB to be an effective authority. In 2017, the SRB will therefore continue to foster cooperation with its main partners, i.e. the National Resolution Authorities (NRAs), the EU institutions and non-EU countries\u2019 authorities, as well as the relevant international bodies and fora. The oversight function of the SRB over Less Significant Institutions (LSIs) will gradually be developed. In addition, the SRB will continue to contribute to all policy and legislative initiatives that can potentially impact on its activities. More concretely, the SRB will: (i) contribute to the revision of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and SRMR, (ii) contribute to the transposition of total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) into EU legislation, (iii) provide input in the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) discussion and (iv) contribute to the development of a resolution framework for financial market infrastructures (FMIs).The SRB requires adequate resources to secure the successful execution of the Work Programme 2017. To achieve its priorities and to ensure the smooth running of its operations, the SRB will continue to grow in 2017.Download the SRB Work Programme 2017 \u00a0 cover.jpg \u00a0More information:BANK RECOVERY AND RESOLUTION DIRECTIVE (BRRD) 2014/59/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 15 May 2014 establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firmsSINGLE RESOLUTION MECHANISM REGULATION (SRMR) (EU) No 806/2014 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 15 July 2014 establishing uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit institutions and certain investment firms in the framework of a Single Resolution Mechanism and a Single Resolution FundAbout the Single Resolution Board The Single Resolution Board (SRB) is the resolution authority within the Banking Union (BU) and, as part of the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), is at its centre.

This requires the SRB to set MREL targets for these banks in 2016. In order to achieve this goal and to better analyse the liability structure of banks in 2016, the SRB publishes its Liability Data Template (and accompanying guidance), through which banks will provide the necessary data to the SRB. This data request was previously announced at the SRB's Second Industry Dialogue meeting.The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) establishes new concepts and categories of liabilities, which do not correspond to those currently in use in the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). The SRB acknowledges the administrative challenge this poses for banks. The SRB has therefore adopted a gradual approach to the collection of data in the Liability Data Template. Mandatory data requests have been kept to the minimum required by the BRRD, while other data are only to be provided on a priority or best efforts basis in 2016.QueriesThe SRB anticipates that banks will have queries in respect of the Liability Data Template.
