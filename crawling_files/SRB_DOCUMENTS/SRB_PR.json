The decision has been published today on the SRB's website, while a summary of the decision will also be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.\u201cThis decision now closes the process of analysing whether insolvency would have meant a better outcome for affected shareholders and creditors of BPE,\u201d said SRB Chair, Elke K\u00f6nig. \u201cIt is clear that this is not the case. I understand this will be disappointing for those who have lost out, however it proves that the resolution framework is effective and shielded the taxpayer from losses and financial instability.\u201dBPE was resolved on 7 June 2017, following the European Central Bank's (ECB) assessment that it was failing or likely to fail. The SRB decided that resolution was in the public interest in order to protect depositors and prevent instability in the financial system and the Spanish national resolution authority (FROB) implemented the decision at a national level. The bank was sold to Banco Santander, S.A.. The services provided by BPE to its customers continued as normal after resolution.A main principle of the European resolution framework is that no creditor should receive worse treatment than if the resolved bank was wound up under normal insolvency proceedings on the resolution date. An independent valuer analysed hypothetical insolvency scenarios in the so-called Valuation 3 report. It found that they would not have been better off if the bank had gone into insolvency proceedings on the same date.On 6 August 2018, the SRB published a preliminary decision that no compensation was required and opened a \u2018right to be heard' process allowing affected shareholders and creditors to express their views and provide reasoning as to why they may not agree with the preliminary decision and its underlying reasoning.The SRB reviewed 2,856 submissions from parties who registered and were verified to take part in the process. The independent valuer was also asked to provide its independent views on the comments related to the Valuation 3 report. As outlined in the decision, the comments included in these submissions covered a number of aspects, including the independence of the valuer and the content of the Valuation 3 report.Following this analysis, the SRB adopted its final decision, which was addressed to FROB, as the national resolution authority that implemented the resolution decision.

The SRB and the Spanish National Resolution Authority \u2013 FROB \u2013 decided that the sale was in the public interest as it protects all depositors of Banco Popular and ensures financial stability. The resolution scheme entered into force on the same day, following the endorsement by the European Commission.On 6 August 2018, the SRB published its preparatory act (SRB Notice) in which it took a preliminary decision that it is not required to compensate affected shareholders and creditors of Banco Popular based on the conclusions of the report of the independent valuer regarding the valuation of difference in treatment (\u201cValuation 3 report\u201d). At the same time, it opened the registration for the right to be heard process. This allowed affected shareholders and creditors to provide reasoning where they do not agree with the preliminary decision and to explain why they consider alternative approaches or assumptions for the normal insolvency proceedings should have been adopted and, if they had been, how in their view these would have affected the final outcome.The SRB collected 2,856 submissions from parties who registered and were verified to take part in the process.

The SRB\u2019s \u2018Expectations for Banks\u2019 document, which was published for public consultation on 23 October 2019, sets out the general capabilities the SRB expects banks to demonstrate in order to show that they are resolvable.Other important priorities will be operationalising the political agreements on the backstop reached in 2019, as well as increasing preparedness for potential new Banking Union members with regard to SRF contributions. The year will also see the SRB operate at full staff capacity for the first time, with close to 400 colleagues on hand to deliver the SRB\u2019s ambitious programme.\u201cAs we reach the end of this current multiannual programme, the next one is already being prepared. The 2021-2024 programme has particular salience considering the link with the end of the transition period of the SRF.

If not, resolution actions would not be taken and national insolvency procedures would apply.\u00a0The document gives clarity to the factors the SRB takes into account when conducting a PIA, and explains how the SRB applies the criteria as set out in EU law. The publication of the methodology is aimed at providing more transparency and certainty for banks and the markets.Speaking in Brussels, the Chair of the SRB, Dr. Elke K\u00f6nig commented, \u2018The resolution framework as an exception to normal insolvency sets strict conditions and the Public Interest Assessment is a core element in this context. Today\u2019s SRB\u2019s publication aims to provide clarity and transparency to all stakeholders.\u201dThe approach was developed by the SRB and national resolution authorities, in consultation with the ECB and the EBA, to ensure a common understanding across the Banking Union.

The conclusion of the PIA drives the decision as to whether resolution is to be considered as the preferred option in resolution planning respectively a resolution decision taken and not normal insolvency proceedings pursued in case of a failing bank. The PIA ensures that, in the case of resolution action, it would achieve one or more of the resolution objectives better than would be the case with a national insolvency procedure.

In 2018, the SRB differentiated between banks active entirely in the Banking Union, i.e. banks without a resolution college, and the most complex, internationally active banks, i.e. banks with resolution colleges, for which the planning cycle reaches well into 2019. The resolution planning cycle for 2018/2019 marks a type of transition phase in order to get to accelerate work and get to the steady state for resolution planning.\u00a0The SRB intends to use the transition phase to implement the new provisions of the risk reduction package, which was agreed upon by EU lawmakers in 2018. Political agreement on the Common Backstop marked another important milestone for the SRB\u2019s work.As part of its commitment to be ever more transparent, the SRB published its detailed MREL policy and communicated extensively with the banks under its remit to reach its goal to have fully-fledged resolution plans for all banking groups under its remit by 2020.Speaking at the launch of the report, SRB Chair Elke K\u00f6nig said \u20182018 marked ten years since the economic crash, but it also marked the beginning of a new phase for the SRB.

The SRB continues to develop its MREL policy, step-by-step. This gives banks the clarity needed on the SRB\u2019s requirements for them to build up MREL.Concretely, in order to increase the quantity and quality of MREL, this second part of the 2018 MREL policy introduces a series of new features to strengthen banks\u2019 resolvability within the Banking Union. Among them, the main new ones are: a refined approach for eligible instruments for consolidated MREL-targets, increased binding subordination requirements and, last but not least, the introduction of binding MREL targets at individual level. \u00a0The SRB will continue to develop its MREL policy going forward. After the adoption of the Banking Package, the SRB policy will need to be adapted to address in particular the TLAC implementation and the new internal MREL requirements.ENDS See the policy hereVisit the MREL page hereFurther Information on the main new features: A Point-of-Entry approach will now apply to liabilities other than own funds instruments to meet consolidated MREL targets. Only liabilities issued directly by the resolution entity will be considered eligible to meet consolidated targets on the ground that resolution tools will be applied only to this entity in resolution.Subordination levels will now be set based on a combination of a general level and take into account of the bank-specific nature of the assessment of No-Creditor-Worse-Off risk in the senior layer. A general level of 16% risk weighted assets (RWA) plus the combined buffer requirement (CBR) will apply for global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs), and of 14% RWA plus CBR for other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs) and other resolution entities.The SRB will determine binding targets at the individual level for subsidiaries of banking groups, prioritising the most relevant entities for this wave of decisions, with a view to ensuring a sufficient quantum of loss absorbing capacity in all parts of the resolution group.About the Single Resolution Board The Single Resolution Board (SRB) is the central resolution authority within the Banking Union (BU).

This event -\u00a0occurring ten years after the financial crash that eventually brought the SRB into existence -\u00a0gave panellists and speakers the opportunity to reflect on the changes made in the decade since the crash. As such, the title of this year\u2019s event was '10 years after the crisis: are banks now resolvable?'\u00a0In response, a general agreement emerged:\u00a0while progress has been made, the journey of resolvability is a marathon, not a sprint - and it\u2019s not over.Recurring themes that emerged throughout the day related to what is required to reach the finish line of resolvability. The need for a harmonised European Deposit Insurance Scheme, as well as a backstop to the Single Resolution Fund, was emphasised, alongside the necessity of overcoming\u00a0inconsistencies\u00a0in national insolvency proceedings and of addressing transparency. Further, more technical\u00a0questions were raised this year as the SRB\u2019s resolution planning continued; are Management Information Systems (MIS) organised and accessible enough to allow for efficient resolution? Can backstop funds be accessed quickly enough? What about cyber-security risks? The progress made in resolution thus far encouraged the consideration of such novel topics\u2014evidence of the fact that the quest for resolvability is always changing and that the\u00a0concept of resolvability itself is evolving.Across all the topics discussed, there was certain\u00a0consensus on one issue: the need to fight against complacency. Now is not the time to slow down in the race.

The SRB\u2019s main duty is to ensure that every bank is resolvable and thus help contribute to financial stability in Europe and across the world.Last year, the SRB presented its first ever\u00a0multi-annual programming document, which set out clear goals and targets to achieve resolvability of the banks under SRB remit by 2020. The\u00a0Work Programme for 2019\u00a0feeds into this ambitious vision, as the SRB continues its work to build resolvability in close cooperation with EU institution, with banks as well as the National Resolution Authorities.\u201cUltimately, it is the banks\u2019 own responsibility to make themselves resolvable; it is the SRB\u2019s job, through its Work Programme and continuous dialogue with the banks, to set the direction and to ensure that this actually happens,\u201d\u00a0said Dr Elke K\u00f6nig, Chair of the SRB.\u00a0In 2019, the SRB\u2019s tasks will focus on tailoring resolution strategies and identifying and addressing impediments to resolvability, MREL is a key tool in this regard. The 2019 Programme forecasts sizeable progress in the definition of binding MREL requirements, including its quality the internal location of MREL within groups. These elements will be put in place to strengthen resolution plans. The year 2019 will also see significant progress in resolution planning, both in the scope of banks covered by plans and in their content. Banking groups previously not covered will be addressed by new plans, leading to the adoption of a total of 113 resolution plans in the 2019 resolution planning cycle. All plans will be further substantiated reflecting the development of new or updated internal SRB policies.The SRB together with its partners at national and international level is committed to carrying out its mission, i.e. making banks resolvable, going forward.Read SRB's 2019 Work ProgrammeAbout the Single Resolution Board and the Single Resolution MechanismThe Single Resolution Board (SRB) is the resolution authority within the Banking Union and, as part of the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), is at its centre.

(BPE) to be failing or likely to fail. The ECB notified the SRB accordingly.On 7 June 2017, the SRB adopted a resolution decision for BPE, Spain\u2019s 6th largest bank. After the write-down and/or conversion of subordinated liabilities into new shares, all shares and capital of BPE were transferred to Banco Santander S.A. The SRB and the Spanish Executive Resolution Authority (FROB) decided that the sale was in the public interest as it ensured financial stability, while protecting all depositors of BPE. The resolution scheme entered into force on the same day, following the endorsement of the European Commission. The resolution scheme was implemented by FROB.The SRB published on 2 February 2018, among other documents, a non-confidential version of the Resolution Decision in respect of BPE, the Valuation 1 and 2 Reports, annexed to the Resolution Decision, and the 2016 Resolution Plan for Banco Popular Group.On 13 June 2018, the SRB announced that it had received the final \u2018Valuation 3\u2019 report. On 6 August 2018, the SRB published a non-confidential version of the Valuation 3 report together with its preliminary decision that it does not intend to compensate former shareholders and creditors of BPE based on the conclusions of the report. On the same date the SRB opened the registration for the right to be heard procedure. The registration phase remained open until 14 September 2018 at 12.00 CET.About the Single Resolution Board and the Single Resolution MechanismThe Single Resolution Board (SRB) is the resolution authority within the Banking Union and, as part of the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), is at its centre.

The SRB Conference is an opportunity to assess the progress made and focus on key issues. The failure of Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008 had a ripple effect throughout the financial world. Extraordinary events in the financial industry meant that taxpayers, through their governments, were left to foot the bill for banks and institutions deemed \u2018too big to fail\u2019.\u00a0Ten years on, the forceful, swift European response saw in particular two pieces put in place: the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive and the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation. This was done to incorporate the international principles into European law and build a single mechanism to manage bank failure within the Banking Union. The first two pillars of the Banking Union, the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the Single Resolution Mechanism are in place and operational. In 2017, the first case of resolution for the SRB demonstrated that the framework is fit for purpose. But much remains to be done. Resolvability needs to be built together; it is a multi-year project. The third pillar of the Banking Union, the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS), and harmonisation of insolvency laws are still missing.The conference features opening addresses and keynote speeches from:Valdis Dombrovskis,\u00a0Vice-President of the European Commission responsible for the Euro and Social Dialogue, also in charge of Financial Stability, Financial Services and the Capital Markets Union, speaking on the future of resolution and the Banking Union: \u201cThe Single Resolution Board is essential for turning the letter of the law of our Banking Union into improved financial stability on the ground. In a resolution, their work is supported by the bank-financed Single Resolution Fund. But to manage a crisis with minimum impact on financial stability and taxpayers, this fund needs a common backstop. The Commission strongly supports the ongoing work in the Council for a backstop that can act with swiftness and with certainty\u201d.Elke K\u00f6nig, Chair of the Single Resolution Board: \u201cA recurring question these days is whether we would be able to withstand a similar crisis to the one we experienced in 2008? I suppose the truth is that nobody knows. But we do know that much of the architecture of the Banking Union is in place, even if not complete. At some point, we may have another crisis, but we have put solid measures in place to deal with failing banks. The SRB together with its partners at national and international level is committed to that work going forward\u201d.Jelena McWilliams, Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation: \"Given the cross-border activities of our G-SIBs, resolution preparedness requires international coordination based on strong working relationships\u2026The work we do together gives us more confidence in the resolution process.\u00a0 The FDIC places enormous value on these relationships and I look forward to continuing this work in the years ahead\".Burkhard Balz, Member of the Executive Board - Deutsche Bundesbank,: \"The previous resolution cases underpin that each case is different. Thus we cannot generalize easily. Small loopholes may suffice to maintain former deficiencies. Therefore, only if all components of the new regime are working properly and are credible, we can speak of a success\".The Conference features panel discussions with industry officials, regulators and supervisors focused on the completion of the Banking Union, loss absorbing capacity, funding in resolution, and critical functions & impediments to resolution.ENDS Further Information To follow the event through the live web-stream, download the agenda, or learn more, go to the SRB Conference homepage.

It is a period that allows all of us involved in the financial sector to pause and reflect. We reflect on the causes of the last financial crisis and we take stock of all the work that has been done in the intervening decade to prevent a future crisis; but we should also use this moment to consider what else still needs to be done in order to ensure financial stability.\u00a0The era of \u2018light-touch\u2019 Casting our minds back ten years, the United States was first hit with the subprime crisis following a decline in the real estate market, which affected the related securities, not least those held by the banks.The eventual bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008 had a ripple effect right throughout the world. In the years prior, banks and other financial institutions had seen profits rise on the back of financial innovation and \u2018light-touch\u2019 regulation. Liquidity was taken for granted and available at any time in the market. Credit had been flowing and the world economy was growing. All the signs were that things were going in the right direction. Of course, what happened next was easy to predict in hindsight. Indeed, it was Keynes who had said many years prior that \u2018the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent,\u2019 and that is exactly what came to pass.The ripple effect - from the US big banks down to the ordinary European The effects of what was happening in the US began to be felt right across the globe. Contagion was rife because banks were ill-prepared to deal with any bump in the road. Trust is central to the banking sector; but trust is hard-won but easily and quickly lost. This quick loss of trust meant an even quicker loss of funding for banks. Extraordinary events in the financial industry, meant that ordinary people, through their governments, were left to foot the bill for banks and institutions deemed \u2018too big to fail\u2019. \u00a0The effects of mismanagement in the financial industry and light touch regulation led to recession, rising unemployment and an enormous bill for the taxpayer.Between October 2008 and October 2011, the European Commission approved \u20ac4.5 trillion - equivalent to 37% of EU GDP at the time - in state-aid measures to financial institutions.The status quo was no longer an option and policymakers accepted the need to reform the financial and regulatory system to end the era of implicit taxpayer guarantees & bail outs.Response to the Crisis Ten years on, the jigsaw that is the European response, as part of a coordinated international response thanks to the 2011 recommendations of the Financial Stability Board, is still not complete. That said, we have come some a long way. The first two pillars of the Banking Union, the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the Single Resolution Mechanism are already in place and operational.Two pieces of legislation were designed by the European institutions to incorporate the international principles in European law and build a single mechanism to manage bank failure at the level of the Banking Union: the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive and the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation.Single Resolution Board As the name suggests, the Single Resolution Board is part of the Single Resolution Mechanism in the Banking Union. We were set up in 2015 in order to create a single European authority responsible for developing and implementing resolution plans for banking groups in the euro area. \u00a0The Single Resolution Board is an EU regulatory organisation funded by banks, not the public purse. Ten years ago, the term \u2018resolution\u2019 had not even been invented and this held true globally.In assessing the role of the Single Resolution Board, it is important to note that if a bank fails this must not be seen as a failure of the system. On the contrary, banks should be able to fail; the exit of failing firms in a free market system is normal. Part of the SRB\u2019s raison d'\u00eatre is to ensure that we end the concept of \u2018too big to fail\u2019. However while banks might be private businesses in the free market system, we must recognise the difference between them and other businesses in the free market economy because of their underlying role in areas such as credit flow to other businesses. Therefore we must have measures in place to ensure that the \u2018domino effect\u2019 is minimised as far as possible \u2013 every financial institution must be resolvable, and in accordance with free market principles, it should be banks\u2019 investors who bear the brunt of any failure \u2013 not the ordinary citizen. The failure of a bank will hopefully be a rare event. Preparing resolution plans is the core task for the SRB and National Resolution Authorities (NRAs). As part of this work, the SRB also sets Minimum Requirements for Eligible liabilities (MREL) for banks. This \u00a0is one of the SRB\u2019s key tools for achieving the resolvability of the banks under its remit. MREL targets set the level of eligible liabilities that a bank must maintain, to ensure that banks have sufficient loss absorbing and recapitalisation capacity to be resolved. In addition, the SRB addresses any concern regarding resolvability ranging from data availability to structural complexities. \u00a0Of course the SRB provides direction, but it is banks themselves that know best what needs to be done to make themselves resolvable, and it is them that have to provide solutions that work.\u00a0In 2017 we had our first resolution case. On 7 June that year, the SRB resolved Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol, the 6th largest bank in Spain, transferring all shares to Banco Santander. The SRB and the Spanish National Resolution Authority \u2013 FROB \u2013 decided that the sale was in the public interest as it protected all depositors of Banco Popular and ensures financial stability. The SRB, by its decision, managed to avoid adverse effects on financial stability and the real economy, without using any public funds. This showed the new regime works \u2013 but of course, there is always room for fine-tuning, and the Banking Union is still not complete.More to do For the SRB, it is important to press ahead and complete the Banking Union. The development of the European Deposit Insurance Scheme, the third and final pillar of the Banking Union remains important. For the proper functioning of a Banking Union, there should be no difference in the strength of protection available to depositors in the individual Member States, and a failure should not fall on the public coffers.Common Backstop We have also begun building up the Single Resolution Fund, which today is stands at 24.9 billion euro, and we are building this fund progressively until 2023. Implementing the Common Backstop for the Fund is also critical. \u00a0A well designed Backstop, available as a last resort, will give markets the confidence that resolution will work even for large, complex banks, and reduce stress on the financial system in the event of a bank failure.Harmonisation is essential The harmonisation of insolvency regimes remains essential. Currently, the SRM framework for resolution is faced with 19 or more different insolvency procedures. While it is challenging to reconsider long-standing national jurisprudence, only by harmonising national bank insolvency procedures can we ensure a smooth functioning of the framework.Time to build on our progress It is also important to avoid weakening the standards already agreed. Following the crisis, there was a material enhancement of regulation. When memories of the crisis fade, it is important that the regulatory system is not weakened. Instead, the authorities should take advantage of positive market conditions to push forward with finalising reforms. It is important to further strengthen the Banking Union through both risk-reduction and risk-sharing measures. This will ensure the authorities are able to manage future bank failures without use of taxpayer funds.Could we withstand a new crisis? A recurring question these days is whether we would be able to withstand a similar crisis to the one we experienced in 2008? I suppose the truth is that nobody knows. But we do know that much of the architecture of the Banking Union is in place, even if not complete. At some point, we may have another crisis, but we have put solid measures in place to deal with failing banks. The SRB together with its partners at national and international level is committed to that work going forward.Deregulation on the cards? We know that European supervision is working. It has provided better transparency and banks are far better capitalised today \u2013 in both quantity and quality.The SRB\u2019s mission is to make every bank resolvable and contribute to financial stability. Some call this past decade the lost decade, but instead let us see the past decade as one where tough lessons were learnt, and robust solutions were put in place, putting our financial system today on a much better footing than before the crisis.", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/632"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0036", "date": "2018-08-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "SRB publishes today a non-confidential version of the Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol (BPE) \u2018Valuation 3\u2019 report", "text": "SRB publishes today a non-confidential version of the Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol (BPE) \u2018Valuation 3\u2019 report, as well as its own preparatory act (SRB Notice) in which it takes a preliminary decision that it does not intend to compensate former shareholders and creditors of BPE based on the conclusions of the report. The SRB now opens the registration for the previously announced \u2018Right to be heard\u2019 procedure. The registration phase for the procedure will remain open until 14 September 2018 (12:00 noon, Brussels time).\u00a0In the Single Resolution Board\u2019s (SRB\u2019s) preparatory act, i.e. \u2018SRB Notice\u2019, published today, the SRB preliminarily decides, based on the findings of the \u2018Valuation 3\u2019 report, that it does not intend to pay compensation to former shareholders and creditors of BPE whose interests were affected as a result of the resolution decision. Before the SRB takes a final decision on whether compensation needs to be granted, the SRB is now launching a \u2018Right to be heard\u2019 procedure.According to the resolution framework, the \u2018Valuation 3\u2019 determines whether affected shareholders and creditors would have received better treatment if the bank had been wound up under normal insolvency proceedings. This report has to be prepared by an independent expert. In the case of BPE, the \u2018Valuation 3\u2019 report was carried out by Deloitte.The \u2018Valuation 3\u2019 report comes to the conclusion that under normal insolvency proceedings the overall losses would have been substantially higher than the losses that were realised in resolution. The shareholders and creditors whose instruments were written down or converted and transferred in resolution would not have received a better treatment if BPE had been wound up under normal insolvency proceedings. Thus, based on the report, the SRB preliminarily decides that it is not required to pay compensation to affected shareholders and creditors.The SRB today opens the first phase of the right to be heard procedure, i.e. the registration phase. Affected shareholders and creditors who wish to exercise their right to be heard with the submission of written comments in the second phase should now register to prove their eligibility, i.e. to prove that they have been affected by the resolution because the instruments they held were written down or converted and transferred. Eligibility will have to be proven by submitting a valid proof of identity and an accepted proof of ownership of the written down or converted and transferred instruments. The registration phase will remain open until 14 September 2018 at 12:00 noon (Brussels time).The second phase will be open to those whose eligibility has been verified by the SRB in phase one, once the SRB has assessed all registrations. During the second phase, affected shareholders and creditors will have the right to express in writing their views in relation to the SRB\u2019s preliminary decision that compensation would not need to be granted and the underlying reasoning, through a dedicated electronic platform. Further details will be released ahead of the opening of phase two of the procedure.All comments provided in the second phase will be duly assessed and taken into account when preparing the SRB\u2019s final decision on whether compensation needs to be granted.The SRB Notice and the non-confidential version of the \u2018Valuation 3\u2019 report can be found here\u00a0Affected shareholders and creditors are now able to register at the following dedicated website where more information on the registration procedure\u00a0Explanatory note on the Valuation 3 Report\u00a0\u00a0BackgroundOn 6 June 2017, the European Central Bank (ECB) determined Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol S.A. (BPE) to be failing or likely to fail. The ECB notified the SRB accordingly. On 7 June 2017, the SRB adopted a resolution decision for BPE, Spain\u2019s 6th largest bank. After the write-down and/or conversion of subordinated liabilities into new shares, all shares of BPE were transferred to Banco Santander S.A. The SRB and the Spanish National Resolution Authority (FROB) decided that the sale was in the public interest as it ensured financial stability, while protecting all depositors of BPE. The resolution scheme entered into force on the same day, following the endorsement of the European Commission. The resolution scheme was implemented by FROB.\u00a0The SRB published on 2 February 2018, among other documents, a non-confidential version of the Resolution Decision in respect of BPE, the Valuation 1 and 2 Reports, annexed to the Resolution Decision, and the 2016 Resolution Plan for Banco Popular Group.

The first resolution decision, the resolution of Banco Popular in Spain on 6 June 2017, was a key event in 2017. It proved that the SRB, together with the National Resolution Authorities (NRAs), is able to effectively apply the existing rules and carry out its mandate to ensure an orderly resolution with minimum impact on the real economy, while maintaining financial stability and protecting the tax payer. The main focus of the SRB\u2019s work is and remains forward-looking. Thus, in the past year the SRB enhanced resolution plans, developed resolution strategies and policies and set for the first time binding MREL targets for the most important banks. In the coming years, the SRB will build on this work and continue to pursue the clear roadmap on resolution planning set by the Multi-annual Work Programme.Speaking ahead of the publication of the SRB\u2019s Annual Report for 2017, SRB Chair Elke K\u00f6nig said \u2018A key component for successful resolution planning is the close cooperation with the NRAs and the interaction and clear communication with the industry. In this way, the banks\u2019 management teams know the SRB\u2019s expectations well in advance. Responsible bank managers can and they should move forward, in order to become truly resolvable and build up the needed MREL buffers.\u2019Elke K\u00f6nig, Chair of the Single Resolution Board, presents the Annual Report to the European Parliament\u2019s ECON Committee at a public hearing this afternoon, July 11th, 2018 at 14:30.Read the SRB 2017 Annual Report (Below)Watch Elke K\u00f6nig\u2019s speech live from 14.30 HERE\u00a0NOTE TO EDITOR:About the Single Resolution Board The Single Resolution Board (SRB) is the central resolution authority within the Banking Union (BU).

To make as much information publicly available as possible, the SRB has decided to publish additional documents relating to the resolution process. On 28 November 2017, the SRB Appeal Panel confirmed that full disclosure of certain documents related to the resolution of Banco Popular would raise financial stability concerns. Taking into account the time that has elapsed since the resolution action and after careful consideration of potential financial stability concerns, following consultation of the relevant stakeholders, the SRB decided to disclose additional parts of the Resolution Decision, and parts of the Valuation Reports as well as of the 2016 Resolution Plan, which are considered to be of a non-confidential nature. In line with this approach, the SRB has released two additional documents related to the resolution action, namely the Marketing Decision as well as the Sale Process Letter.Certain parts of these documents remain confidential. These parts mainly contain information whose disclosure could (a) undermine the protection of public interests as regards the financial, monetary or economic policy, or (b) undermine commercial interests of BPE and/or its purchaser, or (c) affect the still on-going valuation process which is carried out in order to determine whether former shareholders or creditors of BPE would have received a better treatment under normal insolvency proceedings (Valuation 3).Accordingly, the non-confidential version of the following documents is available as of today:The 2016 Resolution Plan drawn up in respect of Banco Popular;The Marketing Decision, i.e. the SRB Decision of 3 June 2017 concerning the marketing of Banco Popular;The Sale Process Letter of FROB dated 6 June 2017;The Valuation Report prepared by the SRB to assess whether Banco Popular was failing or likely to fail (Valuation 1);The Valuation Report and its annexes prepared by the independent expert, Deloitte, in the context of the resolution action (Valuation 2); and,The Resolution Decision, i.e. the SRB Decision of 7 June 2017 concerning the adoption of a resolution scheme in respect of Banco Popular.\u00a0Please see the section 'Resolution Cases'\u00a0in order to consult these documents.Pursuant to Article 20(16) of Regulation 806/2014, a valuation for the purposes of assessing whether former shareholders and creditors of Banco Popular would have received better treatment if the bank had entered into normal insolvency proceedings (Valuation 3) is currently prepared by Deloitte.\u00a0About the Single Resolution Board The Single Resolution Board (SRB) is the central resolution authority within the Banking Union (BU).

At the same time, it decided that the SRB should make public elements of the Valuation Report it considers to be of a non-confidential nature.The SRB is now analysing the steps that need to be taken in the coming days following 6 decisions of the SRB Appeal Panel.On 28 November 2017, the Appeal Panel of the SRB released its decisions on the cases 38/17 to 43/17. These cases related to the review of decisions of the SRB with respect to the Appellants\u2019 requests for access to SRB documents, including the SRB Decision concerning the adoption of a resolution scheme in respect of Banco Popular, the related Valuation Report, the 2016 version of the Resolution Plan in respect of Banco Popular, documents emanating from the ECB concerning the situation of Banco Popular, internal SRB documents, as well as documents relating to the competitive process for the sale of Banco Popular.The SRB Appeal Panel, after balancing the interests involved, has decided that certain further parts of the Resolution Decision could be disclosed, although it welcomed the publication of a non-confidential version of the Resolution Decision by the SRB. In addition, the SRB Appeal Panel upheld the stance of the SRB that the disclosure of parts of the Valuation Report could \u201cpose a threat to such protected interests\u201d, \u201ccould have an impact on other market participants and/or resolution actions in the future\u201d and \u201ccould objectively raise actual concerns either of financial stability or of protection of commercial interests\u201d. Nevertheless, the SRB Appeal Panel stressed the need for the SRB to identify the non-confidential content of the Valuation Report that shall be disclosed. With respect to the 2016 Resolution Plan for Banco Popular, the SRB Appeal Panel considered that since disclosure of this Resolution Plan would now take place several months after the adoption of the Resolution Decision, some parts of this Resolution Plan could be made public. In the view of the SRB Appeal Panel, in preparing the non-confidential versions of these documents, the SRB \u201cenjoys significant discretion, provided that it complies, mutatis mutandis, with the principles stated in [its] decision[s]\u201d. As regards other internal SRB documents, the SRB Appeal Panel stated that access to such documents can be legitimately refused by the SRB to the extent that the Appellants did not show an overriding public interest in the disclosure of the documents.

It clearly proved its functioning, but work on resolvability is a multi-year project for all and the lessons-learned will feed into future work.\u201d - Elke K\u00f6nig, Chair of the Single Resolution BoardThe conference features opening addresses and keynotes from:Valdis Dombrovskis, Vice-President of the European Commission responsible for the Euro and Social Dialogue, also in charge of Financial Stability, Financial Services and the Capital Markets Union, speaking on the future of resolution and the Banking Union : \"We created the Single Resolution Mechanism as the second pillar of the Banking Union in the midst of crisis with ambitious aims: reducing the bank-sovereign feedback loop, protecting financial stability, and making sure that taxpayers are not first in line to foot the bill for the banking sector's mistakes. This year - as it was put to the test \u2013 we saw that the SRM is working. But work still remains before we have fully achieved its objectives. We need to implement what we have agreed, further reduce risks in the banking system, and complete the Banking Union. This is one of the most important short-term actions if we want to move on with the deepening of Europe's Economic and Monetary Union.\"Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank, speaking on the need for a safety net: \u201cWe need to tackle the issue of funding in resolution. New instruments may be needed\u201d. Sir Jon Cunliffe, Deputy Governor for Financial Stability, Bank of England, speaking on resolution feasibility: \u201cThere are in place now credible options, other than insolvency or bailout, that ensure that bank shareholders and creditors will bear losses if a bank fails\u201d.Martin J. Gruenberg, Chairman, U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, speaking on building resolvability for globally systemic important banks: \u201cTackling the issue of resolving a systemically important financial institution requires the commitment of all of the groups represented here today on a global scale. Together, we are building a solid foundation to address this critically important issue.\u00a0 More work remains to be done, but we shouldn\u2019t lose sight of how far we have come.\u201d The Conference also features panel discussions with the industry, regulators and supervisors focused on the promises of the Banking Union, the future of resolution and international challenges to overcome. \u00a0The conclusions of the Single Resolution Board's second conference will be available as a report to be published in the course of next month.To follow the event through web-stream, download the agenda, or learn more, go to the conference homepage.

This Work Programme sets out the strategic goals and objectives of the SRB and of the Single Resolution Mechanism as a whole. Its key focus is on resolution planning and resolution readiness and on ensuring that the significant and cross-border banks of the Euro area are resolvable with minimum impact on the real economy and on the public finances of the participating Member States. In addition, the SRB, as the manager of the Single Resolution Fund (SRF), will invest and administer the fund soundly and securely. A lot has been achieved in the Single Resolution Mechanism\u2019s first full year, and\u00a0the SRB\u2019s focus on addressing \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d is unchanged. Sound resolution planning and resolution readiness, as well as an efficient management of the SRF, remain key priorities.\u00a0\u201dResolution readiness, as well as SRF operations, require a sound framework for the SRB to be an effective authority. In 2017, the SRB will therefore continue to foster the cooperation with its main partners. The SRB is committed to carrying out its mission as outlined in the Work Programme 2017 in the interest of a safer and sounder financial market\u201d, said Elke K\u00f6nig, Chair of the Single Resolution Board.In 2017, the SRB will focus on four main operational areas:Resolution readiness by sound resolution planningThe Single Resolution Fund Policy and cooperationSRB resources in human resources, finance, procurement and information technologyStrengthening resolution readiness is a key operational area for the SRB in 2017, when it will focus on achieving further progress in completing resolution plans for major banking groups. The focus will be on operationalising resolution strategies for these banking groups, bail-in execution and identifying obstacles to resolvability, and of course, further work on Minimum Requirements for own funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL).Based on the experience gathered to date, the SRB will update its existing internal documentation as well as policies and procedures. This includes the further development of documentation regarding the process and procedure for any resolution action, as well as the updating of the Resolution Planning Manual and the Crisis Management Manual in light of the experience gained in resolution planning. In order to promote a level playing field for resolution plans across the banking union, the SRB will also conduct horizontal benchmarking exercises.The credibility of resolution actions is also determined by the SRF and its ability to support resolution actions financially, if necessary. The main priorities in 2017 relating to the SRF will be development of the contribution mechanism, development and implementation of the investment policy and continuation of work with respect to funding options. As an ongoing activity, the SRF will ensure the timely collection of SRM contributions.Resolution readiness and SRF operations require a strong resolution framework for the SRB to be an effective authority. In 2017, the SRB will therefore continue to foster cooperation with its main partners, i.e. the National Resolution Authorities (NRAs), the EU institutions and non-EU countries\u2019 authorities, as well as the relevant international bodies and fora. The oversight function of the SRB over Less Significant Institutions (LSIs) will gradually be developed. In addition, the SRB will continue to contribute to all policy and legislative initiatives that can potentially impact on its activities. More concretely, the SRB will: (i) contribute to the revision of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and SRMR, (ii) contribute to the transposition of total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) into EU legislation, (iii) provide input in the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) discussion and (iv) contribute to the development of a resolution framework for financial market infrastructures (FMIs).The SRB requires adequate resources to secure the successful execution of the Work Programme 2017. To achieve its priorities and to ensure the smooth running of its operations, the SRB will continue to grow in 2017.Download the SRB Work Programme 2017 \u00a0 cover.jpg \u00a0More information:BANK RECOVERY AND RESOLUTION DIRECTIVE (BRRD) 2014/59/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 15 May 2014 establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firmsSINGLE RESOLUTION MECHANISM REGULATION (SRMR) (EU) No 806/2014 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 15 July 2014 establishing uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit institutions and certain investment firms in the framework of a Single Resolution Mechanism and a Single Resolution FundAbout the Single Resolution Board The Single Resolution Board (SRB) is the resolution authority within the Banking Union (BU) and, as part of the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), is at its centre.

The SRB started in January 2015 with a clear focus on resolution planning; since January 2016 the SRB has been fully responsible for bank resolution.The SRB is the resolution authority within the Banking Union. Together with the National Resolution Authorities (NRAs) it forms the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). The SRB works closely with, in particular, the NRAs of participating Member States, the European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB), the European Parliament (EP) and National Competent Authorities (NCAs). The NRAs play a key role within the Banking Union. The mission of the SRB is to ensure an orderly resolution of failing banks with minimum impact on the real economy and the public finances of the participating Member States of the Banking Union.This first SRB Annual Report covers the period from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2015. The priorities for the SRB in 2015 included capacity-building, setting up its governance structure, shaping its resolution function and competence, as well as formalising agreements and memoranda of understanding with key European bodies.\"The Board Members and the SRB staff are committed to our mission. The SRB is the second pillar of the Banking Union. Together with the National Resolution Authorities of the participating Member States we focus on resolution planning to ensure that \u2013 if need be - banks can be resolved without recourse to public funds.\u201d - Elke K\u00f6nig, Chair of the Single Resolution Board.The SRB will exercise its power in an appropriate and proportionate manner (including setting Minimum Requirement for own funds and Eligible Liabilities, MREL) in order to ensure banks are resolvable. Well established resolution planning, adequate MREL and focus on removing obstacles to resolution will further enhance the stability of the banking sector and hopefully avoid future resolution cases by allowing earlier \u2013 private \u2013 intervention.\u00a0\u00a0The SRB, in collaboration with the NRAs of participating Member States, accomplished its 2015 objectives under a new framework, the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) which was published in the Official Journal on 12 June 2014, and came into force on 1 January 2015 (with a one year transitional period for the bail-in tool).The SRB is also responsible for the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) and it set up the relevant procedures to manage the SRF in 2015. In 2015, the SRB finalised the contribution collection mechanism while supporting the negotiations of a bridge financing solution and developing an interim investment strategy. Currently, the SRB has collected over EUR 10 billion from 2015 and 2016 contributions to the SRF.SRB Annual report 2015: srb_annual_report_2015_en.pdf srb_annual_report_2015_en.pdf \u00a0About the SRBThe SRB is the resolution authority for the significant and cross border banking groups established within participating Member States.

Today, the SRB is pleased to report that it has collected over 10 billion euros in contributions in total from nearly 4000 banks and investment firms via the National Resolution Authorities (NRAs).Following the Agreement on the Transfer and Mutualisation of Contributions to the Single Resolution Fund (\"IGA\"), an amount of 4.3 billion euros of 2015 ex-ante contributions had been transferred to the Single Resolution Fund at the end of January 2016.The Single Resolution Fund will be built up during the transitional period of eight years (2016-2023) and will reach at least 1% of covered deposits within the Member States of the Single Resolution Mechanism by the end of 2023. During the transitional period, the contributions will be allocated to different compartments corresponding to each participating Member State (national compartments). The use of the compartments is subject to a progressive mutualisation in such a manner that the compartments will cease to exist at the end of the transitional period. Banks have to make annual ex-ante contributions to the SRF. These contributions are generally calculated on the basis of the institutions\u2019 liabilities, excluding own funds and covered deposits, and adjusted for risk. In calculating the ex-ante contributions, the SRB applies the methodology as set out in the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/63 and Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/81.\u00a0READ FULL PRESS RELEASEBackground presentation on Contributions to the Single Resolution Fund\u00a0", "url": "https://srb.europa.eu/en/node/109"}, {"id": "SRB_NEWS_0061", "date": "2017-03-28", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Press Release - Single Resolution Board holds its first conference in Brussels", "text": "Brussels \u2013 29 April 2016Today, the Single Resolution Board (SRB) is holding its first conference ever in Brussels where it recently found its definitive premises in Treurenberg. \"Charting the course: making bank resolution work\", is the title of today\u2019s event which shows the determination of the SRB to firmly establish the second pillar of the Banking Union as the resolution authority while counting on and fostering strong cooperation with all its stakeholders.
