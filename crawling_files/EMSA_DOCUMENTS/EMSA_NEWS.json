The operation carried out by the Spanish General Directorate of Merchant Marine \u00a0\u2013 under the direction of the Spanish Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Agenda \u2013 marks the first time these emissions have been monitored by drone outside the special designated emission control areas in Northern Europe. The flights have been in operation since mid-July from a base in Tarifa and will continue until the end of October. \u00a0 Image credit: Nordic Unmanned The project designed to test the effectiveness of drones in measuring pollutant emissions from ships was set up by the Spanish Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Agenda (MITMA), in collaboration with the Algeciras Maritime Captaincy and the General Directorate of Merchant Marine. Using EMSA\u2019s remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS), the goal is to detect sulphur oxide emissions above a certain level indicating a possible breach of the International Convention on Maritime Pollution (MARPOL \u2013 Annex VI). The current limit for sulphur oxide in ship fuels is 0.50% by mass. The aircraft used is a CAMCOPTER\u00ae S100 and it is under contract to EMSA from the consortium of Nordic Unmanned, Norce and UMS Skeldar. It has several features making it a useful tool for the service, including the ability to take off and land vertically from an area less than 25 square meters, flight endurance of over six hours and a range of more than 100 km. To help detect the gases generated by fuel combustion and expelled through ship funnels, the aircraft is equipped with gas sensors and cameras that cover both optical and infrared spectral ranges. Since 12 July, the RPAS has been carrying out daily two flights with an average of ten inspections per day. Current figures show that of 294 vessels controlled some 27 were found in possible breach of the limits of sulphur content in their fuel. The measurements and records are automatically encoded in the information exchange system which triggers an alert in the EMSA THETIS-EU database. While this does not confirm non-compliance directly, it does help port authorities target ships for inspection and proceed with the lab testing necessary for any eventual sanctions. ABOUT RPAS Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) services are offered free to all EU member states by EMSA. They have been developed to assist in maritime surveillance operations and ship emission monitoring, and can operate in all seas surrounding the European Union. RPAS services can provide support to traditional coast guard functions, including search and rescue and pollution prevention and response. The services are offered to member states individually and as part of EMSA\u2019s regional RPAS strategy, which allows multiple coast guard functions in several EU member states to be supported by one or more RPAS services. Further expansion of RPAS regionally is planned in 2021 and 2022. See where EMSA is flying.

In the exercise scenario, two tankers collide in the Gulf of Finland, resulting in oil and hazardous materials being released into the sea. The exercise, organised by the Finnish Border Guard, includes participants and resources from Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Poland and Sweden. EMSA is contributing with the Agency\u2019s Oil Spill Response Vessel (OSRV) Norden, the vessel\u2019s on board Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS), and with additional pollution response equipment from the EMSA Equipment Assistance Service (EAS) for use on board other Member State vessels. EMSA currently has 17 OSRV on standby around the European coastline ready to react in case of an oil spill emergency. For this exercise, EMSA mobilised the OSRV Norden, based in Malmo, Sweden. The Norden will be joining in with the activities taking place on 25 August, a day dedicated specifically to coordinating large-scale oil spill response operations at sea.\u00a0 The EMSA vessel will use its rigid sweeping arms for oil recovery and will simulate ship-to-ship fuel transfer operations with some of the other participating vessels. The lightweight RPAS on board the Norden will also be used during the exercise. The purpose of the on board RPAS is to assist in the response operations under the command of the On-Scene Commander. The RPAS can identify areas of pollution and make clean-up operations more efficient by providing indications of the slick thickness, in line with the Bonn Agreement Oil Appearance Code. The exercise organisers are also able to view activities occurring at sea in real time through a live RPAS video stream. Stand-alone pollution response equipment from EMSA\u2019s Equipment Assistance Service (EAS) stockpile in Tolkkinen, Finland (one of four EMSA equipment stockpiles across Europe) will be deployed by selected Member State vessels. EMSA conducts regular drills to ensure that its services and assets are \u00a0in full operational readiness at all times, but a multi-national exercise like the Balex Delta allows it to train with other assets as part of combined task forces, and to ensure that the request and command chains work effectively.\u00a0 The Balex Delta exercise is an annual activity, which takes place under the umbrella of HELCOM, the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission.

The event offered a dynamic virtual platform for the participants to reflect on the work accomplished so far, and particularly for the representatives of national authorities handling coast guard responsibilities to put forward priorities for cooperation in the future. As chair for 2020, EMSA hosted this event which took place within the framework of European coast guard cooperation between EMSA, and its sister agencies in this field EFCA and Frontex. In attendance were the Executive Directors of EMSA,\u00a0 Ms Maja Markov\u010di\u0107 Kostelac, EFCA, Mr Pascal Savouret, and Frontex, Mr Fabrice Leggeri, alongside several high level speakers including: European Commissioner for Transport, Ms Adina V\u0103lean; DirectorGeneral for Mobility and Transport, Mr Henrik Hololei; and Portuguese Minister of the Sea, Mr Ricardo Serr\u00e3o Santos. Ms Maja Markov\u010di\u0107 Kostelac, Executive Director of EMSA, welcomed the participants and underlined the value of interagency cooperation as evidenced in the first four years of action. The key, she said, is to continue to shape cooperation in line with the needs of the national authorities, assisting them in the practical implementation of their coast guard duties. Concrete examples include combining data for an enhanced maritime awareness picture and providing remotely piloted aircraft systems to extend operational capacities. The first morning session on \u2018EU coast guard cooperation in perspective\u2019 was the opportunity for each of the three heads of agency to give their overview of the year\u2019s activities in light of the pandemic and their views on the future of the cooperation. During the event, EMSA also presented the Annual Strategic Plan for 2021, endorsed by the three agencies\u2019 administrative and management boards, which focusses on projects with measurable deliverables in the areas of: information sharing; surveillance services; capacity building; risk analysis; and capacity sharing. Throughout, there will be an emphasis on promoting and strengthening cooperation with member states at EU level. This presentation was followed by a panel discussion with member state representatives on their priorities for EU coast guard cooperation. The event also gave the floor to the current chair of the European and regional forum for coast guard cooperation (ECGFF), RADM Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Qu\u00e9rat, to present the achievements of the forum as well as their plan for future activities.

Status reports will be provided about the planning for a second Test Campaign, the ongoing Security Study, the development of tender specifications for the audit on the Responsibility to Share, outcome of the latest meeting of the Configuration Board, to mention only some points on the agenda. In addition, and following the interest of CSG members to learn more about other ongoing projects with relevance for CISE, representatives from some of these projects have been invited to share information about the projects and their objectives. This information exchange is welcomed and important to explore common issues and possible synergies of different initiatives for CISE.", "url": "http://www.emsa.europa.eu/newsroom/latest-news/item/4019-5th-cise-stakeholder-group-meeting-to-take-place-on-6-and-7-october-2020.html"}, {"id": "EMSA_UNK_0064", "date": "2020-10-09", "text_type": "UNK", "title": "CISE Stakeholder Group notes great progress for CISE at the 5th CSG meeting", "text": " At the 5th CISE Stakeholder Group meeting on 6 and 7 October 2020, members got together by virtual means to get updated on the activities of the transitional phase of CISE. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, CISE goes full speed ahead. Several important milestones were noted, the first being the draft Cooperation Agreement - the key legal framework which will define the rules for the sharing of information in CISE. The CSG members could note an already mature framework and will now, in parallel with the finetuning, liaise with national authorities to obtain the support needed to approve it at the next meeting early 2021. Secondly, the group welcomed the news about the expansion of the CISE network through new nodes of EFCA and EMSA, and the additional services for CISE based on the use cases that are being explored through brainstorming sessions with stakeholders, creating more added value for CISE. The CSG took note of the agreed principles on which the Responsibility to Share Audit should be built, and which outline has been developed by a dedicated working group. With these results, EMSA can now proceed to launch a procurement later this year to engage a contractor to perform the study for the audit scheme. Finally, the CSG members were updated about the implementation of the new version of the CISE node which paves the way for having an operational platform at the end of the transitional phase. Following the interest of CSG members to learn more about other ongoing projects with relevance for CISE, the meeting also included a session where representatives from ANDROMEDA, MARISA, RANGER and ROBORDER joined to share information about these projects and their objectives. Their contribution was much appreciated by the CSG members and a useful way to explore common issues and possible synergies of different initiatives for CISE.", "url": "http://www.emsa.europa.eu/newsroom/latest-news/item/4044-cise-stakeholder-group-notes-great-progress-for-cise-at-the-5th-csg-meeting.html"}, {"id": "EMSA_UNK_0065", "date": "2020-10-13", "text_type": "UNK", "title": "Newsletter October 2020", "text": " In this issue: French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs pays visit to EMSA;\u00a0EMSA capacity building tools available to members of Riyadh MoU and Tokyo MoU; visits and inspections activity resumed; EMSA training available non-stop through Covid-19 limitations; Copernicus maritime surveillance user group meeting; third RPAS user group met online; VR room inaugurated during French minister visit; EMSA\u2019s satellite services help in accident with oil tanker and production platform; EAS hands-on training session for Member States in Rotterdam; EMSA participates in EU secure governmental satellite communications; new operations of EMSA\u00b4s RPAS services; CISE stakeholders keep active in a series of virtual meetings.", "url": "http://www.emsa.europa.eu/newsroom/latest-news/item/4046-newsletter-october-2020.html"}, {"id": "EMSA_UNK_0066", "date": "2020-09-15", "text_type": "UNK", "title": "French minister for Europe and Foreign affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian visits EMSA", "text": "Today we welcomed French minister for Europe and Foreign affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian for an interesting exchange of views.\u00a0We presented and discussed the tasks of EMSA in support of MS and how we contribute to a safe secure and sustainable maritime transport.\u00a0In addition, the role of EMSA in supporting Coast guard functions as well as the set of operational services provided by the Agency were presented to our honourable guest.

The data from the first reporting period was made public at the beginning of this month, as part of an overall plan to encourage the uptake of energy efficiency measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport. Through the THETIS-MRV system, developed by EMSA and launched on 7 August 2017, data has been gathered, as from 1 January 2018, on ships of over 5 000 gt operating in EU waters. The information covers the CO2 emissions encoded for around 10 800 ships and is reported to represent more than 130 million tonnes for 2018. THETIS-MRV facilitates the structured workflow process involved in the reporting of the emissions, from the very drafting of the monitoring plan to the final issuing of the document of compliance, thereby simplifying the administrative burden for all concerned. The system is designed to help shipowners and operators fulfil their legal obligations, and the data they submit must be approved by accredited verifiers that have been recognised by EU National Accreditation Bodies. While the accuracy of the data is paramount, it must be noted that EMSA may not make any modification of the data submitted by the companies and their respective accredited verifiers. In the event amendments are submitted by the companies, new versions are made available in the online database and a new downloadable spreadsheet generated. As the spreadsheet is generated once per day, the figures may vary somewhat from the online search tool which gives the figures in real time. The emissions data are now to be carefully analysed by the European Commission and a report is to be published towards the end of 2019 to inform the public and allow for an assessment of the CO2 emissions and the energy efficiency of maritime transport. The introduction of the MRV system is expected to lead to emissions reductions of up to 2% compared with a business-as-usual scenario.

Both studies were conducted by Bureau Veritas, RISE Research Institutes of Sweden and Stena Rederi. In 2016, EMSA initiated the first FIRESAFE study in order to investigate cost-efficient measures for reducing the risk from fires on ro-ro spaces with a focus on electrical fire as ignition source as well as fire extinguishing failure. In 2017, following the progress of the first report, EMSA initiated a second study (FIRESAFE II) to investigate risk control options in relation to detection and decision as well as containment and evacuation, following a ro-ro space fire incident on any ro-ro passenger ship. In addition, two full scale tests were also performed, one of which focused on alternative fixed fire extinguishing systems and the other on detection systems in open ro-ro and weather decks. The five FIRESAFE II reports that can be downloaded below cover the following topics: - WP1 Final Report, this report presents a Formal Safety Assessment on detection and on decision of extinguishing system activation following a ro-ro space fire incident on any ro-ro passenger ship. - WP2 Final Report, this report presents a Formal Safety Assessment on containment and on evacuation following a ro-ro space fire incident on any ro-ro passenger ship. - WP2 Combined Assessment, this report presents the results of the combined assessment of cost effectiveness based on the results from the different parts previously considered separately in FIRESAFE and FIRESAFE II. - WP3 Final Report, this report presents a review of potential commercially available alternative fire extinguishing systems and their expected performance efficiency, water consumption and estimated installation costs. Additionally, large-scale fire tests were performed for selected systems. - WP4 Final Report, This report presents available and emerging fire detection technologies for use in open ro-ro spaces and on weather decks.
