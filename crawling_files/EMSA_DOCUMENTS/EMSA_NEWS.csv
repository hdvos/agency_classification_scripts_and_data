EMSA_UNK_0008	2021-09-20	UNK	EMSA’s remotely piloted aircraft are assisting Spanish authorities in actively monitoring sulphur emissions from ships transiting the busy Strait of Gibraltar	Over the summer EMSA’s remotely piloted aircraft have been monitoring the level of sulphur oxides released by ships transiting the Strait of Gibraltar, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. The operation carried out by the Spanish General Directorate of Merchant Marine  – under the direction of the Spanish Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Agenda – marks the first time these emissions have been monitored by drone outside the special designated emission control areas in Northern Europe. The flights have been in operation since mid-July from a base in Tarifa and will continue until the end of October.   Image credit: Nordic Unmanned The project designed to test the effectiveness of drones in measuring pollutant emissions from ships was set up by the Spanish Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Agenda (MITMA), in collaboration with the Algeciras Maritime Captaincy and the General Directorate of Merchant Marine. Using EMSA’s remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS), the goal is to detect sulphur oxide emissions above a certain level indicating a possible breach of the International Convention on Maritime Pollution (MARPOL – Annex VI). The current limit for sulphur oxide in ship fuels is 0.50% by mass. The aircraft used is a CAMCOPTER® S100 and it is under contract to EMSA from the consortium of Nordic Unmanned, Norce and UMS Skeldar. It has several features making it a useful tool for the service, including the ability to take off and land vertically from an area less than 25 square meters, flight endurance of over six hours and a range of more than 100 km. To help detect the gases generated by fuel combustion and expelled through ship funnels, the aircraft is equipped with gas sensors and cameras that cover both optical and infrared spectral ranges. Since 12 July, the RPAS has been carrying out daily two flights with an average of ten inspections per day. Current figures show that of 294 vessels controlled some 27 were found in possible breach of the limits of sulphur content in their fuel. The measurements and records are automatically encoded in the information exchange system which triggers an alert in the EMSA THETIS-EU database. While this does not confirm non-compliance directly, it does help port authorities target ships for inspection and proceed with the lab testing necessary for any eventual sanctions. ABOUT RPAS Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) services are offered free to all EU member states by EMSA. They have been developed to assist in maritime surveillance operations and ship emission monitoring, and can operate in all seas surrounding the European Union. RPAS services can provide support to traditional coast guard functions, including search and rescue and pollution prevention and response. The services are offered to member states individually and as part of EMSA’s regional RPAS strategy, which allows multiple coast guard functions in several EU member states to be supported by one or more RPAS services. Further expansion of RPAS regionally is planned in 2021 and 2022. See where EMSA is flying. ABOUT EMSA The European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) is a decentralised agency of the EU, based in Lisbon, Portugal. EMSA serves the EU’s maritime interests for a safe, secure, green and competitive maritime sector, delivering value for member states through support for pollution prevention and response, maritime surveillance, safety and security, digitalisation and the provision of integrated maritime services, and technical assistance.

EMSA_UNK_0013	2021-08-25	UNK	EMSA joins the Balex Delta pollution response exercise in Finland	 EMSA is taking part in the Balex Delta 2021 large-scale HNS and pollution response exercise, held on 24 and 25 August. In the exercise scenario, two tankers collide in the Gulf of Finland, resulting in oil and hazardous materials being released into the sea. The exercise, organised by the Finnish Border Guard, includes participants and resources from Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Poland and Sweden. EMSA is contributing with the Agency’s Oil Spill Response Vessel (OSRV) Norden, the vessel’s on board Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS), and with additional pollution response equipment from the EMSA Equipment Assistance Service (EAS) for use on board other Member State vessels. EMSA currently has 17 OSRV on standby around the European coastline ready to react in case of an oil spill emergency. For this exercise, EMSA mobilised the OSRV Norden, based in Malmo, Sweden. The Norden will be joining in with the activities taking place on 25 August, a day dedicated specifically to coordinating large-scale oil spill response operations at sea.  The EMSA vessel will use its rigid sweeping arms for oil recovery and will simulate ship-to-ship fuel transfer operations with some of the other participating vessels. The lightweight RPAS on board the Norden will also be used during the exercise. The purpose of the on board RPAS is to assist in the response operations under the command of the On-Scene Commander. The RPAS can identify areas of pollution and make clean-up operations more efficient by providing indications of the slick thickness, in line with the Bonn Agreement Oil Appearance Code. The exercise organisers are also able to view activities occurring at sea in real time through a live RPAS video stream. Stand-alone pollution response equipment from EMSA’s Equipment Assistance Service (EAS) stockpile in Tolkkinen, Finland (one of four EMSA equipment stockpiles across Europe) will be deployed by selected Member State vessels. EMSA conducts regular drills to ensure that its services and assets are  in full operational readiness at all times, but a multi-national exercise like the Balex Delta allows it to train with other assets as part of combined task forces, and to ensure that the request and command chains work effectively.  The Balex Delta exercise is an annual activity, which takes place under the umbrella of HELCOM, the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission. The organisation of the event rotates annually between the HELCOM member countries.	http://www.emsa.europa.eu/newsroom/latest-news/item/4514-emsa-joins-the-balex-delta-pollution-response-exercise-in-finland.html
EMSA_UNK_0014	2021-07-23	UNK	Practical guide for European cooperation on coast guard activities adopted by the European Commission	The European Commission has adopted a ‘Practical Handbook’ for European cooperation on coast guard activities to facilitate the cooperation of EU civilian and military authorities in their efforts to increase safety and security at sea. Image credit: Salvamento Marítimo  The document was developed by the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) in close cooperation with EU member states, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) states and with the support of the European Commission. All three agencies are involved to varying degrees in European cooperation on coast guard functions, which includes tasks such as search and rescue, maritime safety, border control, fisheries control, customs activities, law enforcement and environmental protection. The guide includes information on the services provided by the three agencies, cooperation frameworks, best practice guidelines, as well as country factsheets with details on the structure and organisation of coast guard functions in both EU countries and EFTA states. Later this year, an online platform will be launched by the three agencies and the European Commission, with input from the national authorities. Thanks to the new handbook, member states and EU agencies will be able to better coordinate their efforts in making the seas around Europe safer.

Image credit: Schiebel The considerable advantages of using unmanned aircraft for maritime surveillance have been recognised for several years now by Sasemar for which air operations are a fundamental part of the essential day-to-day services. While the flights will provide additional, complementary means to Sasemar in performing its roles of preventing and curbing pollution, and controlling maritime traffic, they will also serve the national fisheries authorities (Spanish Secretary-General for Fisheries) working to protect sea-fisheries resources and to ensure their sustainable development. EMSA’s Executive Director, Maja Markovčić Kostelac underlined the significance of the operation: “Back in May 2017, EMSA started out testing RPAS capabilities with Sasemar as one of our key pioneering partners. It is only fitting that Sasemar is able to capitalise on these services now – particularly for the vital coast guard role they play. Four years down the line, we’re pleased to see our RPAS services being used widely across Europe for maritime surveillance operations in everything from emissions monitoring and environmental protection to traffic control and search and rescue"".

The event offered a dynamic virtual platform for the participants to reflect on the work accomplished so far, and particularly for the representatives of national authorities handling coast guard responsibilities to put forward priorities for cooperation in the future. As chair for 2020, EMSA hosted this event which took place within the framework of European coast guard cooperation between EMSA, and its sister agencies in this field EFCA and Frontex. In attendance were the Executive Directors of EMSA,  Ms Maja Markovčić Kostelac, EFCA, Mr Pascal Savouret, and Frontex, Mr Fabrice Leggeri, alongside several high level speakers including: European Commissioner for Transport, Ms Adina Vălean; DirectorGeneral for Mobility and Transport, Mr Henrik Hololei; and Portuguese Minister of the Sea, Mr Ricardo Serrão Santos. Ms Maja Markovčić Kostelac, Executive Director of EMSA, welcomed the participants and underlined the value of interagency cooperation as evidenced in the first four years of action. The key, she said, is to continue to shape cooperation in line with the needs of the national authorities, assisting them in the practical implementation of their coast guard duties. Concrete examples include combining data for an enhanced maritime awareness picture and providing remotely piloted aircraft systems to extend operational capacities. The first morning session on ‘EU coast guard cooperation in perspective’ was the opportunity for each of the three heads of agency to give their overview of the year’s activities in light of the pandemic and their views on the future of the cooperation. During the event, EMSA also presented the Annual Strategic Plan for 2021, endorsed by the three agencies’ administrative and management boards, which focusses on projects with measurable deliverables in the areas of: information sharing; surveillance services; capacity building; risk analysis; and capacity sharing. Throughout, there will be an emphasis on promoting and strengthening cooperation with member states at EU level. This presentation was followed by a panel discussion with member state representatives on their priorities for EU coast guard cooperation. The event also gave the floor to the current chair of the European and regional forum for coast guard cooperation (ECGFF), RADM Jean-François Quérat, to present the achievements of the forum as well as their plan for future activities. The working arrangement between the three agencies will continue indefinitely as endorsed earlier in the year by the three respective administrative and management boards.	http://www.emsa.europa.eu/newsroom/latest-news/item/4275-annual-european-coast-guard-event-2020-“the-new-normal-for-eu-coast-guard-cooperation”.html

Twenty participants from eight different countries and two agencies attended the two day training exercise that took place on the 24th and 25th November 2020. As was done for the first Node Administrator training held in July, the CISE technical team re-created a test version of the CISE environment with 9 test nodes so that participants could carry out the exercises hands-on during the training. The two trainers, one from the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) and one from EMSA, assisted participants to successfully exchange information between the test nodes. The topics covered during the two days included an introduction to the CISE Node architecture, managing the node, as well as managing the services. Node maintenance and troubleshooting were also addressed. In addition to being an opportunity to share technical information, these types of training events also serve to connect Node Administrators from different member states and to build a network through which best practices and problem solving approaches can be shared.

Air emissions, oil pollution, marine litter and underwater noise are some of the areas targeted by this report which is intended to give a factual view of the state of play in the EU with a global perspective, for which the report will be a stock-taking exercise providing a baseline for future discussions and decisions.  The workshop was structured around three key sessions: a presentation by both EMSA and the EEA of the draft report and its main findings; a roundtable discussion gathering feedback and thoughts from six panellists representing a wide variety of perspectives (French Ministry of Ecological Transition, the Finnish Transport and Communications Agency, the European Sea Ports Organisation, the European Community Shipowners’ Associations, Seas at Risk, Shipping, and Transport & Environment); and, an open discussion allowing for feedback and input from participants from member state administrations, industry and civil society. It is hoped that this interactive dialogue will serve to stimulate and facilitate participation in the written consultation procedure which closes at the end of year. After this process, the European Maritime Transport Environmental Report will be finalised and is then expected to be published in the first half of 2021. For any questions related to both the written stakeholder consultation and the workshop, please contact the EMTER Secretariat: 	http://www.emsa.europa.eu/newsroom/latest-news/item/4271-interactive-emsa-eea.html
EMSA_UNK_0057	2020-10-29	UNK	Belgian Port of Antwerp using EMSA RPAS for pollution monitoring	Port authorities in Antwerp, Belgium, are making use of EMSA’s Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) to support their day-to-day monitoring of port operations and rapid response to pollution incidents in the port area. The RPAS will enable the authorities to inspect at a distance their complex port environment which extends over an area of some 120km². The Belgian authorities requested the service from EMSA following the positive outcome of the SAFIR project led by the SESAR Joint Undertaking for research and development activities in the area of Air Traffic Management. Through this project, the Port of Antwerp was able to test the feasibility of using drones to monitor their port activities. Taking this forward, the Port of Antwerp in cooperation with Belgium’s Federal Public Service (FPS) for Mobility and Transport entered into an agreement with EMSA for the provision of RPAS services. The operation which has been running since the beginning of October continues until the end of the year and is the first time EMSA has provided RPAS services for the purpose of port monitoring. The specific RPAS being employed is a highly flexible, lightweight Indago quadcopter operated by a pilot from EMSA’s contractor, Nordic Unmanned. The focus is on using unmanned technology to help port authorities conduct safe and efficient surveillance of ship and port operations as well as to respond to safety and pollution incidents rapidly. The flights are streamed live to EMSA’s RPAS Data Centre where they can be viewed by authorised port users to monitor the situation on the ground and take action as and when it is necessary.

More than 90% of the world non-bulk cargo carried by sea makes use of containers. Consequently, container vessels have become an increasingly important part of the global logistics value chain. The analysis offers a high-level overview of the safety issues reported in the system between 2011 and 2019 and considers the remedial actions suggested to prevent similar occurrences in future, either safety recommendations (SR) proposed by an Accident Investigative Body (AIB), or autonomously taken by the relevant parties. The deliverable consists of the following documents: • A “full analysis” of the factors contributing to accidents and incidents involving container vessel, including key statistics, and; • A more compact “summary report” presenting specific safety issues with a potential horizontal impact on the transport mode at stake.	http://www.emsa.europa.eu/newsroom/latest-news/item/4276-safety-analysis-of-data-reported-in-emcip-analysis-on-marine-casualties-and-incidents-involving-container-vessels.html

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, CISE goes full speed ahead. Several important milestones were noted, the first being the draft Cooperation Agreement - the key legal framework which will define the rules for the sharing of information in CISE. The CSG members could note an already mature framework and will now, in parallel with the finetuning, liaise with national authorities to obtain the support needed to approve it at the next meeting early 2021. Secondly, the group welcomed the news about the expansion of the CISE network through new nodes of EFCA and EMSA, and the additional services for CISE based on the use cases that are being explored through brainstorming sessions with stakeholders, creating more added value for CISE. The CSG took note of the agreed principles on which the Responsibility to Share Audit should be built, and which outline has been developed by a dedicated working group. With these results, EMSA can now proceed to launch a procurement later this year to engage a contractor to perform the study for the audit scheme. Finally, the CSG members were updated about the implementation of the new version of the CISE node which paves the way for having an operational platform at the end of the transitional phase. Following the interest of CSG members to learn more about other ongoing projects with relevance for CISE, the meeting also included a session where representatives from ANDROMEDA, MARISA, RANGER and ROBORDER joined to share information about these projects and their objectives. Their contribution was much appreciated by the CSG members and a useful way to explore common issues and possible synergies of different initiatives for CISE.	http://www.emsa.europa.eu/newsroom/latest-news/item/4044-cise-stakeholder-group-notes-great-progress-for-cise-at-the-5th-csg-meeting.html

Twenty five participants from 10 different countries and three agencies attended the two day training exercise that took place on the 1st and 2nd of July 2020. The CISE technical team re-created a test version of the CISE environment with 11 test nodes so that participants could practice hands on during the training. The topics approached included an introduction to the CISE Node architecture, managing the node, as well as managing the participants and services. Node maintenance and troubleshooting were also addressed. In addition to the technical materials shared, this exercise served to connect Node Administrators from  different member states and to build the beginnings of a network through which best practices and problem solving approaches can be shared. This is an excellent platform to exchange information. CISE aims to hold further training events for Node Administrators, both remotely and in person, throughout the duration of the Transitional Phase. We look forward to a high level of participation and to receiving valuable feedback that we can incorporate into future events.	http://www.emsa.europa.eu/newsroom/latest-news/item/3964-cise-node-administrator-training.html
EMSA_UNK_0080	2020-07-03	UNK	EMSA publishes monthly report	 Since the start of the COVID-19 crisis, the Commission, the member states and the shipping industry have been taking measures to ensure the continuity of operations and thus the security of supply. The situation is evolving day by day and the effects could be long-term. What shipping will look like post COVID-19 is unclear, however EMSA has the necessary data and tools to analyse the impact of the pandemic on certain shipping activities by analysing vessel traffic data and providing reliable figures to assist in the definition of the recovery policies and specific measures. These figures should assist all parties involved (EU, maritime administrations and shipping industry) in determining a recovery strategy to overcome the economic crisis that Europe is facing. The objective of the report is to provide figures on the impact of COVID-19 on shipping traffic. It is based on solid vessel movements statistics showing the port call trends without interpreting the statistical data. The report could not serve the purpose of an economic impact analysis since the trade volumes are not available in the EMSA systems. The report focuses mainly on EU ports and EU flagged ships, but there are also statistics about the shipping routes from Europe to China and from Europe to the US and how they have been affected. The report is updated on a weekly basis and is published every Friday at the EMSA’s website	http://www.emsa.europa.eu/newsroom/latest-news/item/4040-emsa-publishes-weekly-report-on-covid-19-impact-on-shipping.html

EMSA_UNK_0136	2019-07-12	UNK	THETIS-MRV: A look at the first reporting period of CO2 emissions data	EMSA was tasked to develop a system (THETIS-MRV) for the monitoring and reporting of verified data on CO2 emissions by the European Commission’s DG for Climate Action following the creation of an EU-wide legal framework. The data from the first reporting period was made public at the beginning of this month, as part of an overall plan to encourage the uptake of energy efficiency measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport. Through the THETIS-MRV system, developed by EMSA and launched on 7 August 2017, data has been gathered, as from 1 January 2018, on ships of over 5 000 gt operating in EU waters. The information covers the CO2 emissions encoded for around 10 800 ships and is reported to represent more than 130 million tonnes for 2018. THETIS-MRV facilitates the structured workflow process involved in the reporting of the emissions, from the very drafting of the monitoring plan to the final issuing of the document of compliance, thereby simplifying the administrative burden for all concerned. The system is designed to help shipowners and operators fulfil their legal obligations, and the data they submit must be approved by accredited verifiers that have been recognised by EU National Accreditation Bodies. While the accuracy of the data is paramount, it must be noted that EMSA may not make any modification of the data submitted by the companies and their respective accredited verifiers. In the event amendments are submitted by the companies, new versions are made available in the online database and a new downloadable spreadsheet generated. As the spreadsheet is generated once per day, the figures may vary somewhat from the online search tool which gives the figures in real time. The emissions data are now to be carefully analysed by the European Commission and a report is to be published towards the end of 2019 to inform the public and allow for an assessment of the CO2 emissions and the energy efficiency of maritime transport. The introduction of the MRV system is expected to lead to emissions reductions of up to 2% compared with a business-as-usual scenario.

EMSA_UNK_0168	2018-12-21	UNK	FIRESAFE II	The main objective of the EMSA FIRESAFE studies is to improve the fire safety of ro-ro passenger ships by cost-efficient safety measures reducing the risk of ro-ro space fire, with an aim to discuss specific proposals for rule making. Both studies were conducted by Bureau Veritas, RISE Research Institutes of Sweden and Stena Rederi. In 2016, EMSA initiated the first FIRESAFE study in order to investigate cost-efficient measures for reducing the risk from fires on ro-ro spaces with a focus on electrical fire as ignition source as well as fire extinguishing failure. In 2017, following the progress of the first report, EMSA initiated a second study (FIRESAFE II) to investigate risk control options in relation to detection and decision as well as containment and evacuation, following a ro-ro space fire incident on any ro-ro passenger ship. In addition, two full scale tests were also performed, one of which focused on alternative fixed fire extinguishing systems and the other on detection systems in open ro-ro and weather decks. The five FIRESAFE II reports that can be downloaded below cover the following topics: - WP1 Final Report, this report presents a Formal Safety Assessment on detection and on decision of extinguishing system activation following a ro-ro space fire incident on any ro-ro passenger ship. - WP2 Final Report, this report presents a Formal Safety Assessment on containment and on evacuation following a ro-ro space fire incident on any ro-ro passenger ship. - WP2 Combined Assessment, this report presents the results of the combined assessment of cost effectiveness based on the results from the different parts previously considered separately in FIRESAFE and FIRESAFE II. - WP3 Final Report, this report presents a review of potential commercially available alternative fire extinguishing systems and their expected performance efficiency, water consumption and estimated installation costs. Additionally, large-scale fire tests were performed for selected systems. - WP4 Final Report, This report presents available and emerging fire detection technologies for use in open ro-ro spaces and on weather decks. Fibre optic linear heat detection (open ro-ro spaces) and thermal imaging camera (weather deck) were fire tested onboard a test vessel.	http://www.emsa.europa.eu/newsroom/latest-news/item/3424-firesafeii.html

Different specific developments on Fuel Cells are available today, with research and pilot projects under evaluation that have revealed strong potential for further scaled up implementation. The EMSA Study on the use of Fuel Cells in Shipping has been the result of this Agency’s initiative, under the agreement of the Commission and in support of EU Member States, an important instrument, developed in close partnership with DNV-GL. Notwithstanding the close dependency of Fuel Cell technology and the development of hydrogen fuel solutions, different solutions are today in place making use of LNG, methanol and other low flashpoint fuels. EMSA participates, in support of the Commission, in the 2nd phase development of the IGF Code where provisions for Fuel Cells are to be included as a new part of the text. The EMSA Study on the use of Fuel Cells in Shipping includes a technology and regulatory review, identifying gaps to be further explored, the selection of the most promising Fuel Cell technologies for shipping and, finally, a generic Safety Assessment where the selected technologies are evaluated according to Risk & Safety aspects in generic ship design applications. The Study is composed by 2 (two) documents: the Report and the Result Tables.	http://www.emsa.europa.eu/newsroom/latest-news/item/2921-emsa-study-on-the-use-of-fuel-cells-in-shipping.html

The overarching conclusion of the assessments performed is that the SSN ecosystem has the appropriate technical capabilities to exchange the data [more likely to be shared] with other user communities which are supporting the development of a Common Information and Sharing Environment (CISE) for the maritime domain, since it: i) Is established and operational 24 x 7 x 365 and accessible by all EU Member States as well as relevant EU bodies/organisations; ii) Supports and feeds information exchange by/between all maritime user communities through operational services built up over time in accordance with their needs. These services are: Adapted to the specific needs of each user community; Standards-based; With appropriate security and access management policies; iii) Is largely aligned with CISE: Fulfils 8 out 9 CISE Principles; Fulfils 29 (out of 41) CISE Requirements, partly fulfils 7 and does not fulfil 5; Around 72% of the CISE ""data groups more likely to be shared"" are already available in or through the SSN ecosystem; iv) Possesses the technical capabilities and the flexibility to evolve in accordance with the needs of different user communities."	http://www.emsa.europa.eu/newsroom/latest-news/item/2149-integrated-maritime-policy-and-the-safeseanet-ecosystem.html

They are subsequently implemented and enforced by both national maritime authorities and, under delegated powers, by recognised organisations. European legislation clarifies, and sometimes reinforces, the ship safety standards that have been established by IMO Conventions. Due to a number of serious vessel casualties that have occurred in recent years, ship safety and especially damage stability is a subject that is currently receiving a high level of attention in national, European and international fora. EMSA has been participating as part of the European Commission delegation in the Sub-Committee on Ship Design and Construction (SDC), previously Subcommittee on Stability and Load Lines and on Fishing Vessel Safety (SLF) in IMO. After a specific request from the European Commission, the agency financed studies on damage stability of Ro-Pax vessels. The first study that was led by Hamburgische Schiffbau-Versuchsanstalt (HSVA) was presented in SLF 52 and the second study, which was conducted by the University of Strathclyde, was officially completed at the end of 2011 and was forwarded to IMO.	http://www.emsa.europa.eu/newsroom/latest-news/item/1457-damage-stability-of-ro-pax-vessels-final-report.html
