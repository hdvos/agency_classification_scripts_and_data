EUROFOUND_UNK_0002	2021-09-14	UNK	Future of Europe in the spotlight in discussions between Eurofound and Irish Government	Eurofound’s Directorate met with Thomas Byrne T.D., Minister of State with responsibility for EU Affairs, in Dublin today to discuss the evolving role of the Agency in producing timely and relevant research on the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on employment, the labour market and quality of life, as well as its strategic position as the only EU agency based in Ireland. Eurofound’s Director, Ivailo Kalfin, Deputy Director, Maria Jepsen, and Minister Byrne reflected on the continuous close dialogue and cooperation between the Agency and the Irish government, and how the COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the importance of Eurofound’s work on both a national and European level. They also discussed how, as a tripartite Agency, Eurofound promotes cooperation dialogue between social partners, national governments, and the European institutions, with the next Foundation Forum in March 2022 providing a further opportunity to deepen this dialogue. The meeting, held on the eve of President von der Leyen’s State of the European Union 2021 address, also discussed the ongoing Future of Europe conference as well as the forthcoming visit of EU Heads of Missions in Ireland to the Agency’s premises on 28 September as an important occasion for both cooperation and further analysis of Eurofound’s research findings. Speaking shortly after the meeting, Ivailo Kalfin emphasised his ambition to continue the Agency’s close cooperation with the Irish government, ‘Eurofound has enjoyed a close and productive relationship with the Irish government and political institutions over decades, I am conscious of the importance of not only continuing this under my mandate, but also deepening it and ensuring that Eurofound acts as a hub of research and national cooperation on social policy in Europe.’ Further information: Visit of EU Heads of Missions in Ireland to Eurofound, 28 September 2021 Left to right: Thomas Byrne T.D., Maria Jepsen, and Ivailo Kalfin.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0003	2021-10-06	UNK	COVID-19 one year on: A changed Europe	It has been over a year since the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) hit Europe and many of the response measures necessary to deal with the pandemic, from working from home to social distancing, are now part of our everyday lives. In spring 2020, most citizens, although fearful of the devastating early impacts of the virus, did not envisage that their lives would be so dramatically impacted, and that the economic, social and work-related effects of the pandemic would drag on for so long. COVID-19 has exposed how fragile the progress made on issues such as gender equality and socioeconomic convergence in Europe truly was, with women, young people, and the economically and socially marginalised most adversely impacted. Almost every aspect of our working and family lives has changed and, likewise, all of Eurofound’s research areas have been marked by COVID-19. Not only did we roll out three rounds of the now landmark Living, working and COVID-19 online survey in 12 months to analyse the rapid change that is ongoing, but the analyses in our existing surveys and flagship reports have specifically looked at the impacts of the pandemic across the board. Unfortunately, findings to date paint a bleak picture. In spring 2021, mental well-being reached its lowest level across all age groups since the onset of the pandemic, with young people and those out of work most adversely affected. Our research also showed that over half (55%) of young people were at-risk of depression during the early stages of lockdowns across the EU, with Europe’s youth suffering disproportionately from social isolation and stymied educational and employment opportunities. Meanwhile, trust in institutions has plummeted, with trust in national governments across all EU Member States lower than at the start of the pandemic. Across Europe, citizens felt the divisive social and economic fallouts with a dwindling number viewing crisis support measures as fair and efficient. As the pandemic endured it became clear that, although women appeared to be more resilient than men to COVID-19 in terms of health outcomes, that was not the case when it comes to the economic and social fallout. Measures taken by governments to control the spread of the virus exacerbated gender divides in unemployment, domestic labour and financial security, all to the disadvantage of women. Work–life conflict escalated for many people working from home, with mothers of small children often bearing the brunt of the impact. While what has taken place has been tumultuous and devastating for many, the future also holds possibilities. Eurofound’s research has highlighted that COVID-19 could be a catalyst for fundamental change that will define the future of Europe , and that rather than ‘recovering’ from a crisis like we did a decade ago, we can instead reset our expectations for our lives and reshape our understanding of what we can achieve in cooperation; from building up our health and social systems, to adopting meaningful and ambitious policies to address climate change. COVID-19 may have left many sectors and businesses dormant, but it has revolutionised other aspects of working life, with large swathes of the workforce working from home during the pandemic and increasingly questioning old paradigms. Despite ongoing issues with vaccine hesitancy, which Eurofound’s research helped bring to light – particularly in relation to the spread of misinformation – many EU countries have enjoyed success with their vaccine rollout. The public health threat of the virus gradually is receding and, in addition to the prioritisation of ensuring robust, resilient and coordinated health systems across the Union, the way that work is done may turn out to be one of the most important long-term consequences of the pandemic. Early indications show a workforce tentative to return to the office and, while mindful of the extra pressures and isolation that can result from working from home, many are reluctant to sign-up once more for long commutes and more time away from loved ones. For those in client-facing and manual roles and not able to work from home, the greater advantages of those that have more freedom to decide when and where to work acts as a further reminder of an unequal labour market. These are all themes that Eurofound will be exploring in its research, with an immediate focus on how the lockdowns have changed the labour market, how digitisation has changed the workplace, how COVID-19 has impacted business continuity, and how crises impact equality and cohesion in Europe. The outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe may be moving gradually into history, but the long-term impacts of the pandemic on our work and lives is just beginning.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0004	2020-11-30	UNK	Reflecting on developments of living and working conditions across the EU over the past decade	At the end of his term as Executive Director on 30 November 2020, we engaged in a socially distant interview with Juan Menéndez-Valdés to review the last decade, his thoughts on Europe and his hopes for Eurofound. We wish him all the best into the future.       You have now completed 10 years at the helm of Eurofound, at the core of living and working developments across the EU. This period has seen many important changes and significant developments in this sphere. It has also spanned some major and unique milestones, including the impact of the Great Recession and the ongoing pandemic. What have been the major changes you have seen in the area of living and working in Europe during this time? It has been a turbulent decade indeed. I arrived in the middle of the crisis and at a time when the recovery had not yet fully taken hold in in all countries or across all societal groups. I now leave as Europe faces the myriad of challenges resulting from the pandemic and the economy is experiencing the sharpest drop in GDP since World War II. Over the past decade, there have not been dramatic changes in the working conditions of those who retained their jobs. Structural change, however, has continued to leave a trail of winners and losers as a result of the changes driven by digitalisation, the transition to a low-carbon economy, globalisation and demography, accelerated during the crisis periods. Unemployment is still probably the single biggest issue and the main driver of inequality, poverty and exclusion. Similarly, the overall reduction and availability in working hours is an issue, as the expansion of part-time work impacted on in-work poverty. The crisis also arrested, and in some cases reversed, the process of convergence regarding wages and social protection. The growing variety of forms of employment, pushed by technology, globalisation and business models, has blurred the borders of traditional employment relations, opening up gaps in social protection and challenging traditional industrial relations. In terms of societal groups, we have witnessed progress in closing some gender gaps – although this progress also has suffered a setback during the pandemic and there is still a long way to go – while young people have been most acutely affected by two major crises in a decade. Beyond employment, the needs of an ageing population and reconciliation of work and life, particularly in relation to care needs, remain highly pertinent challenges. How do you feel these issues will impact on living and working in Europe in the longer term? Will they dilute our social Europe? Is the convergence machine set to shudder to a permanent standstill? During the past 10 years, the European Union has seen a rise in divisions and societal tensions, with significant divergences between Member States during the Great Recession, including tensions around wages, contrasting approaches to mobility and migration and a worrying decline of trust in institutions and the EU project, with Brexit perhaps the most visible and dramatic indicator. Rifts between North and South, West and East, creditors and debtors are also still painfully evident. As the EU’s reaction to the COVID-19 crisis has been much bolder and more determined than its response to the financial crisis, citizens will probably appreciate the benefits of working together. However, the ratification of measures is not yet complete, and clearly the political polarisation does not help. What mechanisms do you believe have worked in the face of these challenges? Do you think the social model has proved itself to be still fit for purpose during this time? Europe is still the social benchmark at global level. The social model itself needs to adjust and respond to the challenges, including those related to an ageing population, more diverse employment relations, insecure working lives and faster restructuring processes. It will be important to remain ambitious in terms of the social protection objectives, while at the same time ensuring that problems are not ignored, and the necessary reforms not thwarted. How do you think the role of the EU Agencies has evolved during this period? Has their contribution proved to be of benefit during these critical times? In what way? I believe that the EU Agencies continue to be agile institutions capable of delivering a lot with limited resources (indeed considerably reduced over the last decade). The number and scope of Agencies has grown during the decade and, from the perspective of taxpayers, the demand for increased efficiency of the institutional architecture and higher accountability of Agencies is a legitimate one. Agencies should keep their focus on fulfilling their purpose and demonstrate every day that they are worth the investment the society is making in them. Specifically, what do you think have been Eurofound’s greatest achievements during this time? Overall, I believe we have succeeded in enhancing our usefulness. We have managed to bring our research closer to the knowledge needs in the policy action arena. Eurofound today is more visible and its expertise is acknowledged and used in most social policy debates at EU level. There is much evidence to support this, from the input of our findings in key policy documents to the requests to contribute to key political events of the EU Institutions. And we have achieved this while also increasing our scientific rigour and efficiency. What do you think your own contribution has been? Are there regrets? I think I have been part of that, but I would emphasise that this has been a team achievement. My contribution focused on being very persistent and consistent in all this, asking stakeholders constantly about their needs, passing on the message in house, providing key guidance when selecting our activities, requesting the flexibility to react to demands, maintaining high standards across the board, and striving to convey to the stakeholders and the broader audience a reliable, credible, balanced and robust image of Eurofound’s work. On the regrets chapter, when dealing with so many stakeholders, managers and staff…. it is impossible to ensure everyone is satisfied all of the time. I regret the negative impact of some of the decisions taken, even if I remain convinced that those were the right decisions at the time. The next phase is critical for European social, work and labour related developments – how we will live, how we will work, the Pillar, gender strategy, minimum wage, platform work and so on. Where do you think Eurofound can contribute best? It is clear we are undergoing the deepest crisis since World War II. But we will also be responding to this with the most intense investment assistance package ever coordinated at EU level. It will be key for Eurofound to fully understand and translate the knowledge needed to inform this massive policy initiative at national level and the support and monitoring required at EU level. As you start to take a little distance from the Institutions, the Agency and its work, what do you think Eurofound can try to improve over the coming period? How should we seek to shape change? It will be important to keep the focus on the external demands and requirements and to avoid the unnecessary multiplication of projects and outputs and to integrate our findings better. My advice would be to adopt a ‘digital first’ strategy to explore new and innovative initiatives both to conduct research and to present findings in a way that is searchable and filtered by the user. What would be your biggest hopes and fears for Europe as you look to the future? My biggest hope is that we manage to beat the virus and achieve a successful, cohesive recovery across Europe, and indeed the world. There is potentially, in fact a huge opportunity for Europe in this, despite the pain and destruction, to see the results of what we can achieve by working together. My greatest fear is that increased polarisation, tensions and divisions will undermine trust. That Europeans will fall into the trap of populist narratives focused on identifying ‘us’ and ‘them’ (whether that be countries, groups in society, institutions, etc), exacerbating confrontation where cooperation is needed. If you had one message for staff and stakeholders as you leave Eurofound what would it be? Be nice to the new Executive Director.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/reflecting-on-developments-of-living-and-working-conditions-across-the-eu-over-the-past-decade
EUROFOUND_UNK_0005	2020-12-10	UNK	New Chair of Eurofound’s Management Board	Stefan Gran has been elected Chair of Eurofound’s Management Board during the third meeting of the Board on 6 November 2020. He takes over from outgoing chair Aviana Bulgarelli, Ministry of Labour and Social Policies (Ministero del Lavoro, della Salute), Italy. Stefan, from the German Trade Union Confederation (DGB – Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund), represents the Workers group in Eurofound’s tripartite management structure. He is currently based in Brussels where he is Head of DGB’s EU Liaison Office. In response to his election, he announced: ‘I am pleased that the tripartite representation from the 27 EU Member States elected me as Chair of Eurofound’s Management Board. I take up this position as Eurofound embarks on a new four-year programme of work, Programming Document 2021– 2024: Towards recovery and resilience, set against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic and all the social, employment and work-related challenges it brings. It is a privilege to be able to contribute to informing effective policies that can lead to improving the quality of life and work for all Europeans.’ Three Deputy Chairpersons were also elected: Roel Gans, Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment, Netherlands (SZW - Ministerie van Sociale Zaken en Werkgelegenheid), Stefania Rossi, General Confederation of Italian Industry (Confindustria), and Barbara Kauffmann, DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, European Commission. As set out in Eurofound’s Founding Regulation, the Chair and Deputy Chairpersons are elected by a majority of two-thirds of members of the Management Board. The term of office is for one year, renewable.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/new-chair-of-eurofounds-management-board
EUROFOUND_UNK_0006	2020-11-11	UNK	COVID-19 crisis led to doubling of EU restructuring job loss in first six months of 2020	The COVID-19 crisis has led to a doubling of restructuring job loss in the first half of 2020 compared to the rolling average. The labour market impacts have been highly selective, with two broad sectors – transport (including air transport) and hotels and restaurants – accounting for nearly half the overall announced job loss compared to less than 10% in ‘normal’ times. The new European Restructuring Monitor ERM report 2020: Restructuring across borders reviews recent restructuring activity in the EU, from January 2019 up to and including the first impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. It also presents an analysis of transnational restructuring cases – those that affect workers in more than one country. Around 1 in 20 cases of large-scale restructuring are transnational, affecting activities in at least two countries, according to the report. The employment effects of such cases tend to be much larger and the restructuring processes longer and more complex. Large-scale transnational restructurings in the EU involve on average around 3,000 job losses. While representing only 1 in 20 of the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) database’s 25,000 plus records, restructuring cases affecting workplaces in different jurisdictions and involving multinational enterprises (MNEs) may be of specific interest to policymakers, notably at European level. These enterprises account for nearly a quarter of jobs globally and an even higher share of output. All restructuring activity is cyclical, with peaks coinciding with recessions, but transnational restructuring activity is particularly sensitive to the business cycle. Both the frequency of cases and the size of cases (in job losses) increases relatively faster during economic downturns, including that provoked by the COVID-19 crisis. ‘Given their scale and their impact across Member State borders, including their potential to give rise to cross-border disputes in cases of production transfer, there is a strong rationale for EU involvement in monitoring transnational restructurings,’ says John Hurley, senior research manager at Eurofound and co-author of the report. ‘Funding instruments such as the EGF make provision for cross border applications, but in practice the majority of case applications for post-restructuring active labour market interventions tend to be national.’ More information Publication: ERM report 2020: Restructuring across borders 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/covid-19-crisis-led-to-doubling-of-eu-restructuring-job-loss-in-first-six-months-of-2020
EUROFOUND_UNK_0007	2020-10-29	UNK	Fewer than 10% of EU businesses offer comprehensive learning opportunities critical to employee performance and well-being, new survey says	The best outcomes in terms of company performance and workplace well-being are obtained in companies where training is valued highly according to the recently published European Company Survey 2019 by EU agencies Eurofound and Cedefop. The survey also reveals how businesses fare better when the responsibility for skills use and skills development is explicitly shared between the employer and their employees. According to the findings, almost all managers (96%) agree training is important for employees to do their current job and most workplaces in the EU offer at least some training, yet only a small number – 9% – offer comprehensive training and learning opportunities to most of their employees. Overall, the ECS 2019 demonstrates that companies can design their workplace practices to help generate outcomes that benefit both workers and employers. Businesses can boost performance while improving aspects of workers’ job quality by bundling practices that promote specific practices such as training and learning, increasing employee autonomy and facilitating employee voice. Around one fifth of EU workplaces have these beneficial bundles of practices in place. Successful examples can be found across all types of business regardless of country, size, sector, or competitiveness strategy. Focusing on skills, the findings confirm how training is an important way to achieve positive workplace outcomes. Results also show that 71% of workers in EU-27 companies have skills matching their job requirements; 16% on average are overskilled, while 13% are underskilled. At the same time, over three quarters of companies report they have difficulties in finding candidates with the required skills (26% find it very difficult and 51% fairly difficult). In terms of sectors, construction has the most difficulty, with 86% of these businesses reporting difficulties in finding candidates with the desired skills. Companies that are highly digitalised perform better and achieve better workplace well-being outcomes than others and the survey findings show a positive association between digitalisation and innovation and a company’s approach to skills development. Companies that have a comprehensive training and learning opportunities in place are by far companies that are more likely to be highly digitalised as well as innovative. Conversely, those that do not innovate are likely only to offer limited training and learning at work. Policymakers and social partners have a key role in supporting companies to improve their workplace practices. Employer associations and trade unions can, in particular, play a major role in the design and implementation of policy measures geared towards improving skills use, employee autonomy and development and facilitating employee involvement in the workplace. To support managers in adapting workplace practices, the report also suggests that policymakers can involve business schools and HR management associations to target general and line managers’ skills and knowledge base which is critical to the success of any workplace change initiative. On Thursday 29 October 2020 at 10:00 CET, Eurofound together with European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) , are organising a live #AskTheExpert webinar session to delve into the European Company Survey 2019 findings specifically relating to skills. Moderated by Maria Jepsen, Deputy Director of Eurofound, webinar participants will be able to join a lively and interactive debate with the ECS 2019 report authors Giovanni Russo and Gijs van Houten and guest panellists Isabel Coenen, policy advisor at the Dutch trade union FNV and Pär Lündstrom, expert in skills provision with Swedish employers - both members of Cedefop’s Management Board. Participants will be able to comment via a LIVE online chat.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0008	2020-10-15	UNK	Trust in EU recovers following COVID-19 responses	Trust in the European Union was significantly higher among respondents in the July wave of Eurofound’s Living, working and COVID-19 survey than in April, with average trust in the EU exceeding trust in national governments. This reflects positively on the work of the European institutions during the summer in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, as very low levels of trust in the EU during the early stages of the pandemic raised fundamental questions about perceived EU action and broader European solidarity during the crisis. Eurofound’s unique Living, working and COVID-19 research looks in detail at the experiences of citizens in both April, when much of Europe was under heavy restriction, and July, when restrictions had been somewhat eased. The full report details the social, economic, labour market, and quality of life findings of a total of 87,477 respondents across the EU. It shows that while trust in the media, police and healthcare system remained largely stable over the summer, there was a marked decline in government trust in some Member States, and relatively large growth in trust in the EU. This growth in trust is particularly noteworthy considering the consistent decline in EU trust in the aftermath of the financial crisis and onset of the Great Recession. Trust in the EU, measured out of 10, was highest in Ireland (6.3), Poland (6.2), and Lithuania (5.9) in July, it was lowest in Greece (4.2), Croatia (4.2) and Czechia (4.3). Overall, trust increased from 4.6 in April to 5.1 in July, with significant increases recorded in 13 Member States – most notably Italy (from 4.1 to 5.2) and Spain (from 4 to 5.1). While increases in trust were recorded in southern Europe, a decline in EU trust was noted in Finland (from 6.5 to 5.5), Denmark (from 5.7 to 4.9), the Netherlands (from 4.9 to 4.4) and Sweden (from 5.2 to 4.8). This suggests different national perceptions of changes to European economic and monetary policies to deal with the pandemic during the period. Trust in national governments was highest in Luxembourg (6.8), Finland (6.5) and Denmark (6.4), and lowest in Poland (2.4), Croatia, Bulgaria and Hungary (2.9 respectively). There were notable increases in trust in the national government in Spain (+0.5), France (+0.4) and Luxembourg (+0.3), but significant decreases in Malta (-1.5), Croatia (-1.2), Finland (-1.1) and Austria (-1.1). The report notes that trust in both the national government and EU was higher among respondents that received support from public services to help with living expenses or household needs. Speaking about the findings, Massimiliano Mascherini, Eurofound Head of Unit for Social Policies, said 'Maintaining and improving levels of trust is of vital importance during this pandemic, as trust is a keystone of the compliance needed to control COVID-19. The importance of the improving EU trust that this research demonstrates should not be understated, it sends a clear message that most people in Europe were in favour of coordinated, comprehensive action based on solidarity and common European values.'

EUROFOUND_UNK_0009	2020-10-21	UNK	Just 31% of companies capitalise fully on direct employee involvement to enhance performance and well-being	Fewer than one-third (31%) of companies in the EU27 facilitated the regular direct participation of employees in organisational decision-making and accorded them a high degree of influence last year. This is despite research showing that businesses that combine direct employee involvement, with high levels of job complexity and autonomy, and comprehensive training and learning opportunities, do best in terms of both performance and well-being. Over half of establishments in Sweden (56%) and Denmark (55%) were characterised by regular, high influence direct engagement with employees, but only around a fifth in Poland (20%) and the Netherlands (21%). These findings, discussed at a special #AskTheExpert webinar on 20 October, are detailed in the fourth European Company Survey, conducted in partnership between EU Agencies Eurofound and Cedefop. It provides information on workplace practices, human resource management, skills and development, employee participation and social dialogue from 21,869 human resources managers and 3,073 employee representatives in the 27 EU Member States and the United Kingdom during 2019. Webinar #AskTheExpert: Exploring the survey’s findings on employee involvement The research analyses the different tools companies used to engage directly with employees. The vast majority of establishments (94%) in the EU27 use meetings between employees and their line manager as a way to engage with employees. These are held regularly in 59% of establishments and irregularly in 36%. Regular meetings between employees and their immediate manager are most prevalent in Sweden (82%) and Austria (76%) and least prevalent in Poland (42%) and Croatia (43%). Large establishments are more likely to hold regular meetings between employees and their immediate manager (66%) than medium-sized (62%) and small (58%) establishments. Direct and indirect employee participation, facilitated by open and meaningful social dialogue, is crucial for both employees and companies. — Maria Jepsen, Eurofound Deputy Director Feedback from management in the survey revealed that most managers believe that there is more to gain than lose from close, regular and influential employee engagement. Although around one-third (32%) of managers reported that, in their opinion, involving employees in the implementation of changes causes delays, more than two-thirds (70%) of managers reported that involving employees in work organisation changes gives the establishment a competitive advantage. The research also looks in detail at indirect employee involvement through social dialogue. An official structure for employee representation, such as a works council or trade union delegation, is present in 29% of EU27 establishments. Larger establishments are much more likely to have an employee representation structure (76%) than medium-sized (51%) or small (23%) establishments. Overall, structures for employee representation are most common in Romania (56%) and Finland (55%) and least common in Greece (2%) and Latvia (4%). Managers in 80% of the establishments where an employee representation structure is present reported a general constructive attitude towards employee representation. Speaking about the findings, Maria Jepsen, Eurofound Deputy Director, emphasised the importance of employee voice in companies across Europe: ‘Direct and indirect employee participation, facilitated by open and meaningful social dialogue, is crucial for both employees and companies. Not only can it boost performance and well-being, it can also provide pivotal decision-making structures when job losses or significant shifts in task allocation take place. This is especially the case now that COVID-19 is dramatically impacting companies across Europe.’	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/companies-capitalise-on-direct-employee-involvement-to-enhance-performance-and-well-being
EUROFOUND_UNK_0010	2020-10-13	UNK	Only one-fifth of European companies find secret to combining optimal workplace wellbeing and business performance	‘High investment, high involvement’ workplaces have the best outcomes for workers and employers according to a recent large-scale survey of company practices across Europe. Just 20% of EU organisations fall into this category – bundling practices that increase employee autonomy, facilitate employee voice and promote training and learning. These companies, which are managing to boost performance while also improving workers’ job quality, can be found across all types of business regardless of country, size, sector, or competitiveness strategy, but are most prevalent in Nordic countries, such as Finland and Sweden, and in sectors known to have better working conditions, such as financial services. The three other categories, ‘selective investment, moderate involvement’ (33%); ‘moderate investment, irregular involvement’ (27%); and ‘low investment, low involvement’ (21%) all score lower in terms of worker wellbeing and company performance. The fourth European Company Survey (ECS 2019), conducted in partnership between EU Agencies, Eurofound and Cedefop, collected information on workplace practices, human resource management, skills and development, employee participation and social dialogue from 21,869 human resources managers and 3,073 employee representatives in the 27 EU Member States and the United Kingdom during 2019, providing a timely insight into the potential resilience of companies across the EU in advance of the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, the survey confirms that most EU27 companies have a positive work climate: 84% of managers reported a good or very good relationship between management and employees with the most successful firms not only having facilitating practices in place, but also a supportive management attitude. Workplaces in the ‘high investment, high involvement’ group often combine job design fostering autonomy and learning with a management approach geared towards facilitating autonomous work rather than controlling compliance. But many jobs still offer little autonomy: in 36% of EU-27 companies, a small proportion of workers (fewer than one in five) can organise their work autonomously. Results also show that 71% of workers in EU-27 companies have skills matching their job requirements; 16% on average are overskilled, while 13% are underskilled, with training an important way to achieve positive workplace outcomes. Most workplaces in the EU offer at least some training to at least some workers, but only 9% offer comprehensive training and learning opportunities. Companies that are highly digitalised and those with a high level of computer use achieve better workplace well-being outcomes than others, however only the highly digitalised businesses do better in terms of performance. The research also noted that businesses with strong workplace social dialogue score better on performance and wellbeing with more than two-thirds (70%) of managers thinking that involving employees in changes to the work organisation gives the company a competitive advantage. Workplaces with involving, trusting and influential social dialogue are more likely to have regular, direct employee participation that makes a difference on the ground. The report notes that a people-centred management approach – which supports employees in the application of their skill and knowledge in the workplace and facilitates the development of employee skills and knowledge – can bring benefits that go beyond the workplace, such as lower healthcare costs and increased civic engagement. It highlights the importance of the involvement of social partners to support workplace change in the design and implementation of policy measures geared towards employee autonomy, improving skills use and development and facilitating employee involvement in the workplace. The ECS 2019 is the first Europe-wide company survey to use a push-to-web methodology, where establishments were contacted by telephone to identify respondents, who were then asked to complete the questionnaire online.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/one-fifth-of-european-companies-combine-optimal-workplace-wellbeing-and-business-performance
EUROFOUND_UNK_0011	2020-06-11	UNK	Eurofound contributes to International Archives Day 2020	Eurofound went back to the future in a recent contribution to an online exhibition by the Historical Archives of the European Union (HAEU) in Florence to celebrate International Archives Day which marks the founding of the International Council on Archives (ICA) on 9 June 1948. For the exhibition, Eurofound’s archivist selected an extract from a proposal in the Agency’s 1982 work programme on the impact of ‘télétravail’ on working and living conditions. It is striking that the areas identified for investigation in the research almost 40 years ago are as relevant today. A journey in the archives was a timely reminder that telework has been a topic of interest for Eurofound for some time now. Its 1995 publication setting out a framework for organisations and workers considering such arrangements includes a chapter ‘Thriving on your own’ with self-care guidelines that are equally applicable to the millions of involuntary teleworkers at home today. The HAEU is a research centre dedicated to the archival preservation and study of European integration. It is the official archive for the historical documents of the Institutions of the European Union. EU Agencies like Eurofound (established in Dublin, Ireland in 1975) and sister agency Cedefop (established in West Berlin the same year and relocated to Thessalonica, Greece in 1995) also deposit their archives here after 30 years. Eurofound’s archives ranging in date from 1976 to 1987 have been digitised and are available for online consultation from the HAEU website, upon registration. They consist in the main of papers of the governing bodies (the Board and Bureau) with files from the Director and staff on speeches and events in the first two years of operation, that reveal how the remit of the agency was initially envisaged to extend to environmental factors affecting working and living conditions. The creation of an independent research institute at European level was seen as part of the essential development of social policy in the community, and the involvement of the social partners, alongside the governments and the European Commission in the management board, was a key element of that.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0012	2020-07-13	UNK	Help us delve deeper into the COVID-19 crisis	The second wave of Eurofound’s pan-EU Living, working and COVID-19 survey is now open. The first results of the online survey, carried out in April, showed a Europe grappling to respond to the crisis caused by the pandemic, with many respondents reporting low levels of optimism about their future, job and contract loss, and a spike in financial insecurity. This second wave of the survey will delve deeper and aim to capture how lives have changed over time – particularly for those most impacted, such as the self-employed. Living, working and COVID-19 e-survey wave 2: Tell us how COVID-19 is impacting your life in our 10 min survey The second wave of the survey is more targeted, tracks changes since the initial confinement period, and seeks to provide an even deeper analysis in order to further contribute to Europe’s policy response. Despite its more targeted nature, a strong and balanced response rate is required to ensure that it reflects population structures and captures the true nature of how life has changed across Europe. Speaking about the launch of the second wave of the survey, Eurofound Executive Director Juan Menéndez-Valdés said, “With over 60,000 responses, the first findings of this survey were widely recognised for its insights on how the arrival of this pandemic had fundamentally changed people’s lives and work. Now it is time to go deeper, attain a more granular analysis, and learn about the evolution of these changes. This is why we are calling on the population aged 18 or over to complete the second wave of this survey, which will help contribute to Europe’s economic, social and labour market policy responses in the months and years ahead.” Please complete the survey Eurofound are asking you to complete the survey and to spread it within your network. It takes around 10 minutes to complete, is anonymous, and is designed for the general population aged 18 years or older and living in the EU. It is also open to people from other countries.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0013	2020-05-21	UNK	COVID-19 EU PolicyWatch: New tool for tracking measures to mitigate social, economic impact of COVID-19	Governments, social partners, businesses and other institutions have moved swiftly to implement measures to control the spread of COVID-19 across Europe and to mitigate the social and economic impact of the pandemic. In order to track these diverse initiatives across Europe, Eurofound has launched COVID-19 EU PolicyWatch, a new database collating and mapping the policy responses introduced in Member States, along with the UK and Norway, during this critical period. In the space of just a few weeks, the COVID-19 pandemic radically transformed working life across the globe, placing enormous strain on businesses and workers. Many companies turned to short-time work schemes, re-orienting of working arrangements or the shutting down of operations to comply with the necessary social distancing requirements. Consequently, a growing number of businesses have come under threat, putting the jobs of more and more workers at risk. Policymakers – including governments, support institutions, social partners and other social actors – moved swiftly to mitigate the social and economic consequences of these measures on businesses and workers. Eurofound’s COVID-19 EU PolicyWatch database provides an overview of the policy measures introduced since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, creating a pool of information with details of specific company practices in each country. The database includes large-scale government measures and wider collective agreements, as well as regional and local initiatives and support measures for smaller groups of workers. As the situation is continuously evolving, measures are implemented, changed or replaced at rapid speed. It is planned to update the cases in July and October 2020 with information on the uptake of prominent measures.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0014	2020-10-08	UNK	Easing of restrictions sparked boost in mental well-being across Europe with largest increases for older people; but young people, unemployed cause for concern	Mental well-being among people in Europe improved between the April and July waves of Eurofound’s Living, working and COVID-19 surveys, with the largest increases among those aged 50 and over. On a national level, reported mental well-being was highest in Denmark, Slovenia and the Netherlands, and marked improvements were seen in France and Italy – coinciding with an easing of confinement measures over the summer. Despite broad improvements in a number of well-being and quality of life indicators over the summer months, comparatively low reported mental well-being was recorded among younger people and the unemployed; this is cause for concern, particularly considering that mental well-being has traditionally been higher among younger age groups. Eurofound’s unique Living, working and COVID-19 research looks in detail at the experiences of citizens in both April, when much of Europe was under heavy restriction, and July, when restrictions had been eased according with a relative retreat of the coronavirus. The full report details the social, economic, labour market, and quality of life findings of a total of 87,477 respondents across the EU. Notable improvements can be seen related to mental well-being, life satisfaction and optimism between the two surveys, although from a very low base in some Member States. The WHO-5 mental well-being index was used in the surveys as an indicator of people’s moods over the previous two weeks, based on five statements of positive feelings, with mental well-being measured on a scale of 0 to 100. Respondents in Denmark (61), Slovenia (58), the Netherlands (57) and Finland (56) indicated the highest mental well-being in July. Respondents in Romania (48) and Cyprus (48) had the lowest mental well-being. Overall, mental well-being in the EU increased from 49 in April to 53 in July, with the largest increases observed in Bulgaria (7 points), France (6 points) and Italy (6 points). When an analysis according to population groups is applied, respondents unable to work due to health reasons and unemployed respondents had the lowest mental well-being in July, though both groups experienced an improvement since April. Retired respondents had the highest results. Improvements were also seen with regards to loneliness, something that could be expected from the easing of restrictions. The proportion of respondents overall who felt lonely ‘all’ or ‘most of the time’ dropped from 16% in April to 13% in July. Gender differences in terms of loneliness were small, but there were large differences across age groups, with young respondents still reporting loneliness most frequently (16% in July, down from 20% in April), followed by the middle age group (14%, down from 15%) and those aged 50 and over (11%, down from 15%). Improved findings in mental well-being and loneliness were reflected in levels of optimism and life satisfaction. In the first round of the survey, 45% of respondents expressed optimism about the future; this was 49% in the second round. Despite expressing lower mental well-being, respondents under 35 were significantly more optimistic than older groups, with 57% of this group feeling optimistic in July, in contrast to just 48% of 35- to 49-year-olds and 46% of those aged 50 or over. Statistically significant improvements in life satisfaction were also recorded among respondents in 16 Member States, mostly notably in France, Greece and Italy. Speaking about the findings, Massimiliano Mascherini, Eurofound Head of Unit for Social Policies, said ‘Improvements in mental well-being, life satisfaction and optimism for the future across Europe between April and July are heartening – particularly for southern and eastern Europe where indicators were particularly low. These improvements occurred alongside the relative easing of COVID-19 restrictions. This research will be important for Europe’s broader economic and social responses to this pandemic, particularly from a longer- term perspective.’ Read more: Webinar: Sign up now: Being young in the COVID-19 pandemic Publication: Living, working and COVID-19 Data: Quality of life and quality of society during COVID-19 WHO: World Mental Health Day 2020 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/easing-of-restrictions-sparked-boost-in-mental-well-being-across-europe-with-largest-increases-for

The European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) has published guidance for workplaces, compiling the most significant information and advice available on the coronavirus outbreak. The guidance covers several areas: Risk assessment and appropriate measures Involving workers Taking care of workers who have been ill Planning and learning for the future Staying well informed Information for sectors and occupations Speaking on the publishing of the guidance, European Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights, Nicolas Schmit, said: Today, more than ever, it is very clear that protecting and promoting occupational safety and health is of the utmost importance for workers, companies, social protection systems and the whole society. This guidance provides answers to practical questions that employers have, for instance on how to minimise exposure to coronavirus in the workplace, how to update their risk assessment, taking care of workers who have been ill. It will help employers and businesses in managing the return to work and in providing practical advice to the staff.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0017	2020-03-26	UNK	COVID-19 could permanently change teleworking in Europe	The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic presents unprecedented health, social and economic challenges for Europe, and has profound implications for the way people live and work across the globe. One of the changes that it is already having is the proportion of people working from home, as governments put in place social distancing and isolation measures. Eurofound research shows which countries already had the highest rates of people doing telework, or ICT-based mobile work, in Europe. In 2015, around one-fifth of workers did some form of telework or ICT-based mobile work — meaning they worked, either occasionally or regularly, from somewhere other than a main place of work. There was quite a wide range of variance between Member States: Italy recorded just 8% of workers doing telework/ICT-based mobile work, whereas in Denmark it was 38%. The reason for this diversity across Europe was a combination of factors, such as a country’s affinity for technology; the availability and quality of its technological infrastructure; management culture and the drive for higher productivity within companies; and employees’ needs for spatial and temporal flexibility to balance work demands with family commitments and other personal responsibilities. The full impacts of COVID-19 on the labour market are still to be seen, however, it is likely that rates of telework in Europe, and as a result employer/employee relationships, will be changed permanently. image_covid_news_item_26032020.jpg Data: Percentage of workers doing telework and ICT-based mobile work  	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/covid-19-could-permanently-change-teleworking-in-europe

EUROFOUND_UNK_0019	2020-05-07	UNK	New pan-EU survey highlights plummeting optimism, low trust levels, alongside rising fears of job loss and financial insecurity	The first results from Eurofound’s Living, working and COVID-19 online survey show a Europe grappling to respond to the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic with many respondents reporting high levels of loneliness coupled with low levels of optimism about their future. Overall, people are showing some decrease in their well-being. People across the EU are also reporting very low levels of trust in the EU and in their national governments. The survey findings also confirm an increase in telework and, for a growing number of respondents, a feeling of insecurity regarding their jobs with a dramatic decrease in working time. Finally, the survey paints a stark picture of Europeans across the 27 Member States who have seen their economic situation worsen and are deeply concerned about their financial future. Publication: Living, working and COVID-19: First findings – April 2020 The crisis caused by the pandemic has had a strong effect on people’s optimism about their future. In April 2020, less than half (46%) of EU respondents were optimistic about their own future compared to almost two-thirds (64%) as recorded in the European Quality of Life Survey in 2016. Respondents from the most heavily hit countries in the EU (France, Italy, Belgium, Spain) were all among those least optimistic about their future and below the EU average. At European level, mental well-being has also been affected with the lowest rates (on a scale 0-100) among those unable to work due to disability or illness (37) and those unemployed (39). People aged 50 or over had higher mental well-being (50) than those under 35 and those in between (both scoring 47). At European level 16% of respondents also said that they were lonely “all or most of the time” over the previous two weeks, with 20% of young respondents (under 35) feeling this way. Overall, loneliness was most common among respondents in France (22%) and least common in Finland (9%). This is strikingly different from usual findings in other surveys: in the 2016 EQLS overall loneliness was just 6%, decreasing to 4% for under-35s. Trust levels have also been clearly affected during this period with highest levels reported in healthcare systems. Even countries hardest hit by the pandemic such as Belgium, Italy, Spain and France, are reporting trust in healthcare systems above the EU average and well ahead of trust in their governments, the media and the EU. On the other hand, people across the EU report very low levels of trust in the EU in the wake of COVID-19, particularly in several traditionally pro-EU Member States such as France, Italy and Spain, raising fundamental questions about perceived EU action during the crisis. Teleworking has taken off in all EU countries with over a third of those in employment starting to work remotely as a result of the pandemic. The highest number of those working from home was reported in the Nordic and Benelux countries. These jobs also reported fewer cuts in working time. Almost a quarter of all those working remotely have children under 12. But while more people are teleworking than ever before, one quarter of respondents also reported having lost their job either temporarily or permanently - with young men most affected. Half of respondents are seeing a reduction in their working hours, especially in Romania, Italy, France, Cyprus and Greece. The Nordic countries have reported the fewest reductions in working time. Unsurprisingly then perhaps, almost 40% s report their financial situation as worse than before the pandemic. Close to half are indicating their households cannot make ends meet and over half of all EU respondents report they cannot maintain their standard of living without an income. People’s fears about their financial future vary greatly between Member States, with the lowest levels of anxiety reported in Denmark (10%) and highest in Bulgaria (62%). Further reading: Data: Living, working and COVID-19 data Topic: COVID-19 Topic: Trust Forthcoming publication: Living, working and COVID-19 (Overview report) Living, working and COVID-19 web survey To investigate the impact of the crisis on wellbeing, work and telework and on the financial situation of Europeans, Eurofound launched an online survey Living, working and COVID-19 on 9 April.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0020	2020-03-24	UNK	Europe’s pre-existing household debt condition likely to be exacerbated by virus crisis	The coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis, and the economic and social challenges that it entails, comes at a time when many vulnerable groups in Europe were already exposed to debt and arrears, according to Eurofound’s new research on household indebtedness. The pandemic could also exacerbate an already divergent situation in the EU, with some countries in southern and eastern Europe disproportionately affected by debt, arrears and risk of poverty. The new report, based on an analysis of the 2016 European Quality of Life Survey, shows that debt and risk of poverty were disproportionately problematic in southern and eastern Europe. This was most notably the situation in Greece, where over half of those surveyed reported being in arrears; in total, 52% said they were in arrears in rent or mortgages, consumer credit, loans from family or friends, or utility and phone bills. At 36%, Croatia had the second highest proportion that reported being in arrears, and in Bulgaria 31% reported being in arrears. Across the EU and the United Kingdom, 14% reported being in arrears, with wide variance between Member States. In Sweden just 4% reported being in arrears. These figures do not capture people with high levels of indebtedness who do not have arrears or immediate difficulties making ends meet – for whom this crisis can turn their indebtedness instantly into over-indebtedness. Publication: Addressing household over-indebtedness Eurofound’s research emphasises that over-indebtedness can spiral into greater financial problems, and takes its toll on already strained mental well-being for sections of the population. For example, from 2017 to 2018 there was an increase of arrears among single parents at risk of poverty. This reinforces research from Eurofound’s previous report on Household composition and well-being, which highlighted risk of poverty and social exclusion among single parents, as well as single-person households. Publication: Household composition and well-being After the global financial crisis in 2007, many countries strengthened their institutional responses to over-indebtedness. Debt advisory services became more widely available and accessible in a number of Member States. However, even in countries with well-established services, people experienced problems accessing them. The new reality in which Europe finds itself risks deepening this problem further. Immediate actions being taken in a number of Member States on rent, mortgage and utility payments will give many households and businesses breathing space, but the issue will need to be looked at in a more structured way in the long-term. There should also be a specific regard for the self-employed, whose household and business finances are in practice often hard to separate out fully, and business debts can cause private over-indebtedness. With regards to measures that can contribute to preventing over-indebtedness, credit regulation, financial education and social protection are all areas in which the EU plays an important role – with adequate social protection being particularly important in times of economic shocks. On debt settlement procedures, the report shows that there is a case for EU action to ensure their availability, enable countries to learn from practices elsewhere, avoid access problems, and guarantee a level of well-being for people undergoing such procedures – including some level of protection of their home. Speaking about the findings, Juan Menéndez-Valdés, Eurofound Executive Director, said 'This report clearly shows that over-indebtedness was already an issue for many people in Europe. The new situation, severely impacting individual earnings and household debt, as well as potentially the proportion of people in arrears, needs to be urgently addressed in a coordinated way to avoid deepening negative consequences for Europe’s economy and broader society.' image_overindebtedness_news_24032020.png Datawrapper: Proportion of people at risk of over-indebtedness European Commission: Coronavirus response  	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/europes-pre-existing-household-debt-condition-likely-to-be-exacerbated-by-virus-crisis
EUROFOUND_UNK_0021	2019-11-11	UNK	Eurofound adopts ambitious work programme for 2020	Eurofound’s Management Board has adopted an ambitious work programme for the organisation for 2020, the last of the current multiannual programme for 2017-2020. In a landmark meeting, which saw the election of the Chair and Vice-Chairs - as well as a keynote presentation by Joost Korte, Director General of DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion - the decision by the Management Board reaffirms Eurofound’s important role in providing EU-level decision makers, as well as relevant national level policymakers, comparative information to improve the working lives and quality of life of people in Europe. The work programme adopted for next year acknowledges the need for Eurofound to be able to react to new and emerging information needs of policy makers in a rapidly changing labour market. For this reason, in addition to the six strategic areas of intervention on which the Agency bases its work, Eurofound will continue to take account of changing priorities and developments. Highlights for the coming year include new Flagship reports on Working conditions and sustainable work; Industrial relations; and Labour market change. These Flagship reports showcase Eurofound’s extensive research in these areas, highlighting challenges and prospects for future policy debate and action. Together with Cedefop, Eurofound will also launch the much-anticipated new European Company Survey, which documents workplace practices in relation to work organisation, human resource management, skills use, skills strategies, digitalisation, direct employee participation and social dialogue in over 25,000 establishments in all EU Member States. Other decisions taken by the Management Board included the re-election of Aviana Bulgarelli as Chair; Ms Bulgarelli represents the Governments Group in Eurofound’s tripartite management structure. Stefan Gran, from the Confederation of German Trade Unions, Stefania Rossi, from the General Confederation of Italian Industry, and Barbara Kauffmann, from the European Commission, were appointed Vice-Chairs. Maria Jepsen, Eurofound’s new Deputy Director, also addressed the Management Board for the first time. Ms Jepsen is an economist by training, with over 25 years experience conducting research on labour market issues and the European social dimension. Director General of DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion Joost Korte gave a comprehensive address to the Management Board on the priorities of the incoming Commission – with a particular emphasis on the Commission’s work around minimum wages, the labour conditions of platform workers, the design of a European Unemployment Benefit Reinsurance Scheme, the European Child Guarantee, and continued implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights and the European Youth Guarantee. Mr Korte noted Eurofound’s contribution to these areas, particularly on platform work and minimum wages, and the close alignment between the priorities of the Agency under its multiannual programme and those of the European Commission.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/eurofound-adopts-ambitious-work-programme-for-2020
EUROFOUND_UNK_0022	2020-03-06	UNK	EU Datathon 2020: Creating an economy that works for people – Eurofound data provides critical contribution	Eurofound’s pan-European data on quality of life and economic developments at regional level is being made available as part of EU Datathon 2020. The EU Datathons are annual open data competitions organised by the Publications Office of the EU to create new value for citizens through innovation and promoting the use of open data produced by the EU institutions. Publications Office of the European Union: The EU Datathon 2020 Eurofound will guide entrants in the competition through the 2016 European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) and 2019 European Jobs Monitor. The 2016 European Quality of Life Survey interviewed nearly 37,000 people in 33 countries – the (then) 28 EU Member States and 5 candidate countries (Albania, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey). The European Quality of Life Survey is the EU's premier source of quality of life data and analyses conducted so far have already revealed general improvements in optimism and satisfaction with living standards since 2011 - with overall life satisfaction and happiness levels remaining stable. However, regional analyses have shown significant discrepancies in quality of life in different parts of Europe, a higher quality of life and life satisfaction in capital regions compared to other regions, and a larger proportion of people struggling to make ends meet in rural Europe.

This included how happy they felt, their optimism about the future, their ability to deal with problems, and their ability to make ends meet. Quality of public services Respondents were asked to evaluate a range of public services in their country, including: health services, education system, public transport, childcare services, long-term care services, social housing and the state pension system. Quality of society Respondents were asked about their living conditions, future prospects and perceptions of society. They also responded to questions indicating their levels of trust in institutions such as national governments, the legal system, the EU, and the media. Eurofound's 2019 European Jobs Monitor underlined the economic determinants of many regional imbalances, by revealing that employment grew by 19% in capital city regions in the EU’s largest Member States between 2002 and 2017, compared to 10-12% in other domestic regions. Overall, capital regions have disproportionately benefitted from the economic ‘services shift’ and changes brought about by globalisation. The data in the report analyses regional shifts in employment over 15 years in Belgium, Germany, UK, France, Italy, Poland, Czechia, Sweden and Spain; 130 regions in total. Creating an economy that works for people is one of the key priorities of the new European Commission, and one of the main themes of this year's Datathon. By using the data that Eurofound is providing, participating teams are invited to create applications that address underlying policy and societal challenges, create new services for citizens and businesses and provide valuable new insights to participating institutions.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0023	2020-03-02	UNK	Stagnating gender employment gap costs Europe €360 billion per year	New calculations from Eurofound show that the difference in female and male employment rates cost the EU, including the United Kingdom, over €360 billion in 2018. This updated aggregate figure builds upon previous research done by Eurofound on the gender employment gap in 2013. Eurofound researchers have noted that reductions in the cost of the gender employment gap in the EU stagnated between 2015 and 2018, and there are indications that it may be starting to grow again; partially driven by recovery in employment in male-dominated industries. Upward convergence was recorded between 2008 and 2015, with an overall reduction of the gender employment gap and of Member State disparities. Since 2015 it has stagnated at 11.6 percentage points. At national level, the largest reductions in the gap between female and male employment between 2015 and 2018 were recorded in Malta (4.9 percentage points) and Luxembourg (3.7 percentage points). However, the gap increased in several Member States, such as Greece (increase of 3 percentage points) and Cyprus (increase of 2.1 percentage points) – this is despite them each having seen significant reductions in employment between women and men over the previous 10 years. In 2018, Malta recorded the largest gender employment gap in the EU (22 percentage points), and Lithuania recorded the smallest (2.3 percentage points). Eurofound's new calculations on the cost of the gender employment gap come as the European Commission launches an ambitious new strategy to deal with gender inequality in Europe – including proposals on improving women's access to the labour market and strengthening gender equality at work. Commenting on findings on the impact of sectoral employment recovery, Martina Bisello, Eurofound Research Officer, said 'European labour markets are still characterised by a high level of sectoral segregation. The recovery in employment in male-dominated industries such as manufacturing, construction and transportation has to some extent contributed to the stagnation of the gender employment gap in recent years. These positive trends in male employment are to be welcomed and we should now seek to further improve the employment rates of women in Europe.' Speaking about the overall implications of these findings for policy in Europe, Massimiliano Mascherini, Eurofound Head of Unit for Social Policies, said 'The stagnation of the gender employment gap between 2015 and 2018, and its associated costs, ended a decade-long trend in comprehensive reductions in the employment gap between women and men – now is the right time for innovative new policies to improve women's access to the labour market.'

The highest proportions of young adults living with their parents in 2017 were in southern and eastern EU Member States, as well as in Ireland.         These data are presented as part of Eurofound’s research on Household composition and well-being, which shows how demographic change, social progress and economic cycles have impacted on household composition in Europe.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0025	2019-11-27	UNK	Second-generation EU migrants outperform natives on the labour market	Second-generation migrants with an EU background are more likely to be employed and in high-performing positions, such as managerial roles, than first-generation migrants – and even outperform natives in terms of employment rate. Having a European background plays a significant role: 81% of second-generation migrants with at least one parent born in the EU are in employment, compared to 74% of second-generation migrants with a non-EU background. Overall, first generation migrants are more likely to be in employment than natives in several Member States, as most move in search of work. Again, European background makes a difference as just two-thirds of first-generation migrants with a non-EU background are in employment, 13% below the native population. Eurofound’s policy brief 'How your birthplace affects your workplace' uses national and EU-level data, including the European Working Conditions Survey, to analyse the employment and labour market progression of workers with a migrant background, compared to workers with no migrant background. It finds that having a foreign background – as is the case for one-fifth of the working-age population in the EU – has a profound overall impact on employment prospects, progression and working conditions. Overall, Eurofound’s analysis shows that workers with a foreign background are more likely to face difficult working conditions and less secure contractual arrangements. For example, they are more likely to have a precarious contract, with first-generation migrants making up 14% of fixed-term contract workers, compared to 10% for those with no migrant background. Workers with a foreign background are also more likely to work 20 hours or less in their main job. Both first-generation and second-generation migrants are more likely to work a second job to top-up their income than workers with no migrant background. Although there is evidence of strong labour market progression between first- and second-generation migrants, it seems that disadvantage due to background is more widespread for female workers. Not only are employment rates generally higher among male than female migrants, in 6 out of the 23 EU countries where data are available, female second-generation migrants have the lowest employment rates among the categories analysed. This new research builds upon a previous analysis from Eurofound in 2018, stressing that region of origin, timing of migration, reason for migration and socioeconomic context play a significant role in determining labour market outcomes. In fact, region of origin is one of the greatest determinants of labour market progression and can remain so for generations. Workers of North African origin, and female workers of Asian origin, were found to be most disadvantaged, and were more likely to suffer this disadvantage into the second generation and beyond. Eurofound’s research highlights the clear need for a nuanced approach to policymaking, that recognises the differences between first- and second-generation migrant workers – with a specific emphasis on the effective integration of women with a foreign background into the labour force Publication: How your birthplace affects your workplace   Image © Shutterstock/fizkes	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/second-generation-eu-migrants-outperform-natives-on-the-labour-market
EUROFOUND_UNK_0026	2019-10-24	UNK	Improved public services key to better quality of life in Europe	Levels of trust and social cohesion have recovered overall in the EU since the financial crisis, perceived social exclusion has declined and there has been an increase in active citizenship and civic engagement. At the same time, however, nearly half of all Member States reported lower levels of average trust in national institutions in 2016 than previously and perceptions of tensions – between ethnic or racial groups, and between religious groups – were also more common than before the crisis, resulting in a significantly negative impact on trust in institutions. People with lower levels of perceived security in terms of housing, employment or old-age income have considerably lower trust in institutions than those with higher levels of certainty. These findings, based mainly on research carried out since 2016, are the result of a comprehensive review of the state of play regarding access to and quality of key services – health, long-term care, childcare and education presented in Eurofound’s flagship report ‘Challenges and prospects in the EU: Quality of life and public services’. While the results present an uneven picture regarding service quality, they also give indications of how to offer more satisfactory support. Public services are recognised as a cornerstone of the European Pillar of Social Rights, with a particular focus on promoting access to quality services for all. Assessments of the quality of public services (particularly health care and childcare) have improved, particularly in countries where quality ratings were previously low. High levels of active citizenship and civic engagement reflect positive benefits, with great potential for further investment in this area to boost trust and cohesion. Rates of loneliness, poor mental health and social exclusion are particularly high for older people in central and eastern Europe – in part due to poorly developed care services. There are also strong indications of increased risk of mental health problems among those aged 12–24 years, with many hard groups to reach, such as persons with chronic health problems, living in rural areas and not in education or employment. And while satisfaction with different aspects of health care has improved, many people were dissatisfied with being informed and consulted about their care – and this proportion was higher among people with low income. This flagship report brings together in-depth contributions in the area of quality of society and public services, based mainly on research carried out since 2016. Recognising the fact that the quality of people’s lives is profoundly influenced by their access to quality provision in areas such as education, health, housing and social services, the report pays particular attention to regional and social inequalities and, where possible, changes over time. Eurofound’s approach to quality of life in Europe is grounded in a concept linked to Eurofound’s mission and therefore relevance to the needs of policymakers among public authorities and social partners. It recognised that people’s everyday lives are played out in the context of living in a community and a society, framed by particular institutions and policies. Eurofound’s work consistently seeks to document and analyse the past with a view to helping to better shape and improve the future. Drawing on its wide-ranging analysis of quality of life and society in the European Union over many years, Eurofound aims to use this information, data and analysis to assist policymakers in understanding the progress made, defining the challenges which have emerged and outlining the steps that could be taken to improve the lives of all people living in the EU.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0027	2019-10-15	UNK	Just one in three workers with limiting chronic disease in adapted workplace	Just one in three workers in the EU whose daily activities are severely or somewhat limited by a chronic disease report that their workplace has been adapted to accommodate their health problem. This means that most workers in Europe with a limiting health condition are not being supported in terms of workplace adaptation. Eurofound’s new policy brief on how to respond to chronic health problems in the workplace combines European Working Conditions Survey and other EU and national level data to examine the prevalence and impact of chronic disease at work. It emphasises that long-standing health issues among workers will become an increasingly significant issue for Europe in the coming decades. Europe has an ageing workforce, and a quarter of the EU working population already reports having a chronic disease. This share increased by 8 percentage points between 2010 and 2017. Workers over the age of 50 are more than twice as likely to have a chronic illness as workers under 35; but even among younger workers the share reporting chronic illness is rising - from 11% in 2010 to 18% in 2017 for under 30s. Some of the more common reported chronic conditions include musculoskeletal disorders, mental health conditions and cardiovascular disease. This research on chronic disease has also highlighted inequalities in the labour market. Workers with low educational attainment and those in low-skilled occupations are not only more likely to have a chronic disease and experience limitations in their daily activities, they are also less likely to benefit from workplace accommodation. Reacting to this particular finding, Oscar Vargas-Llave, one of the researchers behind the project, commented 'the issue that people with lower educational attainment and those in lower-skilled occupations are more likely to be affected by chronic disease reflects the link between chronic illness and material deprivation, but the fact that they are less likely to have their workplaces suitably adapted raises the broader issue of fairness on the labour market'. Workplace adaptation is fundamental to ensure that workers with limiting chronic disease are engaged in quality and sustainable work. The policy brief notes that workers who have benefited from workplace accommodation report improved job quality and reduced stress, making it more likely for their employment to be sustainable. Effective accommodation does not have to be costly and contributes to the retention of highly skilled workers. At the same time, over 40% of people with a limiting chronic disease who have had their workplace adapted believe that further accommodation will be required in the future, showing there is no one-off fix for this issue. Eurofound’s policy brief points to a number of areas for policy and legislative action, in particular that, despite the encompassing nature of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities definition of disability, significant variation and uncertainty remains on the protection of individuals with chronic disease in national legislation and policy. The growing challenges posed by chronic illness in the workforce necessitate further clarification, and guidance is needed on the coverage of chronic sickness in the context of EU non-discrimination legislation, particularly related to the right to reasonable accommodation. A review of the European Disability Strategy should seek to address this issue.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0028	2019-10-03	UNK	Workers in newer Member States expected to work three weeks more per year	Workers in Member States that joined the EU after May 2004 were expected to work close to three full working weeks per year more than those in ‘older’ Member States in 2018. Throughout the EU, the average collectively agreed annual working time was approximately 1,714 hours in 2018. However, Eurofound’s analysis shows that for older Member States the average was 1,687 hours, and for newer Member States it was 1,803. This is a difference of 116 hours, or the equivalent to three working weeks. Eurofound’s latest biennial review of working time charts developments in a range of working time issues in the EU and Norway in 2017–2018. It finds that while the average collectively agreed working week across the EU remains unchanged since 2016 – at 38 hours – there was a slight decrease in the past two years in the 15 Member States that joined the EU before 2004 (EU15). Workers in newer Member States (EU13) work longer, a trend which is increasing in all sectors analysed, except for banking where working time decreased in newer Member States and stayed stable in the EU15. At national level, the EU’s longest annual collectively agreed working hours are in Estonia (1,848 hours), where collective bargaining does not play a significant role in defining working time standards. The shortest annual working hours are found in France (1,602 hours), followed by Denmark, Sweden and Germany. This means that in 2018, according to the collectively agreed hours, workers in Estonia were supposed to work approximately 246 hours, or six weeks, more than their counterparts in France. Eurofound’s analysis shows that, on a sectoral level, the banking sector continued to have the shortest average agreed normal working week in 2018 (37.5 hours), and the retail sector the longest (38.3 hours). In terms of collectively agreed paid annual leave, the average across the EU was 23.8 days, but was notably lower in newer Member States. The trend observed in 2017-2018 of increasing actual working hours in newer Member States, while hours in older Member States remain stable, combined with differences in entitlement to annual leave, means that there is currently a reversal of the process of convergence in working time that has been taking place in recent years. This is likely to be an issue of policy concern, as ensuring convergence across various aspects of working life, including working time, is a priority for the EU.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0029	2019-10-07	UNK	Capital gains: Employment growth in EU capitals outstrips other regions over 15-year period	Employment grew by 19% in capital city regions in the EU’s largest Member States between 2002 and 2017, compared to 10-12% in other domestic regions. This employment growth has been reflected in the growing national economic weight of capital regions, with cities such as London, Paris and Stockholm accounting for 30% and more of the GDP of their respective countries. These findings from the 2019 European Jobs Monitor which analyses shifts in the employment structure in 130 regions in nine larger Member States (accounting for nearly four out of five EU workers), confirm that, while the EU has been successful in reducing economic disparities between Member States, inequalities between regions within countries have increased in recent years. Capital city regions in particular have benefitted from the ‘services shift’ and from globalisation, generating a disproportionate share of new well-paid employment across the EU. Just over 70% of employment is now in services, but this share rises to 85% and above in many capital regions – with a skew in particular to highly paid sectors such as financial services, professional services and information and communication. At the same time, capital city regions also appear to be a significant vector of employment polarisation, with high shares of well-paid, high-skilled employment in knowledge-intensive services accompanied by increasing share of low-paid employment. Looking at measures that can help to create more regionally balanced employment growth within Member States, the report highlights that the increasingly digital and location-independent nature of much work, enabled by universal high-quality broadband availability, can help to redress the situation. However, it also observes that good-quality employment - which could, in principle, often be carried out remotely or virtually – has in practice tended to cluster more and not less in large, urban, and often capital city, regions. The report also notes that regional mobility has traditionally been seen as an antidote to unbalanced regional growth, with individuals motivated to transfer from declining regions to higher growth ones. Although this can be an important safety-valve, it can also run the risk of making unfavoured regions even more ‘left behind’, with depleted human capital. The need for labour market and economic integration is just as great for regions as individuals, notably those regions beset by industrial decline or depopulation. As recent voting data in many countries shows, neglected regions can wield more power electorally as their economies weaken. Balanced and sustainable employment and economic growth across regions remains a challenge not just for the Member States but for the EU as a whole. The new report ‘European Jobs Monitor 2019: Shifts in the employment structure at regional level’ is a joint Eurofound-European Commission Joint Research Centre publication. The main regional analysis in the report focuses on the following nine member states – Belgium, Germany, UK, France, Italy, Poland, Czechia, Sweden and Spain; 130 regions in total.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0030	2019-10-11	UNK	Young people, particularly those low qualified, bear the brunt of social inequalities in Spain	This week Spain celebrates the Fiesta Nacional, and we mark the occasion by sharing our research data, findings and analysis to provide a snapshot of the country’s living and working conditions. Eurofound has been monitoring and reporting on living and working conditions in Spain, in comparison to other EU Member States, since before its accession to the EU in 1986. Spain has continued to record relatively strong economic growth and rapid job creation for the fifth consecutive year, giving the Spanish economy a much-needed boost in the aftermath of the economic crisis. Strong job creation has led to a significant increase in the number of people in employment and a resulting decline in the unemployment. Most recent data, however, shows there is some slowdown in job creation and the unemployment rate has yet to recover to the pre-crisis level, remaining the second highest in the EU. This is one of the main social concerns, particularly in the context of growing economic uncertainty, and unemployment remaining a principal cause of poverty. The situation of young people is of particular concern, with a high early school leaving rate and a youth unemployment rate of 38.6% recorded in June 2019 ­­­­- more than double the EU average. Although the early school leaving rate has been decreasing, it is still the third highest across the EU28 at close to 20%, and well above the EU average of 10.7%. This contrasts with a relatively high share of young people completing tertiary education. Spain, like other EU Member States, faces growing levels of automation and digitalisation, which are predicted to reduce the number of employment opportunities available for the large cohort of young unskilled workers. Regarding the well-known segmentation of the Spanish labour market in terms of indefinite and temporary employment, the situation has only slightly improved over the years. And again, the highest concern is with youth, with more than 70% of young workers in Spain engaged on temporary employment contracts, which is significantly higher than EU averages. Though hourly wages have recovered to above pre-crisis levels, there has been a significant rise in the numbers engaged in part-time work. This has helped many to improve their economic situation and find a path to out of unemployment, however, part-time work for those working short-hours or in low wage employment is one of the main reasons for in-work poverty. Spanish income inequality remains high compared to the EU average, with the richest 20% of households in the country earning an income 6.5 times that of the poorest 20%, above the EU28 average of 5.1. Prolonged high rates of youth unemployment, relatively low educational attainment levels, low wages (particularly for part-timers) and a high level of temporary employment are some of factors driving young people to engage in platform work as a source of employment, or indeed to supplement a low income. While new forms of employment offer additional ways to be integrated into the labour market, there has been a growing debate about some types of platform work, particularly with regard to the employment status of workers, their social protection and rights, and compliance with other regulations. Spanish courts have recently ruled in favour of the existence of an employment relationship between the platform and the worker. This is an area of negotiation adept for social partners, particularly in a country with relatively strong social dialogue and collective bargaining practices. Social partners are best placed to find the right balance to seize the opportunities of the platform economy and avoid the deterioration of working conditions and the social protection of workers. The long-lasting impact of the crisis, which has not yet fully recovered, particularly in terms of working hours and income inequality, may have had a pronounced impact on trust, with just 25% of Spaniards trusting national government and state institutions, as detailed in Eurofound’s research Societal change and trust in institutions. This low figure was recorded in 2016, before more recent political turbulences which may have further exacerbated discontent. Despite a welcome recovery in the job market and rapid economic growth in recent years, social recovery cannot yet be considered fully achieved, particularly if the country wants to be resilient to future changes in the economic cycle. Many young and low skilled workers still face relevant problems, and the aforementioned issues have not helped to increase the level of trust in the institutions tasked with addressing these challenges.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0031	2019-06-20	UNK	How can public services work more effectively to integrate refugees and asylum seekers?	Today is World Refugee Day, the international day to show solidarity and support to refugees. Eurofound has just published a new report, coinciding with this occasion, looking at the role of public services in integrating refugees and asylum seekers. Following the influx of over three million asylum seekers into the European Union in the three-year period 2015–2017, Member States faced a number of challenges related to integrating the newly arrived into their country. This report explores the role of public services – specifically housing, social services, health and education services – in the social and economic integration of refugees and asylum seekers. It aims to identify the factors that hinder this process and the elements that contribute to successful integration.  The overall focus is on destination countries, particularly the three countries most affected by the inflow of refugees and asylum seekers: Austria, Germany and Sweden.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0032	2019-09-26	UNK	Better together: Robust upward convergence in employment and socioeconomic conditions strengthens the future of Europe	Strong upward convergence in employment and socioeconomic conditions has emerged between EU Member States over the past 20 years despite the negative effects of the economic crisis, according to new research from Eurofound. ‘Upward convergence in employment and socioeconomic factors’ provides an in-depth look at the issue of upward convergence – a trend whereby Member States’ performance improves, while the gaps between Member States diminish. These trends paint an increasingly positive picture of progress in the European Union at this critical juncture. Sometimes regarded as a niche or technical domain, convergence is an area of intrinsic public interest as it underpins the fundamental EU objective of improving the lives of citizens and reducing inequality in Europe. Achieving upward convergence is of critical importance to the European Union at this time as increasing disparities among Member States potentially threaten cohesion by counteracting citizens’ expectations that EU membership tangibly improve working and living conditions. Eurofound’s new report is based on 21 indicators related closely to the Social Scoreboard of the European Pillar of Social Rights Two different dynamics of upward convergence can be identified: one is the steady and robust trends over the entire period considered, in terms of improvement in levels and reduction of disparities among Member States (for indicators such as education and gender gaps, as well as the activity rate). The other is the cyclical trends exhibiting a considerable degree of correlation with the business cycle, both in terms of averages and variability (for indicators such as labour market participation and exclusion, as well as poverty). For those indicators showing upward convergence in good times (with improvements and lower dispersion) and downward divergence in bad times (with deterioration in levels and higher dispersion), non-euro zone countries converge more quickly than their euro zone counterparts. These are the areas in which Member States should become more resilient in order to avoid future asymmetric shocks. The report also notes the importance of regional aspects of convergence, in addition to differences between Member States. It found that disparities in socioeconomic and labour market indicators are generally greater among EU regions that between countries, which see a more pronounced convergence process. The report analyses two proposals to facilitate social and economic convergence: the European unemployment insurance (EUI) scheme, and the European minimum wage (EMW). It projects that an EUI scheme would promote both macroeconomic risk reduction and convergence in socioeconomic conditions for the unemployed. However, there are potential pitfalls and difficulties in implementation that would need to be tackled. The EMW could potentially support greater convergence in disposable incomes and reduce the number of working poor but risks negatively impacting youth and low-skilled employment, as well as impact the autonomy of national and social partners in wage determination. Eurofound’s research is part of the continuous monitoring of upward convergence required to reduce economic and social inequality between Member States. Taking into account the challenges that Europe currently faces, effective policy measures are required to strengthen Member States’ resilience and avoid asymmetric propagation of further macro-economic shocks.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0033	2019-06-28	UNK	EU on the horizon? Eurofound explores quality of life in the candidate countries	Wind in their sails? At the time of Eurofound’s latest EQLS, there was high optimism for the future in most EU candidate countries. There are high levels of optimism for the future in most EU candidate countries – including for future generations. However, current material hardships, deprivation, urban-rural disparities, gender inequalities and demographic ageing are fundamental challenges, and could undermine the current positive climate and future social cohesion. At this pivotal time in the EU enlargement process, Eurofound’s European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) provides unique insight into life in the candidate countries, based on a detailed analysis of a range of indicators on living conditions and quality of society. EU candidate countries score below the EU average on several indicators such as housing inadequacies, energy poverty and material deprivation. Reported mental health is also below EU average, and most countries register considerable gaps between women and men in domestic and care-related work. However, in terms of perceived quality of public services, candidate countries appear to be at less of a disadvantage than some eastern European Member States in several areas, particularly in the wake of the 2008 economic crisis. There are relatively large differences between rural and urban areas in terms of both quality of life and the quality of public and local services. This is a particular challenge in the candidate countries as they have large rural populations. Eurofound’s research notes that improving quality of life at local level will be challenging due to the pattern of trust in candidate countries. Unlike most EU Member States, where local authorities are trusted more than national institutions, local authorities do not have this relative advantage in the candidate countries and may find it difficult to bring forward necessary change and reform. The EQLS shows that social cohesion comes under strain on a number of fronts in some candidate countries. Considerable sections of society report high levels of social exclusion as well as poor mental health; these include older age groups and people on low incomes. In addition, a relatively large proportion of respondents in some candidate countries report tensions between rich and poor and between management and workers. The estimates of income inequality captured by the EQLS are consistently higher in most candidate countries compared to national statistics. Work-life balance and gender equality also contrast with several EU Member States. While quality of care services is seen as higher than that of other public services in the candidate countries covered, their availability may not be sufficient to have an effect on work–life balance deficiencies. Women typically devote significantly more of their time to domestic and care-related work than men. Quality of life and the enlargement process The 2016 European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) documents the living and social situation of people across Europe. 37,000 people in 33 countries were interviewed in detail – including citizens in the five candidate countries of Albania, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey. The EU enlargement process is an area of political and economic significance for the future of Europe, with the Council and European Commission expressing their commitment to the process. There are both political and economic criteria in the accession process, which includes human rights, respect for and protection of minorities, and a functioning market economy that has the capacity to cope with competition and market forces. image_2_news_item_ql_candidate_countries_28062019.png President Juncker has advocated the enlargement process as a path to ensure 'the reconciliation of the geography and history of our continent'. When he said that the 'wind is back in Europe’s sails' during his 2017 State of the Union address, this could also be applied to candidate counties – who were optimistic for the future. The June 2019 European Council meeting had been expected to mark new progress in the process, particularly in relation to Albania and North Macedonia, who have been undergoing political reform and improved relations with some Member States. The delay in this process had been met with disappointment in these candidate countries, but gives more time to reflect upon, as well as to consolidate, the economic and political progress that has been made – including in quality of life for citizens and implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. This new report from Eurofound will serve as a comprehensive source of information on life and society in the candidate countries. This new report from Eurofound, and associated working life country profiles, will serve as comprehensive sources of information on life and society in the candidate countries.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0034	2019-07-04	UNK	Crisis point: Well-being of young people still defined by the economic crisis	Across the EU, 14% of young adults are at risk of depression, and 4% of young people aged 15-24 suffer from chronic depression. Young women are more likely to find themselves not in employment, education or training, and are significantly more likely to suffer depressive symptoms than young men. Child and youth homelessness have increased dramatically in several Member States over the past decade, and almost three out of ten children in the EU were at risk of poverty in 2016. Despite these difficulties, Eurofound’s research shows that a significant proportion of young people in Europe struggle to access vital health and public services. Eurofound’s latest report uses both European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) data, and existing data from national and European level to analyse the social and health situation of young people across the EU. It also applies new calculations and analysis to existing research to focus in on the situation of young people. The report was compiled in the context of the decline of Europe’s youth – the EU population aged 12-24 declined by 10 million between 2011 and 2016 – and the rising demographic challenges posed by Europe’s ageing population. The report highlights widespread feelings of marginalisation among young people in Europe due to the economic crisis. Presenting in-depth case studies of support services in five Member States, it notes the significant spike in child and youth homelessness in several countries since the crisis – including in economically advanced Member States typically characterised by welfare states and higher levels of social spending. For example, in Sweden there was a 60% increase in children in emergency accommodation between 2011 and 2017, in the Netherlands there was a 60% increase in the number of children classified as homeless between 2013 and 2018; and in Ireland, France and Denmark around one in three registered homeless are children. The issue of youth mental health receives particular focus in the report. There are high at risk of depression rates among young adults in several Member States, notably Sweden (41% at risk), Estonia (27%) and Malta (22%) – the EU average is 14%. The report also emphasises that gender is an important factor in depression: young women were more likely to suffer from depressive symptoms in most Member States, with significant gender gaps recorded in Denmark, Germany, Ireland and Sweden. Risk of depression (18-24 years, 2016) and reported chronic depression (15-24 years, 2014), by country (%) image_2_news_item_youth_04072019.png Sweden, Estonia and Malta record the highest at-risk of depression rates among young adults in the EU. ‘At risk of depression’ is based on WHO-5 index of self-reported well-being over the past two weeks. Despite these clear challenges young people face financial, cultural and societal barriers in accessing services. There is also the question of the adequacy of services in dealing with demand. With regards to accessing health services, there is evidence that, in addition to dealing with perceived stigma and confidentiality issues, young people also struggle with the affordability of services. Eurofound data shows that 20% of young people cite cost as being prohibitive in the EU; this climbs to 72% in Cyprus, 61% in Malta and 56% in Greece. Young adults in Greece were also the most likely to indicate cost as being prohibitive in accessing psychological or psychiatric services. The report offers several policy pointers, including explicitly mainstreaming youth in the European Pillar of Social Rights and related initiatives, and supporting the provision of more youth-specific comparative data on access to social and health services. Young people are, comparatively, a dwindling demographic in Europe and many are not getting the support they need. It is often said that youth are the future, but they are also the present, and it is imperative to deliver adequate and responsive services for and with young people.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0035	2019-09-26	UNK	Potential of platform work may depend on greater protection of workers	The rise of platform work across the European Union can facilitate better access to the labour market for disadvantaged groups, encourage participation among those with other responsibilities and foster self-employment and entrepreneurship. However, there are growing concerns relating to platform workers’ social protection, working time and health and safety standards, with the work itself often characterised by low income, low-skilled work, and individual small-scale tasks. Eurofound’s new policy brief highlights the main opportunities and challenges of specific types of platform work and illustrates some of the first attempts at addressing them in the EU. Platform work - the matching of supply and demand of paid labour through online platforms - emerged on the European labour market about a decade ago. While still small in scale, it is growing and evolving into a variety of forms, as a result of an increasing heterogeneity within platform work. Platform work can be a good source of (additional) income. In some forms of platform work – such as location-based platform work – remuneration compares favourably to the traditional economy. It also has the potential to legalise undeclared work as the data collection associated with online platforms can make work more transparent. Different types of platform work also have significantly different implications for the employment and working conditions of affiliated workers with the most discussed employment-related topic regarding platform work focused on the potential misclassification of platform workers as self-employed. This discussion should reflect the nuance of what is a broad categorisation of modern work. Some types of platform work resemble a market-based business model, with considerable autonomy of the worker who often uses it as a strategic tool to foster their self-employment. But other types of platform work apply a business model that resembles more a hierarchy, that is not only matching supply of and demand for paid work but also managing it. In that case there is a higher potential of workers being misclassified if they are considered self-employed. The employment status of platform workers is important as it is decisive for their rights and entitlements, including social protection and representation. On the assumption that platform work will further grow, and a higher share of workers are doing it as a main job in the future, solutions need to be found to ensure fair treatment and protection of platform workers. The low-skilled, small tasks mediated through platforms have good potential to contribute to labour market integration and legalising undeclared work. However, potential side effects like this resulting in labour market segmentation or deskilling need to be explored before platform work can be strategically used as a labour market tool.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0036	2019-06-04	UNK	Minimum wages have increased across Europe, but will low-wage workers feel the difference?	There have been wage increases for minimum and low-wage earners in most EU Member States, with rises in statutory minimum wages in almost all countries since January 2018; including significant increases in Lithuania, Spain, Greece and low-wage newer Member States. While these increases are welcomed as good news for minimum wage workers, Eurofound’s research shows workers may not automatically feel the positive impacts of these changes in terms of income and reductions in wage inequality. This is because these increases can be offset by changes in taxation; that there are many groups of workers that do not avail of minimum rates; and, although women are proportionately more likely to work in minimum wage jobs, increasing the minimum wage may not mean closing the gender pay gap. Several Member States in Europe have looked to address issues such as in-work poverty and the gender pay gap through increases to the minimum wage - but have pushed through changes without fully adhering to existing social dialogue processes. As a result, revisions to rates may not have been evidence based. For example, as women are more likely to be employed in minimum wage or sub-minimum wage jobs, it is assumed that increasing the minimum wage can narrow the gender pay gap, but changes to the minimum wage can decrease low paid women’s employment and increase the level of non-compliance. They can also produce ‘ripple effects’, by potentially increasing the wages of higher earners, where men are more represented, either dampening the impact, or even exacerbating the issue. In a number of Member States there are groups of workers, such as younger workers or seasonal workers – to which the statutory rate does not apply. Depending on implementation, minimum wage changes could either increase their wages, or compound existing wage inequality. There is also the issue of taxation: in Lithuania minimum wage workers saw a large rise in the nominal rate – at 39% the nominal increase was the highest in the EU – but this was mainly a gross figure on their payslips, as changes in tax and social contributions meant that the increase to net pay was a more modest, but not insignificant, 7.5%. There were, nonetheless, some significant changes to minimum wages that have the potential to benefit large numbers of workers. Spain experienced a significant 22% increase to its minimum wage. Given the size of the Spanish economy, this is possibly the most significant increase on European level since Germany introduced a minimum wage in 2015. There was also a significant change in Greece, which increased its minimum wage by over 10%, the first increase since 2012. Countries with the highest minimum wage rates tended to have more modest increases, ranging from around 2% in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland and Germany (annualised), to a slightly higher increase of 3.6% in Luxembourg. In real terms, adjusting for inflation, these increases were smaller, for example, 0.1% in France and 0.16% in Belgium. Latvia was the only country that did not increase its statutory minimum wage, experiencing a real term decline of 2.9%. Overall, these increases in minimum wage rates took place in the context of a favourable economic climate, combined with continuing labour shortages in certain areas; which increased the bargaining power of workers, and made it possible for businesses to pay higher wages. Europe also played a role, with the reference to ‘adequate minimum wages’ in the European Pillar of Social Rights sparking national debate on the issue. Eurofound’s annual review of minimum wages in the EU is significant in that it not only looks at nominal and real terms increases in statutory minimum wages, but also analyses minimum wages in Member States that do not have a statutory rate. It looks at the political processes, collective bargaining structures, and other issues that are pivotal in setting rates. It also looks at long-term trends in minimum wages, and how minimum and low-wages impact different groups of workers.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0037	2019-05-21	UNK	Economic rebound ushers in gradual recovery of trust in Europe	As citizens across the EU prepare to cast their vote in the European elections, the latest Living and working in Europe report from Eurofound looks at how work and life has changed in the EU since 2015. It shows that Europe continues to strive forward in terms of employment, income and prosperity and that this is gradually improving levels of trust. However, the lingering malaise of the financial crisis, unease over migration, and perceptions of inequality has dampened feelings of progress for many. The last four years of the outgoing European Parliament and Commission have been marked by considerable challenge, particularly those related to the migrant crisis, growing populism and Brexit. Despite this, the emphasis on economic growth and generating employment has largely paid dividends, with employment reaching an all-time high in 2018 and unemployment dropping to the lowest rate recorded in the EU since Eurostat began its monthly records in January 2000. The Living and working in Europe publication notes how wage and income inequalities are starting to contract, and the process of convergence – stalled by the Great Recession – is tentatively starting again. As a result, levels of trust in the EU institutions have been increasing since 2013, although they are still down on pre-crisis levels. Despite these improvements, many Europeans still feel the insecurities created by the crisis. Unemployment remains high in a number of Member States, particularly those in the south of Europe, and over half the EU population worry about their income in old age. The gender employment gap has also stagnated at around 11.5%, and concerns remain around issues related to tensions between ethnic and religious groups, gender inequalities, and the accessibility and quality of public services.  Living and working in Europe is an important resource in that it brings together the issues that Europe has faced in quality of life, employment and working conditions in recent years, the progress that has been made, and the principle challenges that remain. It also showcases the research that has been done in these areas and offers policy recommendations as to what can be done in the future. Europe has rebounded from considerable challenges over the past five years and will need to continue to adapt to meet new ones created by demographic change, automation, and the need to deliver social dividends from economic growth. The new Parliament and Commission will have plenty to do. Eurofound, for its part, will continue to deliver the research needed to support policies that can further improve the life and work of people in Europe.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0038	2019-03-14	UNK	EU, China, US will suffer economically from the re-emergence of protectionism	The world’s largest economies, particularly the EU, China, the US, Mexico and Canada, are all projected to suffer economically from the re-emergence of economic protectionism, and a significant increase in trade tariffs. In the case of the EU, the bloc would experience a 1% contraction in GDP, a 0.3% lower rate of employment, and a 1.1% decrease in imports by 2030, compared to a ‘no new tariffs’ baseline scenario. This analysis is based on a global macro-economic model run by Cambridge Econometrics and Eurofound’s European Jobs Monitor. It is detailed in the Trade scenario: Employment implications in Europe of a large increase in global tariffs report from the Future of Manufacturing in Europe (FOME) project. FOME is an EU project proposed by the European Parliament and delegated to Eurofound by the European Commission. Publication: Trade scenario: Employment implications in Europe of a large increase in global tariffs Project page: Future of manufacturing in Europe (FOME) The projections detailed in the report are modelled on a basis that there would be significant tariff hikes between NAFTA countries; that there would be a 25 percentage-point increase in US tariffs on imports from China across all manufactured and agricultural goods; that there would be reciprocal tariffs implemented by China, and that a similar tariffs regime comes into effect between the US and the EU. There has been an increase in economic protectionism since 2008, but this has significantly gained pace under the current US administration which has overseen a substantial increase in tariffs with both China and the EU. The report shows that all three global actors will lose out in the scenario, with the US experiencing a 0.3% decline in GDP by 2030, China a 0.8% decline, and the EU a 1% decline. Looking at the EU in more detail, nearly all EU Member States will experience a decline in GDP. In the case of the Netherlands, Hungary and Germany, this would be close to, or in excess of, 2%. Germany, Europe’s largest exporter to the US, is particularly vulnerable to higher US import tariffs. However, it is the Netherlands that stands to be the most affected from the direct impact of lower trade volumes to the US, and also more generally from weaker economic activity in the EU, as the Netherlands acts as one of the main ports for EU trade with destinations outside the bloc. The implications for employment are similarly negative in almost every country in the EU, albeit on a smaller scale to GDP. Generally, the impact on employment is roughly half that of the impact on GDP, but there are exceptions, notably in the Netherlands where the sectors most affected by trade are not the most labour intensive in the economy. Partly for this reason, it is Germany that would be most negatively impacted in terms of employment. Spain is another major European economy that would suffer a disproportionately negative impact on employment, reflecting a sensitivity to consumer spending and the importance of consumer service jobs to its economy. On a sectoral level in the EU, manufacturing stands to be most impacted, experiencing a 1.1% contraction on the baseline scenario by 2030. Textiles, clothing, motor vehicles and the chemicals sector are expected to see the largest losses in absolute terms, reflecting the size of these sectors in the EU economy and the loss of important export markets. Commenting on the findings in the report, Eurofound Chief Researcher Donald Storrie said, ‘As could have been expected, all countries lose out from big tariff hikes, both in term of economic growth and employment. Even if the tariff hikes assumed in this scenario here are more extensive in the US than in other parts of the world, it is primarily China and the EU that suffer. This is due to the large trade surpluses, particularly in manufacturing, that these trading blocs have with the US’. The findings of this report are part of a series that examines the employment implications of possible scenarios for the future of manufacturing, including developments in energy and trade policy, technology and investment. The results of these scenarios, as well as other key outputs from the project, will be discussed at the Future of Manufacturing in Europe event in Brussels on 11 April.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0039	2019-05-16	UNK	Workers in Europe in good health, but emotional demands take their toll	People at work in Europe report good health and well-being, and increased control over their work activities. However, Eurofound data shows that work is also becoming more emotionally demanding, which poses a risk to health, as well as the long-term sustainability of work itself. Eurofound’s new report on Working conditions and workers' health shows that the nature of work is changing, and the factors that determine health and well-being at work are also changing. The findings of the research point beyond a ‘traditional’, narrow framework of occupational safety and health; highlighting the importance of including psychosocial risks, such as emotional demands, into the equation, along with engagement at work. Health and well-being may be stable, but Europe needs to safeguard and promote world-class work environments if it is to improve the overall sustainability of work and meet head-on the demographic challenges that are on the horizon. The report emphasises that unskilled jobs carry the highest health risks because they are exposed to higher than average demands such as physical risks, work intensity and long hours. Workers in unskilled jobs report poorer access to resources such as support from supervisors and colleagues and ‘rewards’ such as fair pay, job security and good career prospects. Workers reporting job insecurity, or who are in non-permanent contracts, also report more demands and fewer work resources while displaying less engagement, more exhaustion, poorer well-being and worse performance on health indicators. Control over different aspects of work, such as order of tasks and speed is increasing ­— which is an important part of workers’ resources at work. However, emotionally demanding tasks, which could involve dealing with angry clients, or being exposed to emotionally disturbing situations at work, is also increasing. This may have significant implications for the future because of the need to retain workers in the labour market for longer, as Europe’s population continues to age. Demographic change is becoming a pivotal issue in labour market and economic policy, resulting in a growing demand for services from a health sector already characterised by high emotional demand, stress and work intensity. Women, who are more likely to work in sectors such as health or education, are particularly exposed to the psychosocial risks associated with these emotionally demanding jobs. The report also emphasises the importance of motivation for health and well-being at work: job control, social resources and rewarding working experiences contribute to more engagement which in turn has positive effects on health and well-being. It calls for policy initiatives that go beyond protecting workers from excessive work demands to promoting complementary strategic investments that provide workers with the necessary resources to maintain and improve their own health and well-being. These initiatives should complement, and not replace, the redesign of work to limit work demands.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0041	2019-02-12	UNK	Implementation of Paris Climate Agreement could boost EU GDP by 1.1%	The successful transition towards a low-carbon economy, as defined by the Paris Climate Agreement, is projected to result in a 1.1% growth in GDP, and a 0.5% growth in employment, in the EU between now and 2030. This is compared to a ‘business as usual’ baseline forecast. Globally, China is also projected to benefit from a low-carbon transition, but the United States would experience a 3.4% drop in GDP, and a 1.6% decline in employment. This analysis is based on a global macro-economic model run by Cambridge Econometrics and Eurofound’s European Jobs Monitor. It is detailed in the Energy scenario: Employment implications of the Paris Climate Agreement report from the Future of Manufacturing in Europe (FOME) project. FOME is an EU project proposed by the European Parliament and delegated to Eurofound by the European Commission. Publication: Energy scenario: Employment implications of the Paris Climate Agreement The projections detailed in the report are modelled on a basis that there will be no significant labour market frictions from the transition, in particular that the labour force will adapt to the structural change with regards to skill requirements. This assumes that finance is made available for the restructuring, and that countries maintain current levels of performance in key economic sectors. The modelling shows that the full implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement is positive for the EU as a whole, both in terms of GDP and employment growth. This is mainly attributable to the investment activity required to achieve such a transition, together with the impact of lower spending on the import of fossil fuels. The shift towards production of capital goods, such as equipment, machinery and buildings, will result in a notable increase in demand for construction and for labour from related occupations. On a national level, the study projects that Latvia, Malta and Belgium will experience the largest boost to GDP. At close to 6%, the projected growth in Latvia’s GDP is by far the most significant – this is largely due to the energy efficiency investment required, and the reduction in fossil fuel imports relative to GDP. Belgium is also among the countries that would experience a marked increase in employment from the economic restructuring required to fully implement the Paris Agreement, resulting in increased consumer expenditure in labour intensive sectors such as retail, hospitality and catering. Spain and Germany would experience a similar phenomenon; in the case of Spain the report pinpoints the importance of solar photovoltaic electricity and lower consumer energy prices in generating disposable income to the benefit of labour-intensive sectors. The only country projected to experience a net decrease in employment is Poland, due to its large coal mining sector. Commenting on the findings in the report, Eurofound Chief Researcher Donald Storrie said, “Climate change is expected to have very serious implications for living and working conditions on a global scale; it is the people who are socially, economically, or otherwise marginalised that are particularly vulnerable. This report shows the considerable economic and employment dividends for Europe in tackling climate change and fully implementing the Paris Agreement.” The findings of this report, as well as other key outputs from the project will be discussed at the Future of Manufacturing in Europe event in Brussels on 11 April.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0042	2019-02-20	UNK	Foundation of a new era for Eurofound	"On 26 May 1975 the Council passed Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75 on the creation of a new Agency that would aim to contribute to the planning and establishment of better living and working conditions, through the dissemination of knowledge pivotal to working life in Europe. Now, almost 44 years later, the Founding Regulation of Eurofound gets a 21st Century update that reflects the organisation’s expertise, and continued modernisation and adaptation to a rapidly changing Europe. The new Founding Regulation puts emphasis on the role of Eurofound in shaping and implementing policies and promoting dialogue between management and labour. It envisages that Eurofound will play a pivotal role in enhancing and disseminating knowledge, provide evidence and services for policy making, and facilitate knowledge-sharing among and between the EU and national actors. The new Regulation seeks to adapt the Agency’s mandate to reflect the complex and rapidly changing working environment of modern Europe. It gives greater definition to Eurofound’s role; extends Eurofound’s services to the EU institutions, social partners and national stakeholders; and enshrines cooperation between different actors within the Agency’s tripartite institutions. It also updates the Agency’s governance procedure in a way that maximises transparency and accountability; this includes a new direct role for the European Parliament. Speaking about the coming into force of the new Founding Regulation, Eurofound Executive Director Juan Menéndez-Valdés said, “The adoption of Eurofound’s new Founding Regulation is very significant: it enshrines a spirit of cooperation and mutual understanding that is fundamental for modern Europe. The Regulation also recognises the pivotal work of the Agency, its utility for the EU, national governments, and social partners, and its continued modernisation and adaptation to ongoing change."" The full text of the new Founding Regulation is available via the Official Journal of the European Union.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0043	2019-02-07	UNK	Some progress of fathers taking paternity and parental leave in Europe over the past decade, but equal sharing of responsibilities remains low everywhere	The number of fathers taking advantage of their paternity leave entitlements has been on the rise in most countries over the past decade. However, with the exception of the initial family time typically taken around the time of the birth of the child, the data on parental leave suggest that this benefit is not yet fully exploited. The new report shows which Member States lag behind and will need to ensure the agreed individual right across the EU to paternity leave of 10 days and parental leave of at least 2 months.  All EU Member States now have in place a paid entitlement for fathers to spend time with their children, either in the months around the time of the child’s birth or after this time. Between 2016 and 2018, the Czech Republic, Ireland and Cyprus were the last Member States to introduce such an entitlement for fathers. However, this is not an individual right for fathers in all countries; in some countries, it is a family rather than individual right. Sometimes a father’s entitlement to it depends on the mother’s entitlement. Often, sub periods of ‘parental leave’ or ‘childcare’ are transferable between the parents, but it as is not always possible for both parents to take the leave (at least for a short period of time), in some cases the mother has to give her consent for the right to be transferred to the father. While paternity leave taken around the time of the child’s birth is typically well paid – in the majority of cases with no significant loss of earnings – the periods are usually very short, ranging from a week or less (Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands) to two weeks (Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, France, Ireland, Latvia, Norway, Poland and the United Kingdom); and in a few countries, the period is over two weeks. Parental leave, in contrast, is typically less well compensated. In only around a third of the countries, the replacement ratio stands somewhere between 80% and 100%, but typically also with some upper thresholds and/or for shorter periods of the leave.  The report shows that progress has been made in several countries on increasing the share of fathers taking parental leave (Austria, Estonia for higher rates of benefits, Finland, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, Portugal), or in maintaining already high levels (Belgium, Luxembourg, Sweden). But the research also shows that a good number of countries with available data remain at low levels of father participation (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania), despite some partial growth (Estonia for those receiving lower amounts of compensation or Slovakia). This report has been compiled in the context of implementing the recently agreed EU Directive on work-life balance for parents and carers. It brings together information on the incidence of fathers’ participation in paternity and parental leave from national statistics in Europe, in the form of the number of men among parents or per 100 children.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0044	2019-02-06	UNK	Age heavily impacting quality of life for older people in Eastern Europe	Age plays an important role in life: whether it’s starting school, taking that first alcoholic drink, voting in elections or drawing the pension. Such milestones are grounded in policy that is developed and operationalised through the prism of age. However, quality of life across age groups in Europe is showing both an east-west and north-south divide, with social exclusion reaching worrying levels in the Balkan countries. This Policy Brief looks at age-related inequalities in the quality of life, examining differences across six age groups, seven EU country clusters and in five dimensions of quality of life namely difficulties making ends meet, political participation in society, perceived social exclusion, mental well-being and life satisfaction. Based on data from Eurofound’s European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS), the Brief examines change between 2011 – 2016 thereby capturing the impact of the recession, effects on different age groups and the way labour markets and the welfare state have mitigated the effects of the crisis. In general, the older generations enjoy better quality of life than younger age groups in western Europe, while the younger generations are better off in eastern Europe. Looking more closely, however, it becomes apparent that the differences between the Member States run deep and wide.   Many older people in eastern Europe, who spent most of their lives under communist rule, are not doing well and the situation of the oldest old, especially in Bulgaria and Romania, seems particularly disadvantaged in terms of social exclusion and mental health. Equally, the cost of housing in many Member States is proving especially hard on young people who are struggling to even get a foot on the property ladder. The EU has sought to address inequalities through such initiatives as the European Pillar of Social Rights and, more recently, by highlighting the need for intergenerational fairness in its annual report on Employment and Social Development in Europe.  The renewal of a generational contract together with welfare systems that focus on both traditional life stages as well as new social risks could help to put the EU back on a path towards greater social solidarity.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0045	2018-12-19	UNK	Wage and task profiles of employment in Europe in 2030	Europe's labour market is set to become even more polarised, largely due to the growth of jobs at the very bottom of the wage distribution. However, across the EU28, there is considerable heterogeneity in the patterns of structural change by job-wage quintile, with many Member States projected to upgrade their occupational structure towards higher paying jobs. This latest short report from Eurofound, which forms part of the Cedefop-Eurofound joint report Skills forecast: Trends and challenges to 2030 examines the implications of projected structural change for the wage and task structure of employment in Europe up to 2030. ‘Structural change is expected to move much faster in the Member States who joined the Union after 2004,’ says Donald Storrie, Chief Researcher at Eurofound, ‘and we forecast big changes in the occupational wage and task structure in these countries in the run up to 2030.' A major driver of the structural change is globalisation. Recent decades have seen significant changes in the global distribution of labour, and global competition and market opportunities are likely to continue to impact upon the structure of employment in Europe. In this context, relative wages and productivity are the key determinants of which jobs will remain and grow in Europe and which will be lost to foreign competition. As manufacturing still dominates global trade, it is the main sector impacted by globalisation.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0046	2018-12-14	UNK	Trust in Europe bounces back with economic recovery	Overall trust in institutions such as national governments, the legal system, the EU, and the media has rebounded in Europe following the recent economic recovery – showing that the ‘crisis of trust’ in European societies following the Great Recession was largely temporary. However, in a number of the Member States most adversely impacted by the crisis, trust in national institutions has still not returned to pre-crisis levels. Eurofound’s new publication on Societal change and trust in institutions uses data from the most recent European Quality of Life Surveys, as well as other European-level data, to chart the evolution of trust in institutions in Europe in the 21st century. The decline in trust in institutions was an issue of real concern following the financial crisis in Europe a decade ago when, in the aftermath of the crisis, governments struggled to curb unemployment, manage public debt, and return to economic growth. In many countries, this led to a feeling of distrust in national and EU institutions. Publication: Societal change and trust in institutions The report shows that trust in national institutions was generally more volatile in southern and eastern Europe, and more stable in western and northern Europe and in the Baltic States. In general, trust in national institutions - which includes the national government, the legal system, the police and national media - had fully recovered for most of the EU by 2016. However, in some countries, particularly those in southern Europe, it has not returned to pre-crisis levels; this was most notably the case in Spain, Cyprus and Greece. Lower trust still characterises several eastern European countries, with Croatia and Bulgaria displaying the lowest levels of trust in national institutions in Europe. Levels of trust are highest in Finland, Denmark, Luxembourg and Sweden. In the European context, the erosion of trust in institutions has given rise to questions about the potential impact on political and social stability, as well as the implications for European integration. Although trust in EU institutions had a declining trend from 2007 to 2011, they gradually stabilised between 2011 and 2015, and there has been a slight increase from 2015 onwards. Overall, trust in the EU has remained greater than trust in national governments in most countries during the crisis period. The report emphasised that addressing quality of public services is an important means of boosting overall trust in institutions, this is particularly the case for health and care services. At individual level, perception of quality of public services is the factor most likely to determine trust in national institutions. Trust increased more in the social groups and countries where there was also a larger increase in satisfaction with quality of services. Education is also an important factor: people with higher levels of education generally have more confidence in public institutions, including EU institutions. Finally, the report underlines that maintaining and building trust in institutions is important for well-functioning societies, with countries displaying higher trust in political institutions recording a lower level of tax evasion and a greater level of public support for policy reforms. Trust is, in essence, a cornerstone of democracy and understanding and nurturing trust will be essential for the future of Europe. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/trust-in-europe-bounces-back-with-economic-recovery
EUROFOUND_UNK_0047	2018-12-13	UNK	Quality of life improving in Ireland but challenges remain	Quality of life is improving in Ireland, particularly in relation to social cohesion, with the country recording some of the highest levels optimism in the EU and lowest reported levels of tension between racial and ethnic groups. However, a number of challenges remain, notably in public transport, childcare services, and social housing – all of which were rated below EU averages by respondents in a Europe-wide survey. The findings, based on the 2016 European Quality of Life Survey, were presented by Eurofound to a special Citizens’ Dialogue on 'Quality of life in Europe – How does Ireland measure up?' organised by the European Commission Representation in Ireland and Eurofound in Dublin this afternoon. Mairead McGuinness MEP, Vice-President of the European Parliament, Tadas Leončikas, Eurofound Senior Research Manager, and Dr Shana Cohen, Director of TASC, were panelists at the town hall style meeting. The event will be opened by Gerard Kiely, Head of the Commission Representation in Ireland. Nearly 37,000 people in 33 European countries were interviewed in the last quarter of 2016 for the fourth wave of the European Quality of Life Survey. Findings show that each EU Member State exhibits certain strengths in particular aspects of well-being, but multiple disadvantages are still more pronounced in some societies than in others; and in all countries significant social inequalities persist. Overall, it showed increased satisfaction in quality of life in Ireland compared to previous surveys, as well as a work-life balance that is close to, or above EU averages. Some of the most positive findings for Ireland were in relation to quality of society, and in particular relatively low socio-economic and racial and ethnic tensions in society. There has been a significant decrease in reported tensions between rich and poor in Ireland since 2011: 19% reported a tension between rich and poor in 2016, down from 28% in 2011. This brings Ireland well under the EU average of 29%. The data presented by Eurofound's shows that Ireland now ranks as one of the countries in Europe with the lowest reported tensions between different racial and ethnic groups. Reported tensions in Ireland have been decreasing consistently since 2003 and now stand at 21%, significantly below the EU average of 41%. This has occurred during a general increase in tensions in Europe, with a marked increase in some countries.Although reported quality of life in Ireland was better in 2016 than the previous survey in 2011, results on quality of public services remained mixed. Satisfaction rates are still below EU averages in a number of areas: most notably in health services, childcare, public transport, and social housing. The issue of affordability of childcare received particular focus, as respondents in Ireland were significantly more likely to indicate difficulty in affording the cost of childcare than people elsewhere in the EU.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0048	2018-12-03	UNK	Some improvements in the lives of people with disabilities but disadvantage remains	There has been an overall improvement in the employment and social situation of people with disabilities in the EU with increased employment rates and greater levels of participation in society. But they still remain among the most disadvantaged groups in Europe, with a higher risk of mental health issues, and a lower tertiary education completion rate. The new policy brief on the social and employment situation of people with disabilities uses data from the 2011 and 2016 European Quality of Life Surveys to assess changes in key issues such as employment, education and training, participation in society, social protection and healthcare. It shows that the employment rates for people with disabilities increased from 41% to 50% between 2011 and 2016. This growth in employment was greater than the non-disabled population which grew from 66% to 70% during the same period. Data: Employment differences between people with and without disabilities There has also been some improvement in the area of social inclusion, with fewer people with disabilities reporting feeling left out of society in 2016 than in 2011. This is reflected in the fact that more people with disabilities are participating in social activities than previously. In fact, there is no longer a gap in social participation rates between people with and without disabilities. Despite this, mental well-being remains a concern, as the risk of depression for people with disabilities is significantly larger than it is for the rest of the population: 46% of people with disabilities are at risk compared to 16% of their non-disabled counterparts. Data: Life satisfaction among people with and without disabilities The policy brief also highlights that there has been regression in the area of tertiary education. In 2016, people with disabilities lagged further behind their non-disabled counterparts in completion rates for tertiary education than in 2011. This finding is particularly concerning considering that the employment gap for disabled people with a tertiary degree is significantly smaller than it is for those with lower educational attainment. People with disabilities with a lower level of education find themselves at a particular disadvantage: just 26% of people with disabilities who completed primary education have a job; this figure rises to 46% for those with secondary education and 72% for those who completed tertiary education. Data: Educational attainment of people with and without disabilities The overall improvements in the employment and social situation of people with disabilities are positive, particularly in relation to people in work and social participation. However, significant work remains in order to address the gaps in employment and quality of life between people with and without disabilities. Concerted effort is needed, most notably in the areas of access to tertiary education, provision of mental-health services, and boosting the employment opportunities for disabled people with lower educational levels, in order to move to a situation where having a disability is no longer a determining factor of quality of life in Europe.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0049	2018-11-16	UNK	Eurofound’s Governing Board sets the priorities for 2019	Eurofound’s work programme for 2019 was approved by its Governing Board at the 92nd meeting in Dublin on Friday 16 November. Next year is the third year of the four-year programming period, and the Agency will focus on producing policy-relevant research, data, findings and analysis in the areas of working conditions and sustainable work, industrial relations and social partner representativeness, quality of life and access to public services, convergence, the digital age, and the future of manufacturing. The final 2019 programming document will be published in December 2018. During the meeting, a number of new members were welcomed, and four members who were retiring were thanked for their contribution to the Governing Board over the years. These were Herman Fonck (Belgium), Roland Waeyaert (Belgium), Marcelino Pena Costa (Portugal) and Antal Csuport (Hungary). Also during the meeting, Aviana Bulgarelli, representing the Governments Group, was elected new chair of the Governing Board. In the context of the revision of the Founding Regulation of Eurofound and the Cross-Agency Evaluation of three EU agencies active in the social field - Cedefop, EU OSHA and ETF – the members of the Governing Board were briefed by a representative from the Austrian EU Presidency. The revised Foundation Regulation retains the tripartite nature of Eurofound’s management, work and operations, and it puts an explicit focus on policy relevant research by re-enforcing that EU institutions should take into consideration Eurofound’s expertise in a timely manner before relevant policy decisions are made.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/eurofounds-governing-board-sets-the-priorities-for-2019

EUROFOUND_UNK_0051	2018-11-02	UNK	Pay is just one aspect of disadvantage for women on the labour market	The equal treatment of women and men has been a fundamental principle of the European Union since its inception, but women in Europe still earn on average 16.2% less than men. Tomorrow, Saturday 3 November, marks the moment in the year when women symbolically stop getting paid compared to their male colleagues. Addressing the gender pay gap is an issue of utmost priority for Europe, and pay inequality is an important aspect of Eurofound’s work. Earlier this year we released the Pay transparency in Europe report, which reviewed experiences of pay transparency instruments in Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Finland. It pointed to a ‘bumpy ride’ in terms of compliance, and highlighted room for improvement in engaging employee representatives and in raising employees’ awareness. Unfortunately pay is just one area in employment where women face disadvantages. Getting onto the labour market itself is an issue, not just for the women that are unemployed or underemployed, but for Europe as a whole. The 2016 Gender employment gap report showed that when foregone earnings on the labour market, missed welfare contributions and additional public finance costs are taken into account, the total quantifiable cost of the lower female employment rate is estimated to have been around €370 billion in 2013, corresponding to 2.8% of the EU’s GDP. Publication: Pay transparency in Europe: First experiences with gender pay reports and audits in four Member States Publication: The gender employment gap: Challenges and solutions Women who do make it on the labour market not only grapple with pay inequality, but also the issue of the glass ceiling. The Women in management policy brief, released last month, highlighted that, on average, women still make up just 36% of all managers in Europe, and despite some progress in recent years, men outnumber women in management positions in most sectors. The women that do make it into management are more likely to be in precarious leadership positions that have a higher risk of failure - either because they are appointed to lead an organisation or team that is in crisis or because they are not given the resources and support needed for success. These inequalities don’t just impact women throughout their working lives, but also well into retirement. The gender pension gap in Europe currently stands at 36.6%, and women in Europe express more concern than men when it comes to having enough income to make ends meet in old age, an issue that is underscored in the new policy brief of Social insecurities and resilience. Publication: Women in management: Underrepresented and overstretched? Publication: Social insecurities and resilience Gender inequalities in labour markets in Europe are multifaceted, but they are by no means intractable. The European Commission has launched an EU Action Plan for Tackling the Gender Pay Gap for 2018-2019, and has focused on the gender elements of work-life balance. There are notable improvements in women’s labour market participation in the last decade, although progress is slow. Eurofound remains committed to providing the research and information required in order to address gender inequalities in all its forms.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/pay-is-just-one-aspect-of-disadvantage-for-women-on-the-labour-market
EUROFOUND_UNK_0052	2018-11-13	UNK	Social cohesion and well-being in Europe: A home run for team EU?	In recent years, the EU has put increasing emphasis on the promotion of social cohesion as a central element for the improvement of quality of life for its citizens. With initiatives such as the Europe 2020 strategy, the social investment package and the European Pillar of Social Rights, together with the associated Social Scoreboard, the goal to promote fairer and more inclusive societies has taken centre stage. But is this EU goal hitting a home-run with EU citizens, or is the reality closer to a strike out? Eurofound's latest report from the Quality of Life Survey looks at five key aspects of social cohesion including perceived social exclusion, perceived social tensions, interpersonal trust, participation in society and a sense of community. Collectively, these aspects have an important bearing on the well-being of citizens. Survey: European Quality of Life Surveys As one might expect, the overall picture across the EU is a very varied one with considerable regional differences in most areas of observation. Social exclusion, for example, has become more common in south-eastern Member States, such as Bulgaria, Cyprus and Greece, which are still feeling the effects of the economic crisis. The prevalence of perceived tensions is also high, particularly religious tensions which seem to have become a significant issue in the EU. Ethno-cultural tensions and perceived economic tensions are also prevalent whilst other types of tensions - between rich and poor and between managers and workers - are on the decline. Levels of participation in society are also discouragingly low with fewer than two out of ten citizens getting involved.The most vulnerable groups tend to be those that that are unemployed, people in the low income class and/or with low levels of education, and particularly those who are chronically ill. When it comes to ethno-cultural social tensions, however, it is the chronically ill as well as those that live in the countryside and, perhaps surprisingly, those who are employed and/or highly educated. It is interesting to note that old age is an additional risk factor for participation in society.One factor that has emerged as a new and important force for social cohesion is digital skills. The acquisition of digital skills by members of society is associated with significantly lower feelings of social exclusion. In terms of hitting a home-run therefore, it would seem that policies targeting the economic and social inclusion of citizens, as well as an increased focus on digital skills, represent the pathway to more cohesive societies and happier citizens in the EU.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0053	2018-10-09	UNK	Feelings of insecurity widespread in Europe	Feelings of insecurity across several dimensions are widespread in the EU, even among those who are materially well-off. Only 1% of the EU population enjoys the highest level of security in the combined areas of personal security and security in housing, healthcare, employment and old-age income. Eurofound's new policy brief Social insecurities and resilience looks at the results of the latest European Quality of Life Survey and assesses levels of insecurity in five key areas. It identifies the influence of characteristics such as age, gender and economic circumstances; concluding that offsetting social insecurities depends on more than just an individual's resilience and is highly dependent of levels of social and structural support. The policy brief recognises that Europe is a comparatively prosperous and affluent place to live, that European societies have high levels of social protection, and that people in Europe are, in general, relatively well-off materially compared to other parts of the world. However, feelings of insecurity can pose a risk to quality of life and go beyond current living conditions; involving also perceptions of what the future will bring. The analysis in the policy brief show that low-income groups generally feel most insecure, but insecurity is also widespread among groups who are materially well-off. Just 11% of workers in the EU believe it is very unlikely that they will lose their job in the next six months. The type of employment contract one has is an important factor, and those without a permanent contract experience considerably higher insecurity than those on permanent contracts. However, even among those with a permanent contract, almost a quarter do not rule out losing their job in the next six months - which is an indicator of the perceptions among workers of the volatility of the labour market. When it comes to personal security the policy brief shows that age is an important factor, with over a quarter (27%) of people aged 75 or over feeling personally insecure when outside in their neighbourhood after dark or when alone at home at night. In the area of old-age income security, women are more likely than men to worry that their income in old age will not be adequate - with this particularly the case for separated or divorced women. The policy brief gives significant food for thought for policy makers. Understanding the insecurities highlighted is important to address the concerns and dissatisfactions of citizens and to adapt policies accordingly. Although the insecurities analysed in the policy brief reflect individual concerns, developing well-functioning institutions and ensuring access to interpersonal and institutional support are paramount to cushioning the negative impact of social insecurities and, ultimately, improving quality of life in Europe.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0054	2018-10-10	UNK	World Mental Health Day: Common approach to burnout still lacking	Today is World Mental Health Day, a yearly event held by the World Health Organization with the overall objective of raising awareness of mental health issues and mobilising efforts in support of mental health. Eurofound has made a limited number of copies of its latest report on Burnout in the workplace available to order, free of charge, via its website. The report maps research on burnout across the EU, and shows that psychosocial risks rank top as work determinants most likely to cause the condition. Employees with a sustained exposure to such risks as high work intensity, long working hours, emotional demands, low level of autonomy and tense social relationships at work were found to be at a higher risk of burnout, or indeed more likely to already be developing it. Of those risks, differences in individual impact can also be seen across the Member States. For example, studies in Belgium have found that conflicts in the workplace count among one of the top four work-related factors. It is perhaps therefore not surprising to learn that social support from colleagues has been noted as a mitigating factor in several studies carried out in this area. Additional recurrent themes include heavy workload and long working hours, relationship with management and rewards. One element that remains hotly-debated is the issue of autonomy. In many studies, the prevalence of burnout has been shown to be substantially higher when autonomy of the worker is lower. However, other studies report the opposite to be true, such as the association with telework, which suggests that autonomy could be a double-edged sword in the context of burnout, especially when considering work-life balance and the concept of ‘boundaryless work’. We invite you to access the information below to build understanding of the need for a common approach that will assist employees and employers alike in tackling this important issue.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0055	2018-11-01	UNK	Are apprenticeships keeping up with changes in manufacturing?	Apprenticeships are long established in manufacturing and are attractive for both employers and young people because of the balance between theoretical and practical education that they offer. However, in several countries in Europe and beyond, apprenticeships are lagging behind changes in manufacturing, and the potential of quality apprenticeships for both industry and the labour market are not being fully capitalised on. The new report on Adaptation of national apprenticeship systems to advanced manufacturing from the Future of Manufacturing in Europe (FOME) project looks at apprenticeship systems and practices in the manufacturing sector in five EU Member States (Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland and Italy) and two countries outside Europe (Australia and the USA). It shows that all seven countries have public industrial policy initiatives aimed at fostering advanced manufacturing, but the link between these initiatives and initial vocational education and training (IVET) and apprenticeship policies and practices is relatively weak. Only in Germany and Denmark has a comprehensive approach to modernising and adjusting apprenticeship training been developed in response to new skills requirements. Denmark and Germany are also the only countries where apprenticeship is the only or most widespread form of IVET. The systems there are characterised by a strong involvement of social partners in governance and the modernisation of occupations and training practice. Outside of Europe, in Australia and the USA, only limited numbers of occupational programmes and respective apprenticeship programmes are available, and there has been a weak form of social partner involvement, often centering primarily on input from employers. The report also shows that a lack of formally recognised national apprenticeship qualifications in Italy and the USA limits the possibility to significantly modernise apprenticeships to take account of industry changes. Apprenticeships remain attractive for employers due to their emphasis on practical training, and is preferred by young people who thrive more in hands-on than academic learning environments. Apprenticeship training should be regarded as an integral part of modern industrial policy, and to be successful industrial policies fostering the transition to advanced manufacturing and implementing Industry 4.0 require a complementary strategy of Apprenticeship 4.0. National governments should seek the active involvement of sectoral social partners and IVET institutions in the design and implementation of industrial policies. Europe has already played an important role in the development of apprenticeship training and industrial policy, with the adoption of a Council Recommendation establishing a European Framework for Quality and Effective Apprenticeships, as well as broader commitments to training and lifelong learning laid out in the European Pillar of Social Rights. More can still be done however, including further initiatives to more actively involve relevant social partners and IVET institutions in industrial policy dialogue. Ensuring that future workers, primarily young people, have the most appropriate and relevant training they need, including via IVET and apprenticeships, is vital in order to fully develop Industry 4.0 for economic, social and employment dividends. Close cooperation between the EU, national governments, social partners, and educational institutions is essential and, given the pace of technological change and its impact on industry, will become even more important in the future.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0056	2018-09-25	UNK	Getting to grips with the growth of platform work	Platform work, understood as the matching of the supply of and demand for paid work through an online platform, is still relatively small in scale but is developing rapidly in the EU and becoming increasingly important for the digital economy. The new report 'Employment and working conditions of selected types of platform work' identifies 10 common types of platform work, which cover most platform workers in the EU. It explores three in detail, namely: on-location platform-determined work, which is low-skilled work allocated by the platform and delivered in person; on-location worker-initiated work, which is low to moderately skilled work where tasks are selected and delivered in person; and online contest work, which is a form of high-skilled online work where the worker is selected by the client by means of contest. The report emphasises the diverse nature of platform work, which is one of the main reasons that it has been so challenging to define and regulate. For example, when it comes to how platform workers are paid the report shows that earnings from most types of platform work are variable. On-location platform-determined work (such as that done via Uber) is paid by the hour, per task or a combination of both; while for online contestants (such as that done via 99designs) earnings depend on the outcome of the contests. On-location worker-initiated work (such as that done by ListMinut) provides the most predictable earnings since workers can set their own rates and largely determine their own working time. Many platform workers are also unsure about the tax treatment of their income, with numerous interviewees indicating that they avoid passing tax thresholds. The report identifies adopting a common operational definition as a first step ensuring that platform workers are aware of their rights and obligations. Data on platform work should be incorporated into official EU and national statistics as a means of tracking its growth in Europe, this should include data on working and employment conditions across different types of platform work and on the longer-term prospects of workers. There is also a need to clarify the employment status of platform workers and develop minimum standards for platform-determined work - which could include the introduction of a minimum hourly wage when work is not covered by collective agreements or the legal minimum wage. It is clear that platform work will continue to grow into the future, and it is something that will continue to present challenges and opportunities for workers and businesses for years to come. The challenge for policy-makers will be to not just harness the potential of platform work for economic development, but also to ensure that it develops in a way that respects workers' rights and is fair and sustainable for business.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0057	2018-10-02	UNK	Equality still far from reach for women in management	Management is still mostly a man's game. The limited presence of women in management roles in European workplaces, despite years of gender equality policy, illustrates the magnitude of the challenge in achieving gender equality at work and highlights the need for more concerted effort and comprehensive long-term strategies to drive change. Eurofound's new policy brief, the first of its kind, focuses on women who have overcome the barriers and advanced into management. It shows that, despite rising participation in the labour force, women’s careers remain concentrated in specific jobs and economic sectors, and their career mobility and advancement through the ranks into management remain limited. On average, women still make up just 36% of all managers in Europe, and despite some progress in recent years, men outnumber women in management positions in most sectors. The is also significant variation in the share of women managers in different parts of the EU. In Lithuania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Cyprus and Latvia over 40% of managers are women - more that 5% above the EU average - whereas in Greece and the Czech Republic less than 30% of managers are women. Publication: Women in management: Underrepresented and overstretched? The women that make it into management are more likely to be in non-supervising management roles where they manage operational responsibilities but not staff. Among those who do supervise staff, women are more likely than men to be managing other women, younger workers and workers on non-standard contracts. Women are also more likely to be in precarious leadership positions that have a higher risk of failure - either because they are appointed to lead an organisation or team that is in crisis or because they are not given the resources and support needed for success. Female workers often have less physical risk in their working environment than male colleagues, but for those that make it into management this advantage shrinks, with female managers reporting having to lift and carry heavy loads on the job almost to the same extent as men. Women also generally report more negative spill overs between work and family life than men and this holds true for managers as well, with female managers reporting higher tensions between work and non-working life. When it comes to addressing unequal representation of women in management, and some of specific pitfalls of management experienced by women, the policy brief recommends addressing management cultures that disincentivise women, promoting positive role models for young women wishing to pursue a career in management, promoting flexible working arrangements that can help to reconcile the imbalance between work and family life, and further progressing European-level commitments to strengthen gender equality at work.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/equality-still-far-from-reach-for-women-in-management

It shows that the biggest positive factor is the perceived quality of public services, education also plays a strong role with higher levels of education resulting in higher levels of trust. The biggest negative factor on trust in institutions is the level of perceived societal tensions. The graph is a preview of the new report on Societal change and trust in institutions, due to be released in November, which provides an analysis of the European Quality of Life Survey 2016 showing developments of European societies in terms of trust in institutions, such as the national parliament, government, legal system, police, local authorities, banks, humanitarian or charitable organisations, and news media.  •    Sign-up to receive the report as soon as it is released: Societal change and trust in institutions•    The Quality of Life Survey 2016 is currently available to download and order: EQLS Overview report trust_in_institutions_graph_news_item_24092018.png 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/which-factors-most-affect-trust-in-institutions
EUROFOUND_UNK_0061	2018-07-31	UNK	EU Agencies: Assisting policymakers navigate scientific uncertainty	The EU Agency Network for Scientific Advice (EU ANSA) comprises EU agencies that address a wide range of topics, from social to physical sciences. All agencies in the network collate and appraise scientific evidence, integrate current knowledge and communicate it in order to support evidence-based EU policymaking. EU ANSA has published a report on how EU agencies assess and manage scientific uncertainty in the evidence base where empirical evidence is limited, or where full confidence in the available science to address policy needs is lacking. The report aims to provide a basis to identify common themes and issues, and stimulate further thinking about the definition, identification and communication of scientific uncertainty. The report seeks to ensure that policymakers better understand the strength of the evidence presented, and that resulting policy is made on the basis of fully informed choice. Clarifying uncertainty facilitates judgement and can also provide an understanding of the importance of knowledge gaps in relation to the topic; this understanding can then be used to prioritise future research.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0062	2018-09-10	UNK	Europe’s frayed ends: Understanding the challenges of 21st century burnout	The effects of burnout on workers can be severe; without detection and proper treatment burnout symptoms can last several years – impacting not just the health of individual workers, but also business success and broader economic performance. However, a lack of clear definition and understanding of burnout has resulted in a disparate and fragmented policy response at national level, with those affected experiencing varying levels of support in different parts of Europe. The new Burnout in the workplace report draws on research by Eurofound’s Network of Correspondents to look at the extent burnout is experienced by workers in the EU, based on national research, and mapping where it is a considered a medical or occupational disease. It examines the work determinants associated with burnout and the effects of burnout, including psychosocial and physical work factors, work intensity and work organisation. The report also reviews national strategies and policies, the involvement of the social partners in the current debate, and preventive actions already in place. Psychosocial risks such as heavy workload, long working hours and overtime undoubtedly trigger burnout. There are also risks linked to conflicts of ethics and values, role conflicts, low career prospects and low justice at work: a form of job insecurity whereby individuals no longer think they belong and make a difference in their company, but believe that their employer sees them as a tool. Commenting upon release of the report, Eurofound Senior Research Manager Agnès Parent Thirion emphasised that exposure to high levels of risk for a long period will inevitably increase the possibility of burnout: 'The way that we work can be adapted and organised in a different and better manner,' she said  'instead of reacting after increases in workers experiencing difficulties, there should be more focus on prevention and combating some of the ill-effects of work - this should be the collective focus.' Burnout has numerous health implications and is directly associated with insomnia and inability to recover; this affects the quality of life of sufferers, and results in more frequent absence and sick leave from work, as well as higher staff turnover. Ultimately, severe burnout can lead to long-term disengagement and inability to work, with costs and effects that extend well beyond the individual. Difficulties in terms of medical classification of the condition - whether it is a syndrome or disease, a condition in its own right, or a sub-classification of another issue - are reflected in not just in the various policy responses, but even the way the condition is referred to in various languages throughout Europe. As a policy topic, burnout can be found under a variety of headings, such as mental health at work, stress and excessive working hours, or as an occupational safety and health issue. Burnout and health issues relating to vital fatigue are long-standing and this new publication does not attempt to solve the issue, rather it places the condition in a modern work context and highlights areas where a common approach can help to more effectively address the issue.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0063	2018-09-06	UNK	New tasks in old jobs: Manufacturing in Europe increasingly driven by automation	The importance of physical tasks in manufacturing is generally declining due to automation; with more intensive use of digitally controlled equipment, and the increasing importance of quality standards, resulting in a growing amount of intellectual tasks for manual industrial workers.The New tasks in old jobs: Driver of change and implications for job quality publication from the Future of Manufacturing in Europe (FOME) project summarises 20 case studies in five manufacturing areas (car assemblers, meat processing workers, hand-packers, chemical products plant and machine operators, and inspection engineers) in Germany, Italy, Sweden and the UK.The report brings a contextualised and detailed analysis of recent changes in the task content and nature of these occupations due to factors such as technology, market changes, policy and regulation. It also discusses the implications of these changes for task profiles, job quality and industrial relations.Each sector studied in the research is influenced by digitalisation and automation to varying degrees depending on the specific circumstances within their respective industries, but what is clear across sectors is that manufacturing in Europe is undergoing fundamental change with increasing implications for quality of work, employment quality, workplace risks, work-life balance, industrial relations and wages.  Download the report: New tasks in old jobs: Driver of change and implications for job quality  Find out more on the future of manufacturing: FOME project Image: ©Shutterstok / Humphery	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/new-tasks-in-old-jobs-manufacturing-in-europe-increasingly-driven-by-automation
EUROFOUND_UNK_0064	2018-07-27	UNK	Is teleworking taking off?	Smartphones and mobile technologies are increasingly important in our everyday lives; by expanding opportunities to telework, have they also transformed the world of work? One of the promises held out by the ICT revolution was that anyone who could do their tasks using a computer and a phone would be able to work from home, avoiding the stressful commute and the distractions of the workplace. ‘Telework’ entered the workplace vernacular and progressive employers put the policies in place to implement it. Telework became feasible around the same time as consensus was rising about the desirability of maintaining a work–life balance, and it fitted neatly in the toolbox of measures to help people reconcile the demands of work and home life. But a backlash came as prominent companies such as Yahoo! and IBM had a change of mind and decided to restrict or completely ban staff from teleworking. They argued that it interfered with spontaneous interaction and sharing of ideas between employees, stifling opportunities for development and innovation. So how much impact has telework had on the world of work? Not much. While take-up has picked up in the past five years, just 3% of workers work regularly from home. A further 5% are highly mobile workers who work from several locations (including home) regularly, while 10% telework occasionally from various locations but with much lower mobility than the highly mobile group.  Its reach into the workplace varies markedly across Member States, being more widespread in Scandinavia and much less so in eastern European countries, Greece and Italy. The extent of ICT spread and internet connectivity as well as the national work culture and economic structure influence its adoption in different countries. In part, the ability to telework is restricted by the nature of one’s work. It is a viable option for those who can work independently and whose use of ICT is high; hence its greater prevalence among knowledge workers. Teleworkers are often professionals and managers; substantial numbers of clerical workers rank among them, too, while sales representatives are common in the highly mobile group. On the other hand, it is not feasible for many lower-skilled jobs that require a fixed workplace – machine operators or shop assistants, for example. For these reasons, too, telework is less common in manufacturing and retail and more common in ICT, financial services and services in general.  Publication: Living and working in Europe 2017 image_news_item_lwe_27072018.png 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/is-teleworking-taking-off
EUROFOUND_UNK_0065	2018-08-03	UNK	The quest for convergence	As the European Union recoups the losses of the crisis and seeks a sounder footing for future growth, the concept of convergence has taken centre stage in the policy discourse. But what do we mean by ‘convergence’ in the European context?  There has always been the expectation that economic union would lead to balanced development among the EU Member States. One of the aims of the founding Treaty of Rome was to reduce ‘the differences existing between the various regions and the backwardness of the less favoured regions’. Convergence was conceived mainly in economic terms, and it was assumed that social convergence would unfold as a corollary. That assumption was not mistaken: EU membership has led to an improvement in living standards across all Member States, although the catch-up process of less-developed new members has varied greatly, both in terms of pace and timing. Convergence in the EU context, however, does not necessarily mean that the expectation is one of parity between Member States, which would imply faster rates of growth for those at lower levels. Its conceptualisation, as most recently expressed in the Rome Declaration of March 2017, envisages rather that Member States ‘will act together, at different paces and intensity where necessary, while moving in the same direction, as we have done in the past’. The actual term ‘convergence’ first appeared in the Treaty on European Union (Maastricht Treaty) in 1992 in relation to the convergence – primarily in terms of monetary and fiscal indicators – required for membership of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The first decade of EMU saw strong real convergence in GDP per capita and narrowing wage inequality as well as widespread convergence in living standards. The severe economic crisis, however, stalled this process of convergence. Publication: Living and working in Europe 2017 Convergence in working conditions has been variable. The clearest sustained upward convergence, in terms of overall improvement among Member States with less favourable conditions, has been in working time quality. In eight countries, working time quality improved over a decade, despite the crisis, seven of them eastern European countries that acceded to the EU in 2004.  image_news_item_lwe_03082018.png 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/the-quest-for-convergence
EUROFOUND_UNK_0066	2018-07-20	UNK	Social mobility: Going up? Or down?	The structure of European societies changed dramatically after the Second World War when economies boomed on the back of a shift from industry towards service-oriented activities. New white-collar and professional jobs emerged, dissolving the rigidities of the old class structure. Mass education provided a skilled workforce, meaning that people drawn from all strata of society could, potentially at least, occupy these jobs. Equal opportunities for all became a fundamental principle of democratic societies – backed up by the principles of equal access to education and the jobs market. It seems, however, that social structures are hardening again. As the modernisation of economies subsides, fewer new jobs are being created at the higher occupational levels, and this is curtailing upward mobility. Looking at three generations born in the 20th century – the silent generation (born 1927–1945), the baby boomers (born 1946–1964) and Generation X (born 1965–1975) – Eurofound researchers found that the most recent of the three was the least mobile and that social background continues to have a profound effect on life chances.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0067	2018-07-13	UNK	Sharing caring	It is well known that women take more responsibility for the care of their children than men. According to the 2016 EQLS, 88% of mothers compared to 64% of fathers in the EU care for their children every day. These fathers estimate they give 21 hours a week to the care of their children, while the mothers dedicate 39 hours per week. This disparity is duplicated among working parents and is one of the reasons why the working lives of women contrast with those of men – in terms of working time arrangements, occupational choices and pay. Separating the data by Member State suggests that the gender gap in care provision is highly influenced by social and cultural norms. The graph shows the percentage of working men and women caring for children or grandchildren regularly in the Member States, ordered by the size of gap – ranging from no gap in Denmark to a gap of 34 percentage points in Greece.  The need to reconcile work and care may extend over most of the course of a working life if it involves both the care of children and of dependent adults. The gender gap in childcare is wider at younger ages, while for adult care, it is particularly wide in the 50–64 age group, where a striking one-quarter of women in paid work (compared to 17% of men) report providing care at least once a week to an ill or disabled family member or friend.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0068	2018-07-03	UNK	The tide is rising, are all boats lifting?	Employment is at its highest level ever in the EU, and the employment recovery is now well-established in Europe. But is it being felt in all countries? The employment recovery is well-established in the European Union, and the trends are positive across the main indicators. More people than ever are participating in the labour market – either employed or looking for work – with the EU activity rate (for 15–64-year-olds) at a record 73.5% in Q3 of 2017. While this means more job-seekers, unemployment continues to drop steadily, falling from an annual rate of 8.6% in 2016 to 7.7% in 2017, as does long-term unemployment (from 4.5% to 4%). Employment is at its highest level ever in the EU, rising to 72.3% (among 20–64-year-olds) in the third quarter of 2017, even though economic growth (in terms of GDP) remains moderate. Perennially problematic, youth unemployment has also dropped nearly 2 percentage points over the course of a year (from 18.7% in 2016 to 16.8% in 2017). The latest figures show that 11.5% of young people in 2016 were classified as not in employment, education or training (NEET), down from a peak of 13% in 2013. Eight million net new jobs were created across the EU between mid-2013 and mid-2016, representing a 3.7% rise in employment. The countries that suffered the worst employment hits during the crisis outstripped this average: Ireland (+7.8%), Greece (+4.7%), Portugal (+4%) and Spain (6.6%). But gains across the Member States continue to be unbalanced. Employment has shifted from south to north, with Germany and the UK accounting for most of the new jobs (net of jobs lost) created in the EU between 2008 and 2016, while most of the jobs lost in Greece and Spain in this period have not yet been recovered. And the crisis has left a legacy of workers increasingly distant from the labour market. Almost half of the EU unemployed, or9.5 million people, are long-term unemployed and the majority (around 6 million) have been so for more than two years. Nearly half of long-term unemployed young people have been jobless for more than two years. There is a real risk of unemployment becoming entrenched among these workers – the longer they are without work, the harder it will be to for them to regain it.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0069	2018-07-06	UNK	Nurturing innovation at work	Companies that encourage their employees to participate in broad decision-making around operations or strategic direction can not only improve job satisfaction, but also increase levels of innovation.  Over half (57%) of companies in the EU encourage their employees to participate in company endeavours outside the immediate responsibilities of their job. Companies do this in various ways, ranging from sharing information and consulting with employees – through staff meetings, staff surveys and suggestion boxes, for instance – to involving them in strategic and planning operations. As one might expect, such practices increase job satisfaction, leading to increased staff retention, less absenteeism and better motivation – in short, improved well-being in the workplace. Eurofound research based on its European Company Survey (ECS) has found better workplace well-being in companies that promote employee participation than in companies that are less committed to this. What is less obvious is that such employee participation might have an impact on how innovative a company is, but ECS data confirm this also to be the case. In companies where employees jointly take part in decision-making, the likelihood of innovation rises by 7%. This is a strong argument in favour of systematically involving staff in planning and decision-making, as well as a lesson for the 24% of managers who see involving employees as an obstacle to change. And knowing what other practices might make companies innovative is a good start to boosting innovation.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0071	2018-04-18	UNK	Minimum wages continue to climb across Europe	Increases to minimum wages have gathered pace since 2010, with the highest increases recorded in countries which had the lowest minimum wages. However, a large gap remains with minimum wage workers in Bulgaria, the country with the lowest statutory minimum wage, earning just one-eighth the salary of minimum wages workers in Luxembourg, which has the highest rate. Eurofound’s Statutory minimum wages 2018 report provides information on minimum wage rates that are not limited to specific sectors, occupations or groups of employees. It aims to answer a number of key questions on the coverage and impact of minimum wages in Europe; including how statutory minimum wages are determined, how minimum wages compare to average and median wages, and the different discussions ongoing in Europe on minimum wages. Over the course of 2017, statutory minimum wages increased in the majority of countries in the EU that have a generally applicable minimum wage. Although the largest increases have been in countries with the lowest minimum wage, the gap is till considerable. The highest adjusted minimum wage was observed in Luxembourg and reached almost €2,000 per month, Bulgaria has the lowest at €260.80 per month. The Bulgarian rate is well behind the country with the second lowest rate, Romania, where minimum wage workers earn €407.30 per month Minimum wage-setting remains a controversial topic of debate, and in many respects is seen as a double-edged sword. Mandatory minimum wage-setting is not harmful for employment if it closes the gap between actual wages and a worker’s productivity. It may even attract individuals to the job market who would otherwise remain inactive. But there are also concerns that if the minimum wage is too high, the positive effects on labour demand of higher labour incomes are offset by the negative effects on the employment of those with productivity below the minimum wage.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0072	2018-04-05	UNK	Disruption on the horizon: Game changing technologies in manufacturing in Europe	Technological innovation is permanent and ongoing, but the rapid pace of technological change and advancement in the 21st Century has brought with it the increased potential for disruptive innovation, or 'game changing technology'. Disruption not only happens at a product level, but can also involve the entire process related to its production. This has direct consequences for the working conditions of individuals employed in that area, as well as the broader world of work and society in general. The new report Game changing technologies: Exploring the impact on production processes and work summarises the findings of five case studies on the likely impact of game changing technologies on production and employment in the manufacturing sector in Europe up to 2025. These are advanced industrial robotics; industrial internet of things; additive manufacturing; electric vehicles; and industrial biotechnology. The report shows that production processes will become increasingly digital and less mechanical between now and 2025. It also emphasises the importance of data flows and requirements for data manipulation and analysis. In terms of the labour market, employment demand in manufacturing will most likely further shift away from traditional production line work to increasingly higher skilled profiles. These changes create a number of challenges and possibilities for employers and workers alike. This report was released under the Future of Manufacturing in Europe (FOME) project, which was proposed by the European Parliament and delegated to Eurofound by the European Commission (DG Grow).  Report: Game changing technologies: Exploring the impact on production processes and work Pilot project: Future of Manufacturing in Europe (FOME)	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/disruption-on-the-horizon-game-changing-technologies-in-manufacturing-in-europe
EUROFOUND_UNK_0073	2018-04-05	UNK	Minister Katrougkalos explores Eurofound data on trust and social tensions	Levels of trust and social tension in society, particularly between people of different socio-economic situations and backgrounds, were high on the agenda during the visit of George Katrougkalos, Greek Minister of State for European Affairs, to Eurofound in Dublin on Thursday 5 April. In recent years people in a number of European countries have reported declining levels of trust, both in relation to institutions and broader society. There has also been increases in perceived levels of inequality in a number of Member States. Eurofound’s European Quality of Life Survey 2016 provided a good background for the discussions, allowing for comparisons between people in Greece and other Member States in the European Union. Convergence in the European Union was another issue which was emphasised during the visit. The European Union is committed to economic, social and territorial cohesion, balanced economic growth and upward economic convergence. Focusing on convergence of outcomes and performances of Member States and regions, Eurofound monitors convergence among Member States relating to socioeconomic factors, employment, working conditions and living conditions.  Minister Katrougkalos met with Juan Menendez-Valdés, Director of Eurofound, Stavroula Demetriades, Senior Research Manager, and Mary McCaughey, Eurofound’s Head of Information and Communication.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0075	2018-06-12	UNK	Europe’s recovery means a better life for many, but not all	The number of people active in the labour market is at an all-time high, ratings for key public services are increasing and there is a marked recovery in trust in national institutions in many Member States, these developments are detailed in Eurofound’s Living and working in Europe yearbook for 2017. It also highlights a continent in transition, where there is an imbalance in opportunities for prosperity, and quality of life, depending on where you live.  The Living and working in Europe yearbook provides a snapshot of the working lives, employment circumstances and living conditions of people in Europe in 2017. It describes trends and transitions in the areas of labour market change, industrial relations, working conditions and sustainable work, quality of life and public services, the digital age, and convergence in the European Union.  Employment growth beat expectations in 2017, with more people than ever before employed and active in the labour market. However, when the numbers of unemployed people, involuntary part-timers and inactive people who are willing to work are taken into account –over 40 million people in all – the supply of labour currently well outstrips demand. With an ageing population and declining fertility rates, the need to reintegrate these groups into the labour market is becoming increasingly urgent. The issue of working time also receives attention in the yearbook. Policies in this area need to take account of workers’ differing needs over the course of their lives. People are most likely to want to reduce their working hours when they are parents of young children and when they are approaching retirement. At the same time, the lack of work–life balance is most pronounced during these two periods. Better work–life balance has an implicit societal value linked to gender equality and quality of life. It could also boost labour supply by removing a barrier for those who find it difficult to reconcile rigid working arrangements with family commitments. Finally, the yearbook gives significant attention to quality of life in Europe. Overall, there has been progress in quality of life, quality of society and quality of public services and people in Europe are generally optimistic about the future. However, it should be emphasised that this improvement in not in all Member States and not for all social groups – evidence that Europe is yet to fully kick into gear as an engine for social convergence.  Report: Living and working in Europe 2017 Interactive page: Living and working in Europe 2017 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/europes-recovery-means-a-better-life-for-many-but-not-all

EUROFOUND_UNK_0077	2018-03-06	UNK	Evidence-based research is fundamental to gender equality in Europe	As more women enter the labour market, the EU and Member States reaffirm their commitment to promoting gender equality and progress towards closing the gender pay and employment gaps. Ahead of International Women’s Day on 8 March we invite you to explore the issue of gender equality in depth, to read about the different areas in which gender equality is most urgently needed. Eurofound assists in the development of better social, employment and work-related policies for all EU citizens and those that call Europe home. Evidence-based research is a fundamental stepping-stone on this path to gender equality. Eurofound implements a gender mainstreaming approach which is transversal to its research in the areas of working conditions, industrial relations, labour market change, quality of life and public services. For instance, topics such as pay and income, care, employment participation, leave, skills and training, work organisation, working time and work–life balance, among others, are covered from a gender perspective across various strands of Eurofound’s work, in its pan-European surveys and regular reporting at national level. A recent report by Eurofound on working time patterns for sustainable work examines, from a gender and life course perspective, the links between working time patterns, work–life balance and working time preferences, on the one hand, and workers’ health and well-being on the other. Eurofound has carried out a study examining patterns of social mobility across the EU, looking at barriers to equal opportunities and policies to promote it. It analyses patterns of social mobility for men and women separately, underlining and highlighting the increasingly important gendered patterns of social mobility in different countries.  A previous study on the gender employment gap explores the characteristics and consequences of gender gaps in labour market participation, as well as potential ways of closing these gaps.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0078	2017-12-18	UNK	The scarring effect of long-term youth unemployment	Young people are more affected than other age groups by long-term unemployment. While long-term youth unemployment is certainly not a new policy challenge for Europe, it now affects a wider range of young people than it ever did before, ranging from those with third-level degrees to the most disadvantaged young people. Eurofound's new report on long-term unemployed youth identifies the factors that increase the risk of a young person being in this situation and looks at the overall impacts on well-being and long-term employment prospects. Although youth unemployment has been declining since 2013, it still remains high compared to other age groups. In 2016, 18.7% of young people aged 15–24 years were unemployed, as compared to 8.2% of ‘prime-age’ workers and 6.5% of older workers. The trend is similar for long-term unemployment: in 2016, 5.5% of the active population of young people aged 15–24 years were long-term unemployed in Europe, compared to 3.9% of ‘prime-age’ and older workers. This translates to almost 1.3 million young people in the EU last year who were out of work and actively seeking employment for at least 12 months. The new study, which follows-up on previous research on young people not in employment, education or training, firmly establishes that a lack of education and work experience are the two main driving factors in increasing the likelihood of a young person becoming long-term unemployed. The report also highlights that long-term unemployment dramatically affects several dimensions of young people’s well-being; in particular, it decreases overall life satisfaction and increases the risk of social exclusion, while also decreasing optimism about the future. When it comes to tackling long-term youth unemployment, the report stresses that effective outreach is key, and the use of alternative channels, especially online tools such as dedicated websites and social media, may be an efficient and cost-effective option in reaching marginalised young people. The report also stresses that a multidimensional policy response is needed, one that includes innovative new approaches in policy design and implementation. A holistic, individualised and young-people-centred approach is crucial for bringing young people back on track. Such an approach includes elements such as counselling, mentoring, referral to specialised support, tailor-made training and job placements, as well as flexible and sustained support through all stages of the programme.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0079	2017-11-13	UNK	Foundation Forum 2017 - Converging economies, diverging societies? Upward convergence in the EU	The Foundation Forum takes place on 14 - 15 November 2017 in Dublin Castle, Ireland. The Foundation Forum is Eurofound’s flagship event, aimed at reaching high-level policymakers in the field of social, employment and work-related policies. The theme of the Foundation Forum 2017 is on various perspectives of convergence in Europe. While upward economic convergence is a precondition for social convergence, the main focus will be placed upon upward convergence in living and working conditions, including employment. You can now download the Foundation Forum background paper and other related material. The Foundation Forum 2017 takes place just two days before the Social Summit 2017, where all EU Heads of State or Government will gather in Gothenburg, Sweden to discuss fair jobs and growth, and adopt the formal proclamation of the European Pillar of Social Rights. Keynote speakers at the Foundation Forum 2017 are Ylva Johansson, Minister for Employment and Integration, Sweden, and Simon Coveney TD, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Ireland.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0080	2017-11-28	UNK	Care homes: cost of increased private provision could become barrier to user access unless subsidies rise	With people living longer, the need for affordable care of high quality to support Europe’s population increases. In recent years, the Country Specific Recommendations (CSRs) have repeatedly emphasized the need to contain costs in long term care in order to ensure their sustainability. Yet no harmonised data exists at the European level to accurately map public and private providers of care homes for older people and to assess whether nursing homes and residential care are increasingly becoming a business as a result of the gap left by the cuts in public services during the crisis. Eurofound’s new report Care homes for older Europeans: Public, private and not-for-profit providers is the most comprehensive exercise to date to gather all available data across Member States. The report provides a picture of the quality, accessibility and efficiency of services. Over the last ten years, there has been a substantial increase in the number of private care homes, which has doubled in Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. At the same time, the number of public care homes is either decreasing or growing at a slower pace, with the exception of Malta and Spain, where the number of public homes is increasing faster than private ones. There is a need to agree definitions about public, for-profit and non-profit provision, taking into account legal status, ownership and economic activity of providers. As demand increases so too does the challenge to maintain public funding and spending for long-term care, which may ultimately lead to higher co-payments from service users. Some countries already have schemes in place to limit the percentage of a service user’s assets that can be used. With results differing between studies and between countries, this report provides a starting point for further research which could ultimately pave the way for reforms that meet the demands of Europe's ageing population.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0083	2017-10-04	UNK	Who are the NEETs?	The concept of NEET – young people not in employment, education or training – has been useful in enabling policymakers to better address the disjunctions between young people and the labour market. While the traditional labour market dichotomy of employed or unemployed is valid, it fails to capture modern school-to-work transitions and the legions of young people who are outside the labour market and not accumulating human capital and hence who may be vulnerable to a range of social ills. In 2015, some 4.6 million young people aged 15–24 were unemployed. This is just a subgroup of the broader category of NEET, which comprises 6.6 million young people, meaning that had the concept of NEET not found currency, 2 million young people would have attracted limited attention from a policy perspective. NEET has put previously marginalised populations such as young mothers, young people with disabilities and young labour market drop-outs back into the policy debate about youth unemployment. NEETs is a broad category encompassing a heterogeneous population. Disentangling the subgroups within it is essential for a better understanding of their different characteristics and needs, and for tailoring effective policies to reintegrate them into the labour market or education.  Identifying the subgroups also aids in identifying who is most vulnerable to poverty and social exclusion. While individuals in the NEET category often experience multiple disadvantages, including a low level of education, poverty and difficult family backgrounds, the population of NEETs is made up of both vulnerable and non-vulnerable young people who have in common the fact that they are not accumulating human capital through formal channels.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0084	2017-09-25	UNK	Annual review shows working life in Europe in transition	Working life in Europe is in a period of transition; economic growth has picked up, unemployment rates are generally in decline, and 2016 was the the third consecutive year of increased employment. However, social partners are concerned about the challenges posed by the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, particularly in relation to business, trade, and conditions for workers in the UK. There has also been a renewed focus on the issue of pay inequality throughout Europe. The EurWORK annual review 2016 is the latest in the series and summarises the most recent working life developments, particularly in terms of industrial relations and working conditions, at EU level and in the EU Member States and Norway. The review is based on the inputs of more than 50 contributors from Eurofound’s Network of European correspondents and analyses changes to the economic and labour market situation, policy developments at EU level related to working life, and relevant political developments. The review highlights that as Europe has moved out of the unemployment crisis there has been increased focus on wage inequality; this has particularly been the case for young workers. In a number of countries in Europe the debate has shifted from facilitating youth employment via youth minimum wages, to pay gaps or inequalities that have arisen from the application of these policies. It also looks at the issue of work-life balance and the juxtaposition between meeting family obligations and professional commitments. The review looks in detail at national level social dialogue, and concludes that although social dialogue remains an important issue for Europe, there are challenges in order for it be effective and meaningful. The scope of social dialogue remains limited in a number of EU Member States, while in others it plays only a superficial role in public policy making.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0085	2017-11-02	UNK	More than one in four working-age adults in the EU remain economically inactive	Unemployment in the EU continues to fall, however more than one in four of the EU’s working-age population are economically inactive; meaning they are not working and are either not seeking work or are not available for work. Furthermore, the vast majority of economically inactive people would like to work in some form. Eurofound’s new publication Reactivate: Employment opportunities for economically inactive people looks in detail at what could be Europe’s most important economic resource. The number of economically inactive people has been steadily declining in the EU in recent years: in 2015 it stood at 27.5%, down significantly from 31.4% in 2002, and less than the pre-crisis figure of 29.7% in 2007. However, this substantial section of the population remains outside the labour market, and is not included in official employment statistics. While employment policy tends to focus primarily on the unemployed, there is scope for policies to focus more explicitly on the labour market integration of inactive people, and to harness their economic and social potential. The new report examines groups within the inactive population that find it difficult to enter or re-enter the labour market and explores the reasons why. It also maps the characteristics and living conditions of these groups, discusses their interest in taking up employment and examines the barriers that prevent them from doing so. It finds that around four out of five inactive people would like to work at least some hours per week, depending on their financial needs, and approximately half would like to work 32 hours or more. The desire to work is particularly strong among students and homemakers. The report also looks at strategies currently being implemented by Member States to promote the inclusion of those outside the labour market. It highlights that inactive people often face more than one barrier to employment, such as a low level of education coupled with care responsibilities, and stresses the importance of focusing on the specific needs of the inactive population. Finally, the report underlines that Member States should fully implement the 2008 European Commission Recommendation on the active inclusion of people excluded from the labour market in the design and implementation of labour market integration strategies. In this regard, the European Pillar of Social Rights, which refers to inactivity as an issue in relation to inclusive education and lifelong learning, provides a unique and timely political impetus.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0086	2017-09-18	UNK	Four out of five workers in Europe happy with working time ‘fit’	81% of workers say their working hours fit well, or very well, with their private life obligations. However men continue to have longer working hours (on average 6.5 hours per week more than women) and report more difficulties adapting working time to family life or other commitments. This is according to Eurofound’s new report on Working time patterns for sustainable work. Sustainable work requires jobs of good quality which fit the circumstances and characteristics of those working in them at the different stages of their life-course. In this context, working-time is an important factor, relating as it does to work-life balance, to health and well-being and to the preferences of workers. The report, which looks at data from the sixth European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS), shows the gender gap in paid working time is even greater in the UK and Ireland, as well as in western Continental Europe; reflecting prevailing gender labour market segregation and the gender division of unpaid work, with far-reaching implications for the labour market, work-life balance and family structures. Overall working time preferences are strongly related to employees working time. Short part-timers have a significant higher likelihood of preferring an increase in working time, whereas employees with long working hours have a strong preference for working shorter hours. Working time preferences can also vary across the life course stages; cohabiting mothers of pre-school or pre-adolescent children are more inclined to want to reduce their working time, while for fathers it is across the whole parenting phase. The report also looked at the implications of working time and work-life balance on health and wellbeing. When EWCS respondents reported work–life balance difficulties, they also tended to report health and sleep problems as well as health and safety risks at work. Working nights or shifts, or being exposed to high work intensity also resulted in the same issues. Fixed and regular working hours, job autonomy and good work-life balance have an important positive influence over workers’ subjective wellbeing no matter what phase of life the individuals are in. At the same time, results indicate some tension between working time autonomy and constraint: autonomy enhances wellbeing, but the predictability and regularity of working hours have a positive effect on wellbeing, even when determined by employers In order to make work more sustainable, and reach the objectives to further raise employment rates in Europe, working time policies must adopt a life course perspective, taking into account workers’ needs and preferences in terms of working time throughout their working lives. Policies should also continue to promote a more equal distribution of paid and unpaid work between men and women and encourage a stronger involvement of men, and fathers in particular.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0087	2017-09-04	UNK	EU-OSHA: Work-related accidents and injuries cost EU €476 billion a year according to new global estimates	At the XXI World Congress on Safety and Health at Work, held in Singapore on 3‑6 September, the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) together with the International Labour Organization present new estimates of the cost of poor occupational safety and health (OSH). The new findings reveal that worldwide work-related injury and illness result in the loss of 3.9 % of GDP, at an annual cost of roughly €2 680 billion[1]. The estimates are findings from a major project on the costs and benefits of OSH. The project was carried out by the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Finnish Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health (FIOH), the WSH Institute in Singapore, the International Commission on Occupational Health (ICOH) and EU-OSHA.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0088	2017-08-17	UNK	Trend of converging working time across 28 EU Member States has stalled	(Dublin, Ireland): The difference in working time between workers in the 28 EU Member States remains large and is especially marked between the ‘older’ 15 EU Member States and the 13 new Member States that joined the EU since 2004, according to new research from Eurofound. This is particularly apparent when comparing annual leave entitlements for workers: a gap of 2.5 working weeks is evident between the most generous and the least generous. The trend of converging working time between the 28 EU Member States has clearly stalled. The latest annual report, Developments in working time 2015–2016, shows significant disparities in the average amount of collectively agreed annual leave days between workers in the EU Member States. With the addition of public holidays, ‘high-leave’ countries include Croatia with 41 leave days, Denmark with 39 days and Germany with 37. These should be compared with the figures for ‘low-leave countries’, such as Ireland, Hungary and Estonia, all which come in at just 28 days annual leave. The average figure for the EU28 was 33.8 days – 34.7 days in the EU15 and 31.3 days in the Member States that have joined the EU since 2004 (the NMS13). Collective bargaining plays an important role in determining the duration of working time in many of the EU28 countries; it plays a lesser or sometimes negligible role in some of the NMS13. The nature and extent of this role also differs widely across countries, with bargaining at different levels (intersectoral, sectoral and company level) being more or less important. The Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden and the UK were the only countries registering changes to collectively agreed weekly hours between 2015 and 2016. Over the same period, the EU15 average was reduced from 37.6 hours to 37.5; consequently, this resulted in a reduction for the EU28 from 38.1 to 38 hours. At 35.6 hours, France remains the country with the shortest average collectively agreed working week in the EU. In some Member States – Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovenia – working time is not generally defined through collective bargaining. The ‘actual hours worked’ are the hours that individuals spend in work activities, including production activities, ancillary activities, short breaks, and education and training necessary for successfully carrying out the job tasks. In the EU, full-time employees in the UK report the longest usual weekly working hours in their main jobs in 2016 – 42.3 hours, 0.1 hours less than in 2014 and 2015. They are followed by employees in Cyprus (41.7 hours), Austria (41.4 hours), Greece (41.2 hours), Poland and Portugal (41.1 hours). Employees in Denmark report the shortest weekly hours (37.8 hours). This is 4.5 hours less per week than their counterparts in the UK – the equivalent of more than five working weeks per year. The report also looks at working time across selected sectors, including chemicals, metalworking, banking, retail, and public administration. It finds that across all selected sectors, the NMS13 countries work significantly more hours compared to EU15. The report aims to provide a definitive sense of which EU workers work the most hours. It complements Eurofound’s database of wages, working time and collective disputes, which since 2000 has provided information about the systems in place that define working time as well as some of the main outcomes of these systems. In addition, the report updates and complements the report Working time developments in the 21st century, which covers data on a range of aspects of working time, including collectively agreed working hours between 2000 and 2014.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0089	2017-08-15	UNK	New survey launched to improve reporting of collective bargaining in the EU	Eurofound provides systematic and comparable data on national industrial relations systems and developments in working life. This is done through monitoring and reporting tools integrated in the European Observatory of Working Life (EurWORK). Eurofound has launched a stakeholder survey in an effort to improve the way in which it reports on collective bargaining, and to transition from an initial focus on wage-bargaining outcomes to cover collective bargaining in a more holistic way,  The survey is aimed at governments, social partner organisations (employer representatives and trade unions) in all EU Member States, as well as the European Commission. The survey is designed to ascertain which kinds of data and information about collective bargaining are most useful and worthwhile for stakeholders. The survey will remain open until 30 September 2017. To complete the survey, please visit https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/StakeholderSurvey Since its inception in 1976, Eurofound has developed as a centre of expertise for monitoring and analysing trends in industrial relations, including social dialogue and collective bargaining.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0090	2017-09-05	UNK	Increasing numbers of working poor in post-crisis Europe	In-work poverty in the EU examines what it means for workers to be poor in the 21st century and looks at the ramifications of poverty for workers. Being among the working poor is associated with various social problems, including lower levels of subjective and mental well-being, problems with accommodation and living environment, poor relationships, and feelings of social exclusion. The report builds on mounting evidence to show that in-work poverty represents a significant challenge for Europe, particularly in the context of the post-crisis labour market. Not only has the number of workers at risk of poverty in Europe increased in many Member States between 2007 and 2014, there is also a strong connection between contract types and in-work poverty: just 5% of full-time workers qualified as working poor, whereas 29% of involuntary part-time workers were working poor and 25% of self-employed workers without employees were working poor. It is important that these workers have the same rights and access to social protection that are accorded to workers with standard contracts. The report found that while an adequate minimum wage is a core pillar of any model of social protection for the working poor, increased attention should be paid to minimum household income to reflect more accurately the situation of many of the working poor. Considering the risks that temporary workers face during spells of unemployment, measures are needed to facilitate transitions between jobs and to provide financial support while workers are in this position. Finally, the report identifies the need to provide indirect help to raise the living standards of vulnerable workers; this requires a better understanding of the effectiveness of different kinds of indirect measures on the levels and impact of in-work poverty, as well as a concerted policy approach.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0091	2017-07-05	UNK	Employment transitions and occupational mobility in Europe: The impact of the Great Recession	The Great Recession has had significant and lasting effects on European labour markets, with a big drop in employment levels, which are yet to recover in many countries almost a decade later. It also affected the employment structure, accelerating structural change and generalising a pattern of job polarisation across Europe, in which employment in mid-paid jobs declined more than in jobs at the top and bottom of the occupational structure. Although much is known about how the crisis changed the stocks and structures of employment, there is less evidence about the myriad of flows into and out of employment, and from job to job, which are behind these aggregate numbers. The aim of this report is to investigate the effect of the Great Recession on labour market flows and to explicitly link these individual-level transitions to the broad labour market developments during the crisis, such as the surge in unemployment and the phenomenon of job polarisation. It offers a novel perspective for a better understanding of what happened to workers who lost their jobs in the recession – whether they were reallocated to other jobs or whether they moved into unemployment or inactivity – and whether opportunities for upward occupational mobility (or risks of downward mobility) were affected by the crisis. The analysis compares six European countries that represent different institutional clusters – France, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden and the UK.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0092	2017-07-17	UNK	Aspects of non-standard employment in Europe	There was previously a significant increase in the temporary employment rate, particularly since the late 1980s. This occurred, for example, in France and Spain between 1985 and 1995, Sweden in the early 1990s and Germany in the early 2000s. More recently, the large increase in Poland was particularly striking, rising from only 4.6% in 1999 to 28.2% by 2007. However, in the last decade, there has been no upward trend in the rate of temporary contracts overall in the European Union; indeed, there was a slight decline from 14.5% in 2006 to 14.2% in 2016. The new report Aspects of non-standard employment in Europe examines developments in non-standard employment over the last decade. It looks at trends in the main categories of non-standard employment – temporary, temporary agency and part-time work and self-employment – based mainly on data from the European Union Labour Force Survey.  It discusses some aspects of the labour market situation of workers in these categories including wages and the extent to which they would prefer a standard employment status.  The report includes a specific focus on work mediated by digital platforms, which is the most innovative of the new forms of employment that have emerged in the past decade. Digital platform work is thought to have considerable potential for growth but also to present challenges related to working conditions and social protection.  Social protection issues surrounding other new forms of employment, as identified in earlier Eurofound research, are also highlighted.

The right to free movement for workers within the European Union was enshrined in Article 48 of the EEC Treaty in 1957. Nowadays, private labour market intermediaries – such as temporary work agencies and employment placement agencies – contribute to facilitating this labour mobility in their role as mediator between individual workers and organisations in need of labour. However, due to loopholes in regulation, some workers and vulnerable groups run the risk of being exploited by fraudulent agencies. This report examines how public authorities are currently regulating labour market intermediaries across Member States, highlighting the effectiveness or otherwise of different registration or licensing schemes.  Report: Regulation of labour market intermediaries and the role of social partners in preventing trafficking of labour  	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/world-day-against-trafficking-in-persons

Upward convergence in the EU - Foundation Forum 2017	For decades there was little doubt about the European Union’s success in the balanced acceleration of standards of living among the Member States. Since 2008, this upward convergence has stalled. The Foundation Forum 2017 will bring together up to 200 experts, policymakers, employer and worker representatives, national governments, thinkers and practitioners in Dublin Castle to hammer out the issues around upward convergence as a common goal of social convergence in living and working conditions in the European Union.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0095	2017-07-18	UNK	Estimating labour market slack in the European Union	There were close to 23 million unemployed people of working age in the EU in 2015 but around 50 million people in a broader category of labour slack, encompassing inactive people wishing to work and underemployed, involuntary part-timers as well as the unemployed, according to a new report from Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU Agency.  The unemployment rate is an important and well-publicised measure of labour market performance in developed market economies. It is currently high in the EU compared with other developed countries and still well above its historical average nearly a decade after the beginning of the global financial crisis.  But focusing exclusively on the unemployment rate fails to take account of other numerically important manifestations of labour market slack - or simply labour slack.  Labour market slack is the shortfall between the volume of work desired by workers and the actual volume of work available. The aim of this report is to develop a more nuanced estimate of labour slack using EU Labour Force Survey data, which allows involuntary part-timers and inactive people with some labour market attachment to be identified and quantified. The most important indicator of labour slack is the unemployment rate, but an exclusive focus on this fails to take account of the four-fifths of the jobless population who are inactive rather than unemployed. Many people in this group have some form of labour market attachment – they would like to work, are seeking work or are available to work. In addition, many part-time workers would like to work longer hours.  The authors calculate that there were around 50 million people in the broad category of labour slack in 2015 and that labour slack has been slower to fall in response to the recovery than unemployment.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0096	2017-06-29	UNK	Towards age-friendly work in Europe: a life-course perspective on work and ageing from EU Agencies	The EU’s population and workforce are ageing. This has implications for employment, working conditions, living standards and welfare. How should we respond to these challenges?  A new report, coordinated by EU-OSHA, shows how information from four agencies can support policy-making that is both complementary and greater than the sum of its parts. The report draws on the agencies’ expertise in each of their areas and covers the different challenges associated with the ageing workforce and considers innovative solutions. EU-OSHA presents policy examples of integrated approaches to occupational safety and health for an ageing workforce. Eurofound examines working conditions for workers of all ages, related work sustainability outcomes and how the right policies can foster longer working lives. Cedefop explores how vocational education and training can be used to support active ageing at work. EIGE provides a gender perspective on the issue of the ageing workforce and discusses the different challenges that men and women face. The report also outlines the impact of long-term demographic trends on employment, and examines lifelong participation in learning. This is followed by a call for active ageing solutions that ensure older workers remain active, skilled and employed.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0097	2017-06-27	UNK	Europe’s labour market comes full circle as employment returns to pre-crisis levels	Employment in the EU has returned to the same level as before the global financial crisis: the recovery that began in 2013 has resulted in the net creation of eight million new jobs, with most of this new employment being created in services, as well as a significant increase in the manufacturing sector. This rebound in employment in Europe between 2013 and 2016 has been documented in detail in the sixth annual European Jobs Monitor report, which looks at recent shifts in employment in the EU. In addition to looking at quantitative shifts in the labour market the report analyses the role that occupations play in structuring European wage inequality. It finds that employment growth since 2013 has been only modestly skewed towards well-paid jobs – there has also been robust growth in low-paid and mid paid jobs, which is consistent with a consumption-led recovery. Europe's economy is also increasingly service based, with eight million jobs being created in the sector since 2011. The manufacturing sector, significantly impacted by the economic crisis, has also experienced a marked jobs increase, with 1.5 million new jobs since 2013. Most of this increase has been in engineering, professional and management jobs in the top wage quintile; rather than in more traditional, blue collar production roles. There has also been an increase in the share of older workers in many of the faster growing occupations; suggesting that extended working lives and later retirement are as important in explaining recent employment growth as any resurgence of labour market dynamism. The report also finds that, despite the deepening and generalisation of job polarisation in Europe in the aftermath of the Great Recession, occupational dynamics did not drive wage inequality developments in the last decade. Changes in the distribution of wages within occupations were more significant for overall wage inequality trends than changes in the wages paid by the different occupations or changes in the occupational structure.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0098	2017-05-16	UNK	International Day against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia – 17 May 2017	A large proportion of LGBT people hide their sexual orientation or gender identity in the workplace, according to research carried out by Eurofound. 17 May is International Day against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia #IDAHOT, aimed at raising awareness of LGBT rights violations and stimulating interest in LGBT rights work worldwide. Issues related to LGBTI people have been on the political agenda of the European Union for some time. The EU proposed in December 2015 a List of Actions to advance LGBT Equality, after failing to adopt the LGBTI equality strategy. In June 2016, the European Council adopted for the first time ever conclusions on LGBTI equality, requiring the European Commission to report annually on the implementation of the list of actions. The first report was published in February 2017. Eurofound published a short report in 2016 concentrating on the working conditions of LGBT people in European workplaces and initiatives that tackle this issue. The findings indicate that a large proportion of LGBT people hide their sexual orientation or gender identity in the workplace. Those who express their identity openly face obstacles in accessing employment and experience harassment in employment. Governments, social partners, NGOs and other actors have undertaken initiatives to tackle this problem. However, relatively few initiatives were found in countries with generally negative attitudes towards LGBT. Eurofound has also published three articles where it looked closely at initiatives promoting LGBTI equality in the workplace Germany: Initiatives by ver.di to support LGBTI workers Germany: VK initiatives to improve diversity management in the workplace Denmark: Greater acceptance of LGBT colleagues in female-dominated workplaces Our colleagues in the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) looked into how asylum claims based on sexual orientation and gender identity are assessed and whether there are specific reception measures for LGBTI persons.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/international-day-against-homophobia-transphobia-and-biphobia-17-may-2017
EUROFOUND_UNK_0099	2017-06-20	UNK	Migrants face long road to integration in Europe’s labour market	On the occasion of Word Refugee Day, Eurofound Research Manager Kára Fóti looks at the difficulties that refugees and asylum-seekers face in finding work and opportunities in Europe. The refugee crisis has posed significant challenges for Europe – we have not seen such a large-scale migration of people since the Second World War. The exodus from war-torn regions initially posed a humanitarian challenge for frontline countries such as Greece and Italy. However, the longer term challenge around the successful integration of new arrivals is an issue for Europe as a whole. Labour market integration of these new migrants is vital, not only for their social inclusion, but also for Europe’s economic and political cohesion. The effective and timely integration of new migrants into the labour market has become a prominent issue on the policy agenda in many EU Member States. This is not surprising as, besides facilitating social inclusion, labour market integration is important in order to relieve pressure on social systems, is an economically rational response (to the refugee crisis), and in the long-term can ease Europe’s issues with an ageing population and shrinking workforce. Moreover, effective and sustainable labour market integration can improve social cohesion both locally and in society as a whole – for example, through their workplace colleagues, the newly arrived refugees and asylum seekers can become more involved at community level and in other social activities. Every EU country has been affected by the refugee crisis, many directly. It is not an issue that is confined to national borders, nor can it be looked at in isolation. Eurofound’s report on the labour market integration of refugees and asylum seekers looks at the practical measures that have been taken in different EU Member States. Clearly, integrating these new migrants within the labour market is not simply a question of skills or legal procedures, but also involves living conditions, geographical distribution, incentives for employers and education. For example, living conditions in reception centres are often inadequate to prepare people for joining the labour market. Overcrowding and poor conditions are reported, as well as lack of accommodation. And although the geographical distribution of asylum seekers and refugees within individual countries is being planned, there is no guarantee of job opportunities near the reception centres and locations where migrants are being accommodated. Different situations for refugees and asylum seekers There can also be stark differences in the situation for refugees (those with the officially recognised status of international protection) and asylum seekers (those who have applied for international protection and are awaiting a decision). Funding for employment services for asylum seekers is often less well established than for those for refugees, and access to these services is not as straightforward. Likewise, social security entitlements for working asylum seekers vary significantly across Member States, and often the rules are less favourable than for other migrant groups, including refugees. Another vital issue is that of education. Special arrangements for school-age children of refugees and asylum-seekers are not always guaranteed, with some countries reporting capacity problems, saying that schools are ill-prepared to receive this specific group of pupils. This may cause issues with social mobility in the future and reinforce the cyclical nature of poverty and social exclusion. The volume of newly-arriving asylum seekers since 2015 has resulted in an increased use of temporary asylum. This can weaken refugees’ position in the labour market since it may deter employers from hiring them or offering them longer term contracts as they are reluctant to invest in training. An issue of access – Not of motivation Despite these impediments to accessing the labour market, there is a perception in several countries that a lack of motivation to work is the prevailing issue to be addressed, with a number of Member States recently reducing some non-employment-related social services and allowances provided to asylum seekers and/or refugees. However, these measures risk further isolating people from the labour market since it makes it more difficult for those concerned to live in decent conditions. Restrictions on family reunification may have a similar impact, further postponing social (and labour market) inclusion. Refugees and asylum seekers also face specific challenges and administrative restrictions in becoming self-employed, and in a number of countries measures that aim to facilitate self-employment for refugees are either mainstream initiatives or are targeted at immigrants in general and thus do not take the specific needs of refugees into account. Despite these ongoing issues, it must be acknowledged that in the key destination countries there is a strong political will to integrate refugees and asylum seekers within the labour market as quickly as possible. A broader consensus is developing that the effective integration of refugees and asylum seekers should be a priority for Europe as a whole. However, we are a long way from this objective, and a concerted effort involving social partners is needed in order to make the effective social and economic integration of refugees and asylum seekers a reality.   Eurofound publications Approaches to the labour market integration of refugees and asylum seekers:  Download the report or order a copy via the Eurofound website More information More on World Refugee Day: UN Website This article was originally posted on Social Europe	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/migrants-face-long-road-to-integration-in-europes-labour-market

For many people in Europe work-life balance is a key issue. In our research we look at some of the factors that help or hinder workers in combining working with non-working life. In particular, we look at maternity and paternity provisions, the need for quality and affordable early childhood care, as well as specific supports needed by those with care responsibilities for children and adults. We have also documented in detail how the economic crisis that began in 2008 has impacted families in Europe, and how changes in family policy since 2010 are largely the result of a range of conflicting issues: the evolution of family needs; demands for austerity cuts; and the need for equitable distribution of limited resources.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0104	2017-04-25	UNK	Intergenerational solidarity needed to face Europe’s long-term challenges	29 April is EU Day of Solidarity between Generations. The objective of this annual celebration is to make the European Union more age-friendly and better adapted to our ageing population, as well as have intergenerational solidarity high on the EU agenda. Europe faces stark demographic challenges in the years ahead. The proportion of people aged 65 and over will rise from 17% to 30% of the EU population by 2060, while at the same time the working age population will decline. The European Commission estimates that most of the increase in public spending in the EU over the next 50 years will be on pensions, long-term care and healthcare. At the same time, youth unemployment is a longstanding problem that has been exacerbated by the economic crisis. Delayed entry into the labour market can have long-term effects on a person’s career, economic status, health and well-being. It can also lead to social disengagement, eroding the basis on which democratic societies are built. Dealing with these simultaneous challenges will require a comprehensive effort to improve working conditions, make work more sustainable and tackle the issue of young people not in employment, education and training. Intergenerational solidarity is not confined to the labour market, it is also expressed through social participation and active citizenship. Volunteer activity by older people can strengthen communities and build social capital, while reducing the risk of social exclusion.

It established a common market where people, goods, services and capital can move freely. More importantly, it created the conditions for prosperity and stability for European citizens, which has resulted in the longest period of peace in across the European continent. To mark and celebrate Schuman Day on 9 May, Eurofound staff explain what Europe means to them, in conjunction with activities to mark the day in other EU Institutions and Agencies in Europe and around the world.   40_year_dial_-_adobe_export_300_dpi_page_2_small230.png Created in 1975, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) was set up to contribute to the planning and establishment of better living and working conditions through action designed to increase and disseminate knowledge likely to assist this development.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0106	2017-04-19	UNK	Diverging trends across Europe highlight stagnation and decline in social mobility	Younger Europeans are likely to have fewer opportunities for upward social mobility than preceding generations. Social mobility in Europe seems to have stagnated - at least in some countries - with opportunities for upward social mobility only increasing in a minority of EU countries for all age groups; in some Member States there is even evidence of decline in social mobility. This is according to Eurofound’s new report Social mobility in the EU, which is the first of its kind to look at the issue throughout the European Union. The report looks at absolute social mobility - which is the extent of broader occupational change and societal progress - as well as social fluidity, which measures chances of moving between occupational classes. It shows that broad structural changes have enabled upward social mobility across three generations in the later 20th century, and more recently structural shifts have resulted in the extent of absolute social mobility among men and women becoming more similar. However, convergence in social mobility between EU Member States is slowing, and in some cases divergence is becoming apparent. In terms of social fluidity, only six countries [1] have recorded continuously increasing social mobility across the three generations examined. In Germany, Poland, UK and Ireland social fluidity has remained stable for all age groups, whereas Generation X (1965-1975) has experienced a decrease in social fluidity in Sweden, Austria, France and Bulgaria. Looking at social fluidity from a gender perspective, the report shows that the prospect of upward mobility among men born after 1964 has significantly deteriorated in many countries, most notably in the UK, France, Sweden, Austria, Estonia and Bulgaria. Social fluidity has changed less for women than for men: it has increased in Belgium, the Netherlands, the UK, the Czech Republic and Finland; and has decreased in Austria, Sweden, Germany and Spain. This research comes at a time when there is increasing concern that – for the first time in decades – younger generations will experience lower living standards and have fewer opportunities for upward social mobility than preceding generations. The report emphasises an increasing number of social and economic ‘losers’, referring to people from the middle tiers of employment who have moved into lower-tier occupations with less secure and less rewarding prospects. Increased residential and regional segregation, mainly by income or economic situation has become a feature of most urban areas in the majority of Member States. The report also shows that family background continues to be an important influence on prospects for social mobility, and there is some evidence that this aspect is becoming increasingly significant. The report contains a number of policy recommendations, particularly related to addressing educational disadvantage, creating equal opportunities in access to services, and moderating impact of residential segregation. In particular it calls for recognition of the continued importance of social background in order that policymakers at EU, national and regional levels can implement measures to promote more equal chances for social mobility and break down barriers so that everyone, regardless of where they are from, has the opportunity to fully realise their potential.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0111	2017-03-23	UNK	Treaty of Rome at heart of living and working in Europe	25 March marks 60 years since the signing of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, known as the Treaty of Rome. A seminal document, largely dedicated to economic integration and prosperity, it also enshrined the broader concepts of peace and equality. By bringing together European economies it ensured harmonious development, began a process of upward convergence and copper-fastened the bonds of solidarity between Europeans. In this way it it laid the foundations for the modern European Union and paved the way for the improvement of living and working conditions across Europe, which is the heart of Eurofound’s work still today. The Treaty set about establishing a common market and customs union between signatories Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany and laid the basis for the ‘four freedoms’ on which the EU is built; the free movement of persons, services, goods and capital. And across these decades as Europe has evolved, evidence-based policies have been increasingly required in order to promote the upward convergence of the living and working conditions of the 500 million people living within the EU’s borders, and to ensure Europe’s continued economic development. Although our research reflects the complexities of modern Europe, the values behind our work, whether it is on industrial relations, labour market change, monitoring convergence, quality of life and public services, working conditions and sustainable work; or even the digital age, can be traced back to the signing of the Treaty of Rome on 25 March 1957. When EU leaders meet on the 60th anniversary of the Treaty this Saturday in Rome they will not only reflect on the past, they will also look to the future of Europe. Whatever path the EU embarks upon, the principles of peace, solidarity and prosperity contained in the Treaty of Rome will continue to play their part. Likewise, Eurofound will continue to deliver on its mandate as it provides scientifically-sound, unbiased, timely and relevant knowledge to assist in the development of better of social, employment and work-related policies in Europe.

Evidence-based research is a fundamental stepping-stone on this path to gender equity.   In preparation for International Women’s Day we invite you to explore the issue of gender equality in depth, to read about the different areas in which gender equality is most urgently needed – because at Eurofound providing the knowledge needed to develop policies that ensure gender equality in life and work continues to be a top priority.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0114	2017-03-15	UNK	Income inequalities in Europe on the rise since Great Recession	Income inequalities have increased in around two-thirds of EU Member States largely due to growing unemployment levels since the onset of the crisis. At the same time EU-wide income inequality also increased as income convergence between European countries stalled – this is according to Eurofound's new report Income inequalities and employment patterns in Europe before and after the Great Recession. The report is a comprehensive study of income inequalities during the years of the Great Recession starting in 2008–2009, and based on income data for 2005-2013. It presents an EU-wide perspective on the issue and provides an updated picture of inequalities across different sources of income. The results show that EU-wide income inequality declined notably prior to 2008, driven by a strong process of income convergence between European countries – but the Great Recession broke this trend and pushed inequalities upwards both for the EU as a whole and across most countries. Previous studies have pointed to widening wage differentials as the main driver behind the long-term trend towards growing household disposable income inequalities observed in many European countries; however this report identifies unemployment and its associated decline in labour income as the main reason behind the surges in household disposable income inequalities occurring in recent years. The impact of the Great Recession on inequalities in household disposable income has not been confined to newer Member States or Mediterranean countries, but has also affected older Member States and northern European countries that have traditionally been more egalitarian, such as Germany, Sweden and Denmark. However, welfare state policies managed to cushion the magnitude of the increases in a number of Member States. The report shows that the crisis reduced average household disposable real income levels across almost all European countries, although to varying degrees, with the middle classes being significantly squeezed in the majority of countries. It also notes that the impact of the crisis revealed by real household disposable income levels is not always reflected by relative inequality indices or by GDP per capita data, which suggests that a wider set of indicators to assess well-being and economic prosperity in European societies should be adopted in order to properly assess the fall in living standards resulting from the Great Recession.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0116	2017-02-15	UNK	‘Working anytime, anywhere: The effects on the world of work’ - new report highlights opportunities and challenges of expanding telework	GENEVA/BRUSSELS (ILO News) –The expanding use of digital technologies such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and desktop computers for work for home and elsewhere is rapidly transforming the traditional model of work. It can improve work-life balance, reduce commuting time, and boost productivity, but it can also potentially result in longer working hours, higher work intensity and work-home interference, according to a new joint ILO-Eurofound report released today. The new report Working anytime, anywhere: The effects on the world of work synthesises research carried out by both organisations in 15 countries, including ten EU Member States [1] as well as Argentina, Brazil, India, Japan and the United States. The study identifies several types of employees using new technologies to work outside the employer’s premises, including regular home-based teleworkers, workers performing occasional telework and ICT-mobile work (T/ICTM). [2] The report highlights a number of positive effects of T/ICTM work, such as greater working time autonomy leading to more flexibility in terms of working time organisation, and reduced commuting time resulting in a better overall work-life balance and higher productivity. It also identifies several disadvantages such as a tendency to work longer hours, and an overlap between paid work and personal life – which can lead to high levels of stress. The report draws clear distinctions between home-based teleworkers who seem to enjoy better work-life balance and ‘high-mobile’ workers who are more at risk of negative health and well-being outcomes. ‘This report shows that the use of modern communication technologies facilitates a better overall work-life balance but, at the same time, also blurs the boundaries between work and personal life, depending on the place of work and the characteristics of different occupations,’ said the ILO’s Jon Messenger, co-author of the report. The report provides recommendations in order to address this disparity, such as promoting formal part-time teleworking to help teleworkers maintain ties with their co-workers and improve worker well-being, while restricting informal and supplemental T/ICTM work involving long working hours. ‘It is particularly important to address the issue of supplemental work performed through modern communications technology, for example additional working from home, which could be viewed as unpaid overtime, and also to ensure that minimum rest periods are respected, in order to avoid negative effects on workers’ health and well-being,’ said Oscar Vargas from Eurofound. Currently only the EU has an overall framework to adapt to digital change on telework, with the European Framework Agreement on Telework. However, most existing initiatives are related to formal, home-based telework, while problems seem to be more recurrent with informal, occasional T/ICTM work. As telework becomes more prominent so too has the need to disconnect in order to separate paid work and personal life, with France and Germany beginning to look at arrangements at the company level, and at existing and new legislation. In the future this may result in concrete measures to make working life less pervasive, such as shutting down computer servers outside working hours in order to prevent emails during rest times and holidays, which is already happening in some companies. Download the report Working anytime, anywhere: The effects on the world of work       [1] Belgium, France, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom [2] The incidence of T/ICTM varies substantially, ranging from 2 per cent to 40 per cent of employees, and depending on the country, occupation, sector and the frequency with which employees engage in the type of work. Across the EU-28, an average of about 17 per cent of employees are engaged in T/ICTM. In most countries, larger proportions of workers carry out T/ICTM occasionally rather than on a regular basis.   	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-anytime-anywhere-the-effects-on-the-world-of-work-new-report-highlights-opportunities-and

EUROFOUND_UNK_0118	2017-02-09	UNK	Minimum wages on the rise as Europe moves to curb social dumping	The growth in the level of minimum wages accelerated in the period between January 2016 and January 2017, with the largest increases in newer EU Member States. This continues a trend of slow convergence between minimum wage levels in Europe - however there is still a long way to go, with minimum wage workers in Luxembourg making eight and a half times as much as minimum wage workers in Bulgaria. This is according to the latest findings on statutory minimum wages in the EU from Eurofound’s European Observatory of Working Life. An end to social dumping - the employment of cheaper labour, sometimes involving migrants or moving production to lower-wage countries - and the protection of low-wage workers is a priority for the European Commission, with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker reemphasising the importance of this in a landmark speech in January this year. Eurofound's new article provides information on statutory minimum wage levels, how the minimum wage has been determined for the year 2017, and minimum wage coverage across the EU. The article shows that a statutory minimum wage is in operation in 22 out of 28 EU countries, with most countries without a statutory wage applying a de facto minimum wage via sectorial collective agreements. Over the past 12 months Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic recorded the highest increases in the minimum wage, which continues a seven year trend of consistent growth of the minimum wage in these countries, albeit from very low levels. Despite this general convergence the differences remain stark, with a minimum wage worker earning €1,999 per month in Luxembourg, compared to €235 in Bulgaria. The benefits of a return to economic growth can be seen for low-wage workers in most Member States, and only Greece recorded a lower minimum wage in 2017 than 2010.  There has also been a return to a more collaborative approach in determining minimum wages in a number of Member States, with the input of social partners and expert committees. Social partners have been involved in the negotiation of the minimum wage in Austria, however the government has stated that it may implement a minimum wage by legal means if a minimum wage of €1,500 is not agreed upon by mid-2017. Germany and Ireland for the first time used the expert committee for the 2017 minimum wage levels, with Romania planning to also adopt this practice in the future. Minimum wage workers in most countries have felt the difference to their pockets, as the real term change to wages have increased in relation to prices in the majority of countries compared to 2010, with the particular exception of Greece where workers are still significantly worse off.

The European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) is conducted by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound). Since its launch in 1990, the EWCS has provided an overview of working conditions in Europe in order to: assess and quantify working conditions of both employees and the self-employed across Europe on a harmonised basis; analyse relationships between different aspects of working conditions; identify groups at risk and issues of concern as well as of progress; monitor trends by providing homogeneous indicators on these issues; and contribute to European policy development in particular on quality of work and employment issues.   The Integrated Data File on the UK Data Service website includes all the questions which were asked over the life course of the EWCS. Main topics covered include: employment status, sectors and occupations, company size; physical environment; work intensity; working time and commuting; social environment; work-related health risks and well-being; cognitive and psychosocial factors; harassment and discrimination; skills, training and discretion; job prospects, job security and sustainability; work satisfaction; earnings; unpaid work; work-life balance.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0122	2017-01-17	UNK	Mid-career reviews key to longer and healthier working lives	Mid-career reviews (MCR), where employers organise an assessment of workers in the workplace at a mid-point in their working life, are an important tool to ensure that workers' skills continue to match the job demands, or whether a change in tasks or career is required. Eurofound's new report Changing places: Mid-career review and internal mobility, launched in Brussels today, shows that timely mid-career reviews can improve an employee's working life, boost their added value to their employer, and help to address Europe's long-term demographic ageing challenge. Europe is currently facing a demographic crisis, with a shrinking workforce coupled with increased demands for social services. The labour force in Europe is projected to decrease by an average of two million every year between 2010 and 2030. This represents a loss of 1% of its current size per year for 20 years. Yet, in many countries, most workers still retire too early. They often do so not because they want to, but because they feel compelled to, and that they do not have other options. Solutions need to be found to make work more sustainable, and to extend working lives in order to avoid old-age poverty and to reduce state expenditure on pensions and welfare. Although the nature of employment is changing, continuous, long-term, regular employment relationships are still the norm across Europe, and the evidence suggests that most people retire from a job they have held for over 20 years. Anticipating the future needs of middle-aged workers, before their options to progress and change their conditions of employment become too limited, is therefore important for employers as well as employees. This is particularly relevant for the 9%-15% of workers in Europe that are in 'arduous' jobs - which are intense, dangerous and unhealthy or unsustainable. Demographic change in Europe necessitates that MCRs become an important part of sustainable human resource management policies in companies. Companies can benefit significantly from retaining older workers, both in terms of skills management and the intergenerational transfer of knowledge. Companies also play an important role in helping older employees transition to more sustainable work. The new report shows that wide-spread adoption of MCRs and effective age management policies is a vital priority for companies today, as demographic change in Europe is an acute challenge for tomorrow.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0125	2017-01-16	UNK	New programme seeks to respond to diverse social, employment and work-related challenges facing EU policymakers	(Dublin, Ireland): Eurofound has launched its new work programme for 2017 to 2020. This document sets out the activities the Agency plans to undertake in the next four years to support European decision-makers in formulating effective policies for the improvement of quality of life and work in a fair and competitive Europe during this challenging period. The new multiannual programme commences at a time when the EU looks back at a decade of economic and political turmoil. A large part of Europe has experienced high levels of unemployment, especially among young people, growing economic insecurity, and increasing poverty and exclusion. While slow growth returned to most Member States in 2015, and employment levels recovered in many, the recovery is fragile and significant divides persist both within and between Member States. These tensions affect European integration. It is important therefore that in the coming period progress is made in solving the economic challenges Europe continues to face: increasing competitiveness; ensuring sustainable, job-rich growth; achieving more equal and inclusive societies. In response, Eurofound has chosen six strategic areas of intervention in which to carry out activities aimed at providing the knowledge to achieve upward convergence of living and working conditions in the European Union. Working conditions and sustainable work Industrial relations Labour market change Quality of life and public services The digital age: Opportunities and challenges for work and employment Monitoring convergence in the European Union Through the framework of these six areas – including both established areas of expertise and new and innovative dimensions - Eurofound aims to examine how living and working conditions can be improved through public policies and legislation, through the intervention of the social partners, and through practices at workplace level.

This document sets out the work that the Agency plans to undertake in the next four years to support European decision-makers in formulating policies to steer Europe through a challenging and uncertain period. Eurofound has chosen six strategic areas of intervention in which to carry out activities aimed at providing the knowledge to achieve upward convergence of living and working conditions in the European Union. These are: Working conditions and sustainable work Industrial relations Labour market change Quality of life and public services The digital age: Opportunities and challenges for work and employment Monitoring convergence in the European Union The first four are the core areas where Eurofound has established its expertise over four decades and ensure continuity in the Agency’s work. The final two introduce a new dimension into Eurofound’s activities as they capture cross-cutting challenges and paradigmatic changes – the digital shift and trends in convergence in the European Union – that are likely to have a transforming influence on the areas at the centre of Eurofound’s work. Through the framework of these six areas of intervention, Eurofound aims to examine how living and working conditions can be improved through public policies and legislation, through the intervention of the social partners, and through practices at workplace level.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0129	2016-10-11	UNK	Gender employment gap costs Europe €370 billion per year	Despite a continued increase in the female activity rate in Europe during the recent financial crisis and a narrowing of the gender participation gap in most Member States, a significant gender employment gap remains. With the female employment rate still more than 10% lower than the male equivalent, the cost of this -including foregone earnings and missed welfare contributions of individuals to the society, as well as the public finance cost, comprising individual welfare transfers and social benefits - is now estimated at around €370 billion, corresponding to 2.8% of the EU’s GDP.[1] At an individual level, the cost of a woman’s exclusion from employment throughout her working life is estimated at between €1.2 million and €2 million, depending on her educational level. These findings are detailed in the new report The gender employment gap: Challenges and solutions, presented to the European Parliament’s Women’s Rights and Gender Equality Committee in Brussels today. The report details the main characteristics of gender gaps in labour market participation, employment and economic status. It looks at the main determinants of female labour market participation and studies the social effects of women’s participation in the labour market, as these effects go beyond the economic sphere and extend to people’s well-being and to society as a whole. Finally, it provides an overview and assessment of the effectiveness of policy measures promoting the labour market participation of women in six Member States, highlighting particularly successful and innovative cases. A number of immediate and long-term policy recommendations are included to close the gender employment gap. It recommends policies to create incentives for employers to increase labour market participation, providing adequate and affordable childcare support, ensuring parental and adult care leave, as well as increasing the provision of flexible working arrangements. On a broader level, it emphasises the importance that employers see women as a crucial segment of their workforce, and that care responsibilities and the adaptations needed to help them reconcile these with work are not a ‘women’s problem’ but an area for action from which the workforce as a whole, as well as the employer, can benefit. The report is an important resource for policymakers, businesses and employee representativeness in addressing, and ultimately eliminating, the lower female employment rate in Europe. It also carries a broader message that should resonate with all; the gender employment gap represents an economic and social cost that Europe cannot afford, and all actors should work together in order to promote and foster the labour market participation of women.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0130	2016-12-06	UNK	Two new studies highlight the significant contribution of EU Agencies to citizens and administrations	The 45 EU Agencies and Joint Undertakings make a vast contribution to the economic and political development of the European Union according to two new studies presented today during the EU Agencies Forum at the European Parliament. The studies highlight that while the EU Agencies represent less than 0.8% of the EU’s annual budget their contribution has widespread impact at citizen, industry and policy level. The first study analyses the cost-effectiveness of the seven EU Agencies operating to support the Internal Market, and how they reduce the overall costs to taxpayers. The second study focuses on the contribution of 44 Agencies and Joint Undertakings to the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Juncker Commission Agenda. The studies will be discussed today and tomorrow during the first EU Agencies Forum at the European Parliament. Vice-President of the European Parliament, Mairead McGuinness and Kristalina Georgieva, Vice-President of the European Commission, are speakers at the event. António Campinos, Executive Director of the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) which is currently Chair of the EU Agencies Network, said: 'The EU Agencies are the familiar face of the EU for many Europeans, delivering essential services on the ground for a relatively small proportion of the overall EU budget - less than 0.8%, to be exact. In other terms, they cost €1.23 euros per EU citizen. The cost-benefit ratio is hence very positive, and as the EU Parliament study has shown, agencies save national administrations many millions every year, by delivering synergies and preventing duplication of efforts in each Member State.' Agencies are cost effective and save money Overall, the 2015 budget of the EU Agencies represents less than 0.8% of the EU’s annual budget (about €1.2 billion), while creating significant efficiencies and delivering value for EU citizens across a wide range of policy areas, according to a report by Deloitte. A second report commissioned by the European Parliament estimates that it would cost Member States up to €200 million a year to assume the tasks currently done by just seven of the 45 agencies.* Agencies are close to EU citizens and businesses As well as supporting the top political priorities of the European Union, EU Agencies play an important role in many other aspects of the everyday life of citizens: in disease prevention and control, security and defence, education and knowledge, stability of the financial systems, and in the fields of digital connectivity or transport, among others. In 32 cities across 24 Member States, EU Agencies work to improve the EU industry and citizens’ lives in many ways. For example: Frontex, the European Border and Coastguard Agency, currently deploys some 1 200 officers at EU’s external borders and has helped to rescue more than 89 000 people at sea so far this year; The European Asylum Support Office currently deploys over 300 staff in around 20 locations in Italy and Greece. They are working to support the implementation of the EU Relocation Programme and EU-TR Statement. EASO has an important role in better managing the Common European Asylum System; In 2015, Europol, the EU’s law enforcement agency, supported more than 40,000 investigations against terrorism and serious crime; The EU’s Intellectual Property Office’s study on the economic contribution of Intellectual Property Rights shows that IPR intensive industries in the EU now support directly or indirectly 38% of jobs and 42% of the EU’s GDP; Since 2010, the European Institute of Innovation & Technology (EIT) has created Europe’s largest innovation community, helped set up 32 innovation hubs across Europe, and supported the creation of more than 200 innovative start-ups and entrepreneurship training for 2,000 students and graduates; From 2014-2020 the Bio-based Industries Joint Undertaking is administering €3.7bn investments in bio-based innovation and will be funding more than 200 cooperative projects through cross-industry clusters; The EMCDDA (EU drugs agency in Lisbon), monitors over 560 new psychoactive substances through an EU Early Warning System. Where required, it assesses the risks of these substances to public health in Europe; The European Medicines Agency has recommended over 1000 new medicines for the treatment of patients. In addition to monitoring approved medicines, it also addresses the challenges holding back the development of new medicines, including new antibiotics. * The European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO); The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA); The European Medicines Agency (EMA); The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA); The European Banking Authority (EBA); The European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA); The European Insurance & Occupational Pensions (EIOPA).	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/two-new-studies-highlight-the-significant-contribution-of-eu-agencies-to-citizens-and
EUROFOUND_UNK_0131	2016-10-04	UNK	Partial retirement schemes can help secure pensions	Partial retirement schemes can be an important part of the solution to improving sustainability of Europe’s pension systems. However, despite their clear potential, the practical experiences of partial retirement have shown mixed results, according to a recently published report from Eurofound Extending working lives through flexible retirement schemes: Partial retirement. Eurofound's report looks at the development of partial retirement schemes in the EU and Norway, with more detailed analysis in seven Member States.  Pension reforms achieve limited aims A number of reforms have been introduced across the EU to improve the sustainability of pensions, involving changes to both state and occupational pension schemes. However, these reforms bring their own consequences and have often proved unpopular. Freezing or reducing pension benefits means that pensions no longer meet recipients’ need as they once did; meanwhile, increased contributions have put pressure on disposable income and wage costs. The net benefits of discouraging early retirement and increasing the pension age have also been limited, with workers not necessarily able or motivated to work until the statutory pension age: 25% of the EU28 workforce exits early due to health issues, disability, or care commitments. Partial retirement can potentially provide a new direction for progress, substituting part of the income with a partial pension or benefits. About two-thirds of EU citizens say that this option appeals more than full retirement.  Mixed picture of partial retirement However, the practical experiences of partial retirement analysed by Eurofound have shown mixed results. Partial retirement enables particular groups of people to extend their working lives – in particular, those with health problems, disabilities, care responsibilities and physically or mentally demanding jobs. However, for many workers, the reduction of hours facilitated by early retirement is often greater than the increase in hours gained by extending their working lives.  Policy pointers Workers who can benefit from partial retirement need to be made more aware of the schemes, and partial retirement should certainly be presented as a more attractive option than early retirement. Such schemes can meet individual needs or preferences to reduce working time, while allowing workers to retain an adequate income. However, the report states, continued full-time employment should be encouraged and supported as the best option.  Download the report here: http://bit.ly/PartialRetirement   	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/partial-retirement-schemes-can-help-secure-pensions-0

EUROFOUND_UNK_0134	2016-09-30	UNK	Eurofound report highlights cost of inadequate housing	A recently published report from Eurofound, Inadequate housing in Europe: Costs and consequences, highlights the current costs of poor housing and the benefits that stand to flow from improving the housing stock. The report was requested by the European Parliament in its 2013 resolution Social housing in the EU and is based on data from the third European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS). It finds that issues such as heating, insulation, structural problems and cramped conditions continue to affect a substantial proportion of the population in most Member States, despite a gradual improvement in quality in recent years. These inadequacies have negative impacts on health, make it more likely that occupants will suffer accidents, and have a negative impact on productivity and economic output. Standard of housing varies widely between Member States The report also shows considerable divergence in the standards of housing in Europe. Although only 3% of EU residents said they lack basic facilities such as an indoor flushing toilet, or a bath or shower, this statistic masks large national differences. In Romania, for example, 22% of the population have neither a toilet, nor a bath/shower. Issues associated with structural problems are more widespread: 12% of EU residents reported damp or leaks, and 9% reported rot in windows, doors and floors. Again, there are pronounced national differences: more than half of residents in Cyprus reported a structural issue in their dwelling, whereas in Austria and Sweden it was less than one in ten.  Upgrading housing stock – social and economic benefits Inadequate housing costs EU economies nearly €194 billion per year – in direct costs associated with healthcare and related medical and social services, and indirect costs such as lost productivity and reduced opportunities. To bring the standard of housing up to an acceptable level would cost about €295 billion at 2011 prices. If all necessary improvements were completed at once, the report projects that this €295 billion would be repaid within 18 months by savings in healthcare and better social outcomes. However, in Cyprus, Greece, Hungary, Malta, Portugal and Spain, the investment would be recouped in less than a year. (This figure does not include non-health related outcomes such as the impact on market values, home insurance, enforcement action, or the potential economic and social capital associated with community development through the improvement of housing.) The report also highlights that the removal of housing inadequacies is a long-term investment that will pay both short-term and long-term social and economic dividends. Savings on healthcare provision alone would total some €9 billion in the first year; however, positive outcomes could extend to include a stimulation of the local economy, improved social protection of vulnerable groups, the integration of migrants, and greater social mobility, particularly for Europe's most disadvantaged children living in inadequate housing.  Immediate actions to be taken The report recommends immediate actions that can be taken, such as improving data collected at national level, so that interventions can be well-planned and capitalise on a strong return on investment. The report is also accompanied by a set of case studies from across Europe that will be of particular interest to experts in housing policy and legislators.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/eurofound-report-highlights-cost-of-inadequate-housing
EUROFOUND_UNK_0135	2016-09-28	UNK	Making work more sustainable throughout the life course	European countries face the challenges of ageing populations supported by shrinking workforces, more precarious types of employment, and in many cases, a decreasing number of jobs in the wake of the economic crisis. As a result, the issue of how to enable more people to participate in the labour market and to continue to do so until an older age has become a key policy issue in all EU Member States. These challenges might be met by adopting an approach to work that puts sustainability at its centre. Sustainable work means that ‘living and working conditions are such that they support people in engaging and remaining in work throughout an extended working life’. Eurofound's publication Sustainable work throughout the life course: National policies and strategies analyses national policies that help to achieve sustainable work in 10 EU Member States. It looks at how these policies are being implemented, whether they are integrated into a coherent framework, and whether they are complementary or contradictory. The report is being presented at the 'Workplace innovation – Sustainable work: Retaining Europe’s ageing workforce and making work more sustainable throughout the life course' conference at the European Economic and Social Committee in Brussels tomorrow. Click here to find out more about the event. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/labour-market-working-conditions-quality-of-life/making-work-more-sustainable-throughout-the-life-course

EUROFOUND_UNK_0137	2016-09-14	UNK	The true cost of poor housing	The cost of people living in inadequate housing in the EU Member States is hitting economies to the tune of nearly €194 billion per year, a new report from Eurofound states. The cost of addressing the shortcomings of the housing stock would be in the region of €295 billion (at 2011 prices). However, the report maintains, the outlay could be quickly recouped from savings on healthcare and a range of publicly funded services. The effect of such investment would have a considerable impact on residents, improving their health and well-being. For example, for every €3 invested in basic measures, €2 would be paid back through savings in health and social care within one year. These measures include repairing ineffective heating and improving poor insulation, fixing broken lifts, updating old plumbing and electricity systems, improving security and addressing overcrowding. The report, Inadequate housing in Europe: Costs and consequences, aims to improve understanding of the true cost of substandard housing for EU Member States, and suggests policy initiatives that might help address its social and financial consequences.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0138	2016-09-14	UNK	Combining work with partial retirement	With people living longer and birth rates falling across Europe, a priority of EU policy is to encourage Europeans to remain in work beyond current retirement ages, to minimise pressure on pension systems. At present, older workers often leave the workforce before statutory retirement age, with health problems and care responsibilities cited as common reasons. Many more people simply wish to work less. One possible way to balance this legitimate desire for a better work–life balance with the need to address demographic pressures is to make more widespread use of partial retirement schemes. These schemes enable older workers to reduce their working hours, while the loss of income is compensated for by a partial payment of their pension. At the same time, workers continue to earn and to contribute to that pension. A report published by Eurofound explores the success of such schemes in extending working lives. No scheme was identified that unambiguously extended working lives for all participants. Partial retirement may have extended working lives for specific groups: overall, however, the reduction in hours enabled by partial retirement outweighs the increased hours due to prolonging the working lives of participants.

The removal of housing inadequacies across the EU, or at least improving them to an acceptable level, would cost about €295 billion at 2011 prices.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0143	2016-09-01	UNK	Variable attitudes towards variable pay in Europe	Performance-related pay and employee reward systems in Europe are often unevenly distributed among different groups of workers; particularly benefitting men, highly-skilled and highly ranked workers. Without robust monitoring and transparency, supplementary employee reward systems could potentially exacerbate pre-existing pay inequalities. This is according to Eurofound's new report Changes in remuneration and rewards systems, published today. The use of supplementary employee reward systems has become a well-established practice in Europe. These are schemes used by companies to reward performance and motivate employees both as individuals and as a group. They are normally separate from basic salary and can be monetary or in-kind payments. The employees that benefit from these schemes often welcome them as a means to boost their income and as recognition of their performance. According to the European Company Survey, almost two-thirds of European establishments use at least one form of variable pay. The most common system, implemented by close to half of companies, is linked to individual performance according to management appraisal. Individual results-based pay and profit sharing is used in around one third of establishments, and pay based on team performance is also common. Share-ownership is not commonly used by European establishments. These reward systems are more prevalent in the private sector than in the public sector, particularly in information and communications technology, finance and insurance, and consultancies. Larger companies are more likely to use reward systems than small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly multinational companies and companies located in economically advanced regions. There is also a higher presence of some form of supplementary employee reward systems in companies that foster employee involvement and autonomy, pay higher salaries and have a larger number of permanent and full-time staff. Employer organisations in Europe are generally in favour of reward systems as they are seen to be powerful tools to increase employees’ motivation and to link salaries to a company’s performance. The approach of trade unions is more nuanced: they acknowledge the advantages for workers, but warn that that if these systems are not properly designed they can lead to inequalities as well as income instability. In some instances variable pay systems can be used as a way to assert managerial control in labour markets defined by lower fixed wages and high unemployment. Supplementary employee reward systems are more or less a fixed characteristic of the European labour market, particularly in the private sector. Employers have a growing need for more flexibility, together with a desire to attract highly qualified personnel and financially motivate their workforce against a background of an ageing population, shortages of professionals, and a requirement for higher skills. Among employees, there is also increasing interest in supplementary pay systems on top of wages, especially among highly skilled and highly qualified workers. The use of these schemes is likely to increase in the future, particularly during a climate of economic recovery. In order for rewards and benefits systems to be more widely available and beneficial to the broader workforce, further work needs to be done by policymakers, employers and trade union organisations.  Download the report in full here. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/business-industrial-relations-labour-market/variable-attitudes-towards-variable-pay-in-europe

EUROFOUND_UNK_0145	2016-09-05	UNK	Measuring peoples’ perception of quality of life in Europe	Eurofound launches the fieldwork for the fourth edition of its European Quality of Life Survey today. The survey, which offers a comprehensive picture of the views of people living across 33 countries including the EU Member States and candidate countries, will be carried out over the coming 13 weeks. The fourth edition of the European Quality of Life Survey covers 33 countries, 28 EU Member States and all five candidate countries: Albania, FYR Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey. In total, 35,800 people will be surveyed in the 33 countries, with an individual target sample of between 1,000 to 2,000 per country. The fieldwork is carried out simultaneously in all countries, coordinated by TNS Opinion in Belgium with local partners, starting on Monday 5 September and ending on 2 December 2016. Carried out every four years, this unique, pan-European survey examines both the objective circumstances of European citizens' lives and how they feel about those circumstances and their lives in general. It looks at a range of issues, such as housing, deprivation, family, health and wellbeing. It also looks at subjective topics, such as people’s levels of happiness, how satisfied they are with their lives, and their participation in society. The survey presents data on issues that general statistics do not cover - such as the perceived quality of society, trust in institutions and social tensions. This round will have a specific focus on the use quality of public services: healthcare, long-term care, childcare and schools. Different aspects of quality will be measured, such as access, facilities, staff and information available. Over the years, the EQLS has developed into a valuable set of indicators which complements traditional indicators of economic growth and living standard such as GDP or income. The European Commission uses it in various publications such as annual reports on employment and social developments in Europe. Other examples include the UNECE which uses the data for comparative research about countries for its Active Ageing Index, and the Danish government which uses the EQLS rating of health services in one of its official outputs.  Click here for more information about the fourth European Quality of Life Survey (4th EQLS).    For further information, contact: Tadas Leončikas, Research Manager, email: tle@eurofound.europa.eu, telephone: +353-1-204 3123 Daphne Ahrendt, Research Manager, email: dap@eurofound.europa.eu, telephone: +353-1-204 3168 Eszter Sandor, Research Officer, email: esa@eurofound.europa.eu, telephone: +353-1-204 3151 Sophia MacGoris, Surveys Assistant, email: eqls@eurofound.europa.eu, telephone: +353-1-204 3108 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/measuring-peoples-perception-of-quality-of-life-in-europe
EUROFOUND_UNK_0146	2016-08-08	UNK	Male employment rebounds and part-time work surges	The gender employment gap in the EU has narrowed by 2 percentage points since the global economic crisis erupted in 2008; by mid-2015 women formed 46% of the workforce. The decrease is mostly a result of the disproportionate impact of the recession on employment in sectors that employ men predominantly, particularly manufacturing and construction. Employment has grown in predominantly female-employing service sectors, especially health and education, and this also been a factor. With the economic recovery, however, the pattern has changed, and recent employment gains have been more evenly shared between men and women. An analysis of recent developments in employment in the EU has been published in the annual report of Eurofound’s European Jobs Monitor (EJM), which monitors shifts in employment and the nature of those shifts. Part of this analysis is an examination of employment change according to how job gains or losses are distributed across the pay spectrum. It categorises jobs into five pay categories or quintiles – from lowest-paying (quintile 1) to highest-paying (quintile 5) – and describes the extent of job loss or gain across the quintiles. Figure 1 shows the quintile shifts by gender. Contrasts by gender In the upturn, male employment gains have been stronger than female employment gains in the bottom two quintiles, while female gains have been comparatively stronger in the top two quintiles. Lower-paid service jobs, where women have tended to predominate, have contributed considerably to recent employment growth for men. The fastest growing job in 2013–2015 was that of personal service workers in the food and drinks sector, a job in the bottom quintile. Over 200,000 net new jobs were created in this occupation each year, which were more or less equally divided by gender.  Figure 1: Employment change in the EU by wage quintile and gender, 2013–2015  image003.png   However, looking at marginal employment change does not give an accurate picture of the distribution of female employment in the EU economy – this is illustrated in Figure 2 below. It shows that women predominate only in the bottom quintile, where they account for over two-thirds of jobs. In the top two quintiles, they account for just over 40% of jobs. Figure 2: Female employment share in the EU by wage quintile, 2011 and 2015  female_share_2011_and_2015_2.png   The changes in employment over 2011–2015 resulted in modest adjustments to the gender profile of the EU workforce. There was a slight decline in the proportion of women in the bottom quintile (-0.6 percentage points), and increases in the proportion of women the other quintiles ranged between +0.3 percentage points and +0.9 percentage points. Steady rise of part time The EJM analysis also looks at employment status and shows that part-time employment in the EU increased rapidly in 2011–2015, while levels of full-time, permanent employment declined. A majority of workers still have full-time, permanent work – or core employment status – but the proportion is declining, falling from 61.3% to 56.3% in the EU15 (the pre-2004 Member States) over the past 20 years, although the figure has stabilised since 2013. Figure 3 illustrates an emerging division between the top quintile and other quintiles regarding employment contract. Full-time, permanent employment increased only in the top quintile; it fell in all other quintiles. Meanwhile, the share of part-time jobs grew across the wage distribution. These shifts indicate a destandardisation of employment in 2011–2015, mainly involving the replacement of full-time work with part-time work. While core employment remains the dominant status, less typical types of employment status are becoming more normalised. Figure 3: Employment change in the EU by wage quintile and employment status, 2011–2015  image005.png If this trend persists, it means that that core employment, with its greater contractual security, career advancement possibilities and full-time earning capacity, will increasingly be a privileged position enjoyed by those in well-paid jobs. Dutch ‘part-time revolution’ The employment status of workers varies widely across the Member States. In 2015, only one in three workers in the Netherlands had a full-time, permanent job – over half of the Dutch workforce works part time and an increasing share are self-employed. By contrast, in Bulgaria and the Baltic states, around four out of five workers have core employment status. The incidence of part-time work tends to be much lower in eastern European Member States. Part-time grew especially strongly in Germany over 2011–2015, where some 28% of workers now work part time. But it has also grown in Greece and Spain despite large overall declines in the workforces of both these countries. These declines mainly affected full-time, permanent employment, with secondary impacts on the large shares of temporary workers in Spain and of self-employed workers in Greece. In the UK, a greater share of overall employment growth occurred in core employment, while self-employment grew at a similar rate to part-time work.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0147	2016-07-26	UNK	Eurofound and the Slovak EU Presidency 2016	Slovakia took over the Presidency of the European Council from the Netherlands on 1 July 2016. The Programme of the Slovak Presidency of the Council of the European Union is based on four priorities: an economically strong Europe a modern single market sustainable migration and asylum policies, and a globally engaged Europe.  The Slovak Presidency begins at a time when the Union is facing unprecedented challenges: the result of the UK Referendum calls for discussion on the future of the Union, the continuing migration crisis raises questions concerning the integrity of the Schengen area, the recent terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels have highlighted weaknesses in the area of internal security and the consequences of the economic and financial crisis are still affecting the economies of the EU Member States. This work is being done within the framework of priorities agreed with the Council of the European Union by the three Presidencies for the period between January 2016 and June 2017 - the Netherlands, Slovakia and Malta. The 18-month programme of the Presidencies trio has the priorities growth, jobs, freedom, security, justice, energy union and a stronger EU in the world. For the next six months, the Slovak Presidency aims to make significant progress on boosting entrepreneurship and job creation. This includes promoting a climate in which SMEs thrive to 'help open up the potential for the Union to generate further growth and create jobs'. The trio programme also states: 'Unemployment is a major concern in most Member States. Proposals which help tackle unemployment and which open up opportunities for European citizens will be a key priority. Particular attention will be paid to initiatives in the area of youth, long-term and structural unemployment, as well as full access to the labour market.' It continues: 'The three Presidencies are determined to work together on the forthcoming Labour Mobility Package removing the remaining obstacles to EU mobility with the aim of smoothing the effect of future economic shocks, supporting fair competition and fair labour standards and in so doing contribute to the shared objective of decent work.' On issues relating to social and work-related policies, Eurofound is cooperating with the Slovak Presidency. Relevant priorities include: Job creation – through the daily updating of its restructuring events database, the recently published European Jobs Monitor 2016: What do Europeans do at work? A task-based analysis, and the  Job creation in SMEs (ERM) research.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0150	2016-07-14	UNK	Highest-paying and lowest-paying jobs grow most	Employment in the EU is growing, and the jobs that have grown most in numbers in recent years are at the opposite ends of the pay spectrum:  at the low end, cleaners and helpers providing services to buildings and personal services workers in the food and drinks industry, and at the high end, health professionals working in healthcare (see the blue rows in Table 1 below). These details come from the annual report of Eurofound’s European Jobs Monitor (EJM), which presents an analysis of developments in EU employment in the 2011–2015 period. The EJM defines a job as a specific occupation within a specific economic sector. Table 1 lists the 10 jobs that employ the greatest number of people in the EU. The two largest-employing – sales workers in retail and teaching professionals in education, which together account for 10% of all employment in the EU – grew very modestly over 2011–2015 and growth was concentrated in the two years between 2013 and 2015. Table 1: Top 10 jobs by employment in the EU, 2011–2015  biggest_jobs_2.png Blue-collar job loss The greatest job losses occurred in blue-collar occupations in the agricultural and construction sectors (the yellow rows in the table). Numbers of skilled agricultural workers fell by more than half a million over 2011–2015; a disproportionate amount of this job loss took place in the large agricultural sectors of Poland and Romania. Employment in construction continued to fall seven years on from the construction busts that accompanied the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, but the rate of job loss slowed significantly after 2013. Fastest growth in top-paid jobs The EJM classifies jobs in one of five wage categories (or quintiles) – from lowest-paying (quintile 1) to highest-paying (quintile 5). Since the late 1990s, the fastest employment growth has occurred in jobs in the top wage quintile in both recessionary and non-recessionary periods. This is the case also in 2011–2015, where four of the top 10 fastest-growing jobs were in quintile 5 (see Table 2). These are white-collar jobs in the information and communications technology (ICT), financial or professional services sectors. Number one is ICT professionals in computer programming and consultancy, a job that has increased by 39% since 2011. This job, however, employs less than 1% of European workers. In fact, these high-paying, fastest-growing jobs account for a relatively small amount of total employment, so they have had a limited impact on the employment structure overall. Table 2: 10 fastest-growing jobs in the EU, 2011–2015  fastest-growing_jobs.png   The top 10 fastest-declining jobs, shown in Table 3, are mainly low- and mid-paid jobs; no top-quintile jobs appear in the list. It includes three different construction-related jobs, reflecting the troubles of the sector. Two public administration jobs saw fast declines – protective services workers (social workers) and clerical workers. These jobs have suffered due to widespread public spending restrictions in most Member States in recent years. Declining employment of retail managers may relate to the vogue for ‘management delayering’, identified in many recent retail sector restructurings, whereby layers of middle management have been flattened or eliminated. The often-stated objective of such restructurings is to maximise the share of employees in direct customer service. The online migration of retail transactions may also be a factor.   Table 3: 10 fastest-declining jobs in the EU, 2011–2015  fastest-declining_jobs.png Services at the fore The service sector accounted for nearly all net new employment in 2011–2015, and this growth occurred across all five wage quintiles (Figure 1). The greatest growth occurred in the top quintile, which added a net figure of over two million jobs. These were mainly health and education jobs in the public sector and jobs in private sector knowledge-intensive services, such as media, ICT, consulting, advertising, financial, legal services and accounting. Figure 1: Employment shifts (in thousands) by broad sector and wage quintile, 2011–2015 sectors_figure_2.png   The chart also shows there was net job growth in top-quintile jobs in manufacturing and construction, even as employment declined in each of the other four quintiles. This indicates an upskilling of the workforce, especially in manufacturing. Here employment growth was concentrated amongst science and engineering professionals and, to a lesser extent, business and administrative professionals. Employment shrank in more traditional blue-collar occupations in manufacturing and, to an even greater extent, in construction. These jobs are mainly found in quintiles 2 and 3. The primary sectors – agriculture and mining – shed employment in the bottom two quintiles. Further reading The 2015 EJM annual report includes more details on shifts in the employment structure. It also introduces a new set of indicators on the task content, methods and tools used at work in the present day and uses these to give a detailed account of what Europeans do at work and how they do it. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/labour-market/highest-paying-and-lowest-paying-jobs-grow-most

EUROFOUND_UNK_0152	2016-05-17	UNK	SMEs take distinct approach to recruitment	Eurofound’s recent study on job creation in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) included an examination of SMEs’ approach to hiring, which is quite different from that of larger firms. Recruitment is usually informal, for instance, but while most SMEs do not follow any standardised procedures, hiring decisions are thought through strategically. SMEs tend to consider carefully whether the workload of the position will be sufficient in the long run and recruit only if the job is deemed sustainable. Processes do become standardised with repeated recruitment, as owners become more experienced in hiring. And while recruiting new staff is time consuming, owners prefer to put in the time and do it themselves as they see staff as the most important resource of the company. Selection Smaller employers apply different criteria in choosing recruits than larger companies. SMEs are less interested in formal qualifications and tend to evaluate an applicant’s motivation, skills and capacity to learn. They also focus on candidates’ transversal skills – skills that are relevant regardless of sector or occupation – and soft skills, such as teamwork, willingness to work hard, international experience, flexibility and adaptability. The ability of the candidate to fit into the existing workforce and culture and to share the company’s ambitions is critical. For this reason, SMEs place a lot of emphasis on face-to-face interviews with candidates. These are conducted by the owner, often with other senior staff or staff who will work closely with the new recruit. Candidates normally go through two or three interviews, but testing of competences is less common. Gut feeling can be pivotal in the final hiring decision. Channels The recruitment channels that SMEs use to identify candidates tend to be quite limited. Accessibility and cost-effectiveness are important, so they often turn to personal and professional networks. In general, they don’t favour online recruitment, but certain sectors – such as the creative industries, the technology sector, finance and engineering, and young growth businesses – typically use social media and internet job search tools. For jobs involving high levels of responsibility or requiring higher skills, they enlist a greater number of and more sophisticated channels. SMEs do not typically use public employment services, and only a few national public employment services (notably in Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden) have a formal strategy for working with SMEs. Private recruitment agencies tend to be too costly for their small-scale recruiting. Quality of candidates The informal approach means that recruitment can be relatively fast, and the types of channels used by SMEs keep down costs. However, this often means that SMEs reach a smaller number of candidates than they would like, and the quality of candidates turned up by the search can be disappointing. Some job-seekers find the prospect of working for an SME unattractive, and there is evidence that certain aspects of working conditions tend to be of lower quality than in larger firms, such as job security, pay, formal training opportunities and career prospects. At the same time, workers in SMEs benefit from some advantages inherent to the smaller scale of the employer, including better working time flexibility, autonomy, meaningful tasks and involvement in decision-making. More detail on this topic and on job creation in SMEs is available in the report Job creation in SMEs: ERM annual report 2015.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/labour-market/smes-take-distinct-approach-to-recruitment

Such problems are present across the entire EU and on average, 19% of LGBT employees feels discriminated against at work. The research shows that many employees do not in fact disclose that they are LGBT in order to avoid discrimination in the workplace. Governments, social partners, NGOs and other actors have recently undertaken various initiatives aimed at addressing the plight of LGBTs in the workplace. Such initiatives seem to be more prevalent in countries where the social climate towards LGBT tends to be more positive. This situation is worrying, because it means that the lowest activity regarding LGBT rights in the workplace is taking place in countries where it is needed the most.  Read the full article: Working life experiences of LGBT people and initiatives to tackle discrimination,  compiled on the basis of contributions from Eurofound’s network of European correspondents. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-social-policies/working-life-experiences-of-lgbt-people
EUROFOUND_UNK_0155	2016-05-30	UNK	Working pensioners: Need or desire?	Working after retirement is increasingly common, but do pensioners work because they need the extra income or because they find work rewarding in other ways? The meaning of ‘working age’ is changing. It has usually been defined as 15 to 64 years, but more than 5 million people over 65 in the EU were in employment in 2015, a remarkable increase from 3.3 million in 2004. In the same period, the employment rate of people aged 65–69 increased from 8.5% to 11.6%. A key question is whether pensioners have to work because of financial need or want to work for other reasons. A study by Eurofound in 2012 on working after retirement estimated that roughly one-fifth of people aged 65 and over who work do so purely because of financial need. The remaining four-fifths may value the additional income, but they also have non-financial reasons, such as maintaining social contacts, continuing to learn, remaining active and healthy, contributing to society in an area where they have experience, and continuing with work that has become part of their identity. New findings Since that study, data from the EU Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS) ad-hoc module on transition from work into retirement have become available, which include data on whether working pensioners in the EU work for financial or non-financial reasons. Eurofound analysed these data in a recent blog for the European Commission, and the numbers do not seem to tally with Eurofound's earlier estimate: only 37% of working pensioners aged 50–69 say they continue working mainly for non-financial reasons. However, a closer look at the data reveals that Eurofound’s earlier estimate may not be totally out of step with the EU-LFS. The older workers are, the more likely it is that they continue because of reasons other than financial need. Indeed, a conservative estimate shows that almost half (48%) of workers aged 65–69 works mainly for non-financial reasons. Those who work purely for financial need are likely to have exited the labour force by 65 if they are eligible for early retirement or a disability pension. This is certainly true for many of the 50–64-year-olds included in the EU-LFS estimate. Eurofound estimated that one-fifth works purely for financial reasons. For the other four-fifths, the additional income may certainly be a reason, but other reasons play a role as well. For well-educated only? It is sometimes assumed that work after retirement for non-financial reasons is an elite activity, for rich and highly educated people. This is not true, according to the EU-LFS data. People aged 65–69 with higher education more often work for non-financial reasons (55%), but sizeable proportions of older workers with low (36%) and medium (45%) educational levels do so as well. Overall, the estimates do not seem to contradict each other. However, more importantly, EU-LFS data confirm Eurofound’s findings on the heterogeneity of working pensioners: some work for reasons other than income, others really only work to make ends meet, and both groups are substantial in size. Policymakers should bear this heterogeneity in mind. Eurofound also demonstrated that over half (53%) of retirees aged 50 and over who are not in paid work would actually prefer to work, often part time. Do many say so just because they need the money? The proportion is indeed higher for people with difficulties making ends meet (58%), but those who say they can make ends meet easily also often show interest (50%). Is it realistic that these retirees could be employed? Maybe. Interest is largest among the relatively young, better educated, and those with work experience. Policymakers worried about the decline in the proportion of people of working age may be interested in further exploring the potential of facilitating work for this group. Extending working lives Many older workers would like to reduce their working hours. Research by Eurofound into the work preferences of workers aged 50 and over showed that 45% wanted to reduce their working hours, taking into account the need to earn a living. Facilitating working time reductions by compensating partly for the decrease in wages would increase this proportion further. Such ‘partial retirement schemes’ can enable and motivate people to continue working. Later in 2016, Eurofound will publish a report that maps partial retirement schemes in the EU and Norway. It investigates how they have, and have not, contributed to extended working lives. It draws important lessons for policymakers examining such flexible retirement schemes.  	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-pensioners-need-or-desire
EUROFOUND_UNK_0156	2016-05-16	UNK	Strong partnerships between governments and social partners are essential to prevent trafficking and exploitation in Europe	[Listen to Eurofound Research Officer Andrea Fromm introduce the new report on preventing the trafficking of labour here.]   Workers are mobile and can move freely within the EU single market across borders. In order to protect these workers from being exploited and enables businesses to engage in fair competition, the EU has strong legislation in place. But does that mean that trafficking does not exist within the EU’s borders? The new Eurofound report Regulation of labour market intermediaries and the role of social partners in preventing trafficking of labour shows that trafficking for labour exploitation does exist in Europe and that in some case labour market intermediaries are involved. According to Eurostat, 19% of all identified and presumed victims were trafficked for the purpose of labour exploitation. In some cases labour market intermediaries recruit or transfer workers unlawfully, they deceive workers about their future job, and workers end up working under exploitative conditions. The Anti-Trafficking Directive underlines that trafficking is a serious crime and a gross violation of fundamental rights. Germany is the only country which has failed to transpose the Directive. In this context the report finds that monitoring labour market intermediaries, including temporary work agencies, needs to be improved. Tripartite partnerships also need to be strengthened; this is crucial to achieve effective enforcement and prosecution. The regulation of labour market intermediaries takes a variety of forms in the EU. Registration or licensing schemes are common to monitor compliance with minimum standards, yet coverage of labour market intermediaries is inadequate. As a result, sanctioning labour market intermediaries that are engaged in trafficking is challenging at best. Improved cooperation with social partners is also needed. Some good examples exist already: the involvement of social partners in international and European initiatives, awareness-raising campaigns, in establishing complaint mechanisms, developing codes of conduct, and engaging in cross-border cooperation. To date, a tripartite partnership to tackle trafficking has only been created by the Czech Republic. Targeted policy interventions were developed, cross-border cooperation initiated, the number of inspections was increased, training was broadened, and the compilation of a company blacklist agreed. Tackling trafficking for labour exploitation is not only an important way to facilitate free and safe mobility of workers and the effective functioning of EU labour markets; it is also an essential tool to boost fair competition. Above all, the EU has a commitment to protect people’s basic human rights. Better monitoring and a dedicated partnership between governments and social partners is essential; essential for ensuring not only freedom from being trafficked and exploited, but also freedom to live and work in dignity.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/law-and-regulation-labour-market-working-conditions/strong-partnerships-between-governments-and-social-partners-are-essential-to-prevent-trafficking-and
EUROFOUND_UNK_0157	2016-05-06	UNK	What types of SMEs are most likely to create jobs?	Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) provide two-thirds of jobs in the EU, and some have the potential to create more, with the right support and business environment. The SME population is vast – comprising over 20 million businesses – and diverse, and not all contribute equally to employment growth. One-person enterprises, for instance, are less likely to create additional jobs than other types of SME. On the other hand, born globals – start-ups that from inception engage intensively in international trade – are particularly dynamic job creators. Features of job-creating SMEs A bundle of factors determines whether an SME creates jobs, some relating to the company itself, others to the economic and institutional environment in which it operates. The individual internal and external elements are at least partly interrelated and hence can influence each other. The strength of the influence and whether it is a driver or an obstacle depends on the individual company and the framework conditions in which it operates. Internal factors Job-creating SMEs tend to: be young, no more than five years in existence; be innovative in the products they produce, the services they offer or the processes they use; operate internationally; be based in urban areas; be competitive and perform well due to sufficient market demand for their products or services; have an active growth strategy and the necessary company structure and resources to implement it; have good management skills and resources; have sufficient access to finance and apply diversified funding strategies; be attractive to potential employees in spite of competition from other companies; be run by an owner–manager who is motivated to grow the business and willing to take a certain level of risk.  smes.png External factors As well as having the right internal mix of job-creation drivers, SMEs need a supportive external context, including:  a macroeconomic environment that generates sufficient demand; a level of competition from large multinationals and the shadow economy that the SME can handle; business and labour legislation that is not onerous; bearable labour costs and taxation;  a positive image of entrepreneurship, where the possibility of failure is accepted and second chances are granted; effective public administration and public support structures;  access to external finance (not limited to bank credit);  a labour market with workers possessing the necessary skills. The combination of such a wide range of factors that determine the job creation potential of SMEs highlights the need for comprehensive public support packages. At the same time, the diversity of these businesses demands tailor-made measures for the various SME types to suit their characteristics and needs. For further detail on the employment potential of SMEs, read the report Job creation in SMEs: ERM annual report 2015.  	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/labour-market/what-types-of-smes-are-most-likely-to-create-jobs
EUROFOUND_UNK_0158	2016-04-27	UNK	Tackling trafficking for labour exploitation in Europe	 The EU has strong legislation in place that protects workers from being exploited and also enables businesses to engage in fair competition. Workers are mobile and can move freely within the EU single market across borders – without being dependent upon traffickers. Yet, the Eurofound report Regulation of labour market intermediaries and the role of social partners in preventing trafficking of labour shows that trafficking for labour exploitation in Europe does exist. Eurostat’s latest figures show that 19% of all identified and presumed victims were trafficked for the purpose of labour exploitation, sexual exploitation being excluded. Eurofounds report urges stronger implementation of regulation and joint action by social partners to crack down on trafficking for labour exploitation. Labour market intermediaries (LMIs) such as temporary work agencies help to facilitate the mobility of workers through matching workers with companies’ needs. According to the Structural Business Statistics more than 33,000 temporary work agencies operate in Europe aiding job matching and mobility both within states and across borders.  Unlawful In some cases, LMIs use their role to recruit or transfer workers unlawfully. They deceive workers about the nature of the job, the employer, the location or other conditions related to the work, and these workers end up working under exploitative conditions. In 2011 the EU adopted the Anti-Trafficking Directive. The directive emphasises that trafficking is a serious crime and a gross violation of fundamental rights. The EU Strategy towards the Eradication of Trafficking in Human Beings 2012–2016 complements the legal rules with targeted actions - and recruitment by LMIs is indeed one area of concern. It is puzzling that, although trafficking for labour exploitation has been criminalised at EU level, the recent numbers, according to Eurostat, of prosecuted traffickers are stagnant. The Eurofound report provides one possible answer. It finds that monitoring LMIs needs to be strengthened to achieve greater enforcement, sanctioning and prosecution. The report also shows that building tripartite partnerships, including across borders, is necessary to implement coherent activities. One way of preventing LMIs from engaging in trafficking is by monitoring their compliance with national rules and regulations. Regulation Regulating the operation of LMIs takes a variety of forms in the 28 EU Member States and Norway (which is also covered in the study). Registration or licensing schemes are common across Europe to monitor who is operating an LMI and to ensure compliance with minimum standards in running the business. Yet coverage of registered, licensed or certified LMIs is inadequate. This contributes to the challenge of sanctioning illegally operating LMIs that are engaged at the entry point of trafficking. Greater commitment of and cooperation with social partners is also needed. Member States and public authorities in particular can benefit from social partners’ expertise on working and business conditions and their networks to fight trafficking. Involvement of the social partners in international and European initiatives, awareness-raising campaigns, establishing complaint mechanisms, developing codes of conduct, distributing educational material and engaging in cross-border cooperation with other trade unions or employer organisations are underway. Yet a tripartite partnership to tackle trafficking has been created in only one country of the EU – the Czech Republic. Targeted policy interventions were developed, cross-border cooperation initiated, a tripartite working group established. In addition the number of inspections was increased, training was broadened to relevant groups, a cooperation agreement by the social partners signed and the compilation of a company blacklist agreed. Tackling trafficking for labour exploitation is not only an important way to facilitate free and safe mobility of workers and the effective functioning of EU labour markets. It is also an essential tool to boost fair competition. Above all, however, it is the commitment of the EU as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights to protect people’s basic human rights against violations in order to create an area of freedom, security and justice. A better and dedicated partnership between governments and social partners is needed to ensure not only freedom from being trafficked and exploited but also freedom to live and work in dignity.                    	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-labour-market-industrial-relations-law-and-regulation/tackling-trafficking-for-labour-exploitation-in-europe
EUROFOUND_UNK_0159	2016-04-26	UNK	Start-up support schemes need to be evaluated on their outcomes for young people	** Listen to Eurofound Research Officer Sara Riso introduce the Start-up support for young people publication here.** The new Eurofound report ‘Start-up support for young people: From implementation to evaluation’ maps the variety of publicly supported interventions on youth entrepreneurship and reviews a range of policy evaluations assessing their impact and effectiveness. What becomes apparent from the report is that there is no shortage of start-up support measures for young people in the EU. Many of these measures, including general activation measures for the unemployed, are currently part of the Youth Guarantee. The type of start-up support ranges from access to finance to so-called ‘soft’ support, which can include advice, coaching and skill development. Although the Youth Guarantee has helped to place the existing measures under an overall youth employment strategy, more effort should be made to achieve a coordinated approach and greater complementarity across different types of interventions. The bulk of the measures identified are stand-alone and small-scale, with limited financial resources. The European Social Fund and the Youth Guarantee are important to ensure that start-up measures for young people are linked more effectively with a national youth employment framework of integrated measures rather than left in a special category of their own. Despite the ever increasing policy interest in youth entrepreneurship, there seems to be very little appetite for comprehensive evaluations. There is often an over-reliance on lighter forms of evaluations based on simple take-up data or self-reported data of participants’ opinions and views. These disproportionately report more positive results than robust impact evaluations. The very few in-depth evaluations of start-up support measures for young people that have taken place so far point to limited or no impact. There is a pressing need to design more evidence-based youth entrepreneurship policies. Sound and comprehensive impact evaluations can feed back into start-up programmes and make them more effective. This means that policy evaluation is not the end of the line, but rather an integrated and important part of youth emtrepreneurship policy delivery. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/business-labour-market-social-policies/start-up-support-schemes-need-to-be-evaluated-on-their-outcomes-for-young-people
EUROFOUND_UNK_0160	2016-04-20	UNK	Joint declaration on social dialogue	One year after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker relaunched European social dialogue at a high-level conference in Brussels, find out what progress has been made and how Eurofound has contributed to the work.  The European Commission under President Jean-Claude Juncker is committed to relaunching social dialogue. A first step in this direction was taken with the organisation of a high-level conference in Brussels on 5 March 2015. The aim of the conference was to discuss concrete ways to strengthen social dialogue with EU cross-industry social partners and their national affiliates. What is the situation one year later? Has Mr Juncker become the President of social dialogue? Achievements to date From 1985 onwards, at the initiative of the then European Communities President Jacques Delors, social dialogue took on a more autonomous and bipartite form in the preparatory phase of the Single Market. This fundamental change dates from 31 January 1985, when EU-level social partners met at the Château of Val Duchesse in Brussels. The greatest achievement of the Val Duchesse process was the outcome of the negotiations at Maastricht, which produced the 1992 Treaty on the European Union. The Maastricht Treaty established the EU-level social partners as co-legislators, a role which was formerly reserved for Community institutions. Today, 24 years later, a total of 23 agreements have been concluded on the basis of Article 155 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Some were transposed via directives (for example, on parental leave, part-time work, and fixed-term contracts) and others by so-called autonomous agreements (for example, on telework, work-related stress, harassment and violence at work, and inclusive labour markets). Despite such achievements, many academic experts and EU actors argue that social dialogue could be made more efficient, effective and meaningful. Next steps In order to breathe new life into EU social dialogue to deal with past and future challenges, the commitment and cooperation of all actors on the company, sectoral, national and European level would be a precondition. As a concrete outcome of the high-level conference of last year, two thematic groups were created with the participation of the social partners (at EU and national level and at cross-industry and sectoral level), the social affairs attachés from the past, present and future presidencies (Latvia, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Slovakia and Malta), the Council Secretariat, the Commission and Eurofound. Thematic group 1 focused on social dialogue, economic governance and capacity building. It assessed the involvement and positions of the national and European social partner organisations in the European semester. Thematic Group 2 focused on social dialogue, policymaking and law-making, in particular. Joint declaration After six months of deliberations and discussions, the EU social partners adopted a joint declaration in Brussels on 26–27 January 2016 announcing a fresh start for a strong social dialogue at European level. To promote greater effectiveness and a better functioning social dialogue the declaration stresses the importance of: involving of social partners in EU policymaking; the functioning and effectiveness of social dialogue and the capacity-building of social partners at national level; involving social partners in the European economic governance and European Semester and in assessing, designing, agreeing and implementing relevant reforms and policies; clarifying the relation between social partners' agreements and the European Commission’s better regulation agenda. Conclusions Building on previous studies that were presented by Eurofound at the thematic working groups, the declaration more specifically draws the following conclusions: the involvement of social partners at EU level has significantly improved in recent years, but there is room for further improvement at national level; the involvement of national social partners in the preparation of the National Reform Programmes and in the design and implementation of relevant policy reforms could be reinforced while respecting national practices; annexing the views of social partners to the National Reform Programmes was considered to be a good practice; the concept of representativeness at both national and European levels and its implications for policymaking and law- making at EU level should be examined; in particular, representativeness checks need to ensure that EU social dialogue relies on recognised social partners at national level in all Member States. The official European motto ‘United in diversity’ could be a goal for EU social dialogue to strive for the best possible outcomes for all EU citizens after the crisis: unity without uniformity and diversity without fragmentation.  	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/industrial-relations-business/joint-declaration-on-social-dialogue
EUROFOUND_UNK_0161	2016-04-06	UNK	Ireland increases minimum wage to above 2007 level for the first time	The following article, originally written by Brian Sheehan from IRN Publishing for Eurofound's European Observatory of Working Life (EurWork), gives an overview of the reasons behind the decision to raise Ireland's National Minimum Wage (NMW) to above the 2007 level for the first time. The new rate was implemented on 1 January 2016, and followed on from a recommendation in the Low Pay Commission’s first annual report to increase the NMW by 50 cents per hour to a new hourly rate of €9.15. To read the original article please go http://bit.ly/IEWageRise. In January 2016 the then Minister for Business and Employment, Ged Nash, and the Minister for Skills, Research and Innovation, Damien English, welcomed the introduction of the new NMW rate, estimating that some 124,000 workers will benefit from the increase. Mr Nash said the increase to the NMW was the second one by the Fine Gael-Labour coalition Government during their term of office from 2011, because one of its first acts was to reverse a cut of €1 per hour to the minimum wage introduced by the previous government, adding that the increase will benefit a minimum wage worker by €60 a week, or more than €3,000 a year (when factoring in the reversal of the previous government's cut in the NMW). Mr Nash explained that employers’ Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) thresholds were also adjusted from 1 January, ‘to ensure that an increased PRSI burden does not fall on minimum wage employers’. He said he was ‘acutely aware that the rising economic tide may not yet have reached every business’. The decision to pay the increase follows the first report of the Low Pay Commission, an independent body tasked with considering the appropriate rate of the NMW. The Commission, which is made up of representatives from industry, workers and independent academic members, recommended the increase in July 2015. In its report, the Commission set out a range of data it had considered in recommending the 50 cent increase. However, three members of the Commission did not agree with the findings of the other members. Patricia King, the General Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU); Gerry Light, Assistant General Secretary of the Mandate trade union; and Edel McGinley Director of the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland (MRCI) all called for the NMW to be increased to €10 an hour. The Commission consulted with many interested parties before drawing up its report. In making its recommendation, the Commission set out a range of issues to consider, including: evidence suggesting moderate increases will not lead to significant loss of jobs; the Irish economy is recovering while still facing risks; employment is increasing; unemployment is high, but declining; improved competitiveness (partly due to exchange rate movements); while inflation has been low, the NMW has also largely remained unchanged for eight years. Mr Nash then asked the Commission to look at ‘sub-minima’ rates for younger workers and to consider why so many women are on the minimum wage. He said: ‘Given the preponderance of women in low paid jobs, I have asked the Low Pay Commission to help us come to a better understanding of why this is so, and what might be the underlying reasons for it.’ Sub-minima rates are paid to those under the age of 18; those still on their first or second year of work; and those undertaking training. These rates range from 70% to 90% of the NMW, but rise pro rata with the NMW increase from 1 January. The new minimum wage for workers aged under 18 is €6.41 per hour; those who are 18 or over and/or in their first year of work get €7.32 per hour; those who are over 18 and/or in their second year of work get €8.24 per hour. Trainee rates rise by the same percentage. The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (DJEI) opened a consultation with stakeholders on a University of Limerick report that found that while so-called ‘zero-hours’ contracts are not used as extensively as had been feared, a new type of precarious work was becoming more common. Known as ‘if and when’ contracts, employers offer work if and when they have it available, and workers can choose to accept or refuse it. Due to the result of the recent Irish General Election, the outcome of the consultation, which closed in January, will now be a matter for the next government. The decision by the UK Government to introduce a statutory living wage put this issue centre stage in the lead up to the election. The ICTU had already asked candidates and political parties in advance of the election, to pledge themselves to the introduction of a living wage of €11.50 an hour. The concept of the living wage is based on the estimated minimum amount an individual needs for his/her basic requirements. In the UK, Chancellor George Osborne announced in his summer budget of 2015 that the British Government was making its National Living Wage compulsory for workers over 25 years of age. The level of the wage is calculated by the government and is higher than the NMW. In Ireland, the level of the living wage has been estimated by groups such as trade unions to be €11.50 per hour, but its implementation is entirely voluntary. A small number of non-union firms in Ireland, such as the supermarket chains Aldi and Lidl and the household goods firm IKEA, have announced the introduction of the living wage – all three companies have a very visible presence in Ireland. The NMW remains the statutory legal minimum in Ireland	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/ireland-increases-minimum-wage-to-above-2007-level-for-the-first-time
EUROFOUND_UNK_0162	2016-03-29	UNK	Eurofound marks International Women’s Day / Eurofound News, March 2016	For more than a century, the world has marked International Women’s Day. This year, on Tuesday 8 March, the theme for the worldwide campaign was gender parity. Eurofound’s web page dedicated to the day highlights the disparity that still prevails across Europe, as shown by the Agency’s research findings. First findings from the most recent European Working Conditions Survey, of 2015, indicate persistent gender segregation in the European labour market. Some 67% of all employees have a male supervisor – rising to 85% of male employees. And the lower labour market participation of women comes with a price: in a forthcoming report, Eurofound estimates the cost of the gender employment gap in 2013 at €370 billion – equal to 2.8% of the EU’s GDP. And at home, the unequal sharing of household and care responsibilities is the big issue: women, on average, perform 22 hours per week of this unpaid work, in contrast to men’s average of 9 hours.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0163	2016-04-19	UNK	Eurofound and the Netherlands EU Presidency 2016	The Netherlands took over the Presidency of the European Council from Luxembourg on 1 January 2016. The Dutch Presidency will be focusing on four priority areas:  Migration and international security Europe as an innovator and job creator Sound finances and a robust eurozone Forward-looking climate and energy policy This work is being done within the framework of priorities agreed with the Council of the European Union by the three Presidencies for the period between January 2016 and June 2017 - the Netherlands, Slovakia and Malta. The 18-month programme of the Presidencies trio has the priorities growth, jobs, freedom, security, justice, energy union and a stronger EU in the world. For the next six months, the Dutch Presidency aims to make significant progress on boosting entrepreneurship and job creation. This includes promoting a climate in which SMEs thrive to 'help open up the potential for the Union to generate further growth and create jobs'. The trio programme also states: 'Unemployment is a major concern in most Member States. Proposals which help tackle unemployment and which open up opportunities for European citizens will be a key priority. Particular attention will be paid to initiatives in the area of youth, long-term and structural unemployment, as well as full access to the labour market.' It continues: 'The three Presidencies are determined to work together on the forthcoming Labour Mobility Package removing the remaining obstacles to EU mobility with the aim of smoothing the effect of future economic shocks, supporting fair competition and fair labour standards and in so doing contribute to the shared objective of decent work.' On issues relating to social and work-related policies, Eurofound is cooperating with the Dutch Presidency. Relevant priorities include: Job creation – through the daily updating of its restructuring events database, the forthcoming report on Job creation in SMEs (ERM) and New forms of employment research.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0165	2016-03-29	UNK	Emigration rises in Portugal as unemployment falls / Eurofound News, March 2016	Portugal has the highest emigration rate as a proportion of its population in the EU, a rate that is currently at its highest for more than 40 years. With a marked increase in the relocation of the skilled Portuguese workforce – most notably to the UK, France and Germany – Eurofound looks at how official unemployment figures are distorted by an increase in emigration and the exclusion of those on vocational training, employment programmes and ‘discouraged workers’. These figures have been the subject of debate for some time, with the government and trade unions – among others – having differing views of how they are made up, the latter citing employment policies that encourage emigration as a way of adjusting economic stability.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0166	2016-03-29	UNK	Constancy versus change: Working time in the EU / Eurofound News, March 2016	Despite the far-reaching impact the economic crisis has had on the European labour market since 2008, working time has remained quite stable in most countries for well over a decade. This is one of the findings of Eurofound’s new report, Working time in the 21st century: Work duration and its regulation in the EU. In direct counterpoint to the stability of working time, the report stresses, a major swing towards more working time flexibility may be on the way – triggered by sociodemographic change, increased female participation in the labour force, and the accelerated introduction of new technologies into the workplace. Based on data collected by Eurofound from all EU Member States and Norway, the report describes the current regulations governing working time and assesses the development of working time for full-time workers over a long-term perspective (from 1999 to 2014). Ultimately, it underscores the tension existing between the pressure for decreased working hours to promote a better work–life balance and fewer health problems for workers, and the need for working time flexibility to meet the demands of a modern world economy.

From September to November 2016, more than 35,000 people will be interviewed face-to-face in the 28 EU Member States and in five candidate countries. The EQLS looks at a range of topics, including living standards, housing, work–life balance, health, trust in people and institutions, social tensions, and perceived social exclusion. As in previous waves, the survey will also investigate trends in people’s subjective well-being – in terms of how satisfied they are with aspects of their life. This round of the survey will have an increased focus on quality of public services, with an extended section covering healthcare (primary care and hospitals), long-term care, childcare and schools. First results will be published in autumn 2017; more detailed analyses will follow in 2018.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0172	2016-03-08	UNK	International Women's Day 2016 – The campaign for equality continues	Eurofound salutes International Women’s Day on 8 March, the theme of which is Pledge for Parity, highlighting persistent inequalities between the sexes in areas including politics, employment, education and health. In Europe, equality between women and men at work is rising on some fronts, according to 2015 findings from Eurofound’s European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS), but the gender gap continues in many areas. For instance, one-third of employees now have a woman supervisor, a rise from one-quarter in 2000, but closer analysis shows that while half of women are supervised by a woman, this is the case for only 15% of men. Gender segregation in occupations is prevalent: four out of five jobs are dominated by one sex or the other. The map below shows the percentages of male workers per country who when asked 'Are workers with the same job title as you mostly men or women? ' answered 'Equal numbers of men and women'. The countries with the highest scores, and so the lowest occupational segregation, are Cyprus, Slovenia and Sweden; the ones with the most segregation are Estonia, Finland and Latvia. Unequal sharing of household and care work is the big issue outside of work. Women on average do 22 weekly hours of unpaid work in contrast to an average of 9 hours for men. Source: First findings: Sixth European Working Conditions Survey There is also a big gap in employment between the sexes. In 2014, the employment rate for men of working age (15–64 years) was 70.1%; for women it was 59.6%. The gap exists in all Member States, varying between 1.5 percentage points in Finland to 25.6 percentage points in Malta. This employment gap comes with a price: in a forthcoming report, Eurofound estimates the cost of the gender employment gap in 2013 to amount to €370 billion, which is equal to 2.8% of EU GDP.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0173	2016-03-16	UNK	Workplace innovation in the public sector	Innovative organisational practices in the workplace, which aim to make best use of human capital, are traditionally associated with the private sector. The nature of the public sector activities makes it more difficult to identify these types of internal innovation in publicly funded organisations. It is widely thought that public sector organisations are neither dynamic nor creative and are typified by a high degree of inertia. Yet the necessity of innovation ought not to be dismissed. The public sector represents a quarter of total EU employment, and it is of critical importance as a provider and regulator of services. Improving how it performs has a knock-on effect not only for private sector growth but also for citizens’ satisfaction. Ultimately, this improves governance itself. So how can innovative organisation practices help in dealing with the challenges faced by the public sector? Eurofound, as part of a project on workplace innovation in European companies, carried out case studies of both private and public sector organisations. The findings show a number of interesting practices and processes used. Employee participation The case studies from the public sector, some of which are described below, demonstrate the central role of employee participation in the implementation of workplace innovation and its impacts on organisation and employees. They indicate that innovative practices have resulted in enhanced organisational performance and quality of working life. It is widely thought that changes in the public sector are initiated as a response to government policies. This is often true, but workplace innovation may also be introduced as a result of well-designed initiatives driven by external pressures (such as the need for a more competitive public service) or internal pressures (such as a need to update the skills map to better serve the public). Case study findings The state-owned Lithuanian energy company Lietuvos Energijos Gamyba (140 KB PDF) encourages employee participation by providing a structured framework for all employees to propose improvements. This has required a change in managerial approach and has spread a sense of ownership horizontally and vertically in the company. The Polish public transport company Jarosław City Transport (191 KB PDF), when faced with serious financial stability challenges, as well as implementing operational changes, set up ways for employees’ voices to be heard, which enabled a contributory dialogue and strengthened partnerships. Consultation, development of mutual trust, and common involvement ensured an effective combination of top-down and bottom-up initiatives. The Lithuanian Post, AB Lietuvos Pastas (136 KB PDF) experienced a major organisation transformation in 2010 to improve efficiency and quality of service. Through a programme of ‘Loyalty day’ monthly visits, both top and middle management of the central administration visit any part of the company and work with colleagues in other units. Under budgetary pressure to ‘earn their money’, the Danish Vej and Park Bornholm (142 KB PDF) construction services in roads, parks and forests had to find innovative solutions to deal with a merger and privatisation. Their intervention had the characteristics of workplace partnership with a new set of organisational values set from the bottom up. Self-managing teams are essential for the operation of the company. The world of education has provided new structures that provide better outcomes for students. The South West University of Bulgaria (214 KB PDF) also operates small self-managing teams responsible for employee scheduling. Weekly round-tables encourage participation in collectively finding solutions, creating a more effective environment in which to respond to the competitive demands of education provision. In Poland, an initiative by the Pomeranian Library (185 KB PDF) improved employee–management dialogue and communication through increased participation. The initiative is a response to the new frameworks for open access to knowledge for users, with the library mirroring the user experience through its own work practices. Through new dialogue, government advisory bodies have also developed employee-led improvement. Breaking away from a traditional hierarchy is considered important in achieving a more flexible work organisation. Under considerable pressure, the top-heavy management of the British Geological Survey (89 KB PDF) now operates a flexible matrix that promotes innovative and entrepreneurial ways of working. And in Germany, Niersverband (138 KB PDF), a publicly owned water-management company innovated through training, learning, reflection partnerships and workplace partnerships. New occupational profiles were developed to meet external demands. Based on dialogue concerning workplace experiences and competences, employees acquired new qualifications that allowed the company to be more competitive. In the Funen Village Museum in Odense, Denmark, (143 KB PDF) innovation came about at the request of staff looking for more flexibility in how they work. Formerly most of their work was maintenance tasks, but now they can now engage more with visitors. Control of schedules has moved to the team rather than being the responsibility of a single manager. As a result, museum employees are now hosts as well as craftspeople. They no longer feel ‘forgotten’ and are happier in their work. Timely innovation and less hierarchy Evidence from the case studies is that workplace innovation can and does take place in the public sector. Often old hierarchical systems were reformulated in a participative manner where dialogue became central. Public-owned services also made an effort to engage with end-users in an integrative way. Certainly, where essential services were concerned – water, transport and power – these enterprises were likely to have ceased trading were it not for timely innovation. Staff involvement was of critical importance across all of the case studies, as were flatter, less hierarchical management structures. Publicly owned companies of any size may benefit from such changes. Can social dialogue facilitate the process?  The research identified common features and levels of involvement of the social partners in finding and introducing solutions for both external and internal difficulties. Changes in these organisations all demonstrated the importance of dialogue and employee involvement. More often than not, the word ‘trust’ was shared by many of the participants in these case studies.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0174	2016-03-29	UNK	Job creation balances job loss in restructurings	As labour markets recover across the EU, the number of jobs created in restructurings has converged with the number of jobs lost. Job losses have increased in retail and financial services, while the biggest gains have taken place in private and professional services. Employment has been rising in the European Union since late 2013, reflected in falling job loss and increasing job creation arising from company restructurings. Since mid-2014, the total number of new jobs announced by employers has converged with the number of job losses announced, as shown by data from Eurofound’s European Restructuring Monitor (ERM), which records the employment effects of large-scale company restructurings announced in European media. Manufacturing wanes further Manufacturing is the sector responsible for the largest share of announced job loss (35% – see Figure 1) and job creation (30% – see Figure 2) in 2013–2015, as was the case in the crisis period of 2008–2012. This to some extent is an effect of an overrepresentation of manufacturing in the ERM database due to the predominance of large companies in the sector, whose restructurings consequently tend to be large scale. Nevertheless, the proportion of overall job loss and particularly job gain represented by the sector has been decreasing for many years, reflecting its falling contribution to overall employment. erm1.png   The retail and financial services sectors accounted for an increased proportion of announced job losses in 2013–2015. The falling demand for labour in these sectors is due in large part to technological advances such as online banking, self-service checkouts and online shopping. Announced job losses fell sharply in public administration, however, reflecting an easing of public sector budget cuts (or ‘austerity’) in many countries and a return to a more typical level after an exceptional rise in 2008–2012. Gains in professional services New jobs announced rose sharply in the sector labelled ‘other private services’ – a broad grouping including legal services, engineering, consultancy, media, hotels and restaurants, as well as other professional and administrative services. This sector now represents over one in four new jobs recorded in the ERM database. erm2.png Promise of high-tech Data from the EU Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS) on employment trends at sector level are in line with the ERM and provide more detail on subsectors. In relation to manufacturing, they show that job losses have been most severe in basic, low-technology subsectors such as basic metals; textiles, clothing and leather; and wood, paper and printing. The subsectors that have largely recovered employment lost at the outset of the crisis are predominantly high technology, involved in the manufacturing of cars, machinery and pharmaceuticals, for example; employment in these sectors has benefited from strong export markets. The EU-LFS data also show that most service sectors added employment in the period, although with some notable exceptions, including public administration and defence – the sector covering core government functions – and the telecommunications sector, which shed over a fifth of pre-crisis employment. Growth was fastest in IT and information services; other professional, scientific and technical activities; and residential care and social work activities.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0175	2016-03-02	UNK	Montserrat Mir, Confederal Secretary of the ETUC, visits Eurofound	Ms Montserrat Mir, recently elected Confederal Secretary of the European Trade Union Congress (ETUC) visited Eurofound today. Ms Mir met with Eurofound’s Director Juan Menéndez-Valdés and senior staff, gaining insights into the cost of the gender employment gap, the gender dimension of working conditions, and access to social protection.  Ms Mir was elected in early October 2015, and is the first Spanish person to hold the position of Confederal Secretary. Her mandate spans the coming four years, and she has set the objectives of increasing the visibility of ETUC in European affairs, strengthening the voice of workers in Europe, and helping trade unions at national level to interact and put forward their concerns to the EU level decisions makers in Brussels. Ms Mir is aware that the economic downturn has eroded the rights of workers in many ways, but also acknowledges that the situation has improved in many areas over the past year. ETUC is formally represented in Eurofound’s Governing Board by Mr Peter Sheerer, Deputy General Secretary of ETUC, and Aline Hoffmann of the European Trade Union Institute (ETUI).

EUROFOUND_UNK_0176	2016-03-01	UNK	News Release: New challenges could disrupt working time stability in Europe	 working_time_cover.png Working time has remained relatively stable in the 21st century but socio-demographic challenges and the ubiquitous nature of new technologies may see significant changes in working time in the near future, according to a new report from Eurofound, the EU Agency based in Dublin. Working time developments in the 21st century reveals, for the first time, the development of working time for full-time workers from a long-term perspective, examining the periods before and after the economic crisis. The report shows that, although there has been a general convergence in working time between the EU15 and newer Member States, working times continue to vary widely in Europe, with a number of different regimes in place to set working times. A clear split can be seen in this regard, with collective bargaining playing an important role in the older Member States, whereas in central and eastern Member States working time standards are more likely to be established through legislation. The way working time is set has an impact on average working hours and the phenomenon of ‘working time drift’ - the difference between agreed hours and the usual working time. Negotiated regimes, where collective bargaining plays a stronger role, generally results in shorter working time and more compliance with the agreed working hours. Throughout Europe men continue to work more paid hours than women. This gap is most pronounced in newer Member States, although it has been narrowing in recent years. Despite the profound impact of the financial crisis on the European labour market the agreed working time has remained stable between 1999 and 2014, with few dramatic changes in the average agreed working time in most Member States. One notable exception was in the area of public administration, where changes were introduced that resulted in increased working hours in Greece, Portugal and Spain. These measures were adopted in reaction to the developing economic crises in these countries.  Socio-demographic challenges, increased female participation in the labour force, and the continued adoption of new technologies in the workplace are some of the factors that have triggered discussions about working time flexibility. Some social partners have argued that these developments require a reduction in working hours to improve work-life balance and prevent health issues. However, new technologies and a fast changing economic environment have made working life more pervasive, with employers increasingly emphasising the need for working-time flexibility. Reconciling these two perspectives on working time poses an important challenge for the future.   Download the report Working time developments in the 21st century: Work duration and its regulation in the EU http://bit.ly/WTDevelopments Read the blog piece of Jorge Cabrita, Eurofound Research Officer, on the important role of collective bargaining in establishing working time standards in Europe: http://bit.ly/WorkTimeBlog     For further information, contact:    Måns Mårtensson, Media Manager, on email: mma@eurofound.europa.eu, telephone: +353-1-204 3124, or mobile: +353-876-593 507  James Higgins, Promotions Officer, on email: jhi@eurofound.europa.eu, and telephone: +353-1-204 3157  Jorge Cabrita, Research Officer, on email: jca@eurofound.europa.eu, and telephone: +353-1-204 3115 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-labour-market-industrial-relations/news-release-new-challenges-could-disrupt-working-time-stability-in-europe
EUROFOUND_UNK_0177	2016-02-22	UNK	Statutory minimum wage varies greatly across EU / Eurofound News, February 2016	The level at which the statutory minimum wage is set greatly varies between the Member States of the EU, as new research by Eurofound highlights. Bulgaria and Romania have the lowest minimum wage in the EU, while Luxembourg has the highest minimum wage – about nine times that of Bulgaria. Changes to the minimum wage also vary greatly between countries: between January 2015 and January 2016, the highest increases in the minimum wage (by more than 10%) were in Bulgaria, Estonia and Lithuania. In Belgium and Greece, by contrast, the minimum wage has remained unchanged since 2012. The in-depth article Statutory minimum wages in the EU 2016, published by the Agency’s EurWORK observatory, also draws attention to the considerable differences in the way in which countries establish minimum wage levels. In 10 Member States, the government determines the minimum wage following a (non-binding) recommendation of a third party – often the social partners or a tripartite body. In nine countries, the wage is set unilaterally by the government. And a fixed rule for the determination of the minimum wage is used in five countries. In several countries, these ways of determination are combined.

At Eurofound’s fourth National Cluster Seminar in Warsaw on 3 March, ‘Quality jobs: from low wage to an innovation economy’, participants will seek to answer this question. Organised in collaboration with the Polish employers’ organisation Lewiatan and hosted by the Ministry of Family, Labour and Social Policy, the event will bring together public authorities, social partner representatives, and NGOs from the Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia to discuss a number of issues: the challenges these countries face in striving to grow competitiveness; the transformation from low-wage jobs to innovation economies; and what shape innovation may take in the future. An integral part of Eurofound’s national-level communications plan, the Cluster Seminars facilitate debate and networking between the Agency and key stakeholders on topics of relevance to all parties. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/moving-from-a-low-wage-to-an-innovation-economy-eurofound-news-february-2016
EUROFOUND_UNK_0179	2016-02-22	UNK	European Semester and the social partners / Eurofound News, February 2016	In recent years, social partners have become more closely involved in the European Semester process, the EU’s annual cycle of economic policy guidance and surveillance. However, both they and the EU institutions agree that their even closer involvement is desirable – in the European and national strands of the Semester. Creating a forum for discussion, Eurofound invited key players (EU-level social partners, both sectoral and cross-sectoral) to a working lunch in Brussels on 16 February. Eurofound’s new report, Role of the social partners in the European Semester, formed the point of departure for discussions. The report looks at EU- and national-level involvement between 2011 and 2014. It assesses the role of the national social partners during key junctures of the European Semester – the National Reform Programmes and adoption of the country-specific recommendations – with a special focus on employment and social policy aspects. For more, visit http://bit.ly/PulseSocial.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/european-semester-and-the-social-partners-eurofound-news-february-2016

Deeply affected by the economic crisis, with no real sign of recovery, the sector faces a number of challenges, not least the rise of the internet as a source of information and advertising as well as globalised competition, leading to job losses and overcapacity. The study is the first in a new wave, carried out at the request of the European Commission, which aims to identify the representative social partner organisations to be consulted under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. In addition to its analysis of the employment and economic trends of the sector, this latest study finds that UNI Europa Graphical and Intergraf are the most important European-level social partner organisations, based on their membership.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0182	2016-02-22	UNK	Mapping rise of temporary employment in Europe / Eurofound News, February 2016	Demands for greater flexibility in labour markets, and reforms in employment protection legislation related to these demands, have led a growth in temporary employment in most European countries since the 1980s. Eurofound’s new report Recent developments in temporary employment: Employment growth, wages and transitions takes a broad perspective on this phenomenon, examining temporary employment in the EU27 in the period 2001–2012. The report maps the recent evolution of temporary employment, before and after the economic crisis, calculates the wage gap between temporary and permanent employees and analyses the wage gap within companies. It finds evidence of segmentation in a number of European labour markets, whereby temporary employees have poor pay and labour market prospects, while permanent employees enjoy high levels of job security and opportunities for career progression.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0183	2016-02-08	UNK	Young, innovative and internationally-active SMEs driving job-growth in Europe	Small and medium-sized enterprises that are largely young, innovative, internationally-active and run by skilled managers are driving significant job growth across the European Union. But research from Eurofound highlights that while SMEs were responsible for a massive 71% of employment growth in the non-financial business economy in 2014, there is urgent need for further tailored support if a more rigorous recovery is to be realised. These are some of the findings of the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) annual report for 2015, which looks specifically at the issue of job creation in SMEs. The report identifies which types of SMEs are dynamic job creators and determines their main drivers and barriers for job creation. SMEs, defined by the European Commission as companies with fewer than 250 employees and an annual turnover of up to €50 million, are hugely significant to Europe’s economy, accounting for 67% of total employment across the EU28. Employment in Europe has been growing exponentially in areas in which SMEs are dominant, notably in professional and administrative services. The diverse nature of SMEs has previously made it difficult to pinpoint their specific potential for growth and job creation. However, the report has used the research available to identify the transversal profile of SMEs that have a strong potential to create jobs. Youthful ambition was identified as a generally positive factor, with ambition and strategic risk-taking paying dividends both in terms of performance and growth. There is also an important place for experience, with knowledgeable and qualified managers driving internal and external performance. The report also sets the performance of SMEs in the broader business environment. There must be sufficient access to finance and suitable public support for the growth of the business itself. Businesses also tend to succeed in environments that entrepreneurship is regarded positively and a favourable legislative and taxation regime is in place. In terms of the labour market, there should be a sufficient labour supply, a coherent match between skills and business requirements, and more manageable labour costs. The data in the European Restructuring Monitor helps policymakers, researchers and businesses to understand the strong performance of SMEs over the past three years. It is also important in order to put policy measures in place that will help copper-fasten Europe’s economic recovery and close the gap with other developed countries outside Europe where a more robust post-crisis recovery is already in place.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0184	2016-02-08	UNK	Many European families still at risk of poverty, despite economic growth	Despite a return to economic growth, lone-parent families and large families with three or more dependent children face significant difficulties throughout Europe. In some countries more than eight out of ten lone-parent families are at risk of poverty or social exclusion. There are also large disparities between Member States, with families in some countries significantly more likely to have difficulty in making ends meet than others. This is according to the new report ‘Families in the economic crisis: Changes in policy measures in the EU’ which looks at the situation of families in Europe after the economic crisis, with an in-depth policy analysis of 10 Member States. The report highlights that there are 4.8 million more EU citizens living in poverty than in 2008, with families facing particular difficulties. Lone parents and large families are more likely to be at risk of poverty or social exclusion, or to have difficulties in making ends meet. However, there is a large divergence between Member States, due in part to different national level family policies as well as overall economic performance. The report found large disparities between the Nordic countries and newer EU Member States. For example, in 2012 a large Bulgarian family was more than 13 times more likely to have difficulty making ends meet than a large Finnish family. The report highlights increasing evidence of a shift towards more means-tested support in relation to family benefits in Europe, and a reduction in universal support. This may create new groups of disadvantaged families who, before the crisis, had access to universal support measures. A combination of sufficient universal support for families, as well as means-tested support, is required in order to effectively assist struggling families. The report also highlights that changes to family policies since 2010 are largely the result of a range of conflicting issues; difficulty in equating the evolution of family needs with greater demands for cuts in public spending; and the need for equitable distribution of limited resources. This means family policies often lack a coherent and integrated policy framework, and are increasingly developed in reaction to specific emergencies and political inputs, rather than through coordinated and structural reforms. The effectiveness of targeted measures aimed towards families is also often constrained by a narrow definition of what constitutes a family or a lone-parent family, and does not take into account changes in the make-up of families, such as ’blended’ families after divorce and re-marriage. The combination of a narrow definition of what constitutes a family and a shift towards more means-tested support has meant that families have lost out on vital support in some Member States. Finally, the report emphasises that having a job is not the only answer for families at risk of poverty. Measures such as providing additional childcare support, or providing subsidised public transport can have a large positive impact and help to combat social exclusion. In particular, providing adequate, high-quality childcare that is not cost-prohibitive is a major factor in combating poverty and social exclusion and improving the quality of life for families throughout Europe.

It proved to be a busy year, with the overall assessment of the year’s achievements being definitely positive. At a time when discussions about the future of the EU Agencies continue at the highest level, Eurofound was able to facilitate an effective dialogue with the EU institutions. Under its leadership, the network adopted a medium-term strategy. The ‘Dublin Agenda’ outlines where the network sees possibilities for ensuring that the Agencies function even more effectively. Priority is given to action in four areas: shared services and capabilities, mutual value creation with EU institutions, better outward communication and improved internal governance. In March, Eurofound will hand over the role of coordination to the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM). The Network of Agencies consists of the 44 EU agencies currently in operation, all of which play a key role in implementing EU policies in a wide range of policy areas. A video detailing the work of the Agencies is currently in production.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0186	2016-02-05	UNK	New Article: Statutory minimum wages in the EU 2016	Eurofound has published a new article on the statutory minimum wage levels in Europe. This article provides an overview of the minimum wage rates as of 1 January 2016, explains how they were set, and presents relevant discussions on minimum wages at national level. The article shows that the level of minimum wage greatly varies among EU countries. Bulgaria and Romania have the lowest minimum wage in the EU, while Luxembourg has the highest minimum wage – about nine times the Bulgarian rate. Changes to the minimum wage also vary significantly between countries; between January 2015 and January 2016 the highest increases of the minimum wage (by more than 10%) took place in Bulgaria, Estonia and Lithuania, whereas in Belgium and Greece the minimum wage has remained unchanged since 2012.

Using in-depth analyses of developments in 10 EU Member States, it finds that, in some countries, benefits have been reduced, affecting disadvantaged families disproportionately. Meanwhile, other countries have introduced measures to help those families worst affected by the economic crisis.

The activities proposed in the annual programme for 2016 are designed to contribute to achieving Eurofound’s strategic objective of providing high-quality, timely and policy-relevant knowledge as input to better informed policies, in four priority areas: Increasing labour market participation and combating unemployment by creating jobs, improving labour market functioning and promoting integration Improving working conditions and making work sustainable throughout the life course Developing industrial relations to ensure equitable and productive solutions in a changing policy context Improving standards of living and promoting social cohesion in the face of economic disparities and social inequalities Many activities launched in 2015 were designed to be continued or complemented by follow-up projects during 2016. In addition, a number of new projects will commence. The 2016 work programme also takes into account the sequence and work processes of Eurofound’s flagship activities, its three pan-European surveys and the observatories, which require the allocation of resources in each annual programme. A landmark event under the 2016 workplan will be the launch of the overview report of the Sixth European Working Conditions Survey, currently planned for November. The survey explores quality of work issues and provides information on a number of areas, including: exposure to physical and psychosocial risks, working time duration and organisation, employment status and contract work organisation, and work life. The survey is based on 43,000 workers across 35 different European countries.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0190	2016-01-28	UNK	Boosting access to healthcare in times of crisis	The economic crisis has had a profound effect on people's lives, not least in the area of health. Public spending on healthcare has been frozen or cut; in some respects, citizens' health has deteriorated; and accessing healthcare has become more difficult. In response to this, many public authorities and service providers are attempting to ease the impact of the crisis by maintaining access for all to quality healthcare. ​Impacts of the crisis On 19 January 2016, Eurofound research officer Hans Dubois presented some of the key findings of the Agency's research into access to healthcare at a lecture series on Human Rights and Inclusive Global Health, organised by the Centre for Global Health in Trinity College, Dublin. Changes in public spending on health: In the context of the crisis, the longstanding general trend of increases in public health spending has come to a halt. Moreover, since 2007, in 18 Member States, public spending on health has undergone cuts. In addition, those countries have made cuts are more likely to be countries in which public spending on health was already lower. This makes concern for decreasing access to, and quality of, healthcare in the EU all the more valid. Deterioration in mental health: At a personal level, people’s mental health has suffered during the crisis. In the EU28, the proportion of people at risk of poor mental health rose from 24% in 2007 to 25% in 2011; while this may look small, it represents an increase of over 3 million people. Much of this increase can be attributed to a rise in unemployment; another contributing factor is a a greater feeling of insecurity in terms of housing and job tenure. Impact of crisis greater on low earners: The impact of the crisis upon citizens has not been equal: over the course of the crisis, a greater proportion of people at the bottom of the income scale have experienced bad  health. This is in contrast to those with higher incomes, whose health has remained stable or even improved, as Figure 1 demonstrates. Figure 1: Poor reported health status by income, EU28, 2007 and 2011   figure_1.png Source: Impacts of the crisis on access to healthcare services in the EU (Eurofound, 2013)  Problems with access As well as stalled or falling government expenditures, and worsening health outcomes for some, access to health care services has become more problematic for many. Most commonly, this is because citizens cannot afford the services: difficulties accessing services because of their cost have increased more than any for any other reason in crisis-hit countries. Several more key problems with access have come to light: Circumstances may mean that coverage has been reduced: unemployment, for some, has meant the loss of work-provided health insurance. Increased demand for services, and reduced supply, have led to longer waiting times. Cuts in spending on services such as transport can make services harder to reach: in Bulgaria, fewer resources are available to clear roads of snow, for example. Information services that, previously, helped citizens navigate the health system, may have been cut Lack of awareness can also pose a problem, particularly for vulnerable groups. In Portugal, migrant workers are entitled to access, but many people, including doctors, are not aware of this. Measures to maintain access Over the course of the crisis, service providers have sought to maintain access to services. Some approaches identified in the research include the following. Resorting to less expensive forms of care: In some cases, this has included continuing the ongoing trend of deinstitutionalisation: shortening the length of hospital stays, keeping older people in the community, and developing an alternative care infrastructure. Working more effectively with personnel: To make better use of limited resources service providers have reorganised work processes, brought in measures to motivate and retain staff, and used less costly workers (such as trainees) – which brings its own challenges, such as possible loss of quality of service. Seeking new sources of funding: Funding has been sought from local stakeholders, such as businesses. Extra paid-for features have been added for wealthier patients (such as VIP rooms in a Bulgarian hospital). And Denmark and Hungary have implemented a tax on less healthy foods. ​Incentivising access: In some cases, governments have incentivised healthcare providers to improve access, granting them subsidies if they reach certain defined targets. In Portugal, for instance, primary care providers and the Ministry of Health agreed a target for 2012 that 85% of pregnant women would receive a consultation with a general practitioner within the first three months of their pregnancy. (While such initiatives have potential, there is also scope for introducing unintended consequences.) Economising on cost: Faced with reductions in budgets, service providers have sought to economise in various ways – on utility bills; on food for patients. They have scrapped services not required by minimum national standards – psychiatric and physiotherapy services in a Latvian nursing home. And, in Portugal, service providers actively reduced costs for patients by reusing already used, yet functional, equipment.  Placing emphasis on primary care: A service provider in Sweden has encouraged people to go to a primary care centre (rather than using emergency care) by extending primary care opening hours, and locating the primary care unit close to the emergency unit to boost patient confidence. Moving towards ICT-based services: In Latvia, a family doctor advisory telephone service has been developed. And in Portugal and Romania, web portals and email systems have facilitated emote diagnosis of conditions in remote areas, allowing primary care providers to send digital images of the patient’s condition to specialists in hospitals. Elsewhere, however, ICT services have been cut, in some cases introducing the risk of greater costs being incurred in the long term. Greater flexibility: For instance, service providers may be more lenient in enforcing copayments for people in need.  Looking ahead In the context of the crisis, measures were taken in response to immediate, pressing constraints on public budgets. In early 2016, those constraints have been reduced somewhat in most countries, so it is timely to review measures that have been implemented. It should be noted that many measures were put in place only recently, so it may be more difficult to gauge their impact upon outcomes. Later this year, Eurofound will be conducting fieldwork for its Fourth European Quality of Life Survey. This wave of the pan-European survey will include a special module on healthcare systems. Further information Healthcare policy at EU level Health care policy is mainly a national matter, but increasingly, it reaches the EU level. For instance, the importance of healthcare is cited in the Europe 2020 strategy (150 KB PDF) in the context of social inclusion: ‘A major effort will be needed to combat poverty and social exclusion and reduce health inequalities to ensure that everybody can benefit from growth. Equally important will be our ability to meet the challenge of promoting a healthy and active ageing population to allow for social cohesion and higher productivity.’ The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, from 2000, in Article 35 states that access to quality healthcare is a fundamental right for citizens (770 KB PDF). While the Council conclusions on health inequality state that poor health outcomes may result from uneven access to health services, and stress the importance of ‘interventions that facilitate real access for all’ (120 KB PDF). And the Social Investment Package states that better healthcare can increase productivity and longer-term savings for EU Member States.While the EU-level approach has, to date, been only indirect in its impact, that is changing with the advent of the European Semester, particularly in the form of the country-specific recommendations (CSRs). For instance, the CSRs for Romania’s urge the country to seek to improve access to health care for people in remote regions. Data for the research A key source of the data is the Eurofound project on Access to healthcare in times of crisis. In this study, in-depth studies focused on nine countries: Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia and Sweden. It drew on a wide range of sources, including national literature, surveys and interviews with stakeholders. In addition, over 30 case studies illustrate how in practice budget-balancing measures have affected specific public healthcare services and access to them, for providers and service users, and how service providers have sought to maintain access. Most of the 31 case studies are publicly funded healthcare providers.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/boosting-access-to-healthcare-in-times-of-crisis

EUROFOUND_UNK_0195	2016-01-26	UNK	Exploring the job-creation potential of SMEs / Eurofound News, January 2016	Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) provide two-thirds of the employment in the EU and, with the right supports, could realistically create more. They are a diverse group, however, and not all are equally dynamic job creators. New research from Eurofound has found that the SMEs that create jobs tend to be young businesses that are innovative and operate at an international level. They set out active strategies for growth and investment and perform well thanks to sufficient market demand for their products. They are run by skilled managers, who possess the competences to realise company strategies. External factors are also important: to create jobs, SMEs need a favourable business environment, access to finance, effective public support structures, and the availability of workers with the right skills. This combination of factors underlying SME job creation potential leads the study to conclude that policy supporting SMEs to generate employment should aim towards offering comprehensive packages that address each of these diverse factors.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0196	2015-12-18	UNK	Reality behind welfare debate on Migrants Day	In a new report, Eurofound has examined the impact of intra-EU mobility on public services in nine host countries: Austria, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the UK. The aim of the research was to explore whether there was any evidence supporting the welfare magnet hypothesis, and to find out if if these mobile citizens encountered difficulties of societal inclusion in the host countries, examining the underlying reasons for the challenges they faced. Welfare tourism? Marking International Migrants Day, Klára Fóti, Research Manager at Eurofound, has outlined the findings of Eurofound's research into the 'welfare tourism' hypothesis. Even before 2004, when eight central and eastern European countries joined the European Union, there were fears that citizens from these Member States would flood into the more affluent western European countries, burdening their welfare systems; two additional central and eastern European countries, Bulgaria and Romania, joined the EU in 2007. In the wake of the financial and economic crisis, the debate on ‘welfare tourism’ accelerated. This happened just before restrictions on free movement of citizens from these two countries were lifted in January 2014. Some of the arguments voiced in the debate suggest that ‘new’ EU mobile citizens from these 10 countries (the ‘EU10’) are attracted precisely because of better-quality services and easier access to those services in the more affluent western Member States. This is referred to as the ‘welfare magnet’ hypothesis. Impact Data from host country studies confirmed previous findings that (mostly young) people from the EU10 countries arrive with the aim of working and achieving higher incomes than in their countries of origin. As a consequence, their employment rate is relatively high; in Italy, Ireland and the UK, it is even higher than that of the native population. However, since the ‘new’ EU citizens tend to be employed in those sectors where migrant workers are concentrated – such construction and agriculture – and which are particularly exposed to economic turbulence, they became vulnerable after the crisis: in many countries, their unemployment rate became higher than that of the native population. Conclusion The conclusion of the report was that, overall, EU10 citizens’ take-up of welfare benefits and public services in the host countries is lower than that of the native population. This is especially the case in relation to disability and sickness benefits, as well as pensions. The take-up of unemployment benefits or in-work benefits, however, tends to be higher than that of natives in most of those countries where data are available. Clearly, access to benefits – even for eligible EU10 citizens – can be complicated by difficulties with navigating social welfare systems, sometimes caused by lack of information and language barriers. To address this, the EU could play a more proactive role in helping host countries systematically support language learning. Such an investment could contribute to easing local tensions and improving integration; it could also help offset the negative narratives associated with perceived welfare tourism, which are clearly not evidence-based.  For more, read the report Social dimension of intra-EU mobility: Impact on public services.  	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/social-policies/reality-behind-welfare-debate-on-migrants-day

EUROFOUND_UNK_0199	2015-12-15	UNK	Regulation of labour market intermediaries and the role of social partners in preventing trafficking of labour / Foundation Focus, December 2015	Mobility and migration in the EU contribute to well-functioning labour markets and therefore to increased levels of productivity, competitiveness and growth. Labour market intermediaries (LMIs), such as temporary work agencies, facilitate mobility through matching workers with companies’ needs. They provide information and expertise that contributes to the better functioning of labour markets in Europe. An upcoming report by Eurofound looks at how these LMIs are regulated to avoid unlawful recruitment and exploitative working conditions. The report also looks at the role the social partners play in helping to prevent trafficking of workers. Trafficking for the purpose of labour exploitation In some cases, LMIs use their role to unlawfully recruit or transfer workers. They deceive workers about the nature of the job, the employer, the location or other conditions related to the work, and these workers end up working under exploitative conditions. This process is known as trafficking for the purpose of labour exploitation. To prevent and fight this criminal activity, in 2011 the EU adopted the Anti-Trafficking Directive (2011/36/EU). The directive emphasises that trafficking is a serious crime and a gross violation of fundamental rights. Tackling trafficking is a priority for the EU and its Member States, which is why minimum rules have been established that all Member States need to adhere to. The EU Strategy towards the Eradication of Trafficking in Human Beings 2012–2016 (COM(2012) 286 final) complements the legal rules with targeted actions. It focuses on prevention, protection, prosecution and partnerships and also on ways to increase knowledge on emerging concerns related to trafficking in human beings. The strategy identifies recruitment as one area of concern. LMIs that do not abide by the rules and exploit the vulnerable position of workers distort labour markets and their functioning. Monitoring LMIs’ compliance with rules and regulations helps to prevent exploitation. Employer organisations representing LMIs and trade unions representing workers can also contribute to preventing and tackling the trafficking of labour. Greater cooperation leads to better exchange of information and coherent activities. Eurofound research Greater knowledge of how LMIs are regulated in the different Member States and on what social partners do to prevent and tackle trafficking is required to facilitate targeted activities, especially by public authorities such as the police, labour inspectorates, employment services or local administrations. Eurofound is currently drafting a report containing information that will be used to compile a guide for public authorities on how to better address the issue of trafficking for labour exploitation. One way of limiting the risk that LMIs will engage in trafficking is by monitoring their compliance with national rules and regulations. Regulating the operation of LMIs can take a variety of forms in the 28 EU Member States and Norway (which also participated in the study). Registration or licensing schemes are common across Europe to monitor who is operating an LMI and to ensure compliance with minimum standards in running the business. Another approach to tackling trafficking is to engage in greater cooperation with social partners. Member States and public authorities in particular can benefit from social partners’ expertise on working and business conditions. Activities that contribute to eradicating trafficking include targeted initiatives by trade unions to inform, support and protect vulnerable workers and interventions of employers and their organisations to reinforce the importance of complying with minimum standards. These activities often take the form of awareness-raising campaigns, establishing complaint mechanisms, developing codes of conduct, distributing educational material and engaging in cross-border cooperation with other trade unions or employer organisations. Tackling trafficking for labour exploitation is an important way to facilitate fair mobility and migration within the EU. It is also an essential tool to ensure the effective functioning of EU labour markets for both workers and companies. Above all, however, it is the commitment of the EU, as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights (2012/C 326/02), to protect people’s basic human rights against violations to create an area of freedom, security and justice. The report will be published in early 2016.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0200	2015-12-17	UNK	A better life abroad?	Freedom of movement for all? Freedom of movement of citizens within and between Member States constitutes one of the core values of the European Union. However, concerns have grown in some countries that are popular destinations for migrant workers from other Member States about the impact of intra-EU mobility on their public services. The ‘welfare magnet hypothesis’ holds that migrants, including mobile citizens from the central and eastern European Member States, are attracted by the better quality and easier access of services in ‘older’ EU Member States. The issue has become highly politicised in some Member States recently, especially as a consequence of the global economic crisis and the greater numbers of people coming from central and eastern European Member States. Investigating the issue A newly published report from Eurofound on the social dimension of intra-EU mobility examines if there is any evidence supporting the widely held view that citizens from eastern Europe are coming to western Member States in a form of  ‘welfare tourism’. It looks in particular at the movement of people from 10 central and eastern European Member States (the ‘EU10’)  to nine host countries (Austria, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Sweden and the UK). It compares the take-up of benefits and social services by EU citizens of the EU10 with that of the native population. It also looks at which services arrivals to the host countries take up, and why; and it looks at the barriers that make it more difficult for newcomers to integrate in their host countries. Less take-up of services by EU10 citizens The key finding of the study is that, overall, citizens from the EU10 have a lower take-up of benefits and social services than native-born residents of host countries. And for certain benefits – disability and sickness benefits, social housing and pensions – it is much lower, due in large measure to their being primarily young people of prime working age. These results back up findings from previous analyses by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), among others, which demonstrate EU10 citizens make a positive fiscal contribution to state budgets in the host countries. Since employment is the dominant motivation for mobility among EU10 citizens, most of the benefits and services they use are related to the labour market and having a low income. For instance, their take-up of unemployment benefit tends to be greater than that of host-country nationals. Challenges facing entrants to host countries Several important challenges for EU10 citizens were identified. In most countries, citizens from the EU10 were at greater risk of becoming unemployed, having salaries cut and facing more precarious working and living conditions. In part, this is because these citizens tend to work in sectors largely staffed by migrants (such as construction, catering, tourism and hospitality, and the retail trade); these sectors are particularly exposed to economic turbulence. And even though migrants from the EU10 are usually well educated, they are most often employed in low-skilled jobs. In some countries, however, eligibility conditions for non-contributory benefits can mean that more vulnerable entrants are denied benefits, leading to these migrants facing social exclusion and eventual destitution. This is especially the case for older, lower-skilled people. Looking to the future The movement of EU citizens has important knock-on effects in terms of demographic change in Europe. From the perspective of host countries with older populations and an older workforce, the entry of young workers could aid in resolving some of the challenges policymakers face in terms of ensuring that the workforce can support citizens in retirement. However, the same movement could increase the pressure posed by demographic ageing in those countries that young workers are leaving, even if remittances and accumulated pension entitlements might help in the future. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/a-better-life-abroad
EUROFOUND_UNK_0201	2015-12-15	UNK	Social dimension of intra-EU mobility: Impact on public services / Foundation Focus, December 2015	There is a heated debate in many of the host EU Member States about the impact of mobility on public services. The debate centres on the ‘welfare magnet’ hypothesis, which holds that mobile citizens from the central and eastern European Member States are attracted by better-quality services and easier access to those services in the more affluent western Member States. This, it is argued, puts additional pressure on social services in the host countries. The issue has recently become highly politicised in some Member States, especially as a consequence of the economic and financial crisis and particularly the increased inflow of these mobile EU citizens. Recent research by Eurofound examines the impact of intra-EU mobility on public services in nine host countries: Austria, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the UK. The research focuses on citizens from 10 central and eastern European Member States (EU10) – eight that joined the EU in 2004 (Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia) and two in 2007 (Bulgaria and Romania). The main objective of the research was to explore whether there was any evidence supporting the welfare magnet hypothesis. Focus of the research East–west mobility still dominates current intra-EU mobility, and the debate on ‘welfare tourism’ is associated mainly with the ‘new migrants’. Therefore, the focus of the study was the impact of the inflow of EU10 citizens on the take-up of benefits and various social services in the nine host countries. Previous research has shown that welfare dependency can be reduced when migrants are successfully integrated. Hence, if benefits and services are increasingly used by these mobile citizens, it is important to look at the main obstacles to their integration in the host countries. The study further aimed to identify the challenges that mobile EU10 citizens are likely to face when they arrive and stay in a host country. This could have important policy implications at Member State and EU level, but also for regions and local municipalities within the individual Member States. Take-up of benefits and social services The research found that, overall, take-up of welfare benefits and services by EU10 citizens in host countries is lower than that of the native population. This is particularly the case in relation to disability and sickness benefits, social housing and pensions. However, take-up of employment-related benefits, most notably unemployment benefits, is higher than that of natives. This is understandable due to the high participation of mobile EU10 citizens in the labour market. Moreover, as a consequence of the crisis, especially in those countries severely hit, EU10 mobile citizens were at higher risk of unemployment than native workers. Take-up of education opportunities among mobile citizens, especially compulsory education for younger children, is increasing. As a result of this increase, some countries have reported a high concentration of migrants’ children in schools in certain areas.However, the available data suggest that the EU10 citizens tend to use health services less than the native population in host countries, mainly because the majority of them are young people. Similarly, EU10 citizens make less use of social housing than natives. Data from Ireland and the UK show that fewer EU10 citizens access social housing even if they have similar socioeconomic characteristics – such as income, family size or employment status – as natives. The reason for lower access clearly lies in the low stock of social housing, resulting in long waiting times even for natives. This means that EU mobile citizens who have recently arrived in the host country will join the bottom of long waiting lists for housing. Moreover, restrictive eligibility conditions, such as those introduced in some of Spain’s autonomous communities, tie eligibility to being registered with a particular municipality for a number of years, explaining the lower access to social housing among these EU mobile citizens. As regards future impact on specific services in host countries, demand for housing is likely to increase. This could be linked to the intention of the EU10 mobile citizens to become more settled. For instance, on arrival in a host country and during the following few years, these mobile citizens and especially young people, who do not have families, tend to share an apartment or house. Their position obviously changes later when they start a family and need their own accommodation. Challenges of welfare systems In general, access to benefits can be problematic, even for eligible EU10 citizens, because of difficulties in dealing with often complicated social welfare systems, especially due to lack of information and language skills. More recently, many legislative changes have been reported in several countries, also as a consequence of the crisis, adding to the difficulties for mobile citizens in navigating welfare systems. Ways forward for policymakers Since the lack of information can often be traced back to insufficient language knowledge, remedying this problem could help to facilitate the social inclusion of EU mobile citizens in host countries. The EU should play a more proactive role, in cooperation with the host Member States, in supporting language learning among mobile citizens. Eurofound’s research suggests that recent budget cuts in individual Member States have adversely affected language learning opportunities for the most vulnerable groups of EU mobile citizens, such as those on low incomes or in precarious jobs. Investing in language skills with EU support, therefore, seems to be the right way of achieving the Commission’s aim, stated in its 2013 Communication on free movement, of ‘countering public perceptions that are not based on facts or economic realities’. Conclusions Within the context of demographic change in Europe, the consequences of intra-EU mobility are of high importance. While increased mobility could contribute to mitigating the consequences of population ageing and an ageing workforce in the host countries, it could exacerbate the effects of the same phenomenon in the sending countries, even if remittances and accumulated pension entitlements could help in the future.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0202	2015-12-15	UNK	Migration, labour market and integration policies for third-country nationals: Challenges of policy coordination / Foundation Focus, December 2015	Migration from third countries is a major policy concern at national and European level. While it is dealt with in great detail for the purpose of introducing specific regulations, the overall architecture of migration-related policies is perceived as a challenge. This is particularly the case at present as the influx of refugees to the EU puts additional pressures on policymakers in managing the different strands of immigration flows. The inward migration of non-EU citizens represented two-thirds of EU population growth in the past decade and half of the employment growth in the past five years. These figures will most likely increase as a result of the significant inflow of refugees in recent months. Coordinated approach Against this backdrop, one positive trend has been emerging in recent years: Member States are slowly starting to realise the need for greater coherence between immigrant integration policies and measures to attract migrants, while at the same time looking for more coordinated methods of addressing long-term integration issues. Eurofound’s report on Challenges of policy coordination for third-country nationals shows that Member States have made progress in this area by involving a broad range of partners from different government ministries and departments at national, regional and local level, as well as other stakeholders, including civil society organisations, social partners and service providers. In general, according to the findings, policy coordination has manifested itself in various ways. First, government attempts to attract more migrant workers have often been interlinked from the outset with both integration outcomes and economic competitiveness in mind. Secondly, some governments have implemented an approach to immigrant integration referred to as mainstreaming, which means they aim to reach people with an immigrant background through programmes and policies that also target the general population, such as the education system offered by employment services. Mainstreaming can be achieved by adapting governance structures both horizontally and vertically to improve coordination on integration goals or by adapting general policies to incorporate integration priorities into overall objectives. However, a closer look at the links between migration, labour market and integration policies reveals an uneven patchwork of cooperation within the Member States that has sometimes led to a lack of coordination or a coherent approach. What works? A number of factors underpin successful policy coordination. Countries that promote a mix of both external vertical coordination (national, regional and local) and internal horizontal coordination (between various departments) tend to have better policy outcomes in terms of integration results. Likewise, maintaining policy coherence during implementation or programme coordination is key for reaching the objectives set. This applies to both internal and external coherence: internal coherence within the policy programme and among stakeholders – for example, maintaining a specific approach or strategy; and external coherence between different organisations – for example, good cooperation between national and local levels to adapt to any change in the overall strategy. Stability of institutions and their internal configuration also play a role in maintaining good policy coordination. Putting in place a strong coordination centre (with sufficient resources) that can offer political support is crucial. In addition, in all policy coordination mechanisms, stakeholder commitment throughout each programme is important for its ultimate success. The migrant’s role is an important element that needs to be taken into account in policy coordination. A successful outcome may depend on the involvement of migrants in consultations and the extent of their contribution. Their input is also important in setting the overall goals of the policy programme. Policy pointers In designing their migration-related policies, Member States should think more holistically at the start of the process about the outcomes that go beyond the labour market and encompass integration; this could lead to better planning and yield better overall outcomes. Notwithstanding the challenges related to the overall policymaking and the governance structures that Member States face on a daily basis, it is important to maintain policy coherence and the stability of the process when implementing policy or programme coordination.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0203	2015-12-15	UNK	Role of social partners in policies for third-country nationals / Foundation Focus, December 2015	In recent decades, migration patterns in Europe have changed significantly. Moreover, increasing disparities between more- and less-developed countries have led to an increase in worldwide migration. Europe has become more attractive for migrants, and the numbers of third-country nationals arriving have grown. In more recent months, the situation in Europe has changed profoundly with the substantial inflow of refugees. Eurofound’s new study on migration, labour market and integration policy looks into the challenges this brings for the social partners. Many EU countries are facing an unprecedented refugee inflow and have been grappling with how to deal with this ongoing situation. What is needed, however, is a comprehensive and coordinated response to address both the immediate needs of asylum seekers and the longer-term challenges of integration. The social partners have a significant input to make in this endeavour. Focal points for social partners The social partners are not only an intrinsic part of the workplace but are involved in wider societal issues, which means they also have to deal with the growing challenges of a more diverse workforce and society. For the social partners, the issue of migration, and migrants as both workers and citizens, is an important but not always easy issue to address. It presents a number of challenges. Labour market and economic migrants: The issue of migration is important from the external perspective of organising access to the national labour market and from an internal perspective of dealing with migrant workers after legal or illegal labour market entry. The social partners also have a strong interest in working conditions. Asylum and refugees: Another external dimension is the influx of refugees into the EU. This challenge has been growing dramatically in recent months with the significant increase in the numbers arriving. Wider integration of migrants: Although employment is a key avenue for overall integration, housing and education are also important factors. As trade unions in particular define themselves as organisations concerned both with direct labour market issues and with the wider society, they may be involved in issues related to integration of migrants. Union membership: Inclusion of workers in trade unions is a normal objective of unions in minimising the effect of competition between organised and unorganised workers. However, the degree of interest in organising migrant workers may vary between countries. Treatment of migrant interests: Trade unions usually base their actions and initiatives on the interests of their members as a whole, to maximise internal solidarity and to optimise their position in relation to employers. However, migrant workers may have specific needs and may require some tailored initiatives, albeit of a temporary nature. These may depend on cultural factors (language or religion), legal status (work permits) or structural conditions in the labour market (precarious employment). Involvement in defining policy In many countries, a broad range of stakeholders, including government, employers and, to a lesser extent, trade unions, cooperate to identify labour shortages and to inform broader third-country migration legislation, especially that relating to the labour market. Policy coordination takes place within different frameworks. The most common approach is employer needs analysis. Public employment services can also be a platform, as in Germany and Sweden. In some countries, particularly in central and eastern European countries, but also in Luxembourg and Spain, the tripartite mechanism has been identified as a platform for consultation. In other countries, the equal rights agenda serves as a framework for engagement. The most widespread programmes supporting workplace integration are those related to language provision, both general language training and job-specific tuition. Trade unions are particularly active in this area in Italy and Malta. Other measures, for example, in Finland, Romania and Spain, focus on general training in the areas of labour law and health and safety. Employer organisations and individual companies are increasingly active in the area of diversity management. Initiatives can take the form of agreements that companies have to comply with, or prizes that are awarded for companies excelling in and promoting diversity management. The framework of anti-discrimination has been used by various social partners, especially trade unions, for the provision of programmes tailored to migrants’ needs. In Germany and Sweden, for instance, the social partners have implemented a range of programmes focusing on how to carry out non-discriminating recruitment processes, including analysis of competency needs, the choice of recruitment channels, the interview process, as well as other key steps in recruiting new staff. The approach of social partners to gathering information about the migrant workforce seems to be sporadic and fragmented, and only a few countries do it systematically (Malta and Spain). The situation also varies within countries. In several countries, the social partners carried out ad hoc surveys aimed at learning more about their membership composition (Finland, Ireland and Italy). As third-country migrant workers make up a growing share of the workforce in a number of sectors, the question arises as to whether trade unions have systems in place to increase membership among this group. Few trade unions have a strategic vision to increase unionisation among the migrant workforce. Two countries that are notable exceptions in this regard are Ireland and the UK, where unions have made a considerable effort to increase membership among this group. In some countries, measures have been implemented on an irregular basis. In most cases, initiatives are aimed directly at migrant workers rather than at simplifying internal union procedures and structures. Cost was cited by migrants as a barrier to joining a union, and formal language and internal procedures were also problematic. Furthermore, migrants flagged their lack of awareness of the benefits of being a union member. The social partners have started to pay more attention to policy issues that go beyond the domain of work. In some countries, social partner involvement is implemented through a structured framework, and in others it occurs on a case-by-case basis. Countries where the social partners have been actively shaping integration policies include Portugal and Slovenia. In Denmark, the social partners have set up a range of websites to help migrants in all aspects of living and working in the country. In some countries, social partner involvement is sparked by a particular issue. For instance, vocational training issues have triggered social partner involvement in Germany, Spain and Norway. Issues related to migrant children have been the focus of integration activities by the social partners in Germany, Portugal and Greece. Looking to the future The social partners, along with policymakers and other stakeholders, will also have to reflect on how to react to and address the short-term and long-term impact of the recent influx of refugees to the EU. On 30 September 2015, the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) adopted an emergency motion ‘Refugee crisis in Europe’, in which it calls for a proactive European asylum policy that respects internationally agreed protection standards. It also argues that, when dealing with refugees, more emphasis should be placed on services that focus on social cohesion, such as employment and housing.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0204	2015-12-15	UNK	Workers’ mobility and migration: How to achieve a balance in Europe? / Foundation Focus, December 2015	Part of the objective of setting up the EU was to reduce barriers to the free movement of people, goods and services. The aim is to enable exchange between countries, overcome limitations, and balance differences related to specific national systems, such as social welfare systems. EU regulation Since its inception in 1957, the EU has established the principle of free movement of European workers across the Member States, as set out in Article 45 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). This principle entails: the right to look for a job in another Member State; the right to work in another Member State; the right to reside there for that purpose; the right to remain there; the right to equal treatment in respect of access to employment, working conditions and all other advantages which could help to facilitate the worker’s integration in the host Member State.[1] Stemming from this principle, a whole body of EU regulation has been built up, stressing the equal treatment at work of European citizens, independently of their country of origin and work. Individual and collective rights are to be equally applied to the nationals of one Member State working in another – for example, in exercising trade union rights (Council Regulation (EEC) No. 312/76). Implementing this principle remains challenging. It raises many issues, such as: economic and social aspects directly related to non-native workers, the host states and the overall workforce; the transfer of pensions and social benefits; entitlements of EU mobile workers to unemployment benefits and social security; and family issues related to education and housing. This explains why countries seeking EU membership have often had specific provisions introduced in their Accession Treaty, subjecting free movement to certain conditions. Following the EU enlargement on 1 May 2004, when 10 countries joined simultaneously, there were transitional periods that limited the free movement of workers from these Member States (with the exception of Malta and Cyprus) to most, but not all Member States. (Ireland, Sweden and the UK did not impose restrictions). The purpose of this transition period was to smooth the integration of workers from these countries, ensuring full application of the equal treatment principle. Defining mobility and migration Mobility and migration are two key features of labour markets, highlighting the need for enhancing skills, matching competencies to labour market demands, developing products and services, and responding to new needs. At European level, the term ‘geographical mobility’ covers EU citizens moving within and across countries. Under the EU Treaty, all European citizens have the right and freedom to move between EU Member States for work (known as ‘intra-EU mobility’). By contrast, the situation of third-country nationals is determined, according to articles 79 and 80 of the TFEU, by European migration policy. Both EU and national levels of regulation come into play in shaping legal third-country migration: the EU has the competence to lay down the conditions of entry and residence for third-country nationals entering and residing legally in one Member State for purposes of family reunification. Member States still retain the right to determine admission rates for people coming from third countries to seek work.[2] This issue of Foundation Focus, which brings together the findings of various Eurofound studies on different aspects of migrants and mobile workers, focuses on geographical mobility. It will therefore mainly consider the labour market situation of EU citizens in terms of intra-EU mobility or internal migration, on the one hand, and migration of third-country nationals to the EU, on the other. Challenges for Member States Given the importance of work – both economically and socially – to individuals and to societies, it is vital to acknowledge the position that mobile and migrant workers occupy. Governments, employer organisations and trade unions are all – in principle – open to EU workers freely moving within and between Member States; in practice, however, the integration of (EU and third-country) migrant workers and the implementation of the equal treatment principle still poses a challenge. The long-standing debate on the posting of workers demonstrates the complexity inherent in favouring the model of a single market and free delivery of services across Europe, on the one hand, while seeking to uphold social protection and employment rights for all workers, on the other.[3] Posted workers are workers who, for a limited period, carry out their work in the territory of a Member State other than the state in which they normally work. They are not considered to be migrants (who are foreign workers seeking long-term employment in a specific country). Lengthy discussions regarding the posting of workers have highlighted the importance of a clear vision regarding the rights of all foreign workers in each Member State, the process of guaranteeing those rights, and the controls and sanctions available for implementing them. Key issues are at stake here. First, differences in regulation across Europe create possibilities for what is referred to as ‘social dumping’, whereby an employer employs migrant workers, paying them lower wages and applying less strict rules regarding working conditions, in order to cut labour costs and increase competitiveness. Social dumping can jeopardise workers’ rights and conditions, and fair competition. Secondly, workers who are particularly vulnerable – such as migrant workers – can find themselves in a precarious situation: in the face of difficult circumstances, they have less understanding of their rights and are less able to voice their concerns. The importance of the social partners taking action to combat this phenomenon is recognised at European, national, sectoral and local level. Their collaboration with a range of other social actors and public authorities can provide the framework for striking the correct balance between multiple interests and rights.

As outlined in the 2015 Commission work programme, the Commission will carry out a ‘targeted review’ of Directive 96/71 as part of the Labour Mobility Package in order to assess whether any adjustments are needed to further prevent the posting of workers leading to social dumping (see answer given by Commissioner Marianne Thyssen, on behalf of the Commission, to a question by MEP Jutta Steinruck, April 2015 or CWP 2015, Annex I). Definitions used:Intra-EU mobility: The movement of EU nationals within the EU, whether within a Member State or between Member States, as mobile workers. In cases where this move is between Member States and at least semi-permanent, this constitutes internal migration. Shorter-term movement includes the phenomena of posted workers and cross-border commuters. Migration: The movement of workers between states on a permanent or semi-permanent basis. This migration may be internal migration between Member States or third-country migration of workers from outside the EU.   Full publication with references available here  	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/workers-mobility-and-migration-how-to-achieve-a-balance-in-europe-foundation-focus-december-2015
EUROFOUND_UNK_0205	2015-12-15	UNK	Interview with Adriano Silvestri  / Foundation Focus, December 2015	‘Risks of severe forms of labour exploitation are much higher in the unregulated and uncontrolled areas of the labour market’ Head of the Asylum, Migration and Borders Sector at the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), Adriano Silvestri, discusses FRA’s remit in informing the policy debate on the situation of third-country migrants in the EU and highlights what the Agency is doing to help Member States strengthen fundamental rights protection. What is FRA’s role in informing the policy debate on migrants in the EU? FRA provides independent fundamental rights expertise to EU institutions, bodies and agencies, as well as to Member States when implementing EU law. FRA’s work in the area of asylum, migration and borders is ongoing, and the Agency regularly publishes the results of its research on many aspects of the rights of migrants and asylum seekers. Based on extensive research in 2011, the Agency has since published three reports on the rights of migrants in an irregular situation, and more recently on the fundamental rights situation at the EU’s external borders. The reports contain Opinions that are addressed to the EU and its Member States and offer advice based on the provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. What can Member States do to prevent severe labour exploitation across the EU? In June 2015, FRA presented its research findings on severe forms of labour exploitation in the EU. The report highlights risk factors increasing the probability of exploitation and suggests to policymakers ways of countering these risks in terms of prevention, effective monitoring of the situation of foreign workers and granting victims of severe labour exploitation access to justice. Drawing on this research, FRA has put forward a number of proposals to enhance victims’ protection. Several of these seek to combat the impunity currently enjoyed by many employers engaging in criminal forms of exploitation. Another is a suggestion to improve consumers’ understanding of whether the goods and services they purchase may have been produced under conditions of labour exploitation – for example, through the creation of a ‘fair work’ label that provides reliable information about the quality of working conditions. What is FRA working on in the area of migration following the many recent tragedies involving migrants entering the EU? One of FRA’s key roles is to raise awareness among practitioners. For example, its Handbook on European law relating to asylum, borders and immigration, produced together with the European Court of Human Rights, provides an easy-to-use overview of fundamental rights safeguards included in EU law and in the European Convention on Human Rights. It is also supporting its sister agencies, such as the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) and the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), in developing training and guidance for Member State border guards and other practitioners. The Agency’s ongoing work of providing advice and Opinions is helping to ensure the implementation of fundamental rights safeguards. Its paper Criminalisation of migrants in an irregular situation and of persons engaging with them suggests changes to EU law that would forbid Member States from imposing penalties on refugees who enter without authorisation if they come directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened. Punishment should also be excluded for those who provide humanitarian assistance to migrants in an irregular situation. Children are particularly at risk of abuse and trafficking. What steps can be taken to improve the situation? In October 2015, FRA published a report exploring the key features of guardianship systems put in place for all children in need of protection, including child victims and those at risk of becoming victims of human trafficking or other forms of exploitation. No EU Member State has developed a separate guardianship system exclusively for child victims of trafficking. In principle, the guardianship of child victims of trafficking falls under the general guardianship provisions set forth in civil and/or family law, irrespective of the migration or residence status of the child victim, even in Member States that have separate guardianship systems for unaccompanied children. How can the EU strengthen fundamental rights protection in relation to mobility and migration of workers? In the paper Legal entry channels to the EU for persons in need of international protection, FRA highlights a number of mobility schemes that could be explored to allow migrant workers and refugees to safely access the EU without resorting to smugglers or degrading working conditions. The risks of severe forms of labour exploitation are much higher in the unregulated and uncontrolled areas of the labour market. FRA’s report on severe labour exploitation emphasises that households acting as employers are in a grey zone as they are not always regarded – and often don't regard themselves – as fully fledged employers who have to meet all labour law regulations. As FRA’s research shows, the area of domestic work is one where labour exploitation is frequent and, in fact, sometimes particularly severe. What new research is FRA currently undertaking to shed light on the situation of migrants in Europe? A study is in progress on the social inclusion and democratic participation of migrants and their descendants in Member States. The findings will be used as the basis for developing fundamental rights indicators for use throughout the EU. Field research is underway for the second European Union Minorities and Discrimination Survey (EU-MIDIS), which is collecting experiences of discrimination in different areas (labour market, education, housing, health and other services), as well as criminal victimisation, social inclusion and participation. The survey will show the progress made since FRA’s first EU-MIDIS survey in 2008. FRA is also currently working on the fundamental rights impact of collecting, storing and using the biometrics data collected in the EU’s three large border management IT systems, Eurodac, SIS II (Schengen Information System) and VIS (Visa Information System).Planning is underway for the second phase of fieldwork on severe forms of labour exploitation, in which victims and potential victims will be interviewed. In addition to FRA, a number of other EU Agencies are working in areas related to migration issues. These include, but are not limited to, Frontex, EASO, the EU’s law enforcement agency (Europol), the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and the EU’s Judicial Cooperation Unit (Eurojust).   Full publication with references available here 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/interview-with-adriano-silvestri-foundation-focus-december-2015
EUROFOUND_UNK_0206	2015-12-15	UNK	Challenging times for labour markets across the EU / Foundation Focus, December 2015	Dynamic labour markets are typified by mobility of workers. In a time of crisis, however, mismatches in the labour market can be exacerbated by several factors. This article, drawing on recent reporting from the EurWORK network of European correspondents, provides some examples of how European countries are responding to the combination of intra-EU mobility and third-country migration. Difficulties of integration Entry to the labour market is complicated by varying regulations on work permits and the inherent difficulties of integrating third-country migrants’ wide range of qualifications and skills into existing workforces. At the same time, many EU Member States experience difficulties with immigration from close neighbouring countries and grapple with phenomena such as social dumping and the exploitation of workers. It is a picture of extremes, with some countries encouraging third-country immigration to balance skills levels in their labour markets and others increasing border policing to prevent illegal immigration. For northern European countries, the issues fall between two stools. In general, the social partners are not opposed to immigration. Employers are aware of an impending skills shortage and seek to plug gaps with immigrant labour. Trade unions acknowledge this situation but seek primarily to protect existing wages and prevent exploitation of both native and immigrant workers. Governments seek to manage demographic change using third-country migration and to benefit from its economic rewards while dealing with the accompanying inherent challenges. Emigration and youth unemployment For many EU countries, however, emigration due to intra-EU mobility is more of a problem than third-country immigration. Portugal has experienced problems as a result of many young people emigrating, especially to France and the UK. The British and Portuguese trade union confederations TUC and CGTP-IN signed a cooperation protocol in August 2014 to ensure Portuguese-speaking migrant workers in the UK can join unions and to enforce their rights at work. Although immigrant workers in Portugal have a higher rate of economic activity, they are overrepresented in certain sectors, have more accidents, earn less and are more likely to be unemployed. In common with Portugal, Bulgaria is more concerned with emigration and youth unemployment. A recent survey among employers showed that the outlook for hiring staff in the coming period is poor, and only one-fifth of employers predict extra recruitment. The Czech Republic experiences immigration from Bulgaria, Romania and Moldova, combining intra-EU and third-country migration. Recent research among immigrants from these three countries found that 70% of respondents had a work contract but only half understood it. The vast majority were employed through agencies. Two-thirds reported being subjected to multiple (illegal) working conditions problems such as unpaid wages, bullying and retention of personal documents; 15% of them reported not being paid. Vulnerability of migrants A labour force and living conditions survey of Polish workers in Norway, carried out in 2010, shows that the vast majority (80%) are paid at or above the minimum rates. But the fifth who earned less were employed by foreign subcontracting firms or were unregistered workers. Immigrant workers are more likely to be subject to precarious and temporary associations with the labour market where the compliance of temporary work agencies with legal duties of notification and registration could be improved. Measures have proved effective where social partners have extended collective agreements to enhance regulation monitoring. But where there is no existing collective agreement, within a context of significant labour immigration, the risk of social dumping remains high. Social dumping is also seen as a major issue in Denmark, where immigration is a critical issue. Here, a bill cutting social benefits for unemployed immigrants aims to encourage more immigrants into the job market. A more extreme threat exists where some employers take advantage of migrants’ vulnerability. A survey carried out in Slovenia by the Faculty of Criminal Justice and Security in October 2014 showed that there were cases where the employment of migrant workers had the characteristics of human trafficking. The government seeks to combat this by setting up preventive measures aimed at discouraging any demand for services performed by trafficked persons. Positive steps More positively, some countries (often those with shortages of skills and competencies) seek to facilitate the integration of migrants into their labour markets. In 2011, Austria introduced new rules on both social and wage dumping. Wage dumping means workers are offered a lower wage than is normal in an industry (under collective agreement), and often applies to migrant workers brought in to carry out a specific job. The new rules have been an important element in the opening of the labour market and in greatly reducing bad practice among companies. In parallel, a ‘Red-White-Red card’ scheme was set up to deal with skills shortages in selected sectors by attracting qualified workers, especially from Bulgaria, Romania and outside the EU. In Sweden, the Ministry of Employment invited the social partners to tripartite meetings to introduce a fast track into the labour market for newly arrived immigrants. The aim is for the various parties to work together with the public employment services to shorten the time between arrival and employment and to plug competency shortages in the labour market with new arrivals. In Germany, the ageing working population and shortages of skilled labour are considered problematic by the OECD. The social partners are more or less in agreement, and trade unions have cooperated to ease restrictions on work permits and training for third-country migrants. But while employer organisations continually stress the need for more immigration and further opening of the German labour market to attract immigrants, trade unions are concerned that those coming to work from other European countries could be exploited by ‘dubious’ employers and cite the paucity of information on statutory minimum working conditions. Opposition to immigration At the polar extreme of attitudes to immigration is Hungary, where immigrants are being marginalised even though they create more jobs than they take up. This takes place against a background of an exit from the country of skilled labour. The TÁRKI Social Research Institute recorded a huge increase in outward migration intention over the previous 12 months. Over a million said they would leave the country, many for good. There is already a high rate of emigration among young and highly skilled Hungarian workers seeking better pay and jobs elsewhere. Conclusions This evidence suggests that the social partners in most European countries recognise that migrants are not a threat but an asset to the economy. Employers want to fill gaps in skilled occupations, and trade unions have (for the most part) agreed to softening state regulations allowing migrants to work. Sharper disputes exist where worker protection is an issue. Exploitation of workers has similarities with trafficking, and social and wage dumping both undercut indigenous workers and exploit migrants.Demographics may be the key issue in the migration debate, as cohorts move through employment towards pensionable age and become economically inactive. Migrants may be seen as filling naturally occurring employment positions. At the same time, resentment among the native populations towards migrants may be based on unfounded suspicions of ‘job theft’.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0207	2015-12-15	UNK	Lessons for local migrant integration policy across EU cities / Foundation Focus, December 2015	The current refugee and third-country migrant emergency continues to have an impact across the EU and beyond. Europe’s policymakers are seeking to respond in a just and sustainable manner to this humanitarian crisis. Specific Eurofound research may be of real relevance in this context. Eurofound conducted a study from 2006 to 2010 with a network of over 30 European cities working together to support the social and economic integration of third-country migrants. The European network of cities for local integration policies for migrants (CLIP) encouraged the structured sharing of experiences through the medium of separate city reports and workshops that covered four research modules (see boxed text). The network enabled local authorities to learn from each other and to compose a more effective integration policy. The main recommendations from the project are outlined below. Increased diversity in European cities: Local governments must recognise the changing social structure of European cities. To pave the way for social cohesion, city policies should focus on equal opportunities, civic participation and prevention of discrimination against migrants. Reference to migrant status in the public discourse: Those closely involved in public discourse on the integration of migrants and improved intercultural relations should consider their communication strategies seriously and the way they use concepts, terminology and labels. Cooperation, mainstreaming and governance of integration policy: A balanced intercultural integration policy must be implemented. To do so, a number of factors associated with local government and city administration are required. These include: innovative organisational structures, high intercultural awareness among key decision-makers, strong intercultural competence, professionalism and commitment in the integration department, and visible and sustained political leadership. Innovation within specific domains of integration policy: Cities that are becoming increasingly diverse need a good understanding of intercultural structures and relations. Policymakers need to be aware that their migrant population is equally or even more preoccupied with the same socioeconomic issues as the rest of the population. The migrant population is often more affected by economic downturns, and appropriate policies should be put in place to mitigate the negative consequences of such setbacks. More effective diversity management: Issues of diversity management, non-discrimination and equal opportunities should be given high priority by local authorities. There should be a significant focus on creating employment opportunities for migrants. Access to career opportunities in city administrations and other public utilities is to be encouraged. Greater support for ethnic entrepreneurship: Cities are advised to put more emphasis on the policy area of ethnic entrepreneurship and to combine it systematically with their overall integration policy for migrants. Cities should aim to close communication gaps, recognise ethnic entrepreneurship as an important feature of the overall economic strategy, facilitate links with education and training, support access to finance and provide an effective regulatory framework. Innovation in policy and service provision: A mix of generic and targeted policies for the integration of migrants calls for substantial political, organisational and technical skill in the city council and in the city administration. Good communication skills and the involvement of relevant intermediate organisations of the receiving country and the migrant community are vitally important. Intercultural development of the city administration: Intercultural competence in European cities must be maintained and developed. This will open up the city administration in an intercultural manner. These activities should take place at all levels of city administration. European funding for local migrant integration activities: Rather than provide funding to cities for integration policies via national governments, a new line of finance should be provided and made directly accessible to local authorities within the context of the European Integration Fund for migrants. To finance and support community actions, the European Commission should provide funding for successful city networks. Identity: The CLIP findings suggested the need for a radical change of perception and policy. This would mean a move from traditional ‘asymmetric’ integration policy to ‘balanced intercultural integration’ policy. New forms of identities must be fostered by both the settled population and newcomers in order to deal with the new intercultural reality. If successful, this shift of mind-set could provide the basis for a new concept of an inclusive European identity that would stem from the practical day-to-day experience of citizens. The new perception of such an identity would be accepted and encouraged by non-governmental organisations and other relevant organisations.   Conclusions and lessons learnt: The CLIP studies discovered that in many countries innovative cities were well ahead of national integration policy. In some instances, those cities were also ahead of European policies. Thus, in light of recent events, it is useful to relay such information to national and European policymakers. Overview of CLIP research modules cliphousing.jpg Housing and integration of migrants in EuropeThe first module researched by CLIP was housing – the segregation, accessibility, quality and affordability of housing for migrants – which was identified as a major issue affecting migrants’ integration into host societies. Research results showed that having satisfactory accommodation was regarded as one of the most important human needs. It was apparent that any policy based on the principle of ‘one size fits all’ would fail, and the report recommended that cities and local communities should develop tailor-made solutions, with the support of the EU and Member States.  clipdiversity.jpg Equality and diversity in jobs and servicesThe second module examined equality and diversity policies in relation to employment within city administrations and in their provision of services. It was crucial that migrants could access both of these without suffering discrimination. The study found that cities should give greater priority to policy areas concerning these two integration measures. It was suggested cities should emphasise these issues within a broader integration, diversity or equality strategy, reviewing their approaches where necessary. clipintercult.jpg Intercultural policies in European citiesThe focus of the third module was intercultural policies and intergroup relations. Most cities dealt with intergroup and intercultural policies within the framework of integration policies. Others framed their policies in diversity strategies, while the eastern European cities implemented national minority policies. The empowerment and establishment of links between migrant organisations were considered to be crucial. Intercultural events were regarded as a means of countering ethnic and racial stereotypes and promoting social cohesion. All CLIP cities made an effort to raise the intercultural competence of their residents.  clipentrepreneur.jpg Ethnic entrepreneurshipThe final module looked at ethnic entrepreneurship and found that ethnic entrepreneurs contributed to the economic growth of their local areas. They offered a wide range of services and products to immigrants and the host population and created an important bridge to global markets. Ethnic entrepreneurs were also important for the integration of migrants into employment. In addition to job creation, ethnic entrepreneurship could enhance social opportunities for migrants and promote social cohesion. However, at the time of publication (2011), their importance continued to be overlooked, and ethnic entrepreneurship was not an important part of the European integration policy for migrants. Note: An overview report is available for each of the above four modules, as well as a résumé incorporating key research findings and good practice guidelines for policymakers at European, national and local levels.   Full publication with references available here 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/lessons-for-local-migrant-integration-policy-across-eu-cities-foundation-focus-december-2015
EUROFOUND_UNK_0208	2015-12-15	UNK	The thorny issue of labour mobility: Hotly debated but still a slow burner / Foundation Focus, December 2015	Free movement of labour – or labour mobility – is high on the EU policy agenda, and it is also a hotly debated issue in some EU Member States. A recent report from Eurofound looks at trends and policies in labour mobility in the EU. At EU level, the discourse around labour mobility has been primarily positive, vaunting the benefits of increased mobility as a strategy to reduce discrepancies between supply and demand in European labour markets. At national level, the political debate is more mixed and dominated increasingly by concerns over the negative effects of labour mobility in terms of social dumping (where cheaper migrant labour undercuts local wage rates) and potential abuse of the welfare systems in receiving countries. This negative discourse, which is becoming increasingly mainstream, at times coexists with a national discourse emphasising the need to attract foreign labour in the face of severe labour shortages. Extent of labour mobility Notwithstanding these political concerns, what is the extent of mobility of workers in the EU? European and national data suggest that the level of mobility both between and within countries remains low by international comparison. Data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) indicates that the movement of mobile citizens, referred to as free-movement flows, fell by almost 40% in EU countries between 2007 and 2010, but a rebound in free-movement flows within OECD countries of 10% was recorded in 2012, which was mainly accounted for by intra-EU mobility.[1] Germany continued to be the main destination country, receiving almost a third of free-movers. National data indicate that east–west labour mobility continues to dominate south–north flows, but outflows of nationals from recession-hit southern European countries have been steadily increasing. In terms of numbers of EU mobile workers (residing in another EU country), EU Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS) data show that recent EU labour migration is accounted for increasingly by internal EU mobility, which has grown by 22% in the period 2008–2014 (rising from almost 6 million to 7.3 million workers). This coincides with a contraction in the number of non-EU nationals, or third-country nationals, working in the EU in the same period (down by nearly 600,000). This picture is, however, likely to change, with larger numbers of third-country nationals entering the EU from Syria, where the civil war is ongoing, and other Middle East and North African countries, which are in near-constant turmoil following the wave of Arab revolutions in 2011. As for the number of EU mobile workers, these continue to be relatively small; as former EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, László Andor, keen advocate of free movement commented, they are far from suggesting ‘the massive phenomenon’ that is claimed by Eurosceptics. The 7.3 million EU internal migrants who were resident in another EU country in 2014 represent just over 3% of the EU’s total labour force. Germany and the UK are the countries hosting the highest number of EU internal migrants (over 1.7 million in both), but, again, the figures do not indicate mass movements as they account for 5%–6% of the total working population in these countries. Addressing barriers to entry A Special Eurobarometer survey (no. 337) from 2010 found that what keeps intra-EU mobility low is the lack of proficiency in the language of potential destination countries. This impediment was cited by over half of respondents to the survey. On the policy side, although publicly funded language courses are the most commonly available mobility incentive for EU newcomers, they are made available in just 14 Member States. Such incentives are more widely available for third-country nationals as part of integration policies that are largely disconnected from policies supporting labour mobility and therefore do not target EU mobile workers. And yet, integration also concerns EU mobile workers, as demonstrated by the fact that language and cultural issues continue to be the key barriers to labour mobility. According to the Eurobarometer survey, the next most common impediment to intra-EU mobility, cited by 24% of all respondents, is lack of confidence that they would be able to find a job or actual experience of problems finding a job in another country. At EU level, the European Employment Services (EURES) programme with its internet web portal has been enhanced over recent years precisely to address this mobility barrier and to help EU nationals find employment in EU countries other than their own. The European Commission’s new Labour Mobility Package will also focus on how to improve this service. However, European and national data show that informal personal networks such as friends and acquaintances in other countries continue to play a central role in the job search process and are important sources of information about job opportunities in potential destination countries. Good practice example in Germany It will understandably take time before EURES comes to maturity and both employers and job-seekers in the EU become fully aware of the job-matching resources it offers. Nonetheless, EURES has played an important role in facilitating labour mobility in the context of the German MobiPro-EU programme, which was launched in 2013 to attract young unemployed people from other EU countries, particularly Spain, by offering them traineeships and, possibly, openings in the German job market. MobiPro has been a successful undertaking because it directly tackles the financial barriers to mobility by providing financial support and preparatory German language courses in both the sending and the destination countries. There is a lot to learn from such pilot initiatives on how to recruit from abroad and use labour mobility to address pressing labour shortages. Sara Riso [1]  Free movement is the term used by the OECD to cover mobile citizens of the EU who have some basic rights to enter and leave a country within the EU with few restrictions on their movement or duration of stay. Intra-EU mobility refers to EU citizens moving from one Member State to another.   Full publication with references available here   	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/the-thorny-issue-of-labour-mobility-hotly-debated-but-still-a-slow-burner-foundation-focus-december
EUROFOUND_UNK_0209	2015-12-15	UNK	Mobility and migration of healthcare workers in central and eastern Europe / Foundation Focus, December 2015	The internal migration of healthcare professionals from the central and eastern European Member States to ‘older’ Member States is a major concern and is high on the policy agenda in these countries due to the ensuing labour shortages in the sector. The adverse effects have also been recognised at EU level, as highlighted in Eurofound research. Challenges facing healthcare sector A number of challenges for the health and social care sectors, identified by the European Commission’s 2012 Employment Package Towards a job-rich recovery, are specifically applicable to the newest EU Member States (referred to in this article as the EU11 – those central and eastern European countries that most recently joined the EU: the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia (joined in 2004); Bulgaria and Romania (2007); and Croatia (2013) [1]). Among the challenges identified in the package are: ‘an ageing health workforce with insufficient new recruits to replace those who are retiring; the emergence of new healthcare patterns to tackle multiple chronic conditions; the growing use of technologies requiring new skill mixes; and imbalances in skills levels and working patterns’. The package also recognises that demanding working conditions, alongside low and slowly growing wages, can hamper the recruitment and retention of healthcare workers. Moreover, it acknowledges that ‘maintaining an adequate supply and quality of health services under increased budget constraints is both a social and employment challenge’. While the migration of health professionals from central and eastern Europe might be a solution to shortages in western European countries, the question is what solution could there be for the EU11 countries? This is all the more relevant now as those countries that are expected to join the EU within the foreseeable future may face a similar challenge; for example, a high number of health professionals from Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia are already present in Germany. Inflow of third-country nationals The available data, presented both in Eurofound’s 2013 report on mobility and migration of healthcare workers and in other research papers, have shown that the inflow of third-country nationals into most of the central and eastern European countries is marginal. In addition, it is questionable whether policies aimed at attracting health professionals from countries outside the EU could provide a long-term solution. In the case of the EU11, part of any future inflow will inevitably turn into transit migration, with the incoming migrants going onwards to more affluent EU15 countries (the Member States prior to enlargement in 2004). Experiences have already shown such patterns, with Ukrainians and to some extent Belarussians expected to transit through Poland, and Moldovans through Romania. This means that inflow of third-country nationals to the EU11 cannot be a general panacea for the healthcare sector, even if, under special circumstances and in some regions, it can be part of a solution: for example, Estonia has attracted doctors from Russia, while Romania has drawn health professionals from Moldova. Exacerbating problems in health systems At the same time, it has to be acknowledged that the high outflow of health professionals from the central and eastern European Member States has brought to light problems that healthcare systems in these countries have been suffering from for decades: under-resourced hospitals; management problems; rundown facilities, equipment and buildings; overloaded staff with high administrative burdens; low status of nurses; underpaid doctors; negative effects of high sums of informal, out-of-pocket payments. Finding solutions to increased emigration A long-term solution requires dealing with each of the problems at their roots. The countries concerned have no choice but to draw up a long-term strategy to tackle also the current challenges posed by the high emigration of health professionals. Among other matters, the strategy should address issues like the role of private schemes in healthcare provision, as well as the relationship between the newly emerging private actors and public authorities and institutions. At the same time, such a long-term strategy should be designed within the context of wider societal implications. For successful implementation, substantial investment is needed. In this case, EU support could also be a possibility in implementing the strategy. The ultimate aim is to prevent further, deeper division within the healthcare sector across the EU. Klára Fóti [1]  Although Croatia is included in this article, it was not covered in Eurofound’s 2013 report on the subject as it joined the EU after the report was published.   Full publication with references available here 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/mobility-and-migration-of-healthcare-workers-in-central-and-eastern-europe-foundation-focus-december
EUROFOUND_UNK_0210	2015-12-11	UNK	European SMEs – an engine for job creation / Eurofound News, November/December 2015	Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the job-creation engine of Europe, as new research findings from Eurofound demonstrate. In 2014, the 22.3 million SMEs in Europe accounted for 67% of total employment and contributed considerably to job growth. Despite the attention on SMEs by policymakers and researchers, however, little is actually known about the underlying drivers of successful job creation in these companies. In an effort to close this knowledge gap, Eurofound has looked at the main drivers of and barriers to job creation in SMEs across all 28 Member States. The first findings of the research were presented in a résumé at the SME Assembly 2015 on 19 November, a gathering of SMEs and policymakers in Luxembourg under the Luxembourg EU Presidency, organised by the European Commission.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0211	2015-12-11	UNK	Labour mobility in the spotlight / Eurofound News, November/December 2015	The European Commission has been seeking to better support labour mobility, in part through a better coordination of social security systems, an enhanced European Employment Services (EURES) portal and a review of the Posting of Workers Directive, all with a view to achieving a deeper and fairer Internal Market. A labour mobility package was planned for 9 December but has recently been postponed to 2016. Eurofound is supporting this ongoing initiative with a set of publications on these key topics. The Commission has leaned on some of these research findings in its own work. Two new reports from Eurofound will examine key areas related to the theme. One focuses on third-country nationals and how policies related to migration, the labour market and integration are coordinated. The second looks at the social dimension of intra-EU mobility – specifically, its impact on public services. Along with this, a new edition of Eurofound’s Foundation Focus magazine will be published, taking a broad overview of the ever-pertinent theme of mobility and migration. All publications are available on the Agency’s website, at www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/labour-mobility-in-the-spotlight-eurofound-news-novemberdecember-2015

EUROFOUND_UNK_0213	2015-12-11	UNK	A diverse picture of work in Europe / Eurofound News, November/December 2015	Gender segregation remains persistent across the European labour market, younger workers experience greater work intensity and job insecurity, older workers report less access to training, female managers are on the increase while physical risks remain and there are significant differences in job quality across occupations. These are just some of the first findings from Eurofound’s 6th European Working Conditions Survey, which were launched on 24 November at a joint high-level event with the Luxembourg EU Presidency. The findings present a diverse picture of Europe at work over time across countries, occupations, gender and age groups. They underline the complex reality with which Europe’s policymakers are confronted as they seek to build a fair and competitive Europe in an increasingly digitalised global economy. In terms of the progress made in gender equality, the proportion of workers with a female supervisor rose from 24% in 2000 to 33% in 2015; however, this is still much lower than the proportion having a male supervisor.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0216	2015-12-11	UNK	Involving employees in company decision-making / Eurofound News, November/December 2015	A new report from Eurofound examines the use of direct and indirect employee participation in decision-making in European establishments. Indirect employee participation involves employee representatives in decision-making processes, while direct employee participation is the direct interaction between employers and employees. Building on the overview report for Eurofound’s Third European Company Survey (ECS), this report analyses the survey data with a special focus on how direct and indirect employee participation are related to each other and to national-level industrial relations characteristics. Also examined are the effects of direct and indirect employee participation practices on establishment-level outcomes – which practices of employee participation are beneficial both for the establishment and the employees in ‘win–win’ arrangements.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0217	2015-12-10	UNK	Migrants from central and eastern EU Member States access fewer benefits overall than local population	EU mobile citizens from the central and eastern European Member States which joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 (EU10) have a lower take-up of benefits and place a lower burden on public services on the whole than the native population in western European Member States. Overall, EU10 citizens make a positive fiscal contribution to host countries’ economies. This is according to the new report on the ‘Social dimension of intra-EU mobility: Impact on public services', which examines the take-up of benefits and social services of EU10 citizens in nine host countries – Austria, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. The report analyses the use of various social services and benefits by intra-EU migrants and shows that the ‘welfare magnet’ hypothesis - that EU mobile citizens are coming from new EU Member States to older Member States in order to access benefits - is essentially untrue. A significantly lower proportion of EU10 EU mobile citizens are accessing social housing and pensions in host countries than the native population. However, the report highlights that there are certain benefits, such as unemployment or in-work benefits, that EU10 citizens claim more than the native population in most of those countries where such data are available. This is mainly due to the fact that migrant labour is concentrated in sectors such as construction, which were adversely impacted by the economic crisis. Despite the fact that access to certain employment-related benefits was higher in some countries, this appears to be mainly an immediate consequence of the economic crisis, and the gap between the take-up of unemployment benefits by migrant EU10 citizens and the native population may narrow down or even disappear in the foreseeable future. The report also shows that the concentration of migrants in some areas has produced unexpected challenges in certain sectors, most notably in compulsory education for younger children. This is because the demographic profile of EU10 migrants is often different than the local population and they are more likely to access particular services. In this regard a greater knowledge and awareness is required among authorities and public service providers of the requirements of EU-migrants. Local authorities should also be adequately trained to apply rules correctly in complying with the fundamental rights of EU citizens.  The report highlights that the welfare dependency of EU mobile workers is reduced when there is successful integration, and more can be done to improve the integration of EU10 migrants. In particular, more should be done by Member States in order to support language learning among migrants. This would not only help unemployed EU mobile workers to find new jobs in their host countries, it would also help to ease any local tensions that migratory shifts may have caused, as well as help to further disprove false perceptions of welfare tourism, which are not based on the facts.  Download the ‘Social dimension of intra-EU mobility’ report here​ Watch video interview here of Klara Foti, research manager and author of the report, on the main findings   For further information, contact: Måns Mårtensson, Media Manager, on email: mma@eurofound.europa.eu, telephone: +353-1-204 3124, mobile: +353-876-593 507 James Higgins, Promotions Officer, on email: jhi@eurofound.europa.eu, and telephone: +353-1-204 3157 Klara Foti, Research Manager, on email: kfo@eurofound.europa.eu and telephone: +353-204 3142  	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/labour-market-social-policies/migrants-from-central-and-eastern-eu-member-states-access-fewer-benefits-overall-than-local
EUROFOUND_UNK_0218	2015-12-04	UNK	Irish Development Education Association visits Eurofound	On 27 November, young representatives from the Irish Development Education Association (IDEA) visited Eurofound. This was an opportunity for Eurofound to showcase key findings of recent research on the social inclusion of young people and youth employment in Europe, as well as for IDEA to present the results of their research project on ‘Challenging the crisis’. IDEA was set up to promote, support and enhance development education in Ireland and internationally. Eurofound research on young people Research on the Social inclusion of young people shows that young people are the group at highest risk of poverty and social exclusion in the EU. The proportion of young people living with their parents has risen since the crisis, and the rate of those experiencing serious deprivation has increased.  The EU Youth Strategy 2010–2018 aims to create more and equal opportunities for all young people, in education and the labour market, promoting active citizenship, social inclusion and solidarity. This can be enhanced by challenging negative attitudes of professionals towards young people and focusing on opportunities for social and civic engagement.  Research on young people not in employment, education or training (NEETs) finds that spending a protracted period outside the labour market and education may lead to negative social conditions, resulting in a cost for both the individual and society. Young NEETs scored much lower than other age categories for trust in institutions, participation and interest in politics, and social participation.  The EU Youth Guarantee aims to improve the situation for young people, for example through information, counselling and guidance services, outreach programmes, assisting school-to-work transitions, training and work experience placements, vocational education and training and apprenticeships, as well as fostering youth entrepreneurship. But more attention needs to be focused on those young people who are harder to reach and less job-ready.   Challenging the crisis Representatives from IDEA’s Young Global Advocates network presented initial results of the EU-funded project ‘Challenging the crisis’, a three-year development education project that runs until April 2016. It is led by IDEA, with partners in five of the other EU Member States most affected by the economic and financial crisis – Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain.  The survey was led by young people aged 18–30 and carried out among around 2,300 young adults across the six countries on attitudes towards international development and social justice. In light of the high unemployment levels among young people and the risk of social exclusion, the project aims to raise awareness of and support for international sustainable development policies, despite austerity measures at home.  Results show a general lack of confidence among young people in governing bodies and institutions both at national and global level. Young people believe corruption and poor governance are among the main causes of poverty locally and globally. They consider that governments and non-governmental organisations have a large role to play in turning this situation around. Half of young people believe that development aid should increase and 95% want to bring about change in support of global justice. However, youth engagement in civil society activities was found to be quite low.  Now in the third year of the project, the Young Global Advocates have launched a European-wide campaign on Social and Solidarity Economy (SSE), which is an alternative way of understanding the economy, putting people and the environment at the centre. SSE includes traditional forms of cooperatives and mutual associations, fair trade organisations, associations of informal sector workers, social enterprises, and community currency and alternative finance schemes – such as micro finance groups or credit unions. The campaign is three-fold:  raising public awareness; influencing EU policymakers to put SSE on the political and economic agenda and to establish a European Year for SSE; building support for non-governmental organisations and civil society organisations.  The full report will be available soon at www.challengingthecrisis.com/en/youth-report  Support the 'Challenging the crisis' campaign for a European Year for SSE.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/irish-development-education-association-visits-eurofound

EUROFOUND_UNK_0220	2015-11-30	UNK	Changing working conditions in Europe: Moving towards better work -  First findings from Eurofound’s 6th European Working Conditions Survey	On 23-24 November 2015, Eurofound presented the first findings of its 6th European Working Conditions Survey (6th EWCS) at a high-level conference in Luxembourg. The survey’s first findings offer a snapshot of trends in working conditions in the EU, and comparisons across the 28 EU Member States in areas ranging from work-related risks, work and gender, working-time and work organisation, to developing skills at work and lifelong learning. Keynote speakers included Nicolas Schmit, Minister of Labour, Employment and the Social and Solidarity Economy, Luxembourg.  Presentations from the event are now available on the event page. Eurofound’s European Working Conditions Survey series (EWCS) measures working conditions across European countries on a harmonised basis. It analyses relationships between different aspects of working conditions; identifies groups at risks and issues of concern, as well as areas of progress. Since the first survey in 1991, the series monitors trends over time. The European Working Conditions Surveys contribute to European policy development, in particular on quality of work and employment issues. The 6th EWCS is based on over 43,000 face-to-face interviews in 35 European countries.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/changing-working-conditions-in-europe-moving-towards-better-work-first-findings-from-eurofounds-6th
EUROFOUND_UNK_0221	2015-11-24	UNK	Eurofound publishes the first findings of its Sixth European Working Conditions Survey	Press release: Survey shows diverse picture of Europe at work - but with some positive developments Press release:  Most workers are satisfied with their working time (58%), feel supported by their manager (58%) and colleagues (71%) and say their organisation motivates them to give their best job performance (63%). At the same time, while female managers are on the increase, gender segregation remains persistent across the European labour market, younger workers experience greater work intensity and job insecurity, older workers report less access to training, physical risks remain and there are significant differences in job quality across occupations.  These are just some of the first findings from Eurofound’s 6th European Working Conditions Survey which presents a diverse picture of Europe at work over time across countries, occupations, gender and age groups. It underlines the complex reality with which Europe’s policymakers are confronted as they seek to build a fair and competitive Europe in an increasingly digitalised global economy. The 6th EWCS first findings are presented for the first time today at a joint high-level event with the Luxembourg EU Presidency. The survey confirms a differentiated picture on working time:  working hours continue to decrease, numbers working ‘part-time’ have increased and the self-employed work longer hours than employees. While fewer workers are working 48 hours or more, the number of workers working part-time (both 21-34 hours and 20 hours or less per week) have increased over time. While the overall  gender gap has decreased,  it remains significant, with men on average working 39 hours and women 33 hours a week in their main paid job. Overall, women’s working hours are longer when the paid and unpaid working hours are combined. The findings also highlight gender differences as a continuing feature of the European labour market.  While the proportion of employees who report having a female supervisor has increased from 24% in 2000 to 33% in 2015 gender segregation remains a persistent feature with over half of all workers reporting that they share their job title mainly with workers of the same sex as themselves (58% for men, 54% for women). Only one in ten workers (10%) say they are not (very) well informed about the health and safety risks related to the performance of their jobs. Overall, the percentage of workers reporting that their health is at risk because of their work has declined to 23% in 2015 from 31% in 2000. Violence in the workplace, however, can take many different forms and is a major risk for mental health. Almost one in six workers (15%) reports having been subject to adverse social behaviour – such as acts of violence, harassment and unwanted sexual attention – with potentially serious negative consequences for the workers concerned. The proportion of training paid for by the employers has increased over the past decade. Young employees are more likely to learn new skills at work than older workers. Workers over 50 report lower prospect for career advancement and less training opportunities. ’Whether we work to live or live to work, we all spend significant amounts of time at work. ’ says Juan Menéndez-Valdés, Eurofound’s Director. ’How do we feel about work? Do we enjoy it, feel appreciated, secure, and do we have a say in our own work? The sixth European Working Conditions Survey from Eurofound seeks to answer these questions.’ The EWCS is a wide-ranging survey of workers carried out by Eurofound every five years since 1991 and is a unique tool to measure job quality in Europe (and beyond). The survey interviews employees and self-employed workers face-to-face about key issues related to their work and employment. The sixth edition of the EWCS was carried out in 2015 in 35 countries. The EU28 analysis is based on 35,765 interviews. The questionnaire covers employment status, physical and psychosocial risks, time and place of work, work organisation, skills use and development, social relations at work, as well as health and well-being.

The Commissioner will deliver a keynote speech at the celebrations of Eurofound 40th Anniversary in Dublin Castle, an event drawing together current and former Eurofound staff, Directors and deputy Directors, representatives on Eurofound’s Governing Board, Advisory Committees and collaborators, as well as Ged Nash, Irish Minister of State for business and innovation, Ambassadors of EU Member States to Ireland, Members of the European Parliament, and Irish government officials. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/european-commissioner-marianne-thyssen-visits-eurofound
EUROFOUND_UNK_0225	2015-11-23	UNK	Improving company performance by investing in people	European companies are rethinking how they can sustainably secure growth and competitiveness in the wake of the biggest global economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. And this task, hard enough by itself, is happening in the light of long-term developments in demography, mobility and the internationalisation of markets. Eurofound has looked at the innovative ways in which companies combine workplace practices with regard to work organisation, human resource management, direct participation and social dialogue and at how these practices may bring successful (or otherwise) outcomes for companies and workers. Combining workplace practices  The overview report of the third European Company Survey shows that there are multiple approaches associated with better performance and well-being, but the key common dominator between these approaches is the facilitation of direct employee participation. The report examined practices across nine different areas, which are often interlinked. Collaboration and outsourcing in the development, production (or delivery) and marketing of goods and services; Internal organisation and information management: organisation of departments, teamwork, task rotation, information management (knowledge sharing, monitoring quality and monitoring external ideas); Decision-making on daily tasks: autonomous teamwork and employee autonomy in decision-making; Recruitment, employment and career development: employment contracts, performance appraisal, tenure and promotion opportunities; Training: paid time off for training and on-the-job training; Working time flexibility: flexibility in starting and finishing times, accumulation of overtime, part-time work; Variable pay: performance related pay and financial participation; Direct employee participation: Instruments to enable direct employee participation, level of involvement, attitudes towards direct participation; Workplace social dialogue: types of structures, communication with the workforce, resources for the employee representation, information provision, level of involvement, level of influence, trust, industrial action. This revealed five common ways in which the approaches to each of these areas are combined. The largest group of companies (Systematic and involving) combines a top-down approach to decision-making on daily tasks with a highly structured internal organisation, high investment in human resource management (HRM), and extensive use of direct and indirect participation. This group resembles the ‘high performance work systems’ that are widely discussed in both the professional and academic literature and have been observed in previous Eurofound research. This approach to work organisation is characterised by a strong focus on teamwork, flexibility in terms of working time and pay, and investments inarrangements, training and employee participation. The second largest group (Externally oriented) combines high levels of collaboration and out­sourcing with a top-down approach to decision-making on daily tasks, moder­ately structured internal organisation, moderate investment in HRM, and little direct and indirect participation. In a third group (Top-down and internally oriented) top-down decision-making on daily tasks is even more prevalent, and comes along with very little collaboration and outsourcing, a highly structured approach to the internal organisation, moderate investment in HRM, and moderately supported direct and indirect participation. The fourth group (Passive management) also has a top-down approach decision-making on daily tasks, combined with a moderately structured internal organisation, hardly any investment in HRM, and very little direct and indirect participation. This group resembles the ‘traditional or simple organisations’ found in previous research. Finally, the fifth group (Interactive and involving) is the only group that is characterised by a joint approach to decision-making on daily tasks, which is combined with a moderately structured internal organisation, fairly lim­ited investment in HRM, but extensive use of direct participation. Again, we find similarities with an approach discussed in the literature, labelled ‘discretionary learning’. These differ from ‘high performance work systems’ in their less formal organisational structure and stronger emphasis on individual and team autonomy. Associations with performance and well-being The figure shows the average scores for each of these five groups on indicators of establishment (local site) performance and workplace well-being. The ‘Systematic and involving’ and ‘Interactive and involving’ groups both score highest on establishment performance, but the ‘Interactive and involving’ group scores much higher on workplace well-being. The other three groups score below average on both establishment performance and workplace wellbeing. The ‘Passive management’ and ‘Top-down and internally oriented’ groups have the worst scores on performance. The ‘Top-down and internally oriented’ and ‘Externally oriented’ groups score lowest on well-being. Note: The scores on the axes are z-scores indicating a relative difference from the mean (0). Workplace practices are not a panacea. Even in the two most favourable groups only around half of the establishments have an above-average score on both performance and well-being. In the least favourable group (passive management) this is the case for just over a quarter of establishments. This implies that companies should not only look at workplace design, but also at their wider cultural, institutional and socio-economic context, and should try to find the combination of workplace practices that best matches their circumstances. Conclusions The common characteristic of companies that score well on both performance and well-being are their extensive practices for ensuring direct employee participation, supporting the notion that ‘win-win’ arrangements need to include measures to enable optimal use of employees’ knowledge. However, even when these favourable practices are in place, achieving ‘win-win’ outcomes is not guaranteed. Further research is required to investigate how to best match workplace practices with the wider circumstances and characteristics of the establishment. In the meantime, policy makers, social partners and company managers should be encouraged to explore how they can best facilitate the involvement of employees in operational and strategic decision-making. By stimulating and facilitating employees to vocalise and utilise their tacit knowledge managers gain access to a largely untapped resource. Importantly, tapping into this resource does not only improve workplace performance but increases well-being as well.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0226	2015-11-10	UNK	Irish Government signs seat agreement with Eurofound	A Memorandum of Understanding and Seat Agreement between the Government of Ireland and Eurofound was signed today by Dara Murphy, T.D. Minister for European Affairs and Data Protection and Juan Menéndez-Valdés, Director, Eurofound. The agreement underlines the continued high-level support from the Irish Government for Eurofound – the EU Agency mandated to provide comparative research, data and analysis in the areas of social and work-related policies. The event took place at Eurofound’s offices in Loughlinstown, Co Dublin. The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) was established in 1975 by Council Regulation (EEC) no 1365/7. It employs 115 staff in its offices largely centred around the 17th century Loughlinstown House in Dublin, Ireland. Eurofound’s work includes its three pan-European surveys on working conditions, quality of life and company practices. Drawing on its network of correspondents across all Member States also allows Eurofound to complement its in-depth original research with timely comparative information from across the EU. Over its 40 years of existence, Eurofound has worked closely with the Irish Government during its EU Presidencies and in providing relevant research analysis on key issues such as youth unemployment and industrial relations. Eurofound’s work has consistently helped shape the decisions policymakers have made over the last four decades to improve the living and working conditions of all Europeans. Eurofound’s Governing Board comprises 87 members, of whom 84 are appointed on nomination from governments and social partner organisations within the 28 Member States, with three representatives from the European Commission. Eurofound’s tripartite structure underpins all its activities. Eurofound is one of first specialist EU Agencies to be set up by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union to carry out specific legal, technical and scientific tasks in the European Union. The 42 EU Agencies account for 13% of all EU staff and represent 1.5% of the total EU budget. They are an important component of the EU institutional architecture, and add value by providing timely and reliable expertise in specific areas that are critically relevant both to the competitiveness and the job-rich growth of the European Union, as well as to the lives of all Europeans in areas as diverse as medicines, education, chemical safety, justice, security, transport, fundamental rights and the environment.   For further enquiries, contact Mr Måns Mårtensson, Media Manager, on email: mma@eurofound.europa.eu, telephone: +353-1-204 3124, or mobile: +353-876-593 507.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0227	2015-10-28	UNK	Broader policy approaches to the social inclusion of young people	The impact of the economic downturn on young people has been a key topic of the European policy debate in recent years, with particular emphasis on employment. Yet, the adverse impact on young people goes far beyond their employment situation and affects their social inclusion generally. One of the most tangible signs of this is that almost 30% of young people aged 15–29 across EU are now at risk of poverty and social exclusion, the highest risk of any age group. Young people continue to struggle in many aspects of their lives: in making a successful transition from education to employment and more broadly into independent, fulfilling adulthood. Eurofound’s report Social inclusion of young people includes an investigation of initiatives for a broader policy approach to the social inclusion of young people in 11 EU Member States: Belgium, Denmark, France, Greece, Ireland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the UK. Types of policies and measures When looking at the policies and measures countries can put in place to alleviate the problems facing young people and enhance broader social inclusion, it is clear that efforts can be channelled into policies that aim to either strengthen the individual situation of young people or try to address more structural issues. The first set of policies can be categorised as individualising measures that address individual capabilities to cope better with labour market and societal demands. The more structure-oriented policies address the socioeconomic aspects or the institutional set-up of youth transitions or the conditions under which young people enter the labour market and societal life. Individualising measures The individualising measures are considerably more diverse and more visible in Member States in terms of their mechanisms and approach, but nonetheless have a common focus on individual capacity-building, skills development, and access to services and support. Many of the individualising schemes combine elements of training and personal development that might traditionally need to be accessed from multiple sources or be beyond the reach of young people experiencing social exclusion. They include measures to develop life skills, alongside volunteering or work experience gained through community projects. A number of the measures offer alternative education on a more formalised basis, often leading to a qualification, with the elements designed to reinforce and validate prior attainment. Individual action planning is a further core element of these measures, irrespective of their educational or wider personal development focus, with young people empowered to take greater control over shaping their goals, accessing support and reviewing progress. Many of the individualising schemes also include practical help and support to unlock barriers that might otherwise block participation in mainstream opportunities, such as childcare, therapeutic support, or access to housing and finance. Structure-related measures With regard to the structure-related measures, which are less prominent across Member States, there is a cluster of examples concerned with the adjustment of local planning and decision-making structures, to strengthen young people’s participation in democratic life. Other primarily structure-related measures include financial assistance to ‘unlock’ barriers to the social inclusion of young people, and measures to provide professional training and development to build the capacities and competences of adults who interact with young people. Preventive or compensatory measures Another useful way to review policies is to look at whether they are preventive or compensatory in nature. Preventive policies tend to be oriented towards larger populations of young people, and tend to focus on their participation and empowerment rather than addressing specific social problems. Preventive measures can also include actions to challenge negative attitudes towards and perceptions of young people, and the creation of opportunities for civic and social engagement, such as through environmental or community projects. The compensatory measures are more often those targeted at already excluded groups. Analysis shows that the compensatory nature of the measures is quite strongly determined by their intended target groups; for example, young people not in employment, education or training (NEETs), for whom a risky transition has already happened. These types of policies may also address longstanding issues related to ill health. In summary, the actions needed across the cycle from prevention to compensation clearly reflect the level of need or the social disadvantage faced by young people. Improving social inclusion It is essential to call for more attention to be paid at EU level to the social exclusion of young people, beyond the issue of unemployment. In fact, while youth unemployment remains a clear emergency in the EU, evidence shows that many young Europeans are exposed to social exclusion much more broadly – in terms of access to education, access to housing, as well as social and political participation. The report shows that there are indeed policies and measures of a broader nature in place, but much more can be done to mainstream the issue of social inclusion of young people into general EU and Member State policies for social inclusion, employment and access to public services of general interest. Eurofound Research Manager Anna Ludwinek will present the findings of the report at the 9th UNESCO Youth Forum taking place from 26 to 28 October 2015 in Paris. Eurofound’s assessment of the broader policy approaches to the social inclusion of young people across 11 EU Member States features in its recently published report Social inclusion of young people. Chapter 4 of the report presents more detailed findings on policy measures. The 11 country reports are available on demand from Eurofound.

October is particularly busy, with Eurofound hosting a number of meetings in Dublin. On 1–2 October, the web managers of the EU Agencies met, closely followed by a meeting of the heads of communication and information on 7–8 October, and the Agencies’ Performance Development Network on 8–9 October. The directors and the heads of administration of the Agencies will come together on 21–23 October, and on 5–6 November, the EU Agencies Network for Scientific Advice (EU-ANSA) will meet. Since March of this year, Eurofound has been the coordinating Agency in the troika representing the Agencies as a body, together with the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), and the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM), which will take over the coordinating role in March 2016. Eurofound is one of 42 EU Agencies operating in the Member States, which play a key role in delivering EU policies in a wide range of policy areas. A key pillar of the Agency’s coordination of the network is to continue the progress that has been made in implementing a common approach for all the EU Agencies.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/coordination-of-the-eu-agencies-at-eurofound-eurofound-news-october-2015
EUROFOUND_UNK_0231	2015-10-20	UNK	Mapping representation in the construction sector / Eurofound News, October 2015	The construction sector (the largest sector in employment terms in the EU, with nearly 15 million people in declared employment) is the subject of Eurofound’s latest representativeness study. This series of studies, carried out at the request of the European Commission, aims to identify the representative social partner organisations to be consulted under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. As well as identifying the most important EU-wide representatives of employees and employers in construction, the study outlines some of the sector’s key characteristics. The recession of 2007–2008 hit the sector hard, due in part to a halt in access to credit. The sector also faces a number of structural problems: the most pressing appear to be a shortage of skilled workers, unattractive working conditions and a high incidence of undeclared work.

A clear positive association is apparent between the levels of trust that employee representatives have in management, and management has in the employee representation; this implies that trust is likely to be mutual. The exceptions are Austria – where average levels of trust in employee representation are high and average levels of trust in management are low – and Cyprus, Hungary and Italy, where the reverse pattern is found. Where mutual trust is low, industrial action is found to be more prevalent.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/node/85000
EUROFOUND_UNK_0233	2015-10-20	UNK	Wage moderation more likely in centralised bargaining / Eurofound News, October 2015	In the EU, around two-thirds of workers are covered by some form of collective agreement. Wage-bargaining regimes across Europe are increasingly under pressure to become more flexible – flexibility here meaning moving from more centralised forms of bargaining (at national or sectoral level) to decentralised forms (at the company level). The goal of this is to keep pay rises in line with productivity, hence securing the competitiveness of European businesses. However, research just published by Eurofound finds that wage moderation is more likely to occur when bargaining is centralised and coordinated across the economy. The reason, suggests the research, is that high levels of employment are a goal of centralised bargaining systems, one not shared by uncoordinated bargaining taking place at company level. Read Pay in Europe in different wage-bargaining regimes at http://bit.ly/1KVSayD	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/wage-moderation-more-likely-in-centralised-bargaining-eurofound-news-october-2015
EUROFOUND_UNK_0234	2015-10-20	UNK	Making a fresh start for social dialogue / Eurofound News, October 2015	A significant transformation has taken place in collective industrial relations in recent years, with a shift towards greater decentralisation, in the context of the growth of service economies and the economic and employment effects of the global financial crisis. Against the background of recent initiatives to relaunch social dialogue involving the European Commission, EU governments and the social partners, Eurofound’s latest issue of Foundation Focus looks at the issue in detail. Entitled Social dialogue: For a competitive, fair and modern Europe, this issue investigates some of the current trends and topics, including patterns of change in industrial relations systems, win–win outcomes for social dialogue in companies, good practice in micro and small companies, developments in European works councils and the role of social dialogue in industrial policy. And in an extensive interview, Head of Unit for Social Dialogue at the Commission’s Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion Directorate-General, David-Pascal Dion, stresses the importance of a joint approach: as he puts it, ‘Only a reinforced partnership of the main European actors can preserve the European project.’ For more, visit http://bit.ly/1OXwGFx	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/making-a-fresh-start-for-social-dialogue-eurofound-news-october-2015
EUROFOUND_UNK_0235	2015-10-20	UNK	Growing role for private sector in delivering public services / Eurofound News, October 2015	Welfare systems – aimed at promoting the well-being of citizens through high levels of social inclusion and protection – are at the heart of the European social model. Up to the 1970s, delivery of public services was almost exclusively the responsibility of the state. Since then, however, many Member States have extended the role of the private sector in delivering public services in pursuit of improved choice, quality and efficiency. A new report from Eurofound, Delivering public services: A greater role for the private sector, looks at the particular experience of private-sector provision of public services in four Member States: Lithuania, Spain, Sweden and the UK. Over recent years, in these countries, the study finds that the outsourcing of services has increased.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0236	2015-10-14	UNK	Social dialogue, tripartitism and bipartism at national level / Foundation Focus, September 2015	Social dialogue – whether conducted through tripartite concertation or bipartite dialogue in the Member States – is concerned with more than just topical issues: it also involves efforts to establish, readapt and revise the system of industrial relations. Eurofound’s most recent comparative analysis of developments in collective bargaining in Europe found that most legislative changes made over the past two decades have in fact bolstered the collective bargaining process (Eurofound, forthcoming). This article – based on contributions from Eurofound’s network of European correspondents – selects the most recent reforms and debates that are currently underway in the EU Member States.[1] Strengthening tripartitism Reforms of the industrial relations system are often made against a background of attempts to resolve deadlocks in concertation. In Lithuania, Malta, Poland and Romania, this has involved reforming the tripartite bodies with a view to strengthening tripartitism. In the Czech Republic, the role of social partners was strengthened after the Czech government, in December 2014, changed the procedural rules for preparing legislation and statutory regulations. Under the new rules, the comments of social partners to draft regulations and guidance will be forwarded to the relevant Deputy Ministers who have proposed the amendments to the legislation; the government’s Legislative Council is obliged to discuss the comments and address possible conflicts. In Poland, following a long-standing stalemate in social dialogue, the deadlock seems to have been overcome. New tripartite bodies – with an increased scope of responsibility – began operations in early 2015. Under draft legislation, it is proposed that a Social Dialogue Council will replace the Tripartite Commission on Social and Economic Affairs. In Malta, a working group has proposed changes in the structure of the tripartite national institution for social dialogue – the Malta Council for Economic and Social Dialogue (MCESD). Its key recommendation was that MCESD should have administrative and financial autonomy. The working group also recommended that MCESD move away from the Ministry for Social Dialogue in order to assert its independence. In Romania, further amendments to the law governing the Economic and Social Council (CES) aim to unlock social dialogue at sectoral level and revive tripartite dialogue through the National Tripartite Committee for Social Dialogue. Another goal is to enforce dialogue within the CES with third parties representing civic society (similar to that operating in the European Economic and Social Committee). In Lithuania, proposals for a new social dialogue model were put forward in December 2014 and presented at the Parliament of the Republic of Lithuania (LRS) in May 2015. Under the new model, the current main national tripartite social dialogue institution, the Tripartite Council of the Republic of Lithuania (LRTT), would be replaced by the National Council. Moreover, the status of employer organisations would be defined by legislation, which should also establish representativeness criteria for social partner organisations, regulate relations between work councils and trade unions, and provide better protection for the leaders of trade unions and works councils. In Luxembourg, after signing a bilateral agreement with employer representatives, and another with trade unions, the Luxembourg government has been encouraging the social partners to revert to the country’s former tradition of tripartite consultation. At the same time, tripartite meetings have been held as part of the framework process of organising the national response to the European Semester. Similar debates have been underway in Finland, focusing on the role of social partners in the traditional tripartite setting. For over a year, the peak-level social partners have been in bilateral negotiations regarding a renewal of the collective bargaining system. In February 2015, the dialogue ended in deadlock due to disagreements on how to avoid illegal strikes. Negotiations to reform the social dialogue structure were expected to continue alongside the developments following the parliamentary election in April 2015. However, the new government, which took office in May, immediately put pressure on the social partners. In a move that is at odds with the Finnish tradition of tripartite consensus, the government has threatened to introduce additional austerity measures if the social partners do not agree to a ‘social contract’ to improve the country’s competitiveness. Reinforcing bipartism In Sweden, social partners have discussed ways to reinforce the bipartite model. On 3 October 2014, the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise (SN) and the Swedish Trade Union Confederation (LO) made a joint declaration to mark the opening of negotiations about how the Swedish model of social dialogue might be revised. Their stated position is that social partners – and not politicians – should continue to be the key actors in regulating working conditions in the Swedish labour market. At the same time, in France, reform of the funding of social dialogue has been proceeding. The Law of 5 March 2014 on Professional Training, Employment and Social Democracy provided for the creation of a new fund to support trade union and employer organisations in ‘their role in the management of bipartite bodies (paritarism) and their participation in the design of public policy’. A decree of 31 January 2015 set out rules for how the fund would operate. Social partners in France have also recently expressed the need to discuss the future of national bargaining more generally, following the breakdown in January of negotiations on modernising social dialogue (on the ‘quality and effectiveness of social dialogue in companies and improving worker representation’). Reforming collective bargaining A new law on the ‘Promotion of collective bargaining autonomy’ came into force in Germany in August 2014, introducing a new mechanism for simplifying the extension of sectoral minimum wage agreements. Previously, a collective agreement could only be declared generally binding if it covered more than 50% of the employees in a sector. Under the new law, the prerequisite for an extension is the condition that it is ‘of public interest’; this will be the case if the agreement is vital for the protection of working conditions in a sector or for combating economic ‘maldevelopment’ – for instance, to prevent wage dumping. In March 2015, the bill on ‘Collective bargaining unity’ (Tarifeinheit) was introduced in parliament, stipulating that if more than one trade union concludes a collective agreement covering the same group of workers, only the agreement of the trade union that has the relative majority of members should be applicable. This has triggered a heated debate on whether the act will impact on the right of small trade unions to conclude applicable agreements and to go on strike.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0237	2015-10-14	UNK	Social dialogue in micro and small companies / Foundation Focus, September 2015	When relaunching social dialogue at a high-level conference in Brussels in March 2015, the European Commission acknowledged the role of social partners – specifically, their active participation and their involvement in all policies. In the EU context, social partners are viewed as an asset that – in respect of the principle of autonomy and subsidiarity – can make a contribution to achieving a safer working environment, more and better jobs, and support for employment and growth. Where do micro and small companies fit into this picture? What are the factors that can lead to the development of good working conditions, a favourable health and safety environment and robust social dialogue in small businesses – and how can this lead to a win–win situation for all involved? The EU Better Regulation and REFIT programme has drawn attention to the environment in which (in particular) small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have to operate. The programmes launched a debate to reflect on whether some elements of directives relating to social dialogue and the involvement of social partners – including on health and safety and information and consultation – are an unnecessary administrative burden.[1] Research lacking Micro and small companies are crucial in terms of Europe’s economic development and job creation: in the period 2002–2010, some 85% of all new jobs created in the EU were in SMEs and nearly six out of ten were micro companies. Given this, it is surprising that very little research has been conducted into social dialogue in these companies as a way of contributing to good working conditions. Findings from Eurofound’s fifth European Working Conditions Survey indicate that micro companies have the highest proportion of workers who report they are ‘not very well’ or ‘not at all well’ informed about health and safety risks; according to national surveys, in workplaces with employee representation structures the workers enjoy better working conditions than where there is no representation (Eurofound, 2012a). Eurofound’s third European Company Survey found that 26% of small establishments had an official employee representation structure and nearly one-third of employee representatives in micro companies said they had no influence on management decisions in the area of occupational safety and health (OSH) (Eurofound, 2015d). Eurofound research into social dialogue in micro and small companies has investigated social dialogue and labour relations in these companies, examined relevant legislative changes at Member State level, identified examples of good practice where social dialogue has worked well and analysed the drivers of success. OSH concerns General workplace representation structures are present in micro and small companies in 22 Member States. Trade union representatives tend to be more prevalent than elected representatives; they also often carry out OSH duties in these companies. Employee representation bodies are often more prevalent in micro or small establishments belonging to a larger company or group, which exercises an ‘invisible’ influence in the type of governance. The work of employee interest representation bodies at company level is extremely demanding: SMEs tend to have a works council chair on a part-time basis and there is a lack of personnel support resources. In many micro and small companies, the manager of the company is responsible for OSH management; as the manager is often not qualified in this area, outside company support has to be brought in. The increased need for external structures of support, information and advice on working conditions over the years may explain the lower identification with health and safety concerns in the company. There are public policies to foster tripartite involvement (with public authorities and social partners) in micro and small companies – in terms of OSH policies, national strategies, sectoral-level safety partnership initiatives (in the construction sector, for instance), or coaching on OSH in the sector. Sectoral-level initiatives can take advantage of the social partners’ greater knowledge of sector-specific situations. Relevant in this context also are the interprofessional training funds for financing the territorial-level training plans of micro and small companies. Company size The study findings confirm that the presence of collective bargaining, company agreements and representation structures increases with the size of the company, but it is very difficult to map the general patterns of quality of social dialogue in micro and small companies. In some instances, the lack of formal structures could be compensated for by direct dialogue between employer and employee: there are some indications that the smaller the company, the more open and confidential the relations between employees and employer. A considerable number of micro and small companies operate outside the established participation model. It should be noted as well that the low level of trade union density and reduced company membership in employer associations is not the best starting point to formalise an operational practice of structured social dialogue. Although it is not good to generalise, it could be stated that micro and small companies contain simultaneously elements of the best and the worst examples of social dialogue. While OSH is one of the most important issues of social dialogue in micro and small companies, such companies frequently have less knowledge and fewer resources to deal with OSH. The research findings indicate in micro and small companies, that less training is offered, there is less knowledge of the role of OSH representatives and there are fewer workplace assessments. Good practice examples The good practice examples reveal that a participatory style of leadership and management applied by the owner/manager, one based on mutual respect, is favourable for the development of social dialogue. Similarly, a type of work organisation based on teamwork, combined with a high degree of autonomy and responsibility for the individual worker, is most conducive to a more cooperative atmosphere based on common interests. Another influencing factor is a company business model and competition strategy based on the quality of products/services and not solely on grounds of competition on the basis of prices and costs. Without doubt, companies face increased competition (in particular from low-cost competitors) but reputation and quality remain winning factors in a market where the consumer has become more critical in their decision-making. These company internal and external factors can influence the development of a sound social dialogue in a win–win strategy. The current trend towards the decentralisation of industrial relations and collective bargaining has affected social dialogue in micro and small companies much more than in larger companies: ultimately, workers could elect to work in companies covered by collective bargaining rather than companies that are not in order to ensure better protection and working conditions for themselves. Good practice is very much shaped by the national industrial relations context and labour relations culture, which can either favour or obstruct social dialogue at company level. In conclusion, working conditions in small businesses are characterised by great variation with industrial relations often taking place in an informal, unstructured way. Putting in place the necessary resources to overcome the difficulties faced by small businesses is crucial in order to gain real improvements in the quality of working conditions and industrial relations. Different actors have to work together to achieve joint interests, arrive at a shared understanding of the expectations of a win–win situation, and foster acceptance, mutual trust and understanding. An open-minded approach on the part of both employers and employees can facilitate a strong and pragmatic orientation towards problem-solving. Making the case that better working conditions through social dialogue can lead to better performance and recognising that the good health of the workforce is also good for business remain a challenge, which all actors – the research world and the social partners – have to address.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0238	2015-10-14	UNK	Building bridges: 20 years of EWCs / Foundation Focus, September 2015	European works councils (EWCs) provide transnational information and consultation mechanisms for employee representatives in multinational companies (MNCs). In organising meetings between central management and employee representatives from the EU Member States in which the companies operate, the EWC builds a bridge between the headquarters where strategic decisions are made and the workplaces where these decisions have a concrete impact on employees. This bridge-building takes place across different cultures, interests and levels. As there are information and consultation mechanisms at European level, and also at workplace level, the way these different levels work together determines their efficiency. Legal framework The information and consultation Directive (94/45/EC) applies to companies that have at least 1,000 employees in the European Economic Area, and 150 or more in at least two EU Member States (European Parliament, 2002). These companies are obliged to establish an EWC or some kind of agreed European mechanism for information and consultation, if employee representatives of at least two EU Member States request this. An EWC is established through negotiations with employee representatives from the MNC’s European operations in a special negotiating body (SNB); this results in an EWC agreement establishing the terms of operation of the EWC. Only when the parties cannot come to such an agreement are the standard rules (the subsidiary requirements) applied. There is no doubt that having the subsidiary requirements in the background boosted the conclusion of voluntary agreements in the years before the entry into force of the national transpositions of the 1994 EWC directive in September 1996. The EWC directive has evolved to become an important instrument of compliance with the European standards and practices shaping the European Social Model. After 10 years of attempts to amend the EWC directive, on 6 May 2009 a recast EWC directive was adopted (2009/38/EC). By June 2016, the European Commission will present a report assessing the implementation of the recast directive. Window of opportunity The period between the adoption of the recast directive in June 2009 and the entry into force of its national transpositions in June 2011 provided a window of opportunity to conclude new EWC agreements, discharging those EWCs and MNCs from the obligations of the recast EWC directive. The window of opportunity aimed to respect the autonomy of the social partners. It did not raise the number of newly established EWCs, as it had done in the period before the entry into force of the national transpositions of the 1994 EWC directive in September 1996. There appear to have been fewer new EWCs established each year since 2009, compared with previous years; the recast EWC directive, however, aims to facilitate the process of establishing new EWCs, by making information on the scope of a company more easily available to local workplace representatives and making local management responsible for disclosing this information in each workplace. In addition, the recast directive has provided for crucial support to SNBs in terms of granting an employee-only preparation meeting for SNB members, training for SNB members, as well as notification of ongoing negotiations to European trade unions and their expert assistance in SNB meetings. A recent report from Eurofound, based on 10 longitudinal case studies, indicates that the window of opportunity did indeed trigger a considerable number of renegotiations of the agreements of existing EWCs (Eurofound, 2015a). There is, however, no evidence that the recast directive made these EWCs more effective within the period of the window of opportunity, since this could have happened before 2009, and also after 2012. It may be that some of the EWCs had no real scope to become more effective, perhaps having already developed beyond the previous legal minimum requirements. This could be due to their having already implemented provisions on the training of EWC members, holding more than one annual plenary meeting or having further fine-tuned their information and consultation mechanisms. The potential impact of the recast directive had thus already occurred in part in these EWCs before it was adopted. As the case studies were based on interviews conducted in 2012, there is no evidence to show the recast directive has had an influence on the development of EWCs after 2012. In any case, the legal developments that clearly influenced EWCs most in terms of their composition, representativeness and functional requirements were the successive enlargements of the EU and the subsequent European expansion of MNCs: these led to an increase in the number of employee representatives from different countries in EWCs. Impact of the crisis None of the cases studied illustrates a direct impact of the crisis in terms of a reduction in EWC activities, such as cancelling or postponing an EWC meeting. EWCs were indirectly affected through company changes that the crisis set in motion. The companies hardest hit by the crisis were those in the financial sector, but substantial changes also occurred in some companies prior to and independently of the crisis. While such restructuring challenged EWCs, it also offered some an opportunity to clarify their information and consultation procedures. As regards other factors, the study investigated whether the size of the MNC’s workforce and the degree of its internationalisation might also have a bearing on the development of EWCs. In terms of the degree of internationalisation, a greater number of companies in an MNC means a greater number of countries from which representatives must be included in the EWC. Regarding workforce size, delegates from countries with smaller workforces do not have the same opportunities as representatives from the home country or from countries with larger workforces to participate in and contribute to the development of the EWC. The study also found that the more internationalised the management decision-making or the smaller the workforce in the MNC’s home country, the greater the level of interest of home-country employee representatives in the EWC’s activities. Opportunities for EWCs to autonomously develop a proper European identity are improved when the key roles on both the management and employee representative sides are given to delegates from countries other than the home country. Certain company characteristics and how these change can influence developments in the composition or functioning of EWCs. However, for the companies in this study, this has been more of an ongoing trend than a result of the recast directive or of the recent crisis. Fine-tuning the parameters Renegotiations of EWC agreements offer the opportunity to fine-tune the parameters of an EWC in terms of its composition, the number of meetings, the duration of the meetings, the internal structure or the role of the select committee. The report shows that the largest potential impact of an agreement renegotiation on the functioning of an EWC can occur when it is triggered by mergers or acquisitions of companies that both have EWCs already. Company changes can also increase the turnover among EWC membership, potentially impeding the development of cooperation, which is central to the effectiveness of the EWC. The research shows that the investment and efforts that employee representatives and management make to develop an EWC depend on how they assess its function. Most of the significant developments in the functioning of the EWCs studied were due to the continuous efforts of committed EWC members to overcome cultural differences, challenge company changes and resolve them through increasing cooperation, building trust and seeking a common understanding of the appropriate ways for the EWC to handle change. As for the management perspective, interesting developments were reported for two companies where a European human resource network was developed in parallel to the EWC. This demonstrates that the efforts made by management and employee representatives to further develop their EWCs can benefit both sides. The practices presented in the EWC case studies in the report are examples of innovative industrial relations practices in a win–win context.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0239	2015-10-14	UNK	‘Only a reinforced partnership of the main European actors can preserve the european project’ / Foundation Focus, September 2015	Interview with David-Pascal Dion Recently appointed Head of Unit for Social Dialogue and Industrial Relations at the European Commission’s Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, David-Pascal Dion discusses the Commission’s firm commitment to strengthening dialogue with social partners across Europe and its role in recent initiatives to reignite social dialogue. Eurofound: Recent research by the Commission and Eurofound has shown that social dialogue came under stress in a number of Member States during the crisis – in particular, in the so-called ‘programme countries’.  What can be done to improve the functioning of social dialogue at Member State level? David-Pascal Dion: Certainly, we have seen that during the later stages of the crisis social dialogue came under strain in many Member States. As also shown in the 2014 edition of Industrial Relations in Europe, the impact has been particularly strong in countries that have received financial assistance. In view of the acute economic pressure, achieving a broad consensus on the necessary reform measures has often proved difficult. Governments have more often taken measures unilaterally. In the framework of the European Semester, the Commission calls for strengthening social partners’ involvement in the design and implementation of policies and reforms at national level. National social partners need a certain degree of capacity to represent their respective interests and to coordinate their work. In a significant number of Member States, more support for capacity-building is needed, while social partners and public authorities from other Member States can usefully share their good practice in a process of mutual learning. The Commission also provides financial support to strengthen industrial relations at national level – in particular, through the European Social Fund. Some voices from among the academic world and the social partners have argued that European social dialogue did not deliver to its full potential in the past. Do you agree? First of all, it should be noted that there is not one single European social dialogue. Social dialogue at the European level is quite varied, with both cross-industry committees and 43 sectoral social dialogue committees that have been active in past decades, delivering a broad range of outcomes including autonomous agreements and agreements that were implemented by Council Directives. However, the Commission agrees that social dialogue at European level could contribute more to addressing the key challenges facing the European labour market and economy. This is why President Juncker has said that he wishes to be ‘the President of social dialogue’ and his Commission has taken these steps to give the social dialogue a fresh start. What steps have been taken so far and what is planned for the ‘renaissance’ of a genuine and effective European social dialogue? Many steps have in fact been taken, and I feel that we have hit the ground running. In the first months of its mandate, this Commission launched the process of the new start for social dialogue with a high-level event that brought together leaders of national social partner organisations from all across Europe.[1] Some 30 years after the launching of European social dialogue by President Delors and four members of the College of Commissioners at Val Duchesse, the new start for social dialogue initiated by President Juncker and four other members of the College highlighted the importance of this process to the Commission. The new start process is organised around two key themes: involvement of social partners in economic governance and support for capacity-building; and the contribution of social partners to policy and law-making. As regards economic governance, the European social partners have already been more closely involved in the discussions during this year’s European Semester. Earlier publication of the country reports allowed the Commission, the national authorities and the employment and social protection committees to engage in an exchange with the social partners before the country-specific recommendations (CSRs) were issued. The March 2015 Employment Guidelines – a document that sets the direction of the coordination of employment policy – emphasise the need for the Member States to closely involve social partners in designing and implementing relevant reforms and policies and to support an improved functioning and effectiveness of social dialogue at national level. The efforts undertaken by Member States in this regard will need to be reflected in next year’s Semester – for instance, in their national reform programmes. The Commission is also keen for the social partners to be more involved in policy and law-making. In consulting the social partners, we want to go beyond the statutory consultation requirements, set out in Articles 154 and 155 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). We have organised dedicated consultation hearings on key employment and social policy dossiers, such as integration of the long-term unemployed or the labour mobility package. But we also wish to involve social partners in areas that do not fall within the employment or social portfolio but that have social and employment impacts – for example, the Investment Plan, the Energy Union, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), the Digital Single Market, and so on. Meetings with EU social partners on these topics have already taken place, including with European Commissioners and Vice-Presidents. Finally, we will continue to look for ways to support and strengthen social dialogue at national level through capacity-building. On 14 October 2015, as part of the ‘Open Days’ in Brussels, we are organising a workshop on the use of EU funds in supporting capacity-building. We will also look into ways to foster mutual learning with a view to further improving the functioning and effectiveness of social dialogue at national level. A more detailed discussion on how to follow up on the new start is taking place in the two Thematic Working Groups dedicated to the two key themes with the participation of social partners representing all levels, representatives of Member States and of the Commission, as well as colleagues from Eurofound. Where do you see a role for Eurofound in this relaunch of the social dialogue process? Eurofound is a key partner in providing input in relation to the new start for social dialogue. With its tripartite structure and extensive expertise in industrial relations research, we count on Eurofound’s support – particularly in terms of delivering on the country-specific information, which we need in the context of the European Semester. I would also underline the importance of the representativeness studies carried out by Eurofound; these are essential to ensure the proper functioning of European social dialogue.[2] Similarly, the recent research done by Eurofound on the concept of representativeness at national and at EU levels will provide useful material to deepen our knowledge and understanding of a key feature of social dialogue. You have recently been appointed Head of Unit for Social Dialogue and Industrial Relations at the European Commission’s Employment Directorate-General. What are the main objectives you would like to achieve in this role? In my previous jobs in DG EMPL [as Head of Unit responsible for Coordination, Planning and Inter-institutional relations and earlier as assistant to successive Directors General], I actually followed several social dialogue files. I have, for instance, vivid memories of a discussion with M. Monti, R. Verrue, J. Monks and P. de Buck on the social dimension in the draft Monti Report on the relaunch of the single market. When I took up my new job – after President Juncker announced that he wanted to be the President of social dialogue – I looked back at the launch of social dialogue, 30 years ago, by President Delors and at all its achievements, including its formal recognition in the EU Treaties. Since 1985, the European landscape has changed dramatically. Globalisation, together with technological, demographic and environmental changes, all imply an adaptation of our European social model. Only a reinforced partnership of the main European actors can preserve the European project. Social partners are key actors to ensure a more equitable and a more efficient social market economy. Not properly involving social partners in the design and implementation of reforms and policies runs the risk of failure and of ineffective and unfair outcomes. Therefore, my main objective with the new start for social dialogue is to place social dialogue (European and national, cross-industry and sectoral, bipartite and tripartite) back at the centre of the discussions and of the solutions for a fairer and more effective European Union. And I hope that, in 30 years’ time, our successors won’t feel the need for a new ‘new start’.  Interview: Christian Welz   [1] The event took place on 5 March 2015 in Brussels.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0240	2015-10-14	UNK	From Val Duchesse to Riga: how to relaunch social dialogue? / Foundation Focus, September 2015	The new European Commission under President Jean-Claude Juncker is committed to relaunching social dialogue: a first step was taken with the organisation of a high-level conference in Brussels on 5 March 2015. The aim of the conference was to discuss concrete ways to strengthen social dialogue with EU cross-industry social partners and their national affiliates. On 21 and 22 April 2015, Ministers for Employment and Social Affairs in Riga again discussed – informally – ways towards a committed, realistic social dialogue. From 1985 onwards, at the initiative of then European Communities President, Jacques Delors, social dialogue took on a more autonomous and bipartite form in the preparatory phase of the Single Market. This fundamental change dates from 31 January 1985, when EU-level social partners met at the château of Val Duchesse in Brussels. It was Delors’ firm conviction that the Single Market programme had to be matched by a social dimension to the European Community; the cornerstone of this Social Europe would be European social dialogue. Thirty years later, many academic experts and EU actors now argue that it could be made more efficient and effective. Towards more autonomy The principle of ‘autonomy of the social partners’ is embedded in most of the legal systems of the EU and has been recognised as one of the general principles of EU law. However, recent Eurofound research has shown that one impact of the crisis on industrial relations has been an increased trend towards unilateral decision-making by governments at the expense of social partners’ autonomy, especially in the public sector (Eurofound, 2013a). EU social partners stress the importance of their collective bargaining autonomy; trade union representatives – in particular – voice their concern about what they perceive as interference by EU institutions in national-level wage determination and wage policy. Society works better if citizens feel that decisions concerning them are taken at the most appropriate level – in line with the principle of subsidiarity. When social partners arrive at common solutions, these often have a better chance of succeeding, because they have more support and are often more realistic. A firmer application of the principle of subsidiarity seems to be the right way to strengthen social dialogue. Greater representativeness and legitimacy Under European social dialogue, management and labour have developed into co-legislators in the social policy field; the representativeness checks that the European Commission carries out are very important in ensuring the legitimacy of the actors in this process. In 2006, Eurofound was mandated by the Commission to assess the representativeness of the European social partners; since then, it has published 38 sectoral studies (and one cross-industry study) in order to underpin the legitimacy of that dialogue. These studies map the relevant EU social partners that should be consulted by the Commission. Need for better linkages Within European social dialogue, the number and scope of policy proposals depend on whether the European Commission considers these initiatives a priority for the EU. The EU’s progress in this field is – in turn – contingent on the degree of support from other EU institutions and Member States, and on the social partners themselves. This is why one commentator famously interpreted European social dialogue as an industrial relations process characterised as ‘bargaining in the shadow of the law’ (Bercusson, 1995). However, the shadow of the law seems to have faded over the past decade – as has the incentive of both sides of industry to engage in effective dialogue. Furthermore, a crucial dimension of social dialogue is the relationship between European-level social partners and their national affiliates: the future of social dialogue at EU level depends on the ability of social partners to increase the flow of information and degree of cooperation between these two. If European social dialogue is to operate fully, the EU and its Member States must support both the dialogue itself and national players in the field of industrial relations. Rebuilding mutual trust Social dialogue is based on discussion and mutual learning. The Val Duchesse process created a dynamic by building up both a relationship of trust between the actors (based on their having better information about each other’s capabilities and intentions) and a commitment to engage in negotiations at EU level. Past interviews with actors with interests at the EU level have shown that ‘learning’ is a key factor in the process. In the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis, it may be time to revisit the spirit of Val Duchesse and rebuild that relationship of trust between the two sides of industry. Closer involvement At EU level, the involvement of the social partners in the European Semester process has improved at the different junctures. The European social partners are now consulted prior to the publication of the Annual Growth Survey (AGS) and the 2015 AGS proposes to further engage with the social partners beforehand and to discuss and receive feedback on emerging trends or topical country-specific issues. Since this year, the country reports are published three months earlier in order to allow for a better discussion of the reports with the social partners and other stakeholders at national level. The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) has discussed the involvement of the social partners and endorsed the Employment Committee (EMCO) guidelines, which could be  followed by the Social Protection Committee (SPC) as well. In a move initiated under the Italian Presidency, the European social partners now participate directly in discussions at the informal meetings of the EU ministers for Employment and Social Affairs. The European social partners have welcomed this recent practice and the dialogue with EMCO and SPC as advisory policy committees for EPSCO. Another innovation within the Semester process is the creation of European Semester Officers – economic policy experts based in the European Commission’s national representation offices in the 28 Member States. Their role is to explain the European Semester and the new economic governance to the various stakeholders, including the social partners, at national level. However, there also seems to be a general consensus among the actors (EU institutions and European social partners) that despite recent progress an even closer involvement of the social partners both in the European and national strands of the European Semester is needed. Social market economy The European social model – of which social dialogue is a central pillar – has been challenged over the course of the crisis. Recent attempts to strengthen the social dimension of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) have addressed some initial design weaknesses to make it fairer, more competitive and capable of promoting growth. On the 30th anniversary of the Val Duchesse conference, both Vice-President of the European Commission Valdis Dombrovskis and Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility Marianne Thyssen reiterated that social dialogue was a prerequisite for a social market economy and crucial to both competitiveness and fairness. The genuine and committed involvement of the social partners is needed for a fresh start to that dialogue.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0241	2015-10-14	UNK	Trust: a key element in effective social dialogue / Foundation Focus, September 2015	How has the crisis impacted on social dialogue in workplaces? Findings from Eurofound’s third European Company Survey show that, despite the crisis, many workplaces in Europe have managed to retain their well-functioning social dialogue practices. In fact, companies where social dialogue is working well report better company performance and overall workplace well-being. However, the research points to a sizeable minority of companies where social dialogue is characterised by a lack of resources, poor trust between management and employee representatives, and relatively high levels of industrial action. Representation structures According to the third European Company Survey, structures for workplace social dialogue are found in only about a third of establishments with 10 or more employees in the EU28: just 32% of establishments have an official structure for employee representation, and 26% of establishments are a member of an employers’ organisation, or part of a company that is (Eurofound, 2015d). In this respect, differences between countries are huge. The Nordic countries have relatively high levels of organisation of both labour and capital (generally, it is found that higher levels of organisation of workers coincides with higher levels of organisation of employers). However, and worryingly, in a relatively large group of countries – including the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Malta and the UK – only a small minority of establishments have structures for employee representation and are members of employers’ organisations. Size differences play a significant role, with small and medium-sized establishments being much less likely to have an official employee representation or to be a member of an employers’ organisation. Collective bargaining coverage The absence of an employee representation at the workplace level does not necessarily mean that the workers in the establishment are entirely unrepresented. Collective bargaining can take place at various levels and higher-level collective bargaining (at the national, sectoral or company level) is likely to impact on the establishment as well. The survey results show that, overall, employees in 67% of establishments are covered by one or more collective wage agreements: 30% of establishments are covered by a company-level collective wage agreement, 29% by a sectoral or regional-level agreement, 23% by a cross-sectoral agreement and 21% by an agreement negotiated for workers in a specific occupation. Employee representatives In establishments where there is a structure for workplace social dialogue, the vast majority of employee representatives report having sufficient time to carry out their duties. Smaller proportions report having received training for their duties (32%) and having access to external advice (37%). As would be expected, given the obligations arising from the Information and Consultation Directive (European Parliament, 2002), a large majority of employee representatives report having received information on the financial situation of the establishment (75%) and on its employment situation (80%). Again, information provision is better in larger establishments, and country differences are quite pronounced. In just over half of all establishments, the employee representation is involved in joint decision-making on important decisions. However, in around one-third of establishments, the employee representation is not involved in, or only informed about, important decisions. Similarly, around half of the employee representatives (52%) report having had at least some influence on the most important decision taken in the establishment in recent years. Some 17% report having a strong influence, leaving 31% not having any influence at all. Relationships of trust In order to capture the degree of trust between management and employee representation, two separate indices were constructed. The ‘Trust in management’ index is based on the employee representative’s assessment of the management’s trustworthiness, their general relationship with management, their perception of the management’s sincerity and whether or not they felt they were treated less favourably because of their position as employee representative. The ‘Trust in employee representation’ index is based on the manager’s assessment of the employee representation’s trustworthiness, their view on whether the involvement of the employee representation is constructive, and whether or not consulting the employee representation in important changes leads to greater staff commitment to the implementation of changes. The figure shows a clear positive association between trust in management and trust in the employee representation, implying that trust is likely to be mutual. news_trust.jpg   The exceptions are Austria – where average levels of trust in employee representation are high and average levels of trust in management are low – and Cyprus, Hungary and Italy, where the reverse pattern is found. Where mutual trust between management and employee representation is low, industrial action is found to be more prevalent. Overall, 16% of employee representatives reported that some type of industrial action had taken place at their establishments in the three years preceding the survey. Towards ‘win-win’ outcomes In order to gain an insight into the way in which practices with regard to social dialogue are combined at the workplace level, establishments were grouped together based on similarities in the resourcing of employee representatives, provision of information, extent of involvement of the employee representation, level of influence of the employee representation, trust in management, trust in the employee representation and industrial action. Four types of establishment were identified. In establishments of the ‘Extensive and trusting’ type (39%), employee representatives are well resourced and highly involved, levels of trust are high, and industrial action is rare. In establishments of the ‘Moderate and trusting’ type (26%), employee representatives are moderately resourced and involvement and influence are limited; nevertheless, levels of trust are high. In establishments of the ‘Extensive and conflictual’ type (25%), employee representatives are well resourced and highly involved and have moderate levels of influence; however, levels of trust are low, and industrial action is relatively prevalent. Finally, in establishments of the ‘Limited and conflictual’ type (10%), employee representatives lack resources and information and have little influence. In addition, levels of trust are low, and industrial action is relatively common. Size of establishment and sector make a difference: the prevalence of the ‘Moderate and trusting’ type increases as establishment size decreases; in contrast, the prevalence of the ‘Extensive and conflictual’ type increases as establishment size increases. The ‘Extensive and trusting’ and ‘Moderate and trusting’ types are more prevalent in the services sectors than in construction, industry and transport. The transport sector stands out with a relatively high proportion of establishments of the ‘Extensive and conflictual’ type. Country differences are large but there is no clear-cut pattern, except that both the conflictual types of social dialogue are much more prevalent in Spain than in the other countries. Establishments of the ‘Extensive and trusting’ type are most likely to achieve ‘win–win’ outcomes, scoring highest in terms of both establishment performance and workplace well-being. Establishments of the ‘Moderate and trusting’ type score slightly lower on performance and well-being than the first type, but these difference are not statistically significant. Both of the types characterised by a conflictual environment score significantly lower in terms of both performance and well-being.   news_performance.jpg Future investment The analyses show that establishments where social dialogue practices are characterised by relatively high levels of mutual trust score better on both establishment performance and workplace well-being. In general, social dialogue practices are more strongly associated with differences in performance and well-being than other workplace practices, such as practices with regard to work organisation and human resource management. However, win–win outcomes are not guaranteed even when favourable practices are in place. Institutions and context matter and the effectiveness of practices depends on the wider conditions in which establishments find themselves. It also should be noted that only a minority of establishments actually have structures for workplace social dialogue in place – and this proportion is likely to have decreased in recent years due to the recession. In this respect, also, country differences are very large. There is no doubt, therefore, that more investment is needed in both the quality and extent of social dialogue at the workplace level.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0242	2015-10-14	UNK	Social partner organisations – the long march towards gender equality / Foundation Focus, September 2015	Despite the almost 60-year-old commitment to the goal, gender equality is far from being achieved in the European Union. The ‘moving targets’ – labour market participation, employment and unemployment rates, and other quantified objectives – do not make attaining gender equality across Europe any easier. Furthermore, there has been, at least in some academic and social circles, an evolution regarding the nature of the measures to be taken, with some experts suggesting that it might be better to shift from women-focused measures to more encompassing ones, addressing the situation of both men and women. Role of social partners Social partners, as with other key actors in society and policymaking positions, have a crucial role to play in improving the overall situation of equality – specifically gender equality, both in society at large and, particularly, at the workplace. As Eurofound’s report on Social partners and gender equality in Europe confirms, national peak-level social partner organisations have been to the fore in promoting gender equality, albeit by focusing more on external actions affecting the labour market and wider society and less on internal structures (Eurofound, 2014c). The message stemming from the EU regulations could not be clearer: social dialogue between the social partners is extremely important for the promotion of equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation.  It is part of the recast Equal Treatment Directive (Directive 2006/54/EC), which consolidates in a single text all the rules and case law of the European Court of Justice relating to equal opportunities and equal treatment for men and women in employment and occupation. This has been followed up by the ongoing commitment shown by the European cross-industry social partners to tackle gender inequality in work and employment. Policy approaches While the issue of persistent segregation in the labour markets is easy to grasp, the main difficulty regarding gender equality is defining the concept, which naturally has implications for the type of policy measures needed to address the issue. Some gender equality measures focus on ‘equality of opportunity’ while others focus on ‘equality of outcomes’. The former see gender equality as part of broader diversity and inclusion strategies with the objective of ensuring equal rights and opportunities for all, irrespective of gender. In the latter, the definition focuses more on the concept of equality of outcomes, where gender equality depends on the comparison of results achieved by women and men (for example, in terms of representation or pay). Nevertheless, social partner organisations do not apply such a clear-cut distinction when devising measures, tending to pursue and implement an amalgam of concepts and policies. Prevailing bargaining regime 2008 and 2013 Focus Aim Policy commitments Equal opportunities Ensuring equal rights and opportunities for all based on merit – ensuring access to the labour market and appropriate skills for women and effective family- friendly legislation – differences between men and women attributed to gender identity acquired over the lifetime and learning experience – male norm remains the standard Equality of outcomes Same results achieved by women and men – supporting special measures to bring women to the levels already reached by men (in pay, for example) – acknowledging that men and women have different contributions in gender-segregated societies – special measures for the advancement of women   Source: Eurofound, 2014c Country differences In terms of the priorities of peak social partner organisations, the research identified three groups of countries. In a handful of countries (Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia and Poland), gender equality is not a stated priority for social partner organisations and therefore no specific commitments have been developed. The remaining Member States are split into two groups: social partner organisations having either ‘relatively well-developed activities’ on gender equality issues (18 countries) and those with ‘unilateral activities’ (6 countries). Interestingly, the group with well-developed activities falls into two categories. In the first, equality issues feature among the strategic objectives of at least one organisation of each side of industry. In the second, the importance given to gender issues extends across all partners: this is the case in Austria, Finland, Ireland, Sweden and the UK. Unilateral activities are mainly developed by trade union organisations. It is worth stressing that, beyond the general level of engagement on gender equality issues (measured, for example, through the Gender Equality Index developed by the European Institute for Gender Equality) and the specific features of different industrial relations systems, the main reason for relatively low levels of activity on gender equality issues is the declining level of importance accorded to those issues since the beginning of the crisis. Despite the general buy-in to the equality principle, it is seen by the social partners as less deserving of prioritisation when more pressing issues, such as the risk of redundancy and policy changes affecting working conditions, are on the agenda. Positive actions There is a growing awareness that promoting gender equality within the social partner organisations themselves can positively affect the shaping of external policies while setting a good example for the wider labour market. Many organisations have a specific body or department responsible for gender issues. This is the case in trade unions in 21 Member States and in employer organisations in seven. These departments, reflecting the importance given to gender equality issues by the organisations, can play a key role in facilitating gender mainstreaming, both within the organisations and in activities related to collective bargaining. In many other cases, social partner organisations (mostly trade unions) have developed and implemented several measures to promote internal gender equality. For example, some organisations have introduced quota systems. Despite being a very controversial measure, the quota systems aim to bring more women into decision-making roles and to balance the participation of men and women in the executive bodies. Trade unions in Austria, Croatia, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the UK have introduced such measures. Some organisations implement gender-awareness training activities on collective bargaining negotiations, social dialogue or policymaking in general. Other organisations, again mainly trade unions, have been introducing family-friendly enhanced policies for their own staff, sometimes even emphasising the family-leave rights of fathers or measures favouring a good work–life balance. The development of handbooks or guidelines is also part of the relatively limited range of activities. Road blocks in the way Nevertheless, there are many hurdles preventing the social partners from achieving a more balanced participation of women and men in decision-making roles and from implementing effective gender equality actions, particularly internally. Apart from scant resources and limited knowledge on how to promote gender equality, social partner organisations face other significant challenges. The removal of de jure barriers to women accessing decision-making positions in social partner organisations has proven insufficient because de facto barriers still exist. A good example of the latter is the lack of commitment and unwillingness to prioritise gender equality issues – often associated with the relatively small representation of women in top positions in the social partner structures. In addition, there is also gender stereotyping in relation to the roles of men and women in social partner organisations: for example, in sectors predominantly occupied by men, it seems more difficult for gender issues to find their way onto the agenda. Other challenges are less visible. While some social partner organisations advocate a gender-neutral approach for policies or programmes to avoid having an unequal (even if unintended) outcome on women and men, internally they continue to accentuate stereotypes regarding the division of roles of women and men in society. The reality is that the top-level decision-making positions in social partner organisations are still predominantly held by men: according to data from the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Justice, women in 2014 held just 15% and 6% respectively of presidential positions in workers’ and employers’ national social partners’ peak organisations (European Commission, 2015b). Moreover, there is a serious risk of thinking that attaining equal representation of women and men at a decision-making level is synonymous with achieving gender equality and consequently overlooking the structures on the ground that could encourage a more balanced participation of men and women. Uphill journey The European Union still has a long way to go on the road towards gender equality. Social partner organisations are important players but certainly not the only ones that must embark on this journey to achieve this goal. Public authorities also have their part to play. Most importantly, all women and men should be invited to undertake this journey, revising their respective roles and contributing to promoting equality.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0243	2015-10-14	UNK	Role of social dialogue in industrial policy / Foundation Focus, September 2015	Financial turmoil and the increasing globalisation of value chains have focused attention on how to stimulate economies across Europe by revitalising industrial policy. However, existing policy instruments need to be aligned to the realities of global competition and evolving technologies. The role of the state in this process is crucial, but it is clear the social partners also have a role to play. What instruments of industrial policy are currently used in Europe? What is the role of social dialogue and of the social partners in shaping them? How can social dialogue play a proactive role in the current landscape of policymaking? Based on findings from a study by Eurofound’s network of European correspondents, a Eurofound report, Role of social dialogue in industrial policies, sought to answer these questions. Its analysis is supplemented by interviews carried out with representatives of both sides of industry in six selected sectors: automotive, defence, food, chemicals, steel, and textiles. Policy framework The Europe 2020 Strategy has an explicit focus on industry and puts forward a modern industrial policy for Europe, calling for close collaboration between different sectoral stakeholders at both European and national level. The 2012 Commission Communication A stronger European industry for growth and economic recovery set out a new approach to the EU’s industrial policy by delineating clear and concrete measures that combine both horizontal and selective policies in a strategic manner. The 2014 Commission Communication For a European industrial renaissance affirms that a strong industrial base is central to the recovery of the European economy and its position in the global market, pointing to the key role of the Member States and other relevant actors in implementing reforms. Focus on recovery, innovation and restructuring Industrial policy appears to have reignited across many EU Member States in the aftermath of the crisis, as a strategy to re-activate growth, create jobs and foster productivity. Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain were shown to have comprehensive industrial policy strategies (with a cross-sectoral focus) to drive recovery from the crisis and bring about innovation and industrial growth. Other countries have introduced horizontal policy initiatives aimed at increasing competitiveness or fostering technological innovation. The industrial policy instruments in place in the Member States can be categorised in two main groups: horizontal or cross-sectoral instruments, and those applicable to selected sectors. The former can be related to specific themes or policy domains, such as training and education, manufacturing and productivity, tax and trade. The latter (targeted or sectoral) industrial policy instruments are aimed at strengthening specific strategic productive sectors and can involve channelling investment in research and development (R&D) into specific technologies or products, creating jobs in the entire value chain, attracting skilled labour in specific sectors, and increasing the technical skills profile of the workforce to meet the needs of strategic sectors. While innovation appears to be a key component of the emerging industrial policy agenda, there is substantial variation in the way this is pursued by Member States. Some national policies include a focus on SMEs (as in the Czech Republic) or a regional dimension, such as Denmark’s regional councils and clusters of companies in Austria and Romania. Restructuring and its effects are often linked with industrial policies. Most of the national examples come from the central and eastern European countries and often include funding from European regional and development funds. An example from Poland illustrates a joint effort by the social partners to put in place a restructuring programme. Degree of involvement   Overall, social partners’ involvement in the industrial policymaking process (particularly that of trade unions) has been quite limited. Examples of consistent and robust involvement in industrial policy emerge from countries belonging to the so-called ‘social partnership regime’ of industrial relations: Austria, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Slovenia. However, during the crisis even the Nordic countries – which usually display high levels of tripartitism in the process of policy development – have seen these arrangements come under pressure. Those countries particularly affected by the sovereign debt crisis demonstrate a very low degree of social partner involvement. In the central and eastern European countries, involvement is mixed: some countries (such as Estonia and Romania) benefit from social partner engagement in the process, leading to robust industrial policy initiatives; others (such as Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia) show limited engagement even when structures are already in place. The study shows that the degree of social partner involvement in industrial policy at national level is influenced by the institutional characteristics of the industrial relations regimes in those countries and is more substantial in the formulation of horizontal policy initiatives than in targeted, sectoral initiatives. With the evolution of the European industrial policy agenda, the number and type of industrial policy instruments initiated at EU level has expanded greatly. Focusing on six sectors at EU level – automotive, defence, food, chemicals, steel and textiles – the study found that innovation policy and R&D are the most widely used instruments. The most encompassing form of social partner involvement is that of high-level groups, essentially multi-stakeholder groups, which overall are favourably viewed by the social partners. Agenda shift In terms of the role of European sectoral social dialogue in industrial policy, it appears that there is a shift in the agenda setting: while training and adapting the skills base and the social consequences of restructuring are still important, other issues such as innovation, access to raw materials, R&D and access to finance have risen higher on the agenda, enlarging the scope of the European sectoral social dialogue committees. Moreover, the social partners have produced joint reports and taken own initiatives on industrial policies, which have facilitated policymaking. Involving the social partners in formulating and implementing policy at both national and European level can harness expertise and experience in labour market, social and industry domains, which in turn can increase the robustness, relevance and timeliness of industrial policy initiatives. Overall, the analysis points to the potentially increased importance of social dialogue in industrial policies, but it also calls for new ways of working for both policymakers and social partners. Harnessing strengths from both sides The study points to the ongoing pressures of globalisation and the economic crisis, which have put social dialogue under strain and created a tendency for governments to decide and implement interventions very quickly, often without properly consulting the social partners. This is particularly evident where sectoral initiatives are taken. For policies to be robust, coherent and effective, national instruments should benefit from the social partners’ industry-specific knowledge and enhance awareness and alignment among social partners and other industry actors. Trade unions can provide important insights into the skills of the labour force, and their involvement will facilitate the commitment of workers to political goals and objectives and help foster innovative approaches from the shop floor up. Employer organisations can bring valuable data and analysis of the dynamics at the policy level. The positive results of European sectoral social dialogue in the sectors examined call for a sharing of that experience among all interested sectors and the use of their outcomes at policymaking level. One way of developing industrial policies so that they address the challenges of globalisation is to introduce a systemic approach that can encompass a variety of instruments and work across sectors. In developing such an approach, the knowledge of the social partners can be crucial – as it is for the implementation of programmes as well. With ambitious social and environmental goals set at EU level and in the face of common problems confronting European industries (not least, scarce natural and energy resources), the coordination of industrial policies at EU and national level can contribute to a true European industrial renaissance.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0244	2015-10-14	UNK	Towards a fresh start for European social dialogue / Foundation Focus, September 2015	‘It would be great if, in ten years’ time, we could already be in the history books for having managed to give a fresh start to social dialogue after the crisis.’Marianne Thyssen, Social Agenda No. 39, December 2014   Collective industrial relations, including social dialogue, have undergone dramatic change over recent decades. This article looks at the current state of play of social dialogue, examines the trend towards further decentralisation in collective bargaining across many countries and assesses the impact of the crisis and the new European economic governance on collective bargaining and wage-setting. Social dialogue in flux The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) establishes and institutionalises social dialogue at EU level on the basis of Articles 154 and 155. A distinction is drawn between cross-industry social dialogue and European sectoral social dialogue, and between tripartite and bipartite social dialogue. In the Laeken Declaration of December 2001, the European social partners clarified the conceptual differences between tripartite concertation, consultation and social dialogue. The topics of bipartite social dialogue derive from the work programmes adopted by the social partners. With regard to agreements concluded by the EU-level social partners, the TFEU distinguishes between agreements implemented by Council decision or by procedures and practices specific to management and labour in the Member States (Article 155 (2)). A key characteristic of the latter, also called ‘autonomous agreements’, is that these texts have to be implemented in accordance with procedures and practices specific to management and labour and the Member States. This governance necessitates a functioning social dialogue at European and national level. Strengthening of the interaction between the European and other levels of social dialogue, effective industrial relations systems and strong social partner capacities at national level are considered crucial for ensuring proper implementation of these agreements (EESC, 2014). Outcomes To date, the European social dialogue has delivered eight cross-industry, one multi-sectoral and 11 sectoral agreements. Parts of academia and EU actors argue that the EU sectoral social dialogue, in particular (which has adopted more than 700 texts in 43 sectors over the past decades, but concluded only 11 agreements), could be rendered more efficient and effective. In total, the number of agreements signed equates to less than 2% of the texts signed in the European social dialogue. The recent controversy about the hairdressers’ agreement has additionally fuelled this debate. The Commission has not taken any decision to date and the social partners in the meantime have announced an initiative to revise the 2012 agreement (Eurofound, 2015b). Collective industrial relations, including social dialogue, have undergone dramatic change over recent decades. Fordist mass-production in industrial economies has given way to more varied production models in predominantly service or knowledge economies. There has been a rise of individualisation in society at large – affecting the self-perception of the workforce and their attitudes towards both their work and the collective institutions which represent their interests. The growth of female employment and changing gender roles have brought new emphasis to issues of work–life balance, care arrangements and working-time patterns as topics for social dialogue. And the flexibility needs of companies and workers have come on to the agenda of social dialogue. Parties involved Taken together, these factors have contributed to at least a partial de-standardisation of employment relations, which has posed a major challenge to the traditional actors in industrial relations: their role has been questioned not only in the practical sense of declining membership strength and organisational density, but in the reduced political acceptance of their role and of the legislative underpinnings of the work they do and the agreements they reach. A number of factors appear to be important for effective social dialogue: the support of the public authorities; the autonomy of the negotiating parties; and the trust between the parties. The support of the public authorities can take very different forms – logistical and technical support for the actors, providing political incentives to the parties to engage in dialogue, and giving legislative support to extend and generalise the outcome of negotiations. Examples of all of these can be found at both European and national level, although recent developments have generally been to restrict or end such support. The autonomy of the negotiating parties is seen by the social partners themselves as of crucial importance and this is reflected in different ways in the various national settings and at European level. Clearly, the European social partners have concerns that some of the procedures of the new European economic governance have undermined their autonomy, and this has implications for the degree of trust among the parties. Past experience has demonstrated, however, that a ‘virtuous’ cycle of interactions between social partners and public authorities is possible, in which bilateral exchange and the interventions of the public authorities bring the negotiating parties to understand that engaging in dialogue offers the best prospects of reaching their goals. Social dialogue in the context of the crisis In the early phase of the crisis (2008–2010), some EU Member States with robust industrial relations systems were in a better position to weather the economic and social impact of the crisis (Eurofound, 2012a). In the second phase of the crisis (2011–2014), however, there were many significant impacts on a range of aspects of industrial relations in the Member States, although in some cases it is hard to disentangle the impact of the crisis from other developments, such as longer-standing national industrial relations trends (or ‘megatrends’). The impact of the crisis has not been even across all groups or sectors. Even in Member States that have emerged relatively unscathed from the crisis, such as Austria, it is reported that the impact has been most severe on young and older workers (Eurofound, 2013b). Move towards decentralisation Another – if not the clearest – result of the Eurofound research has been a multi-country trend towards further decentralisation in collective bargaining (see table). The late Franz Traxler distinguished between ‘organised’ and ‘disorganised’ decentralisation (Traxler, 1995). Organised decentralisation refers to increased company-level bargaining within the framework of rules and standards set by (inter)sectoral agreements, whereas disorganised decentralisation takes place outside such a regulatory framework of bargaining coordination. It could be argued that decentralisation has been in train for some decades now, and that the crisis has merely accelerated the process, owing to the need for more flexibility and more tailoring of agreements to companies’ individual circumstances. The only countries identified with a definite trend towards centralisation have been Finland and, to a limited extent, Belgium. In the Nordic and central-western European industrial relations regimes, decentralisation, if it has happened, has taken place in a more organised manner, whereas in the Member States under macroeconomic adjustment programmes, disorganised decentralisation seems to prevail. In some of the Member States, the combined effect of more unilateral decision-making by governments and decentralisation of collective bargaining has led to less multi-employer bargaining and a drop in collective bargaining coverage. In the central and eastern European industrial relations systems, a drift towards more voluntary and less tripartite or less neo-corporatist structures and processes seems to have taken place (Glassner, 2013). A decentralised national social dialogue also impacts on its European counterpart, especially when it comes to the implementation of autonomous agreements in accordance with the procedures and practices specific to management and labour and the Member States (Article 155(2) TFEU). New social actors Some Member States, particularly those in the most difficult financial circumstances, have seen the emergence of new social movements and industrial relations actors, such as the 15-M movement in Spain. In Greece, recent reforms allow a role for ‘associations of persons’ and many business-level agreements are now being drawn up by these associations established under the provisions of the new rules on collective bargaining. These associations may be created by three-fifths of the workforce at firm level, regardless of the total number of employees in the company and without imposing time limits on the duration of the collective agreements. New social movements and industrial relations actors have also surfaced in Portugal, Romania and Slovenia. news_prevailing.jpg Notes: *Croatia is not included in the ICTWSS, and for 2011 has been coded on the basis of the EurWORK country profile.

Countries that experienced a change in bargaining regime are shown in red. Source: J. Visser, ICTWSS Database, Version 4, 2013; Eurofound, 2014a. Fall in collective bargaining Other paradigmatic change has concerned collective bargaining and its related mechanisms: fewer extension mechanisms, more opt-out and derogation clauses, and less continuation of collective agreements on expiry. Eurofound has identified another dimension of decentralisation through the abolition of the ‘favourability principle’: the reversal of this principle in some Member States now often accords workplace agreements priority over higher-level agreements (Eurofound 2013b; Schulten, 2013). However, some Member States had already made earlier changes to the ‘favourability principle’ (for example, France) or to the introduction or increased use of opening clauses that were not directly linked to the crisis (for example, Germany). Some Member States cater for mechanisms of automatic continuation of collective agreements on expiry – for example, Spain (ultraactividad), Greece (metenergeia) and Portugal (sobrevigencia). These automatic prolongations have been revised in several Member States. A combination of the above changes and the difficult general economic and financial environment led to a drop in the overall volume of bargaining, as well as to the conclusion of agreements of shorter duration, deemed to be more suited to the changing economic climate in uncertain times. It was argued that some of the above changes were necessary to increase the capacity of existing wage-setting arrangements to respond quickly and adequately to these changes. New European economic governance and wage-setting There is considerable variation between Member States in the extent to which wage-setting mechanisms have been subject to change. Change has been concentrated among six Member States whose wage-setting mechanisms have each undergone multiple changes: Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Romania and Spain. In a further four countries, there have been some changes to wage-setting mechanisms: Croatia, Hungary, Italy and Slovenia. Wage-setting mechanisms in a majority of Member States have seen fewer changes since 2008, or none. The reasons for this stability include the relatively muted impact of the crisis in some Member States, the marginal role of collective bargaining to wage-setting in a few Member States and the capacity of existing wage-setting arrangements to respond to abrupt change in economic conditions triggered by the crisis (Eurofound, 2014a; Glassner et al, 2011). Government intervention Some trends in decentralisation, such as the increased use of opening and opt-out clauses, were much more likely to result from negotiations between the social partners than from intervention by governments. Other changes involved clear governmental action and tended to mark a departure from existing arrangements. Government decisions were also to the fore in the changes to minimum wage-setting and indexation mechanisms that have taken place among a wider range of countries. In some Member States, the intervention of governments has recently resulted in an increase of minimum wage protection – for example, Croatia, Germany, Slovakia and Slovenia. While the impact of the memorandums of understanding (MoUs) accompanying the financial assistance programmes on inducing changes to wage-setting mechanisms is clear, the influence of country-specific recommendations (CSRs) under the EU’s new European Semester macroeconomic planning regime is more variable. Nonetheless, as with requirements under the MoUs, a noticeable feature of the CSRs is the emphasis they place on collective wage-setting becoming more decentralised. Scale of adjustment On the question of whether the severity of the impact of the crisis can be linked to industrial relations typologies, a case could be made that Member States in the Mediterranean cluster appear to have changed more than those in the Nordic or central European groups. It is, of course, difficult to disentangle the different threads here: the Member States in which the impact of the crisis has been most severe on industrial relations are also those where the crisis has had the most acute economic impact. The social partners in Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, for example, have had little room for manoeuvre, given the scale of the economic adjustments these countries have had to make. Finally, academic experts argue that the industrial relations systems of Nordic and Central countries contain more potential flexibility for actors and processes (such as opening clauses in collective agreements), enabling them to adapt more readily to changes in the economic environment.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0245	2015-10-14	UNK	Collective bargaining in the 21st century in the EU / Foundation Focus, September 2015	At the heart of industrial relations systems, collective bargaining plays an important role in the functioning of national economies and sectors, as well as in the social fabric of Member States and the European Union. Diversity – in terms of the actors and parties involved in negotiations, rules of procedure, topics on the agenda, outcomes and legal effects of the agreements – is widely acknowledged as one of its key features. Collective bargaining systems and practices in the EU have come under some pressure in recent years, particularly following the financial and economic crisis in 2008. However, apart from a few exceptional cases of stability, many EU Member States were undergoing significant changes in their systems and practices of collective bargaining before the crisis. In addition, even with regard to long-standing, common trends such as decentralisation, these changes differ markedly at national level – in terms of pace, content and coordination and in the role played by the government. Recent research from Eurofound traces major trends and developments in collective bargaining in Europe from the late 1990s to the present. Some of the key findings are outlined here. Acceleration of change There has been a process of steady change in collective bargaining systems since the late 1990s; this has accelerated since 2008, affecting all countries and not just those that experienced the crisis’ most obvious social and labour market effects. In fact, the significant shifts towards more decentralised bargaining systems in many Member States started in a context of relative stability before the crisis, with countries in southern Europe catching up on developments that had already unfolded in other countries. Significantly, while the decentralisation of multilevel bargaining systems and practices in the Nordic countries and western continental Europe had been implemented gradually in a coordinated way – mostly based on tripartite consultation and concertation – before 2008, the shift in countries such as Greece, Portugal, Romania and Spain has been much more abrupt and disorganised, with the changes often imposed unilaterally by governments. Process of fragmentation This process (often described as ‘individualisation’ or ‘fragmentation’) is widespread. It has taken place in those Member States that have introduced more flexibility into their multilevel bargaining processes by implementing mechanisms to allow deviations from sector-level collective bargaining agreements (such as limiting or preventing extension mechanisms or allowing temporary or permanent opt-outs) and to orientate wage negotiation towards company level. Fragmentation also has taken place in countries, such as the central and eastern European Member States, where bargaining processes were predominantly implemented at company level. And it has become a more visible reality in those countries that until the 2008 crisis had resisted the trend. The common trend towards decentralisation and flexibility in collective bargaining processes has not been totally uniform. There have been moves in different – even opposing – directions. To understand these divergent developments, it is important to consider the differences in the point of departure (particularly the degree of flexibility from the company point of view), the organisational strength and influence of key actors, and external pressure (such as unemployment, competition and the financial state of companies). Despite all these asymmetries, however, the underlying trends fundamentally stem from an increasing economic pressure on companies, sectors and countries and the need to adjust labour costs and improve productivity. Growing polarisation The already existing differences between collective bargaining regimes have widened since 2008. These differences arise from distinct industrial relations models: those in which social partners’ organisational strength is comparatively high, social dialogue structures, practices and institutions are stable and influential, and the collective bargaining agenda is broad; and those in which actors, processes and outcomes are weaker. Perhaps the most dramatic indicator of growing discrepancies is to the substantial change in the distribution of collective bargaining coverage rates among countries since the late 1990s. When countries are grouped by degree of coverage, a pattern emerges of growing polarisation between national collective bargaining systems. The group with the highest coverage rate (of more than 80% of the labour force) has remained relatively stable, comprising Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Sweden over the entire period. A second group, with a high rate of coverage of between 60% and 80%, at the end of the 1990s comprised Croatia, Cyprus, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and Romania. This level of coverage has eroded significantly during the period; today, only four countries achieve it: Croatia, Italy, Malta and Portugal. The group of countries with a collective bargaining coverage rate below 40% has experienced the strongest growth in numbers (from six to eleven). In the late 1990s it comprised Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and the UK; it now also comprises Greece, Ireland, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. As a result of this transformation of the collective bargaining landscape, four out of ten employees in the EU today are not covered by collective agreements, as the figure shows.

In addition, the European Semester process, taking place within the framework of European economic governance, has over recent years brought about a paradigm shift away from non-intervention in collective bargaining towards a more proactive EU approach of guiding and recommending reforms that encourage decentralisation and company-level flexibility. Varying patterns of change The table shows the aggregate impact of change on collective bargaining according to a widely known typology, which classifies countries by the nature of their industrial relations system. Although a more detailed assessment may show variance from case to case, what is apparent is the diversity and growing polarisation within the Centre-West, South and Central-East clusters. This diversity is particularly notable, in the Central-East cluster, ranging as it does from countries where stability has prevailed to those where change has had a strong impact. Since the end of the 1990s, three general patterns of change have affected the industrial relations clusters quite differently. Gradual adaptation: This characterises all countries in the North cluster and most in the Centre-West group (apart from Germany), as well as the majority of countries in the South and Central-East clusters. This pattern includes situations as in Finland (with temporary recentralisation activity) and other countries with mixed experiences (Lithuania and Croatia). Accelerated change: This pattern characterises a much smaller group of countries consisting of Germany (with different trends before and after 2008), Portugal and three Central-East countries. Crisis-induced change: This describes an abrupt pattern of change – mainly in terms of decentralisation – in those countries in the South and Central-East clusters (and Ireland) that were most severely hit by the crisis. Challenges ahead According to the views of the national partners consulted, there is a general climate of uncertainty and a growing feeling of standing at a crossroads with regard to the future of collective bargaining. At the same time, it is widely acknowledged that collective bargaining provides a solid foundation for progress and growth in the EU Member States – not only due to its central function of setting wages and working conditions, but also as an intangible value of industrial relations. This shared value builds up mutual trust between actors, eases the settling of labour and industrial disputes, and contributes to general macroeconomic development at national level and to the performance of business. Collective bargaining has been shown to have important potential in increasing sector and company competitiveness and productivity and in enabling business to adapt to global challenges such as technological change. In order to foster this potential in accomplishing the development of the EU single market, policymakers should take action to support collective bargaining as an important asset of the EU social model.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0246	2015-10-14	UNK	Val Duchesse – revisited / Foundation Focus, September 2015	From the Treaty of Paris onwards, it took more than 30 years before the next decisive step was taken to promote Community social policy.  The roots of European social dialogue, strictly speaking, date back to the 1970s, when the Community social partners were consulted on European-level issues on an ad hoc basis. In 1984, under the then French Minister for Employment, Pierre Bérégovoy (France holding the Presidency of the Council of Ministers at the time), the European social partners met three times in a row in Val Duchesse, Belgium, in order to discuss the possible outline of a European social dialogue. The outcome of these first meetings was not very productive. The aspirations of the Union of Industrial and Employers’ Confederations of Europe (UNICE, now BusinessEurope) and the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) with regard to the objectives of the European social dialogue were diametrically opposed. While ETUC was striving to accomplish full-fledged collective agreements, UNICE did not want to go any further than formulating general common orientations. These conflicting positions have not changed much in the course of the development of a more sophisticated European social dialogue. Some observers also blame the failure of the ‘Bérégovoy round’ on the dispersion of the social partners who were invited to the talks. From 1985 onwards, at the initiative of Commission President Jacques Delors, social dialogue took on a more autonomous and bipartite form in the preparatory phase of the Single Market. This fundamental change may be dated to 31 January 1985, when the EU-level social partners were invited to participate in a high-level meeting in Val Duchesse.[1]  In contrast to Bérégovoy, Jacques Delors dispatched invitations only to the General Secretariats of ETUC and UNICE. The goal of the meeting was to reaffirm the importance of the social partners in the European integration process, which had been relaunched with the implementation of the Single Market programme. It was Jacques Delors’ firm conviction that the Single Market programme had to correlate with a social dimension of the European Community: the cornerstone of this social Europe would be the European social dialogue. For the first time, a President of the European Commission took responsibility for uniting the leading social partners by giving them an essential role in the multi-level game of ‘Community chess’. This proved to be the first step in what became known as the Val Duchesse period of dialogue (1985–1993), characterised by bipartite social partner activities consisting mainly of joint opinions, resolutions and declarations. The Val Duchesse I delegation was composed of 39 members: six from the Commission, 18 trade union representatives and 15 employer representatives. UNICE had a stronger preference for EU-level representatives (having seven), whereas ETUC was represented only by its president and the secretary-general (two). Finally, it is interesting to note that all the key Commission actors of the early phase of the Val Duchesse process had a strong trade union background. Delors was a former trade unionist with the French Christian Workers’ Confederation (CFTC); his social affairs adviser Patrick Venturini and François Staedelin – later President of the European Economic and Social Committee and, according to Delors, one of the ‘prime movers’ of the Val Duchesse process – were affiliated with the French Democratic Confederation of Labour (CFDT); and finally, Jean Degimbe, Director-General of DG Employment and Social Affairs, had links with the Belgian Christian trade unions. The social partners agreed to engage in deepening the social dialogue. At a second meeting, on 12 November 1985, they decided to convene two joint working groups: one on macroeconomics; and another on social dialogue and the impact of new technologies. The macroeconomic working group produced a joint opinion on the strategy of cooperation for growth and employment (1986) and a yearly economic report (1987). The social dialogue and new technology working group delivered a joint opinion on the training, motivation, and information and consultation of workers (1987). In contrast to the tripartite conferences, the Val Duchesse process focused on the autonomous bipartite dialogue between the social partners. The national governments were largely eclipsed and the role of the Commission was that of a catalyst and interface between management and labour. The greatest achievement of the Val Duchesse process, however, was the outcome of the negotiations at Maastricht, which produced the 1992 Treaty on the European Union. Most of the substance of the social provisions, which eventually became the Agreement on Social Policy (ASP) between 11 Member States, was the result of negotiations initiated at Val Duchesse and culminating in the agreement dated 31 October 1991 between ETUC and UNICE/CEEP on a new draft of Articles 118(4), 118A and 118B of the Treaty of Rome (now articles 154 and 155 TFEU). With few modifications, the 11 Member States adopted this agreement as the basis for the future labour and social law of the European Union. The social partners’ agreement of 31 October 1991 introduced a fundamental paradigm shift in the Community legislative process of social policy and industrial relations. The ASP instated the EU-level social partners as co-legislators, a role which was formerly reserved for Community institutions. Of the then twelve EU Member States, only the UK rejected the ASP, which gave rise to a twin-track Europe in the field of social policy and industrial relations. On the first track, all twelve Member States would continue to fall under the scope of the commonly revised social provisions of the EC Treaty. On the second track, by agreement from all twelve Member States, eleven Member States could adopt legal acts on social policy and industrial relations based on the ASP, including the new social dialogue process. Despite the installation of a twin-track social Europe, the Protocol on Social Policy should be seen as the culmination of the Val Duchesse process, started in 1985, and as one of the major accomplishments of the former President of the European Commission, Jacques Delors. The election of a Labour Government in the UK in May 1997 led the UK to opt in, and the Treaty of Amsterdam, approved by the European Council on 16 and 17 June 1997, provided for the provisions of the ASP to be incorporated into the EC Treaty (articles 138 and 139 EC), thus terminating the Protocol on Social Policy. According to one commentator, it was mainly the numerous British vetoes in the social policy domain that incited Delors to initiate this alternative approach of policymaking through social dialogue (Bercusson, 1995; Lapeyre, 2015). From the Commission’s point of view, the Val Duchesse process aimed at neutralising opposition from some Member States to a social dimension of the interior market by activating the national and European interest organisations for the common European cause. This argument corroborates the neo-functionalist approach of interpreting the origins of social dialogue as the paradigm of cultivated spill-over – that is, political engineering stemming from the European Commission.[2] At the same time, the Val Duchesse process is also a piece of evidence supporting the theoretical assumption that mutual learning is a key factor in the process of the Europeanisation of industrial relations. The intimate involvement of management and labour in policy networks resulted in a revised definition of interests and preferences. Many of the personalities representing management and labour at Val Duchesse had never met their counterparts from the other Member States before. The Val Duchesse meetings increased the convergence of both sides of industry, which gradually started to acknowledge the usefulness of social partnership. This view is corroborated by Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, the former Secretary General of UNICE, who stated: ‘It is certain that without the learning process provided by the “Joint Opinion” phase, when the Social Partners really got to know and respect each other, the agreement of 31 October 1991 would never have been reached’ (Tyszkiewicz, 1998).

EUROFOUND_UNK_0247	2015-10-06	UNK	Combating youth unemployment in Europe: Lessons learned from early Youth Guarantee implementation	While slight improvements in unemployment numbers have been recorded more recently, almost two-thirds of European Member States continue to experience the highest youth unemployment rates in their history. In countries such as Greece, Spain, Croatia and Italy, more than 40% of young people remain unemployed. Young people’s employment prospects have thus been severely affected by the economic crisis. In an attempt to respond to the youth unemployment crisis, the Council of the European Union recommended the establishment of the Youth Guarantee. Eurofound’s report Social inclusion of young people investigates early implementation of the Youth Guarantee in 10 Member States: Belgium, Bulgaria, Estonia, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Spain and the UK. At the heart of this policy framework lies the aim of presenting all young people up to the age of 25 with a good quality offer of a job, continued education, apprenticeship or traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving education.  Steps towards Youth Guarantee implementation Since the Council Recommendation in 2013, Member States have started implementing the Youth Guarantee in 2014 with the presentation of the national Youth Guarantee Implementation Plans (YGIPs) adapting this policy framework to their national, regional and local requirements. In doing so, Member States have adopted different strategies for implementation based on their institutional set-ups, labour market situation and structural framework conditions. Some countries have chosen a more holistic approach using the Youth Guarantee as a means to improve links between labour market, education and vocational education and training (VET) provisions, as well as youth and social policies more generally. Other countries have chosen to apply a narrower approach predominantly focusing on the labour market dimension. In line with the Council Recommendation, efforts were made to improve stakeholder cooperation and reaching out to young people, and concrete measures were put in place ranging from an increase in information and guidance provision, and activities seeking to smoothen school-to-work transitions, to the encouragement of apprenticeships and youth entrepreneurship.  Challenges for effective roll-out A range of challenges however go hand in hand with the implementation of a major policy framework such as the Youth Guarantee. Major concerns persist over Member States focusing on job-ready young people rather than on those who are hard to reach, as well as the quality and sustainability of opportunities offered under the Youth Guarantee framework. Another challenging aspect is that, besides putting in place immediate measures bringing young people back into education or employment, the Youth Guarantee also entails long-term reforms in order to remove barriers to labour market access faced by Europe’s young people. In addition, a strong evaluation framework is required to ensure effective monitoring of Member States’ Youth Guarantee efforts. Member States have made great efforts in moving to implement the Youth Guarantee, a policy which is unique in terms of how fast it moved from conception to implementation. Although it does not claim to be a one-size-fits-all solution, the added value of the Youth Guarantee lies mainly in the early intervention to kick-start a young person’s further education or career, the fact that it foresees both immediate measures to help young people back into the labour market and more long-term reforms, as well as the provision of a personalised and integrated approach for young people.  Eurofound’s assessment of the first year of Youth Guarantee implementation across 10 EU Member States features in its recently published report on the Social inclusion of young people. Chapter 3 of the report presents more detailed findings on Youth Guarantee implementation. The 10 country reports are available on demand from Eurofound.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0248	2015-09-21	UNK	Ensuring citizens receive social benefits	Across Europe, many people do not receive the social benefits to which they are entitled. Estimates based on a subset of European countries suggest that – for at least one type of benefit – over one-third of those who are entitled to it do not receive it. Non-take-up (or 'non give-out') is an issue for a broad range of benefits and is not restricted to those that are means-tested. A new report from Eurofound, Access to social benefits: Reducing non-take-up, outlines the scale of non-take-up of social benefits across the EU Member States and looks at the reasons why people don't receive the benefits they are entitled to. It goes on to explore how non take-up can be reduced, presenting evidence from case studies in 10 Member States. Role of benefits in European policy The report focuses on those monetary social benefits that support people in vulnerable situations – including benefits related to minimum income, housing, health, old age, heating, children, unemployment, disability and care. Governments put benefits in place for specific reasons, such as preventing poverty or guaranteeing access to basic goods and services, stabilising the economy and including people socially and economically. Clearly, if benefits do not reach the people they are meant for, they fail to fulfil these aims. Reducing non-take-up can also contribute to the Europe 2020 employment targets: some benefits are designed to help citizens integrate into the labour market, for instance. If these benefits are not taken-up, they do not have this desired impact. And reducing non-take-up is in line with the EU’s Social Investment Package: by facilitating access to utilities, food, housing and healthcare, it can prevent greater social and economic costs in the long run. Why do benefits not reach the intended recipients? For a number of reasons, benefits don’t always reach the people they are intended for. Citizens may be unaware of the existence of the benefits or their entitlement to the benefits or do not know how to apply for them. The application process may be too complex or time consuming. Social barriers, including a sense of stigma, can stop citizens applying. A lack of trust in the administering institutions can also be a barrier. Solving the problem Automatic payment of benefits: Ideally, benefits should be paid automatically, with no need for applications. Proactive administrative systems: Proactive administrative systems can notify people who are likely to be entitled to a benefit. This includes informing people when certain life events take place that they have become eligible for a particular benefit; notification would also be helpful when entitlement criteria change. Effective use of ICT systems: Most benefit systems were designed before the widespread use of ICT: rethinking the systems as a whole in the context of ICT can render applications unnecessary or make systems more proactive. Online application procedures can make applications less costly in terms of time and travel, and reduce administrative costs.  Better-targeted information: Simply informing people about benefits and entitlement criteria is not always enough. They may need information about how and where to apply for specific benefits, or active support with the application process. Liaison between key actors: By working together, public administration bodies, local service providers, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), trade unions and employers can support people in taking up their entitlements. If benefits are funded at the national level, local governments have a particular incentive in helping citizens claim their entitlements.  Involvement of providers of paid services: Social housing bodies, utility suppliers, telecoms companies and health insurance providers should know that their clients may be eligible for social benefits they are not claiming. Addressing non-take-up can prevent arrears, disconnection, eviction and loss of insurance.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/ensuring-citizens-receive-social-benefits
EUROFOUND_UNK_0249	2015-09-23	UNK	Stronger focus on social inclusion key to future of Europe’s young people	There is a need for a stronger focus on social inclusion initiatives which go beyond the labour market in order to help all young people to become active members of society, according to Eurofound’s new report Social inclusion of young people launched in the European Parliament today. The report explores the labour market and social perspectives of young people, gives an in-depth analysis of early Youth Guarantee implementation and reviews policies for social inclusion and participation in several Member States, and provides recommendations as to how to improve the levels of social inclusion of young people across the European Union.   Young people are arguably the demographic that has been hit hardest by the recent economic crisis, and their labour market perspectives and social situation have deteriorated sharply in the majority of EU Member States. While there are some cautiously positive developments, almost two-thirds of EU Member States continue to experience the highest youth unemployment rates in their history. In countries such as Greece, Spain, Croatia and Italy more than 40% of young people remain unemployed. The impact of the economic crisis on young people has not only been limited to their opportunities on the labour market. Today, young people are amongst the groups experiencing the highest risk of poverty and social exclusion in the EU. In order to prevent young people from falling through safety nets, the European Union and its Member States have put in place a series of measures including the Youth Guarantee as well as policies tackling social exclusion of youth beyond labour market integration. This report provides a unique analysis of the situation facing young people and the cumulative disadvantages arising from disengagement from the labour market and education. It also explores recent EU strategies aimed at promoting the social inclusion of young people, focusing in particular on the operation of the Youth Guarantee initiative to combat youth unemployment across EU Member States. The Youth Guarantee is a policy framework which derives its added value from early and immediate intervention combined with long-term reforms as well as a personalised and integrated approach for young people. Despite the fact that Member States have made great efforts in rolling out the Youth Guarantee, a range of barriers and challenges to successful implementation persist. Barriers identified include a lack of stakeholder cooperation, low level of funding of the overall scheme as well as a lack of absorption capacity in Member States’ education systems and labour markets. The report finds that while young people can deal relatively well with short spells of unemployment, lasting unemployment or disengagement has a strong negative impact on their future labour market outcomes and their well-being. This can have a large impact on society as a whole, particularly considering changing demographics throughout Europe and an ageing population. The need for major reforms to improve the capacity and capability of public employment services (PES) and to increase the provision of apprenticeships, vocational education and training (VET) and education opportunities has arisen in many countries, as well as the need for more effective partnerships among stakeholders. Broader social inclusion policies identified in the study include community-based measures, with a focus on participation and community development, personalised training and life skills programmes, awareness-raising and advocacy measures with the aim of tackling structural barriers to youth inclusion. Training and capacity building for professionals working with socially excluded young people was identified as one of the key issues to be tackled. The findings point to the conclusion that broader social policy measures   require more support in terms of public investment. Yet, scaling up these initiatives has been challenging due to a general lack of financial stability, as well as a lack of support from public authorities. In addition, more must be done to tailor schemes towards young people who are not job-ready and require extra support before they can be reintegrated into the labour market.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0250	2015-09-24	UNK	Social inclusion of young people a major concern for Europe	Young people who have been disproportionately affected by the crisis are now the group at highest risk of poverty and social exclusion in the EU, as highlighted in Eurofound’s new report Social inclusion of young people. While young people can deal relatively well with short spells of unemployment, long-term unemployment or disengagement has a strong negative impact on their well-being, their future labour market outcomes and society as a whole. The report explores the labour market and social perspectives of young people across the EU, looking at employment-focused initiatives, as well as broader, more holistic approaches aimed at fighting social exclusion of young people. Youth Guarantee: Successes and challenges The Youth Guarantee is a new policy framework at European level largely drawing on the good experience of similar schemes in Austria, Finland and Sweden. Conceived in 2013, the Youth Guarantee aims to provide young people with a good quality offer of a job, continued education, apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving education. The report provides an in-depth analysis of the first year of Youth Guarantee implementation in 10 Member States – Belgium, Bulgaria, Estonia, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Spain and the UK. While Member States have made great efforts in rolling out the Youth Guarantee quickly and adapting it to their needs, the research has identified a number of common challenges to implementing the Youth Guarantee, related to: legal and policy frameworks; partnership approaches; infrastructure of the public employment service (PES) and monitoring and evaluation provisions; provisions for vocational education and training (VET) and absorption capacity of the labour market. The report also shows that during the first year of implementation, given the scale of youth unemployment, some Member States focused more attention on young people who are ‘job-ready’ and likely to be more easily reintegrated in the labour market. Therefore, further initiatives aimed at reaching out to hard-to-reach young people should be designed and implemented. Broader approaches While the Youth Guarantee seeks to intervene quickly and help young people back into the labour market, there are many other policies and measures at EU, Member State and regional level promoting the social inclusion of young people. Going beyond an employment focus, the report discusses broader approaches to support the social inclusion, empowerment and participation of young people. It presents a set of policy measures and good practices aimed at ensuring social inclusion of young people in 11 Member States – Belgium, Denmark, France, Greece, Ireland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the UK. Broader social inclusion policies can be grouped into individualising measures which address individual capabilities to cope with labour market and societal demands, and structure-related measures which address either the socioeconomic aspects or the institutional set-up of youth transitions. Policy measures can also be considered on the basis of whether they are mainly compensatory (repair disadvantage that has already happened) or preventive (prevent development of disadvantage) in nature.  Broader social inclusion policies include those aimed at youth participation, specific policies for disadvantaged groups, and policies for access to services and income support that aim to address to particular needs of specific youth populations. Such measures typically include mentoring, counselling and social support which are important when offering second-chance education opportunities, acknowledging the fact that early school-leaving is caused by a ‘cumulative process of disengagement’ that encompasses different areas of a young person’s family, social and education life. How to improve social inclusion The report provides pointers as to how to improve the levels of social inclusion of young people across the EU. Among these are: to encourage more coordination between employment and social inclusion policies aimed at young people; to strengthen the capacities and capabilities of the PES and the absorption capacity of VET and education systems more broadly; to target more public investment towards broader social policy measures; to tailor schemes towards young people who are not job-ready and require extra support for reintegration. Eurofound research managers Massimiliano Mascherini and Anna Ludwinek presented the report’s findings at the European Parliament on 23 September.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/social-policies/social-inclusion-of-young-people-a-major-concern-for-europe
EUROFOUND_UNK_0251	2015-09-17	UNK	Boosting social inclusion of young people / Eurofound News, September 2015	Since the onset of the economic crisis, the unemployment level among young people has risen sharply, with some Member States having stubbornly high youth unemployment rates. Young people, especially those who are not in employment, education or training, are at the greatest risk of social exclusion – with serious consequences both for the individuals concerned and for society and the economy as a whole. An upcoming report from Eurofound investigates young people’s social inclusion, looking at the disadvantages arising from disengagement from the labour market and education. It explores recent EU strategies aimed at promoting the social inclusion of young people, focusing in particular on the operation of the Youth Guarantee in 10 Member States to combat youth unemployment.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0254	2015-09-17	UNK	Mapping convergence and divergence of job quality / Eurofound News, September 2015	A core objective of EU policy is to improve working conditions and harmonise them across the Member States. Many factors affect job quality and the impact of these can vary between countries, occupations and sectors. As a result, changes in job quality across Europe may be faster in some countries and slower in others, causing job quality to diverge or converge between countries. A recently published report from Eurofound maps the convergence and divergence of job quality across the EU from 1995 to 2010. It examines the statistical significance of trends in key dimensions of job quality – skills and discretion; work risks; work intensity; and working time quality – to provide an up-to-date analysis of changes in job quality across the EU, providing new insights to inform policymaking.

However, there is a need for greater clarity about what policymakers can do to stimulate greater innovation at the workplace. Eurofound’s new report Workplace innovation in European companies provides an understanding of how and why companies put innovation measures in place. The research was conducted in 51 companies identified in Eurofound’s third European Company Survey, all of which had put in place considerable innovation practices. The report found that the primary drivers for introducing innovation practices in an organisation are improved efficiency, greater competitive advantage and enhanced innovative capability. While it is clear that the main reason for introducing workplace innovation is economic and business-related, a majority of practices (69%) target both the goals of enhancing company performance and improving quality of working life.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0256	2015-09-17	UNK	Ensuring citizens claim their rightful benefits / Eurofound News, September 2015	Many people across Europe do not take up the social benefits to which they are entitled – the monetary social benefits that support people in vulnerable situations. The reasons include lack of awareness of specific benefits or of eligibility, complicated application procedures, and stigma. A new report from Eurofound argues that it is often the most vulnerable groups who miss out on much-needed support. While it might be perceived that non-take-up is in fact desirable from a financial point of view, the report argues that such thinking is mistaken: benefits are put in place to achieve specific goals – for example, to prevent poverty or to get people into work. If they do not reach the groups they are aimed at, this represents a failure of policy.Read Access to benefits: Reducing non-take-up at http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/ensuring-citizens-claim-their-rightful-benefits-eurofound-news-september-2015

Eurofound’s stakeholders will be able to top up the EQLS sample size in order to obtain more extensive data to enable a more detailed breakdown and analysis at country level, at their own cost. A sample of, say, 1,000 interviews enables reliable figures for the country as a whole, but it does not readily permit the study of specific sub-samples if the number of respondents is low: for example, the unemployed, users of specific services such as childcare, or people with care responsibilities.

Eurofound’s new report on ‘Workplace innovation in European companies’ provides an understanding of why and how WPI is implemented in companies and organisations. The report will be presented to European social policy-makers and practitioners in Leuven, Belgium today. Workplace innovation (WPI) is a developed and implemented practice or combination of practices which enables employees to participate in organisational change and renewal and hence improve the quality of working life and organisational performance. This report looks at reasons for enabling WPI, adoption and implementation, and impact on organisation and management, employees and employee representatives. The research is based on 51 companies identified in Eurofound’s third European Company Survey (ECS 2013), all with substantial WPI practices. The report found that the primary organisational drivers to introduce WPI practices in European companies are to improve efficiency, gain competitive advantage and enhance innovative capability. While it is clear that the main reason for introducing WPI is economic and business-related, most practices (69%) target both goals of enhancing company performance and improving quality of working life. The report outlines five distinguished types of WPI practices in European companies. Some 14% of the company cases were WPI practices oriented towards the structure of work, for example, job autonomy, teamwork, and employment budget control. 20% are WPI practices oriented towards culture, such communication, consultation and social dialogue. The third type contains practices that combine elements of both orientation and culture. The fourth type cover HR-related practices, which account for 39%, and include personnel recruitment, training, competency development, performance appraisal, working conditions, remuneration, flexibility, and health, risk and safety measures. The last type of intervention, accounting for 8%, are related, to introduction of IT systems or technology. The report also finds that management usually takes the initiative to innovate in work organisation, and the involvement of employees follows quickly in order for any initiative to be successful. ‘We found that workplace innovators seem to naturally align themselves with employee interests, and as a result there are gains for both the organisation as a whole and the employees,’ says Stavroula Demetriades, senior program manager at Eurofound. ‘Those gains can be higher employee engagement, performance, greater learning opportunities, interesting, challenging jobs, and longer term sustainability.’ The authors of the report argue that there is an urgent need for new thinking on how European and national policy can help to shape more productive and healthier workplaces through WPI in much of Europe. As a starting point, it proposes that EU governments and other stakeholders would do well to consider the creation of a ‘Forum on the Workplace of the Future’, with a strong focus on the contribution of worker participation, work organisation and job design in securing innovative, productive and healthy workplaces.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0260	2015-09-11	UNK	Eurofound marks 40th Anniversary at the International Trade Union House	Eurofound marked its 40th anniversary at the International Trade Union House in Brussels on 9 September. The event was part of a series of initiatives to highlight our contribution to EU policy developments in the area of social and work-related policies over the past 40 years. At the event Eurofound Director Juan Menéndez-Valdés and European Trade Union Confederation Deputy General Secretary Józef Niemiec spoke about the shared objectives of Eurofound and the trade union movement in improving working conditions in Europe. Mr Menéndez-Valdés put an emphasis on the fact that, although Europe had changed significantly over the past four decades, common challenges remain in improving the lives of citizens.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/eurofound-marks-40th-anniversary-at-the-international-trade-union-house
EUROFOUND_UNK_0261	2015-07-24	UNK	Are workers staying in jobs for less time?	The view that the ‘job for life’ is a thing of the past is a commonplace. It comes, in part, from the sense that security in employment is decreasing. If employment stability is measured by the amount of time people spend in the same job (job tenure), it implies that tenure should be getting shorter. Is this actually happening?  On the surface, it appears not. The average worker in the EU stays in the same job for 123 months (10.3 years), according to 2012 Eurostat data, up from 116.5 months (9.7 years) in 2002. Part of the reason for this rise in tenure is the economic crisis. Workers became less willing to change jobs and stayed put for longer.  In addition, the crisis destroyed more jobs with short tenure than with long tenure, so in its aftermath, there are more jobs with long tenure. The countries hit especially hard by the crisis (Estonia, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Portugal and Spain) all had considerable increases in average job tenure.  Ageing workforce But that is not the whole story. The growing proportion of older workers in the workforce also had a big influence on rising tenure. Older workers have longer tenure: one further year of tenure is by definition one further year of age. Tenure would have actually decreased by two and a-half months if the age structure of the workforce had remained unchanged, meaning that an underlying trend towards shorter tenure may exist in Europe as a whole. Employment protection There is quite a lot variation across the countries of the EU. The continental European countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) and the Mediterranean countries in general have higher average tenure, while the central and eastern European countries as well as Ireland and the UK have lower tenure. The legal framework protecting employment plays a part in these differences between countries: in general, the stronger the legal protections around employment, the longer tenure is. Ireland and the UK, for instance, protect employment to a lesser extent and have lower tenure. A higher prevalence of temporary contracts and, more generally, labour market flexibility are also linked to lower tenure.  Gender gap Average tenure in the EU as a whole is longer for men than for women, partly because women work more in sectors where tenure is shorter, such as the hotels and restaurants sector. The gap has narrowed since 2002, however, due to the crisis having greater impact on male employment. Further information Much more detail on these findings is available in the Eurofound report Job tenure in turbulent times. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/labour-market/are-workers-staying-in-jobs-for-less-time
EUROFOUND_UNK_0262	2015-08-25	UNK	Low-paid and mid-paid jobs rebound	Employment in the EU increased by around 1.8 million between the second quarters of 2013 and 2014, the largest year-on-year increase since the beginning of the global financial crisis in 2008. Eurofound’s latest research on the nature of the upturn indicates that this rally is in large part due to a recovery in low-to-mid-paid jobs. Between 2008 and 2013, the job destruction caused by the recession was concentrated in mid-paid jobs, mostly as a result of the huge job losses in the manufacturing and construction sectors. This is shown in the first two charts in Figure 1 below, which illustrate the percentage  employment change per annum  across five categories (quintiles) that classify all jobs in the EU from lowest-paying (1) to highest-paying (5). Figure 1: Employment change (% per annum) by wage quintile Note: 1 = low-paid, 2 = mid–low-paid, 3 = mid-paid, 4 = mid–high-paid, 5 = high-paid Employment continued to grow in highest-paying jobs throughout this period. Employment in the lowest-paying jobs also tended to be more resilient than in mid-paid jobs, suffering relatively modest losses.  The most recent data, for 2013–2014 (shown in the third chart above), is something of a break from this pattern in that most of the net new job creation has been in the low-to-mid-paid quintiles. This suggests that there has been a recovery or replacement of jobs previously destroyed as market conditions improve.  Rebound in manufacturing While services continue to account for most of the recent employment growth (more than 7 out of every 10 workers in the EU now work in services), manufacturing employment has shown some increase since the middle of 2013, both in mid-paid technician occupations and in well-paid managerial and administrative roles.  The construction sector, however, continues to shed employment, mainly in the lower quintiles of the wage distribution.   Figure 2: Year‑on‑year employment shifts (in thousands) by wage quintile and broad sector in the EU, 2011–2014 Fastest-growing jobs Of the jobs that employ large numbers of people (at least 500,000), the fastest growing are service sector jobs in the highest-paid quintile, such as ICT professionals in computer programming and business professionals in management consultancies. But other lower-level service jobs, such as personal care workers in various sectors, have also shown fast growth. Fastest-declining jobs As for large-employing jobs showing fast decline, the greatest relative fall in employment was in customer service clerks in financial services, probably reflecting the twin impacts of post-crisis job-cutting and the migration of basic bank-telling functions to the internet.  Three predominantly state-paid jobs also showed fast rates of decline – clerical grades in public administration, personal service workers in education, and cleaners and helpers in health services – reflecting pressures on the public sector pay bill post-2011.  A number of jobs in retail and wholesale are also in this group, suggesting that the replacement of workers by technology is having a strong impact in these sectors, resulting from the spread of self-service and online shopping. It may also relate to the post-crisis rationalisation of retail activity in the EU, evident in the rapid cross-border spread of large discount retailers and the associated decline of smaller retail outlets, as well as the demise of large, traditional retailers such as Woolworths in the UK and Arcandor in Germany. Further detail on Eurofound’s research into recent change in the employment structure can be found in the European Jobs Monitor 2015.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/labour-market-industrial-relations/low-paid-and-mid-paid-jobs-rebound
EUROFOUND_UNK_0263	2015-08-31	UNK	Eurofound publishes its annual ‘Developments in collectively agreed pay’ report	Collectively agreed nominal pay outcomes in 2014 break with the past Collectively agreed nominal pay is the same or lower in almost all of the countries surveyed in 2014 compared to 2013, according to new research from Eurofound. However, lower inflation during the same period resulted in increases in real collectively agreed pay, confirming the return of growth in real terms which had begun in 2013. Eurofound’s report Developments in collectively agreed pay 2014 provides insights into collective wage bargaining outcomes in Europe. This report describes the developments in collectively agreed pay in the EU Member States in 2014 and compares them to developments in previous years, providing an overview of developments since 1999. It also provides details about pay indexation mechanisms, central or major cross-sector agreements and pace-setting agreements that were in effect in 2014, and a summary of public sector wage developments. Eurofound has reported on developments in collectively agreed pay across Europe on an ongoing basis for almost two decades. Fourteen countries have information resources enabling nationwide estimation of collectively agreed pay change. In eight of the 14 countries covered in the report, the 2014 nominal increases were lower than in 2013. Four countries saw similar increases in both years. Germany and the UK were the only countries reporting a considerably higher increase in 2014 than in 2013, with wage increases growing by 0.4 percentage points and 0.5 points respectively. In many countries, the nominal increases after 2010 tend to be lower than in the previous period. For the period between 2012 and 2014, the collectively agreed wage increases tend to get smaller in 10 out of the 14 countries. In real terms, 12 countries reported positive real wage increases in 2014. Finland was the only country where collectively agreed pay growth did not keep up with the growth of prices. EurWORK’s ‘Collective wage bargaining portal’ provides more data on collectively agreed pay in six sectors (metalworking, chemical industries, retail, banking, central public administration and local government).

EUROFOUND_UNK_0264	2015-08-14	UNK	Decline in full-time, permanent jobs	Although employment is on the rebound across Europe, increasing by 1.8 million jobs between mid-2013 and mid-2014, this recovery is not, by and large, based on the creation of full-time, permanent jobs. The traditional, standard employment contract is increasingly being replaced by non-standard or atypical forms of employment – part-time and temporary work, as well as self-employment. This is one finding from the 2015 annual report of the European Jobs Monitor, which looks at employment developments over 2011–2014. The report also shows that permanent, full-time employment is increasingly the privilege of workers in the best-paid jobs. When jobs are categorised by how much they pay, full-time, permanent jobs increased only in the highest pay category and declined in all others (see the figure below). Atypical employment, by contrast, increased in four of the five categories, with significant growth in the top and the bottom categories (of around 500,000 jobs in each). This finding suggests that full-time, permanent employees have been replaced by non-standard workers, especially in low-paid but also in mid-paid jobs. The countries in which non-standard employment has been growing fastest include the four most populous Member States – France, Germany, Italy and the UK – as well as Austria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands.  Growth in part-time work Growth has been particularly strong in part-time jobs, with the number increasing by 2.3 million over the three-year period, while full-time employment fell by 1.7 million. Part-time working has expanded most in the lowest pay category, where the jobs of retail worker, cleaner and helper have shown the greatest growth. But part time also grew more or less evenly across higher-paid categories, which suggests it has become more normal in these jobs too, as has been the case for teaching professionals and health professionals, for example.  The share of part-timers has risen especially sharply in Austria and Germany in recent years, and it has continued to grow in the Netherlands, where in 2014 the number of part-time workers actually overtook the number of full-time workers for the first time.  Part-time employment has also grown in countries where labour market performance has been weaker and the workforce overall has contracted since 2011, such as Cyprus, Greece and Spain. This growth, however, has only partially compensated for the much more substantial decline in full-time employment in the same jobs.  Male part-time rises An emerging pattern since the recession has been the increase in male part-time workers. Four out of five part-time workers in the EU are women, but the net increase in part-time employment in recent years has been much more evenly distributed by gender. Over one million new part-time male workers were added to the EU workforce between 2011 and 2014.     	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/labour-market/decline-in-full-time-permanent-jobs
EUROFOUND_UNK_0265	2015-07-28	UNK	The Youth Guarantee and beyond	Europe’s young people have been exposed to poor labour market prospects in the majority of EU Member States as a consequence of the crisis, leaving the EU with an uphill struggle to reduce unemployment and get young people back into the labour market. Since the Council adopted the Recommendation on establishing a Youth Guarantee in April 2013, Member States have been introducing structural reforms and new employment initiatives for young people, as set out in their Youth Guarantee operational programmes. These steps, with the help of funding from the Youth Employment Initiative and European Social Fund, have contributed to the recent fall in youth unemployment in the EU28. Unemployment rates fall According to Eurostat data, in May 2015, the unemployment rate among young people aged 15–24 was 20.6% in the EU28, a drop of 450,000 or 1.6 percentage points since May 2014 and the lowest level since July 2009. The percentage of young people aged 15–24 who are not in employment, education or training (NEETs) is also down from 13% in 2013 to 12.4% in 2014 in the EU28, the same level recorded in 2009. However, these rates are still extremely high and show that more opportunities need to be found for Europe’s future generations. Despite improvements in 2014–2015 in some Member States, many countries still report their highest youth unemployment rates ever. More than 50% of young people are still unemployed in Greece, more than 40% in Spain, Croatia and Italy, and more than 30% in Cyprus and Portugal. Employment and job creation The Youth Guarantee is an important step in fighting unemployment, and although first results are encouraging, the situation remains critical as 4.7 million young people aged 15–24 in the EU are still out of work (Eurostat data, May 2015). Policymakers recognise that the Youth Guarantee needs to be developed further and policies have to go beyond this framework to tackle social exclusion and bring about inclusive growth. This was evident in the Luxembourg Presidency background note (550 KB PDF) for an informal meeting of Ministers of Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities held in Luxembourg on 16–17 July 2015. The focus of the working lunch of ministers of employment on 16 July was ‘Youth employment and job creation: Youth Guarantee and beyond’. Young people were represented by the European Youth Forum. At the meeting, policymakers were asked to think about two complementary agendas crucial for a competitive Europe and improving access of young people to the labour market: the need to invest in people, via on-the-job training, quality apprenticeships and the Erasmus programme, but now also placing a greater focus on vocational education and training; the need to invest in jobs for young people, via direct job creation, allowing companies to invest in new activities, setting up a structural framework that supports entrepreneurship, offering a wider provision of microfinance for young start-ups and also mentoring. Lessons learned During the session, Eurofound Director Juan Menéndez-Valdés offered some initial lessons learned in the first year of implementation of the Youth Guarantee drawn from research in this area for an upcoming Eurofound report on Social inclusion of young people. He highlighted that early intervention via the Youth Guarantee may limit the potential scarring effect of long-term unemployment on young people. However, during the first year of implementation, given the scale of youth unemployment, some Member States focused more attention on young people who are ‘job-ready’ and likely to be more easily reintegrated in the labour market. Therefore, further initiatives aimed at reaching out to hard-to-reach youth should be designed and implemented. The report is due to be published in autumn 2015.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/the-youth-guarantee-and-beyond
EUROFOUND_UNK_0266	2015-07-21	UNK	Investigating job tenure in turbulent times / Eurofound News, July-August 2015	Ongoing economic change has led to growing concern about decreasing job stability and the disappearance of the ‘job for life’. There is a fear that globalisation and technological progress have reduced job tenure (the length of time a worker has been continuously employed by the same employer). In addition, the recent economic and financial crisis may also have affected job stability. A new report from Eurofound provides a comprehensive picture of the evolution of job tenure between 2002 and 2012. Using data from the European Union Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS), it finds that the wide variations that exist in job tenure between EU Member States are strongly linked to countries’ institutional frameworks – in particular, their employment protection legislation. And how job tenure changes over time is strongly linked to the business cycle, with tenure typically behaving counter-cyclically: despite a mixed picture across countries between 2002 and 2008, average job tenure rose in most countries during the recession as short-tenured jobs were disproportionately destroyed and fewer jobs were created.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0267	2015-07-20	UNK	High-paid jobs showing most growth / Eurofound News, July-August 2015	Since 2013, employment has been rising across Europe, with growth being most pronounced in high-paid jobs, according to the latest annual report from Eurofound’s European Jobs Monitor (EJM). The greatest increase in employment over the three-year period studied (2011–2014) has been in high-paid health professional jobs, while the fastest-growing jobs were for information and communications technology professionals in the computer programming sector (followed by business professionals in management consultancies). As the economic recovery has progressed, employment in low-paid services jobs, such as personal care and personal service workers, has also begun to rise. The proportion of jobs in the middle of the pay spectrum, however – especially jobs in construction – has fallen since the start of the recession and continues to do so. The EJM also confirms a rapid increase in part-time work and finds that more men are working part time than in the past. With a decreasing percentage of European workers in permanent, full-time employment, this employment status is increasingly the privilege of workers in well-paid jobs.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0268	2015-07-17	UNK	Eurofound highlights costs and challenges of gender employment gap in presentation to informal EPSCO meeting today	Preliminary findings from Eurofound's project looking at the challenges and costs of Europe's gender employment gap were presented today to EU Labour Ministers and Ministers for Gender Equality on the second day of the informal EPSCO meeting under the Luxembourg EU Presidency. Increasing labour force participation and raising the employment rate of women is increasingly high on the agenda for Europe, for the individual and for society. In 2014, the employment rate for men across the EU28 was 70.1%; for women it was 59.6% with labour market participation of women varying across Member States, from 41.1% in Greece to 73.1% in Sweden. A gender employment gap exists however in every Member State of the European Union. This has both social and economic implications. Eurofound's current project has evaluated the estimated cost of the current European gender employment gap at more than € 300 billion a year,  with the cost of lifelong exclusion of women estimated at above € 1 million per individual (see presentation by Eurofound's Director).  Final results of this project will be forthcoming in the second part of the year. On this occasion  and based on four decades of work in this area, Eurofound also highlights the wide range of material it has available on gender inequality, including pay and working conditions and on labour market participation of men and women, as well as issues of work-life balance and care responsibilities.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0270	2015-07-03	UNK	Eurofound and the Luxembourg Presidency of the EU	Luxembourg took over the Presidency of the European Council from Latvia on 1 July 2015. The priorities of the Luxembourg Presidency are based on seven pillars: Stimulating investment to boost growth and employment, deepening the European Union's social dimension, managing migration, combining freedom, justice and security, revitalising the single market by focusing on its digital dimension, placing European competitiveness in a global and transparent framework, promoting sustainable development, and strengthening the EU's presence on the global stage. For the next six months, the Luxembourg Presidency aims in particular to make significant progress on deepening the European Union's social dimension: - the Presidency seeks to promote a highly competitive social market economy, which aims at full employment and social progress, as well as of justice and social protection that are enshrined in the Treaties. It will lend its full support to the EC in its efforts to involve the social partners in order to ensure better economic and social governance at the European level. It will also support the EC’s initiatives to fight effectively against all forms of social dumping such as those related to undeclared work. A primary objective in the field of education will be to focus in particular on the provision of schooling and high-quality childcare during early childhood. As for youth, it is necessary to strengthen the political participation of young people and to develop, for that purpose, necessary European synergies. On issues relating to social and work-related policies, Eurofound is cooperating closely with the Luxembourg Presidency. Common priorities include: Job creation – through the daily updating of its restructuring events database, the newly published European Jobs Monitor 2015 report and New forms of employment research. See also our Spotlight on employment in Europe. Early childhood care and education - with new reports on Early childhood care: Accessibility and quality of services and Early childhood care: working conditions, training and quality of services. Youth and employment - with new projects on NEETs and social inclusion of young people in the pipeline and due to reach completion this year. See also our Spotlight on youth.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0272	2015-06-30	UNK	Harnessing the crowd – A new form of employment	A new type of outsourcing has emerged in the past decade thanks to the internet, known variously as crowd employment, crowd working or crowd sourcing. The basic idea is that a client (the ‘employer’) posts a task on an internet platform and selects from a virtual pool of workers who express an interest in doing the task. On some platforms, workers pitch proposals to the client and the client selects from these. The platform manages the relationship between client and worker, charging a fee for its services. In some cases, these services go beyond matching supply and demand to include vetting applicants or supporting clients in drafting their requests. Amazon Mechanical Turk (an offshoot of the US internet retailer Amazon.com) is probably the biggest platform, with 350,000 tasks on offer any point in time. A number of smaller operators have sprung up across Europe, such as Clickworker (Germany), Boblr (Denmark), Lingjob (Lithuania) and Adtriboo.com (Spain). These are still early in their development, but the size of Mechanical Turk’s marketplace for work shows the potential for growth. Micro tasks A lot of crowd employment involves micro tasks – simple, piecemeal, monotonous tasks such as image tagging, data entry, audio transcription and answering surveys. Crowd workers are even paid to ‘like’ products on Facebook. Other platforms offer opportunities to do more substantial and creative work. On Adtriboo.com, the most common tasks advertised include corporate image design, video production and creative writing. This type of work is not covered by labour law. The relationship between the client and the worker is usually based on individual agreement, so pay, working conditions and other issues, notably intellectual property rights, are determined either by the two parties or the terms and conditions of the platform. Low earnings Pay for micro tasks can be extremely low. One survey found that a quarter of the tasks offered on Amazon Mechanical Turk paid $0.01 (€0.007) and that 90% paid less than $0.10 (€0.07). The hourly rate has been estimated at around $2 (€1.44). Workers on Clickworker can earn €200–400 for about 30 hours of work. On the other hand, Boblr offers large-scale projects, with payments ranging from €2,000 to €20,000 and averaging around €6,000. Who does it? Crowd workers in Europe tend to be young, well-educated people who use it as a source of additional income. It offers flexibility – people can pick up work when they choose and work on tasks at home in their free time. Micro tasks typically attract students, unemployed people and workers on parental leave. This is not all about the money. For young professionals starting out, some platforms provide them with an opportunity to showcase their ideas and test the reaction of potential employers. This can be valuable experience, even if they don’t win the competition for a given task. The spread of crowd employment has been hampered by a lack of platforms and uncertainties around the new concept. There is also lack of awareness that such platforms exist; particularly in the start-up phase, word-of-mouth promotion through networks and social media is crucial. However, it is growing fast and could soon in Europe become a common way to get certain types of work done.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0273	2015-06-23	UNK	Rise in exposure to poverty and social exclusion in the EU	The number of people in the EU28 living in poverty or social exclusion in 2013 was up by 4.8 million, compared with 2008 – a total of 122.6 million or almost 1 in 4 Europeans. The EU Social Protection Committee’s (SPC) annual report for 2015, Social Europe – Aiming for inclusive growth, provides an analysis of recent trends in the social situation in the European Union and finds that in some Member States the situation has deteriorated, particularly for young people. Despite quite mixed trends compared with previous years, about a third of Member States still saw significant rises in poverty and social exclusion in 2013. Moreover, the rate of those at risk of poverty or social exclusion has stagnated at a high level. These findings show the EU is struggling to make progress towards its target of lifting at least 20 million people out of poverty and social exclusion by 2020. Eurofound contributed extensively to the section on ‘Social protection and youth exclusion in the EU’, which draws on its research on the social situation of young people, young people not in employment, education or training (NEETs), and quality of life of young people. Social protection and youth exclusion According to the SPC report, the impact of the crisis on young people has weakened their social situation and increased their vulnerability. For instance, the ‘at risk of poverty’ rate is higher among young people than any other age group. Eurofound’s research on the social situation of young people shows that unemployed and inactive young people are more likely than others to feel socially excluded, to feel lonely, to face a lack of social support, and to have lower levels of mental well-being. They are also less likely to trust institutions now than they did in 2007. Quoting Eurofound’s study on NEETs, young people with low levels of education are three times more likely to be NEET than those with tertiary education. Young people with an immigration background are 70% more likely to become NEET than nationals. And young people suffering from some kind of disability or health issue are 40% more likely to be NEET than those in good health. Consequences Unemployment and poverty have long-term consequences for young people, according to Eurofound findings. Those with only lower secondary education, in particular, might have to face frequent spells of unemployment due to lack of skills and work experience and also limited chances to train on the job. Moreover, long-term unemployment and detachment from the labour market, education and training increase the risk of poverty and social exclusion in later life. Eurofound’s Third European Quality of Life Survey shows that in 2011 the lowest levels of perceived social exclusion were found among young people in Denmark, Greece, Austria and Finland and the highest in Cyprus, Greece, Bulgaria and Romania. The SPC report also draws on Eurofound’s forthcoming study on social inclusion of young people, which finds that participating in lifelong non-formal learning activities can be an indicator of inclusion. Around 8.8% of young people aged 15–29 reported taking part is such learning activities in 2012. But vast country differences exist. While around a third of young people took part in non-formal learning activities in Denmark (33.1%) and Sweden (28.6%), less than 1% reported taking part in these activities in Romania and Bulgaria.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0274	2015-06-17	UNK	Living and Working in Europe 2014: Adapting to the realities of an ageing labour market	Older workers have been least affected by job loss since the onset of the economic crisis and have remained in employment at surprisingly high levels in comparison to previous recessions. However, the number of people aged 50-64 who are still at work is still well below the rate for those aged 25-49, and is undermining the Europe 2020 total employment target of 75% employment. This is partly due to the difficulties that older workers face to find new employment when they have lost their jobs, with unemployment after 50 becoming a de-facto early exit from the labour market.  The need to adapt to an ageing labour market is highlighted in the ‘Living and Working in Europe 2014’ report. The report brings together research showing the issues that older workers are currently facing, as well as factors that are impacting their quality of life. Despite a growth in the number of part-time jobs in Europe, the working time of older workers is similar to that as the younger population. Many older workers are opting not to work at all, rather than to work the EU average of 40 hours per week. This means that Europe is losing out on their knowledge, expertise, and economic contribution to society.  Although older people have been relatively safeguarded from the harshest effects of the crisis, they have been disproportionately affected by cuts to healthcare services. Pension contributions are also being increasingly used for broader support for families as the economic crisis has impacted the income of the younger population. Older people are also reporting the lowest levels of well-being and happiness, with a growing gap developing in comparison with the rest of the population in terms of life satisfaction.   For further information see the 'Quality of life, citizens and public services' chapter in the 'Living and Working in Europe 2014' report. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/living-and-working-in-europe-2014-adapting-to-the-realities-of-an-ageing-labour-market

EUROFOUND_UNK_0276	2015-06-15	UNK	Living and Working in Europe 2014: One-fifth of workers in Europe are in poor-quality jobs	 One-fifth of workers are in poor-quality jobs, putting their health at risk and increasing the probability that they will leave the workforce early. This is according to Eurofound’s research in the area of sustainable work, which has been highlighted in the ‘Living and Working in Europe 2014’ report. Ensuring sustainable work, which is the concept of improving the quality of work over the course of people’s lives so that the way they work now does not compromise their capacity to work in the future, is vital to ensure the well-being of people in Europe and to reach the Europe 2020 objective of a high-level of participation in the labour market. As part of its research in the area, Eurofound has developed four indices of job-quality based on characteristics of work that have proven positive or negative on well-being. These are: remuneration; job prospects; the balance between work life and private life; and the working environment. The report shows that work intensity is the most prevalent psychological risk in European workplaces. This is the volume of work and the speed required to carry it out. More than six in ten workers work to tight deadlines and almost the same number work at high speed. Unfavourable working time arrangements are also common, with more than one-third of workers indicating that their working time changes regularly, while more than one in five workers work more than 48 hours per week.  Adverse social behaviour is also prevalent, with more than one in ten workers reporting that they have been subject to verbal abuse. Humiliating or threatening behaviour is less common, with one in twenty workers reporting to have experienced it, and one in fifty workers have reported unwanted sexual attention.  Specific attention needs to be paid to the fact that a large number of workers are in poor-quality jobs if Europe is to make a transition towards more a sustainable labour market. There has been an increase in industrial action since 2008, with almost one in ten private sector establishments experiencing a strike lasting a day or more in the five years following the onset of the economic crisis. Governments, social partners and individual employers must focus on tackling unfavourable working conditions in order to allow employees to participate in the labour market for longer, and in turn improve Europe’s economic and social development.   For further information see the 'Working towards sustainable work’ chapter in the 'Living and Working in Europe 2014' report. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/living-and-working-in-europe-2014-one-fifth-of-workers-in-europe-are-in-poor-quality-jobs
EUROFOUND_UNK_0277	2015-06-12	UNK	Living and Working in Europe 2014: Workplace innovation is instrumental for boosting growth and productivity	Workplace innovation is increasingly recognised as a driver for reaching Europe's goals of smart, inclusive and sustainable growth, resulting in more job creation, developing human capital and boosting productivity. Over half of companies in Europe have instruments in place to enable direct participation of employees. However, employee retention remains an issue in one in ten companies and poor employee motivation is an issue in almost one in five. caplwe-image3-resize1.png These developments in workplace practices are laid out in the new 'Living and Working in Europe 2014' report. The report highlights that the way in which companies organise their work is vital in facilitating innovation, improving performance and ensuring job quality. Maintaining good levels of motivation and productivity are particularly important in a backdrop of a greater number of personal financial challenges and stress brought about by the financial crisis.  Over four in five managers and more than two in three employees in Europe report a good working climate, with higher levels reported in smaller companies. There are also large differences between countries, with a good work climate reported in over 80% of establishments in Bulgaria and Romania, and in fewer than 50% of establishments in France, Hungary, Portugal, Spain and the UK.  Almost nine out of ten companies have structures in place for employee representation; seven out of ten companies actively seek the feedback of employees in decision-making processes, and in six out of ten workplaces employees are involved in joint decision-making with management.  Despite these mechanisms for improving employee representation and retention, four out of ten EU companies have difficulties finding workers with the rights skills. This is particularly problematic considering the economic recession and high levels of unemployment in Europe.  For more information see the 'Win-Win Work Places' chapter in the 'Living and Working in Europe 2014’ report. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/living-and-working-in-europe-2014-workplace-innovation-is-instrumental-for-boosting-growth-and

Although Directive 2003/88/EC sets the maximum average working week at 48 hours (including overtime) as part of the minimum safety and health requirements for the organisation of working time, Article 22(1) provides the option for Member States to opt out from this weekly working limit. The report looks at how Member States make use of the working time opt-out, how widely it is used and what its impacts are on workers and employers. Although national data about its use are limited, the opt-out and long working hours continue to be the subject of heated debates among governments and social partners across the EU.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0280	2015-06-12	UNK	Exploring key messages from Eurofound’s research findings / Eurofound News, June 2015	The Eurofound yearbook 2014 – Living and working in Europe presents the key messages from the Agency’s research over the course of 2014. In terms of employment, the Yearbook shows that the gradual erosion of manufacturing in Europe for over two decades has meant a declining number of jobs in the middle wage stratum. Research in the area of mobility and migration finds that, across the EU, national policy measures to attract workers from other Member States are few. For youth, successful transitions for young people from education into work would appear to depend on the experience of work in the course of education, rapid transitions from school into work and gaining standard employment contracts after leaving education. At the other end of the age scale, for older people, reducing early exit from the labour force is not just a matter of increasing the pension age and prohibiting early retirement. A parallel route should aim to bring working conditions more in line with the needs and aspirations of older workers.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0281	2015-06-10	UNK	Living and Working in Europe 2014:  Europe on a slow road to recovery	 lwe-compressed.jpg Europe is on a slow road to recovery, with job gains and job losses balancing out each other for the first time since the global financial crisis struck. There has been a steady decline in job loss since the second half of 2012, and fewer jobs are being lost due to offshoring, outsourcing or relocation. However, the future is not all bright, as there has been are marked increase in job loss due to bankruptcy or closure, pointing to rising credit constraints for troubled companies. These were some of the findings with regards to employment and developments in the labour market in 2014, as highlighted by the newly released 'Living and Working in Europe 2014' report. Although economic recovery has been slow, and overall decreases in unemployment in Europe have been marginal, the report shows that the labour market has changed significantly in Europe since the crisis. Our labour market is ageing, with employment increasing among the over 45s and decreasing among the under 45s. There has also been a decrease in the number of permanent full-time jobs, with new jobs more likely to be part-time, both in the public and private sectors. Although employment in the public sector has increased by around 4% since 2008, while employment in the EU has declined by 2.6% in the same period, there has been siginificant restructuring in public administration, resulting in a loss of 800,000 net jobs in this area in the period from 2008 to 2013. Manufacturing and construction continue to be the sectors experiencing the most job losses, and as a result men have experienced more job losses than women, further narrowing the gender employment gap. Job losses since the crisis have also been concentrated among those with a low to medium level of educational attainment, however the report highlights that this cannot continue indefinitely as there will most likely be an increase in demand for low-end personal service jobs as our population ages. Finally, although youth unemployment began to gradually decrease in 2014, Europe's young people are now most at risk of poverty and social exclusion. The economic and social gap between young people and those aged 65 widened during the crisis and is continuing to grow as Europe makes its way towards recovery.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0283	2015-05-26	UNK	Celebrating 40 years of contributing to Social Europe	This year marks 40 years for the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound). In a joint event with the European Commission’s Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion on 26 May – the exact day when the Council regulation (EEC) No. 1365/75 established the Agency 40 years ago - Eurofound will celebrate four decades of active contribution to improving the quality of life and working conditions of all Europeans. At the first European Summit of the European Heads of State or Government of the nine Member States of the enlarged European Community in Paris on 19–21 October 1972, it was agreed that ‘that appropriate Community action should be built up on an inter-disciplinary scientific basis and at the same time that employers and workers should be associated in the action undertaken’, to tackle ‘the problems presented by the improvement of living and working conditions in modern society’. In response to this challenge, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions was created by Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75 of the Council of 26 May 1975, to ‘contribute to the planning and establishment of better living and working conditions through action designed to increase and disseminate knowledge likely to assist this development. With this aim in view, the tasks of the Foundation shall be to develop and to pursue ideas on the medium and long term improvement of living and working conditions in the light of practical experience and to identify factors leading to change.’ ‘It is testament to the vision of the European forefathers that in those early years they already saw the need to establish a European Agency with the unique mandate of providing knowledge on social and work-related issues,’ says Juan Menéndez-Valdés, Eurofound’s Director. ‘The goal then was to help policymakers shape a better future for its citizens. Forty years on and now charting 28 countries and 520 million people, the Agency’s role has never been more relevant – continuing to strive to deliver timely, topical and accessible information and analysis to help policymakers shape a better future for us all.’ ‘Eurofound provides invaluable input into the policymaking of the EU to achieve these ambitious goals, and I look forward to working with the Agency as we forge a stronger, dynamic and more equal Union,’ comments Marianne Thyssen, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility. To mark the 40-year anniversary, Michel Servoz, Director-General of the European Commission’s Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (DG EMPL), and Juan Menéndez-Valdés will today open a specially designed 40-year anniversary exhibition in Brussels, Belgium.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0284	2015-06-02	UNK	Partial pension and part-time work	European societies are ageing, with older and shrinking workforces. To maintain competitive economies and to sustain adequate pension systems, a policy priority for European governments and EU policymakers is to increase the employment rates of older people. Often, this requires fresh thinking about age, work and retirement. Working beyond retirement age It has become increasingly common for people to work beyond the age at which they are entitled to a pension. Eurostat’s Labour Force Survey data for 2012 indicate that the biggest take-up rates of working post-retirement since 2005 have been in Finland (+4.9%), the UK (+4.7%), Lithuania (+4.3%), Germany (+3.5%) and Austria (+3.4%). Overall, the employment rate of 65- to 69-year-olds increased by 1.7% in the EU, from 8.8% in 2005 to 10.5% in 2011. Eurofound research on income from work after retirement shows that the reasons for working after retirement go beyond financial need: this group of older workers enjoy the contacts with clients and colleagues and appreciate the opportunities for learning and to contribute to society. When surveyed, many people aged 50+ who are retired, and currently not involved in paid work,  indicated they would actually prefer to be involved in paid employment – this was particularly the case among people who are relatively young  and who have a higher level of education. The research also identified a number of barriers preventing people who have retired, often early, from taking on paid work, such as the limited options to work part time and rigid pension rules. Other barriers can be lack of information and awareness and age barriers encountered, for example, with regard to training. Still working – but less In its recent report on Work preferences after 50, Eurofound found that 45% of workers aged 50+ would prefer to work fewer hours. By facilitating part-time work, it is likely that this group of older people would be able and willing to continue working longer. Part-time work among older workers can lead to a better work–life balance, with time off for activities such as leisure pursuits, caring activities and volunteering. Eurofound’s study on Volunteering by older people in the EU, based on case studies in 11 Member States, demonstrates that engaging in meaningful volunteering activities for an older person can enhance their community involvement and sense of personal fulfilment and avert the risk of social exclusion often experienced by this group. Combining part-time work with a partial pension One way of satisfying the wish to work part time among older workers is to make available the option of combining part-time work with a partial pension. A forthcoming study from Eurofound will document the nature and extent of such measures in the EU and Norway. These include both government measures regarding public pensions and also collective agreements on occupational pensions. Input from Eurofound’s Network of European Correspondents will be combined with evidence from a literature review and data analysis, and potentially backed by case studies from selected Member States.  The research will also map changes that have taken place within countries over the past 10 years, linking them to differences in employment rates among older people, and highlighting examples of good practice. With work ongoing during the course of 2015, it is planned to publish the results in 2016.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/partial-pension-and-part-time-work
EUROFOUND_UNK_0285	2015-05-28	UNK	Service sector workers more likely to experience aggression at work	Workers in the service sectors more often experience violence and harassment in the workplace than workers in other broad sectors such as manufacturing, construction or agriculture. While 14% of EU workers in total report experiencing adverse social behaviour at work – which includes verbal abuse, unwanted sexual attention, threats or humiliating behaviour, physical violence and bullying – the proportion reaches 23% among workers in health and social work. Such behaviour is also more prevalent in the transportation and storage, accommodation and food services, public administration, and education sectors.  Women are subjected to sexual harassment more than men, while men show higher levels of exposure to physical violence than women.   Third-party aggression Part of the reason for this greater exposure to violence and harassment is that many workers who provide services not only have to deal with colleagues, but often have substantial interaction with third parties, such as customers, patients and students, and this increases the risk of being harassed or attacked. An analysis of workplace violence based on data from Eurofound’s European Working Conditions Survey found that employees in hotels and restaurants, health and education, and public administration are at higher risk of third-party violence. While the possibility of having to confront violence is inherent to some jobs, notably in policing and defence (areas categorised under public administration), it has not traditionally been associated with the work of teachers, food service staff or doctors, but current trends may change perceptions.  Health workers vulnerable Findings from surveys across the EU, summarised in a recent Eurofound study, indicate that in the health sector, nurses, trainee doctors and physiotherapists report exposure to violent behaviour well above national averages. In a 2012 German survey of care staff, for instance, 56% reported having experienced physical violence (63% in inpatient geriatric care), and 78% had experienced verbal aggression in the 12 months preceding the survey. In all, 44% of respondents said they had experienced physical violence and 68% experienced verbal aggression once per month or more. Lone workers are also particularly vulnerable to violent attacks, according the UK’s Health and Safety Executive. This is a diverse group and includes:  people working at their premises in a small workshop, petrol station, kiosk or shop; people working on their own outside normal hours – cleaners, security staff and maintenance or repair staff, for instance;  mobile workers, such as postal workers, taxi drivers, estate agents, and sales or service representatives.  Impact on health Being subjected to aggression at work has a marked impact on the health, well-being and productivity of workers. It can lead to stress, depression and anxiety, conditions that lead to absenteeism, incapacity to work and may even cause workers to exit early from the workforce.  More reading The report Violence and harassment in European workplaces: Extent, impacts and policies brings together research findings from across Member States on the prevalence of violence and harassment at work and its impact on workers and business, and describes legislation and policies that have been put in place to tackle the problem.     The joint report from Eurofound and EU-OSHA Psychosocial risks in Europe: Prevalence and strategies for prevention assesses the extent of psychosocial risks in European workplaces and examines measures establishments are taking to tackle them.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions/service-sector-workers-more-likely-to-experience-aggression-at-work
EUROFOUND_UNK_0286	2015-05-21	UNK	Early childhood care: Getting it right from the start	Recommendations on how to improve the working environment that are based on a limited number of studies can be misleading if there are flaws in these studies. It may also be difficult to interpret their results as a whole. Moreover, in the field of early childhood education and care, most of the studies used to inform policy tend to be only in English and from outside the EU. By bringing together in a systematic manner the results of studies across the EU, a new piece of research allows us to identify which elements of training and the work environment matter most in order to increase the quality of early childhood education and care services. Enjoyment of early childhood education and care (ECEC) services provides a host of benefits for children, ranging from enhanced academic performance at school and later stages of education, reduction of poverty and a better work life balance for their parents. Despite the vital importance of support in this period of life, increasingly recognised by bodies such as the United Nations, staff providing ECEC services still suffer from poor working conditions and lack training opportunities. Eurofound has drawn up a working paper looking at the situation of ECEC workers in several EU Member States and found issues of concern to them such as lack of career and salary progression and increases in both the number of children per group and per member of staff. There are also demands for further training opportunities that go unmet (particularly among those working in the private sector) or a lack of comprehensive training schemes. All this leads to high turnover rates and a decrease in the quality of the services provided. In order to highlight the importance of good working conditions and training opportunities, Eurofound has undertaken a systematic review of research studies carried out by a consortium that covered all EU 28 languages. This systematic review shows the impact of working conditions and training opportunities on the quality of services, with particular emphasis on the impact on the outcomes of children. Most reviews of research studies focus on the situation outside Europe and only include studies in English. This review focuses on Europe and includes studies in Dutch, English, German, Portuguese, Slovenian, Spanish and Swedish. I highlight below the main findings from the 44 studies from 12 Member States included in the review. Impact of continuing professional development (CPD) The review shows that CPD is more effective when delivered to groups of peers and a coach or a mentor provides ongoing support, when training is delivered in ECEC centres and when its content is directly related to daily professional practice, thus enabling staff to absorb it better. Video feedback was found to be particularly useful in training courses shorter than six months. Some of the positive effects of this type of CPD include improvements in the capability of ECEC staff to provide care and to stimulate language development. It has a positive impact on children’s cognitive development and their language acquisition. For courses longer than six months, group workshops and ongoing support had positive outcomes in allowing practitioners to reflect upon and review their practices more critically. ECEC staff undertaking training feel more confident about their skills, reflect more on the impact of their practices and can reconsider the role of children as well as their own role as educators (e.g. staff listen more to the needs of children or wait for them to initiate interactions). Staff are more willing to discuss issues openly; this produces an overall improvement in the cooperation of professionals both within their teams as well as with other professionals and parents. Teaching strategies also improve with training, with play-based activities being better designed. Impact of working conditions The findings regarding working conditions were smaller in number, with studies indicating that class size probably has an impact on pupils’ academic progress (literacy and mathematics). A large group size leads to more stress for practitioners, less flexibility in teaching methods and less individualised (one-to-one) monitoring and support for children. A heavy administrative burden is seen by practitioners as impacting badly upon teaching, the conduct of classes and their planning. Some of the studies that were reviewed but excluded provide additional evidence regarding other dimensions of working conditions. Having a higher salary and the possibility of having non-contact time to organise activities have a positive impact on tailoring communication to the interests and capabilities of children. There is also a correlation between career progression and the cognitive competencies of children. Another study pointed out that as the level of teacher education increases, so does the language performance of children. Many studies found that it is not possible to single out one dimension of working conditions as the main predictor of quality (e.g. it is difficult to disentangle the effect of group size from that of staff-child ratio) and therefore service reforms need to address several aspects at the same time. The way forward The review identified that there is a need for further research to analyse the impact of training initiatives that last less than six months, that are not incorporated in ECEC settings and that do not make use of video feedback. Moreover, only one study was found to have looked at the impact of long-term training on the interactions between staff and children, pointing to the need for further research in this area. The review also uncovered a lack of robust studies on the impact of working conditions and training even in countries that have well-developed ECEC systems (e.g. France). As far as practice is concerned, it is important to bear in mind that CPD interventions should provide opportunities for staff to interact with other colleagues. Changes in working conditions, especially the availability of non-contact time, should also be pursued.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0287	2015-05-14	UNK	ERM quarterly – more announced job gains than losses / Eurofound News, May 2015	"In the first quarter of 2015, announced job gains recorded in Eurofound’s European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) outnumbered announced job losses, after two consecutive quarters showing the opposite trend. The manufacturing sector experienced the most restructuring activity, accounting for 41% of announced job losses and 26% of announced job gains. Meanwhile, Germany experienced the greatest job losses (almost 9,000 being announced) and the greatest gains (over 16,000 new jobs announced). The quarterly also examines cases of job creation and loss in detail – respectively, in Germany’s Deutsche Post DHL and Poland’s Poczta Polska. The European Restructuring Monitor is a unique EU-wide dataset on larger-scale restructuring events, which tracks the announced employment effects of restructuring in the EU28 and Norway.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0288	2015-05-14	UNK	Levels of youth entrepreneurship and NEETs correlate across countries / Eurofound News, May 2015	Across Europe, the proportion of self-employed young people is highly correlated with the proportion of young people not in employment, education or training (NEET). This indicates that countries with high overall levels of NEETs, such as Italy, Greece, Romania and Spain, are also more likely to have high levels of youth self-employment. This may suggest that labour markets with more opportunities for paid employment have less of a ‘push’ into self-employment in general and therefore lower levels of youth self-employment. Conversely, in Member States with slow or stagnant economic growth, self-employment seems to attract more young people.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0289	2015-05-13	UNK	Fostering young entrepreneurs in Europe / Eurofound News, May 2015	Almost half of all young people in Europe would like to become entrepreneurs, yet only a very small proportion actually do so, according to Eurofound’s publication of the month, Youth entrepreneurship in Europe: Values, attitudes, policies. Launched at a lunch debate on 29 April with EU-level social partners in Brussels after the kick-off of European Youth Week, the report finds that while 48% of young Europeans would like to become entrepreneurs and 41% believe it is possible, less than 7% of those aged 15–29 were self-employed in 2013. This figure varied greatly across the Member States: the proportion of youth self-employment in Greece and Italy was 15% or more, but only 3% or less in Germany and Denmark. Although there is considerable policy interest across Europe in promoting youth entrepreneurship to help create employment, self-employment is not a viable career path for all young people: setting up as an entrepreneur requires the right skills, ideas and personality traits. The report analyses factors that could unlock this entrepreneurial potential, and those influencing a young person’s decision to become self-employed.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0291	2015-04-28	UNK	EU Agencies renew action to tackle migrant death crisis	Key EU Agencies will coordinate urgent action to tackle the crisis of migrant deaths in the Mediterranean  following the EU summit in Brussels in 24 April. The EU’s agreed priority areas for action address the ever-increasing crisis in the Mediterranean following the most recent tragedies with the promise to step up both control and rescue operations.  The plan calls on EU Agencies such as the EU’s law enforcement agency, (Europol), the EU borders agency, (Frontex), the European Asylum Support office (EASO), the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and the EU's Judicial Cooperation Unit (Eurojust) to offer their assistance and expertise. Specifically, they should meet regularly and to work closely to gather information on smugglers, to trace their funds and to assist in their investigation in order to better tackle the smugglers who are exploiting those most at risk. Eurofound, currently coordinating the network of EU Agencies, recognises the painful poignancy of this tragedy which partly emanates from a desire to attain the improved living and working conditions that is the core mandate of our Agency. At the same time, the Fundamental Rights Agency, FRA has reiterated its call for a holistic, fundamental rights-oriented EU migration policy in order to save lives and combat the smugglers that seek to make financial gain out of the desperate situation of people in need of protection.  All join in reconfirming their commitment to ensuring every effort is made to address this human crisis. For further details. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/eu-agencies-renew-action-to-tackle-migrant-death-crisis
EUROFOUND_UNK_0292	2015-05-13	UNK	Impact of crisis on wage inequality / Eurofound News, May 2015	The Great Recession changed the trend of overall EU wage inequality: while wage inequality had been decreasing prior to the start of the crisis, it started to rise as the crisis progressed, as a new report from Eurofound illustrates. Between 2004 and 2008, overall wage inequality in the EU diminshed. This was due to convergence between European countries, driven by a rapid catching-up by eastern Member States and a stagnation of wages in the two biggest economies – Germany and the UK. After 2008, however, wage inequality increased, mainly as a result of rising inequalities within countries. Only eastern European Member States experienced a decline in wage inequality over the whole period, while other Member States saw increasing overall inequality levels against a background of growing unemployment. In the UK, wage inequality had fallen markedly up to 2008, after which it rose even more sharply up to 2011 – so strongly as to largely explain trends in overall EU inequality. The sector most affected was the financial sector, which experienced a significant reduction in both its average wage levels and in its levels of internal wage inequality.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0294	2015-04-29	UNK	New report defines factors to unlock the potential of Europe’s young entrepreneurs	Eurofound launches new report on ‘Youth entrepreneurship – Values, attitudes and policies’: (Press release) Only a fraction of young Europeans interested in becoming entrepreneurs actually go on to do so, according to Eurofound’s new report ‘Youth entrepreneurship in Europe: Values, attitudes, policies’. The report looks at factors that could unlock this entrepreneurial potential, and that influence young people’s decision to become self-employed. The report will be launched today Wednesday 29 April at a lunch-time discussion with EU-level social partner representatives in Brussels, Belgium. Fostering greater participation of young people in the labour market has become a priority in Europe, and there are a number of different strategies in place at national level to increase youth entrepreneurship. The report analyses selected policy measures aimed at fostering youth entrepreneurship, organised around three main support pillars: fostering an entrepreneurial mindset and culture among young people; providing the right information and support to young would-be entrepreneurs; and removing perceived practical and logistical barriers. The report shows that almost half of young Europeans are interested in becoming entrepreneurs, and over 40% believe it is feasible. However, only 6.5% of young people in work are self-employed, and there are significant national and gender differences in Europe when it comes to the amount of young people that actually set up their own business. There are significant differences between EU Member States, and the share of youth self-employment varies from 15% or more in Italy and Greece to 3% or less in Germany and Denmark. Youth self-employment is also a predominantly male activity as just 33% of young self-employed people in the EU28 in 2013 were women. There is also an issue with the overrepresentation of young self-employed people in sectors with low barriers to entry, such as construction, where there are issues with ‘bogus’ or false self-employment. Although youth entrepreneurship is not a panacea for youth unemployment, a long-term strategy for supporting the creativity and ambition of Europe’s entrepreneurial minded young people can produce positive results. Tailoring policies and initiatives to those with the right skills, values and ideas, and encouraging the creativity and ambition of young people could significantly impact the economic and social landscape of Europe in the future.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0295	2015-04-27	UNK	European Youth survey highlights participation of young people	The Flash Eurobarometer 408 survey on ‘European Youth’, published on 23 April by the European Commission, looks at how young EU citizens aged 15–30 participate in society and highlights a number of concerns that they face. Confidence about a job Although 26% of young people are very confident about finding a job once they finish their studies, 18% are not very confident. Young people in the Czech Republic, Luxembourg and Austria appear the most confident, compared with those in Greece, Spain and Cyprus. Not finding a long-term contract or a stable job is reported as a concern by 31% of respondents, and having to move to find a job is a concern among 16%. Participation in organisations Compared with previous surveys, young people report stable levels or slight decreases in participation in sports clubs, youth clubs, leisure clubs or other youth organisations in the previous 12 months. Almost half (49%) say they participated in at least one form of organised activity, down from 56% in 2011. Young men are also more active in this area than young women. Political elections Voting in political elections in the past three years has generally been higher at the local (47%) and national levels (43%), followed by regional (37%) and EU levels (31%). A majority of respondents voted in 24 Member States, while fewer than half voted in Lithuania (49%), Ireland (48%), Cyprus (47%) and the UK (45%). Volunteering One-quarter of young people report involvement in volunteering in the previous 12 months. The highest levels are in Ireland (42%), Denmark (39%) and the Netherlands (38%), while the lowest are in Bulgaria (10%), Greece (13%) and Sweden (15%). Charity, humanitarian and development aid is the most common area for volunteering, followed by education, training or sport. Of those who had taken part in voluntary activities, 28% report incurring expenses but not receiving any contributions towards them. Only 6% of young people have volunteered abroad, with 93% never having volunteered abroad: 88% had no opportunity to do so, while 5% have had the opportunity but not availed of it. Young people in the Netherlands (11%) and Ireland (10%) are most likely to have volunteered abroad.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0296	2015-04-22	UNK	Starting preparations for 2017 / Eurofound News, April 2015	Work has begun on formulating Eurofound’s next four-year work programme, which will determine the course of its research work over the period 2017–2020. By 2017, when implementation of the programme begins, the EU will have spent a decade fighting the crisis that began with the economic downturn of 2007. At this point, a return to growth remains uncertain and Europe is still dealing with high levels of unemployment, poverty and exclusion. Eurofound’s work will parallel the challenge facing Europe and seek to provide information and analysis that can assist inclusive growth and job creation and help address citizens’ and societal needs. On 19 March members of Eurofound staff, its governing board, and experts from international organisations such as the ILO and OECD met to debate the key policy challenges that Eurofound’s work should address. The results of this initial brainstorming will feed into an initial draft; several rounds of discussion will follow.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/starting-preparations-for-2017-eurofound-news-april-2015

Once the survey is completed, more than 43,000 workers in 35 different European countries will have given a comprehensive interview on their working conditions – on such topics as exposure to physical and psychosocial risks, working time duration and organisation, employment status and contract, work–life balance, earnings, and health and well-being. This, the sixth wave of the survey, is building on the lessons learned from the previous five surveys and will contribute to a rich portrait of workplace trends in Europe over the last 25 years. In addition to the 28 Member States, this sixth survey is covering five EU candidate countries (Albania, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Turkey) plus Switzerland and Norway.

Lingjob – an online crowdsourcing platform based in Vilnius, Lithuania – enables people to buy and sell text-related services such as writing, translating and proofreading written material. Job’Ardent, an organisation based in Liège, Belgium, has been set up by a group of employers to manage a number of shared employees. And Human Garden – a Prague-based Czech company – hires out expert managers on an interim basis to assist companies dealing with specific human resource management issues. These are organisations where new forms of employment are operating, and they are among the 66 case studies that form the basis for Eurofound’s research into forms of employment that have emerged recently or are of growing importance in different Member States since 2000. Some of the case studies focus on specific organisations, while others examine policy in a specific country.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0301	2015-04-21	UNK	Exploring what makes companies work / Eurofound News, April 2015	Establishments with more extensive practices for direct employee participation score better in terms of establishment performance and workplace well-being, according to the recently published overview report of Eurofound’s third European Company Survey. Two different combinations of workplace practices are particularly associated with better performance and greater well-being. The first – especially prevalent in larger organisations – brings together a top-down approach to decision-making on daily tasks, a highly structured internal organisation, extensive investment in human resource management, and extensive practices for direct and indirect employee participation in organisational decision-making. The second, more prevalent in small and medium-sized establishments, sees a joint approach to decision-making on daily tasks, moderately structured internal organisation and limited investment in HRM, combined with extensive practices for direct employee participation. The key common denominator is the facilitation of direct employee participation. The findings also imply that the combination of practices needs to match the circumstances and characteristics of the establishment.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0302	2015-03-31	UNK	New types of casualisation still put workers at a disadvantage	Casual work is nothing new, but as employers seek greater flexibility to meet their labour needs, it is taking new forms. It has been suggested that new work arrangements can help reduce unemployment, but concerns are being raised about the implications for workers. Rise in zero-hours contracts On-call casual work, which is on the rise in a number of EU countries, maintains a continuous employment relationship between an employer and an employee. However, the employer does not continuously provide work for the employee, instead calling them in only when needed.  A very precarious type of on-call work is the ‘zero-hours’ contract, which specifies no minimum number of working hours, meaning the employer is not obliged to ever call in the worker. Zero-hours contracts have gained notoriety particularly in the UK, where there has been significant growth in their use in recent years. Food chain McDonalds hit the headlines in 2013 when The Guardian reported that 90% of its workforce was on these contracts. The newspaper subsequently reported that a similar proportion of Domino’s Pizza staff and all 20,000 of Burger King’s restaurant staff were zero-hours workers. Other large companies have also come under the spotlight for employing large numbers of employees on zero-hours contracts. Questions of fairness On-call contracts are controversial because of their apparent unfairness to workers. In most cases, workers are paid only for the time worked. This means, for instance, a care worker may visit a number of clients in a day, but won’t be paid for the time they spend travelling between clients.  Workers are put at further disadvantage when contracts include exclusivity clauses barring them from working for other employers. In addition, social protection coverage is often poor – in Ireland, workers on such contracts receive no mandatory social protection coverage, while in the UK workers become eligible only if they reach a minimum income. Role of company practices Casual employment is also developing through company practice. For instance, German commercial airline Lufthansa in 2013 introduced a new type of work contract to cover the peak summer months, which recruits staff to work full time from March to October and releases them for the remainder of the year. They complete the same basic 12-week training as regular flight assistants and are hired initially on a two-year contract, renewable once for four years. Social partner opinions  Casual forms of employment have obvious benefits for employers, allowing them to very flexibly meet their labour demands when the need arises. Employers have been taking a cautious approach to recruitment since the economic crisis: temporary hiring increased between 2008 and 2012, reaching as high as 71% for elementary occupations in 2012, but also becoming more common for highly skilled occupations such as technicians and professionals. Trade unions have expressed concerns about the ‘overflexibilisation’ of the labour market to the disadvantage of workers. Casual work by and large offers little job security, uncertain and irregular working hours, low and unpredictable wages, no or limited benefits, less job satisfaction and, in many cases, dull and predictable work. Employers’ organisations argue that companies need to be able to adjust to fluctuations in the market, particularly in economically difficult times. It remains to be seen whether the shift towards flexible hiring will be reversed when the economy shows more definite signs of recovery. More information Casual work is one of the forms of employment examined by Eurofound in its project to research forms of employment that have emerged or been on the rise since 2000. The results of this research are published in the report New forms of employment.  	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-labour-market/new-types-of-casualisation-still-put-workers-at-a-disadvantage

EUROFOUND_UNK_0304	2015-04-14	UNK	Getting Europe’s youth into work and training: National examples	Eurofound’s European Observatory of Working Life (EurWORK) gathers together information on working conditions and industrial relations across all EU Member States and Norway, supported by a network of European correspondents. A number of recent articles from the observatory have focused on youth-related issues in various EU Member States, such as the Youth Guarantee, vocational training, entrepreneurial activity and school-to-work transitions. Youth Guarantee and vocational training Slovenia’s Youth Guarantee strategy for 2014–2015 sets out a range of measures that are designed to improve the transition from education to employment, to get young unemployed people into vocational training or paid work more quickly, and to reduce youth unemployment. Slovenia is unusual among EU Member States in having raised the upper age limit for eligibility for the programme from 25 to 29 years. The first results show that those participating in the Youth Guarantee scheme received 40% more referrals for job vacancies than those who had not participated. Youth employment was also up 24% on the previous year. The results of the Youth Guarantee show that this strategy is really helping young people in Slovenia to find employment faster. The role of the social partners has also been looked at in various Member States in delivering the Youth Guarantee. The EurWORK topical update on Social partners and the Youth Guarantee presents some of the key developments and research findings on aspects of skills, learning and employability in the fourth quarter of 2014. For instance, the social partners in Italy and Lithuania have committed themselves formally through memoranda of understanding to cooperate in the implementation of each country's national Youth Guarantee plans. In Luxembourg, the results of the first implementation phase of the Youth Guarantee scheme show that 420 young job-seekers have signed a binding agreement with the National Employment Office (ONEm); of these, 65% could benefit from a quality offer, either in the form of a job offer or an apprenticeship. The social partners have supported the scheme. For example, the Independent Trade Union Confederation (OGB-L) put forward a number of proposals during its annual congress in December 2014 such as a strategy to validate and certify competencies. Meanwhile, in Germany, the Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) announced the creation of a new alliance for vocational and further training in December 2014. The new alliance covers the 2015–2018 period and unites all relevant actors under one umbrella. Employers have promised to provide 500,000 internship positions and 20,000 apprenticeship positions anually, in addition to those already registered with the Federal Employment Agency. Entrepreneurial activity Spain has seen recent growth in entrepreneurial activity. The difficulties experienced by young unemployed people in getting a job have led many to set up their own businesses. Experts acknowledge the success of Spanish measures to encourage self-employment, but argue that many unemployed people have decided to set up their own businesses only because they cannot find a job, and that necessity-driven new businesses have lower survival rates. They say entrepreneurship should be supported with long-term measures adapted to entrepreneurs’ actual needs. School-to-work transitions In Italy, framework agreements have been signed to strengthen school-to-work transitions. The Italian government aims to strengthen school-to-work transitions by means of apprenticeship contracts. Therefore, an experimental plan allows students to spend training periods within enterprises.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0305	2015-03-30	UNK	New report confirms people-centred workplace practices crucial for recovering Europe’s competitiveness	Eurofound launches 3rd European Company Survey overview report at high-level EU Presidency conference ‘Workplace practices: creating win-win arrangements for companies and employees’ Press release (Dublin, Ireland) - Establishments with more extensive practices for direct employee participation score better in terms of performance and well-being according to findings in the new report from Eurofound’s third European Company Survey launched at a joint EU Presidency conference in Riga today. The report also highlights that ‘win-win’ arrangements often include practices that draw on employees tacit knowledge but warns that these ‘win-win’ outcomes are not a given even when favourable practices are in place. The European Company Survey maps workplace practices in terms of work organisation, human resource management, direct participation and social dialogue. Other results show that despite the crisis, most managers (84%) and employee representatives (67%) report a ‘good’ or ‘very good’ work climate, and the vast majority of establishments make available a variety of instruments to facilitate direct employee participation. Establishments that offer a broad range of variable pay schemes also perform better in terms of well-being and performance. The survey found that more than half (56%) of employee representatives report they can use as much of their working time as is necessary to carry out their duties, 32% had received training and 37% have access to external advice. The majority of establishments provide paid time off for training (71%) or on-the-job training (73%) for at least some of their employees.  However, while the majority of establishments provide training for at least some of their employees, 13% of establishments do not provide any training at all. In this context, barriers to the provision of training by companies need to be addressed, paying attention to the ways in which workers learn and develop. Social dialogue is functioning well in a large proportion of establishments, but there also is a sizeable group where a lack of resourcing and a lack of trust go hand-in-hand with a high likelihood of industrial action. The availability of resources for employee representatives varies greatly between countries.  ‘Achieving ‘win-win’ outcomes is not guaranteed even when favourable practices are in place,’ says Juan Menéndez-Valdés, Eurofound’s Director. ‘Policymakers and the social partners have a role to play in fostering best practice, raising awareness and implementing initiatives at sectoral level.’ The 3rd European Company Survey was carried out at a time when Europe was only just starting to recover from the biggest crisis to hit the world since the Great Depression of the 1930s. For many companies, therefore, the crisis is likely to have had a major influence on the experiences which they report. The focus of the report links to the EU’s Europe 2020 strategy – in particular, its flagship initiatives for the ‘innovation union’, ‘industrial policy for the globalisation era’, and ‘agenda for new skills and jobs’. If these are to succeed, what happens in European workplaces is crucial. Recently, the debate has centred on workplace innovation, which stresses the importance of tapping into the tacit knowledge of employees to achieve ‘win-win’ outcomes that simultaneously benefit both companies and employees.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0308	2015-03-19	UNK	Launch of third European Company Survey report / Eurofound News, March 2015	On 30 March, Eurofound will launch the overview report of the third wave of its European Company Survey. Based on interviews in around 30,000 establishments across Europe, the report seeks to provides decision-makers with comprehensive information on workplace practices in terms of work organisation, human resource management, direct participation and social dialogue. Beyond simply documenting the incidence of these practices, the report also investigates how they relate to each other and to outcomes in terms of company performance and well-being in the workplace. The focus of the report links to the EU’s Europe 2020 strategy – in particular, its flagship initiatives for the ‘innovation union’, ‘industrial policy for the globalisation era’, and ‘agenda for new skills and jobs’. If these are to succeed, what happens in European workplaces is crucial. Recently, the debate has centred on workplace innovation, which stresses the importance of tapping into the tacit knowledge of employees to achieve ‘win-win’ outcomes that simultaneously benefit both companies and employees. The report will be launched in Riga in cooperation with the Latvian EU Presidency, at a conference entitled ‘Workplace practices: Creating win-win arrangements for companies and employees’.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0309	2015-03-20	UNK	New forms of employment emerge in Europe	The nature of work is changing: new forms of employment are emerging across Europe, driven by technological change, competitive pressures and the desire for more flexibility on the part of both employers and workers. These new forms often transform the traditional one-to-one relationship between employer and employee and frequently involve unconventional work patterns and places of work, or the irregular provision of work. A new report from Eurofound identifies the emergence or expansion of nine forms of employment over the last 15 years, including ICT-based mobile work, portfolio work (doing small indivdiual jobs for a large number of clients) and interim management, bringing external management skills into an organisation on a temporary basis. The report concludes that for the most part they make the labour market more attractive and boost innovation in it. However, a greater acceptance of more casual forms – which may be linked to lower income and limited social protection – poses the risk of labour market segmentation.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0310	2015-03-24	UNK	Employment in public administration falls sharply	Over 800,000 net jobs have been lost in public administration – the part of the public sector responsible for core government functions – since 2008, as governments have sought to reduce public debt through spending cuts. Over the five years, the headcount has declined by 5%, which is proportionally more than the total employment decline.                     Nineteen of the 28 Member States have cut their public administration workforces; the most drastic case is Latvia, where 29% of the workforce has been cut, followed by the UK and France, with declines of more than 10%. public_sector_gains_and_losses.png               Employment rises overall However, employment overall in public services has risen by 4% in the EU since 2008, at a time when overall employment in the region has fallen by 2.6%. Most of the gain has occurred in health, but education has also contributed. Fiscal retrenchment has recently begun to bite in these sectors too, with rates of employment increase flattening out in the most recent two years and a net decline in education sector employment between 2012 and 2013. There is some evidence that an increasing share of new education and health jobs are in the private sector. Pay cuts or job cuts? Governments in Ireland, Portugal and Spain – countries among the worst affected by the crisis – more often opted for pay reductions or freezes to control the public sector pay bill, and staff cuts were relatively low, according to a survey of senior public service executives (the COCOPS project). By contrast, layoffs were favoured over pay restraint in Denmark, Finland and Sweden.  Much of the research on recent public sector restructuring carried out by Eurofound finds that the process was generally flawed: decisions were not well prepared, processes were carried out quickly and often not transparently, and consultation with the social partners was limited.  An assessment of the impact of the changes on public sector employees, based on the COCOPS survey, is quite negative. When questioned on 16 aspects of internal performance, 2 of the lowest scores were related to staff motivation and the attractiveness of the public sector as an employer. Assessments were particularly negative for these dimensions in France, Italy, Spain and the UK. Public sector restructuring is the theme of the recently published 2014 ERM annual report, examining the impact on the public sector of government austerity measures.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/labour-market/employment-in-public-administration-falls-sharply
EUROFOUND_UNK_0311	2015-03-19	UNK	Tackling violence and harassment at work / Eurofound News, March 2015	Being subjected to violence and harassment at work has a marked impact on workers’ health and productivity; it also undermines the sustainabilty of work over the life course. A new comparative report from Eurofound looks at the extent of violence and harassment in the workplace in the EU28 and Norway, using the results of national surveys conducted between 2009 and 2013, as well as the results of Eurofound’s fifth Working Conditions Survey from 2010. Findings from national surveys indicate that women are more likely to report having experienced violence and harassment than men; also vulnerable are workers in sectors where there is substantial contact with customers, clients and patients – transport and storage, accommodation and food services and health and social work.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0312	2015-03-13	UNK	Gap between large-scale job loss and job gain closes	Announced job creation in large-scale restructuring cases balanced announced job losses in the first six months of 2014 for the first time since before the start of the global economic crisis in 2008. The convergence reflects improving labour market conditions and is mainly down to a steady decline in job destruction since the second half of 2012.  This information comes from Eurofound’s European Restructuring Monitor (ERM), which records restructurings involving the loss or creation of 100-plus jobs announced in the media across Europe. Its annual report for 2014, just published, describes developments from the first quarter of 2013 to the second quarter of 2014 inclusive. Over this total period, announced job loss outstripped announced job gain: 481,000 jobs were lost while 298,000 new jobs were created. Manufacturing contracting Manufacturing accounts for most announced job losses and job gains in the database, partly because manufacturing firms tend to be big and so are more likely to meet the threshold for inclusion. The share of manufacturing in the database has tended to decrease since its launch in 2002, in particular as regards announced job creation, which demonstrates its diminishing share of overall employment. Around one in six European jobs is now in manufacturing compared with one in four in 1980.  EU-LFS data show that within manufacturing, job losses have been most severe (losing more than 15% of employment) in basic, low-tech subsectors such as basic metals, textiles, clothing and leather, and wood, paper and printing. Machinery, food and beverages, and pharmaceuticals suffered more modest employment declines (losing less than 5%). Retail losses  The retail sector makes up an increasing proportion of announced job loss. Retail has been undergoing intensive restructuring activity since 2008 as consumption patterns shift away from established supermarket chains to mass market discount retailers. A combination of market forces, narrow margins and cross-border competition has seen the collapse of some major established retailers such as Woolworths, Arcandor and Dayli and the rapid rise of groups such as Aldi, Lidl and Ikea. The overall outcome for employment has been a net loss of some one million retail jobs (just over 3% of sector employment) since 2008. Public administration is another sector where large job losses have been announced in the past few years, occurring mainly in 2011–2012, coinciding with austerity-driven cutbacks in many Member States. There was also a significant increase in the share of job losses announced in financial services in 2013–2014, which could be a delayed reaction to the troubles experienced by the sector during the global financial crisis. Employment growth has occurred mainly in the service sectors, both in high-skilled services and also in predominantly low-skilled residential care activities. Part-time employment A striking change in the employment landscape since the crisis has been a fall in full-time permanent jobs, even in the public sector; new jobs are increasingly likely to be part time. Part-time employment in the EU has increased by more than 10% since the crisis began, in the same period as full-time employment decreased by 5%. This development has negative implications for job quality, as part-time work generally offers lower pay and fewer entitlements. It also implies that real labour inputs (in full-time equivalent terms) have declined by even more than the overall figure for net job loss in the EU since 2008 – six million – suggests. The ERM annual report 2014 also includes an analysis of flows out of employment over a decade, to map why people left employment, and explores the rapid transformation of the public sector in Europe since 2008. Factsheets on individual restructuring events in the ERM are also available.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/spotlight-on/employment/gap-between-large-scale-job-loss-and-job-gain-closes-0
EUROFOUND_UNK_0313	2015-03-12	UNK	Restructuring in the public sector in Europe	(Dublin, Ireland): In the immediate aftermath of the recession in 2008, employment in the public sector continued to grow, helping to sustain demand in the European economy. However, by 2010 significant restructuring was underway in the public sector in several Member States. Public sector restructuring affects more of the population than private sector restructuring, and so generates a great deal of political interest, as well as some controversy. The ERM Annual Report 2014 – Restructuring in the public sector provides an overview of restructuring trends in Member States since the onset of the recession in 2008. One of the characteristics of the recession was that, even if employment in the public sector helped to cushion the initial macroeconomic shock, the public sector subsequently experienced the most severe restructuring in Europe for many decades. This was due to the spiraling public debt in many Member States, largely due to the banking crisis, and issues related to the governance of a then fragile euro. The report has found that nineteen of the 28 Member States have experienced declining employment levels in the core public sector: the sharpest decline has been in Latvia (-29%), with declines of more than 10% recorded in the UK and France. Meanwhile, the education and health sectors have continued to expand during the peak years of the crisis and afterwards, although at a slowing pace since 2011. Employment in the large public services – health and education – continues to grow but there is evidence of an increasing share of private employment in these sectors. Some 800,000 net job losses have been recorded in the core public sector (public administration) in the EU since 2008, meaning that this sector has contracted faster than the overall workforce. As most job loss occurred in the male-dominated core public sector, public sector employment has become significantly more female-dominated overall. More than one-third of public service workers in Europe are now aged over 50, and the share of older workers has increased by more than five percentage points since 2008 in both the health and public administration sectors. While the number of workers taking early retirement has declined somewhat in the private sector since the onset of the economic crisis, it has increased in the public sector. The report also found that pay reductions or freezes have been most common in the programme countries, Spain, the UK and the Baltic countries, and least common in the Nordic countries and Germany. There is no doubt that, regardless of the experiences of the recent economic crisis, the public sector faces a very challenging future: in no sector of the economy will the impact of the ageing demographic structure be as great as that in the health and care sectors.  	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/restructuring-in-the-public-sector-in-europe
EUROFOUND_UNK_0314	2015-03-19	UNK	ILO Director-General visits Eurofound / Eurofound News, March 2015	Knowledge is central to policymaking, emphasised Guy Ryder, ILO Director-General, during his visit to Eurofound on 27 February. ‘Investing in knowledge and developing research capacity has been a priority at the ILO since its foundation,’ he said. ‘We strive to provide our tripartite stakeholders around the world with answers to what initiatives work’. With these parallels between the goals of the ILO and Eurofound, the stage was set for an energetic sharing of ideas. Mr Ryder listened to presentations from Eurofound’s experts on the future of manufacturing, 30 years of social dialogue in Europe and on active inclusion of those furthest from the labour market. He expressed his appreciation of meeting Eurofound staff to hear and discuss opinions in an informal setting. Looking ahead, Mr Ryder outlined the ILO’s priorities in the runup to the centenary celebrations of the Geneva-based UN agency in 2019. Under the umbrella of a far-reaching debate on the future of work, these priorities include a review of international labour standards, examining the impact of work of the UN’s millennium goals to end poverty, a focus on decent work, promoting gender equality in the workplace, and establishing a sustainable approach to work and the environment. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/ilo-director-general-visits-eurofound-eurofound-news-march-2015
EUROFOUND_UNK_0315	2015-03-19	UNK	Promoting parental and paternity leave among fathers / Eurofound News, March 2015	The take-up rate of paternity and parental leave by fathers in the EU is still relatively low, although it has increased in recent years, according to new research from Eurofound. Most EU Member States provide for paternity and parental leave, although systems vary greatly in the duration of leave and the amount of compensation offered. The main factors influencing take-up are the level of compensation, the flexibility of the system, the availability of information, and the extent to which men are concerned that they may be isolating themselves from the labour market if they take leave. On 26 February, Eurofound presented its findings on paternity and parental leave to the European Parliament Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality (FEMM), as part of an exchange of views on the maternity leave directive. More detail on the findings is available in the report Promoting uptake of parental and paternity leave among fathers in the European Union.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-industrial-relations/promoting-parental-and-paternity-leave-among-fathers-eurofound-news-march-2015

EUROFOUND_UNK_0318	2015-03-10	UNK	Older people unduly hit by healthcare cuts	In the wake of the economic and financial crisis, many European governments have cut spending on healthcare services. However, at the same time, there is an increased need for these services due to the higher unemployment and financial strain experienced by many households. Given that older people generally have greater healthcare needs than younger people, it seems that this group has been disproportionately affected by the cuts. Findings from Eurofound’s report Access to healthcare in times of crisis have confirmed the link between reduced healthcare provision post-crisis and older people. The report examined a wide range of healthcare services across the EU, including nursing home care, outpatient and community care and emergency services. Using case studies from healthcare providers in 11 EU Member States – Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden – the report describes how these services did their best to maintain access despite the cuts. Cuts in funding For example, in Ireland, while the funding for home care (including home help, nursing and physiotherapy) was reduced – the total number of hours of service provision falling from 13 million in 2008 to 9 million in 2013 – the number of people receiving home care increased from 9,000 to 11,000. In Hungary, the budget for home healthcare was cut by 3.9% in 2009 and by 9.3% in 2010, resulting in a decrease in the number of visits per patient, down from 26 in 2007 to 23 in 2012. Other population groups affected by the crisis in terms of access to healthcare include those in the ‘twilight zone’: people earning too little to be able to access healthcare but whose income is above the threshold for support. In some countries (such as Greece, Ireland and Slovenia) many people have had to cease paying complementary private insurance, because they can no longer afford it. Issues highlighted in the report Waiting lists  While the waiting lists for nursing care should have increased with population ageing and reduced supply, demand has actually gone down in some countries such as Hungary and Latvia. This is because pensions have become an important source of household income due to employment loss post-crisis. Cutting costs Some nursing homes have succeeded in maintaining their services by cutting costs in some areas. One example highlighted in the research is a nursing home in Latvia that was able to continue providing its services by economising on its catering facilities, as well on as its psychiatrist and physiotherapist services. Demand from new clients There is increased demand on healthcare providers coming from older people who would have previously turned to other services or who find themselves in poverty never before experienced. One example is the case of a hospital in Ireland that set up a community taskforce charged with developing innovative response to keep older people out of the hospital and to shorten their in-patient stays. Shift towards community care Generally, the crisis has provided an opportunity for governments and service providers to accelerate the shift from in-patient care toward alternative options in the community, at lower cost and with better quality of life for older people. While this has indeed happened in some examples described in the report, some have moved in an opposite direction because out-patient services were easier to cut than in-patient services. However, the report argues that the crisis is not the ideal context for such a shift, given the lack of resources to plan and design alternative services. Impact of reduced provision Policymakers and service providers should be aware of the unexpected or indirect consequences of reductions in healthcare, and the downside of the crisis even where no cuts have been made. In some countries, demand for healthcare in nursing homes has declined because the pensions of elderly relatives are an important source of household income (Hungary, Latvia). In some cases, people have moved from private to public healthcare, creating increased demand (Greece, Ireland, Slovenia), while in others private hospitals have gained more clientele, partly as an indirect consequence of the crisis (Bulgaria, Romania, Sweden).  	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/older-people-unduly-hit-by-healthcare-cuts

EUROFOUND_UNK_0320	2015-03-10	UNK	How can the Youth Guarantee best succeed?	The Youth Guarantee was developed in response to the youth unemployment crisis, with a staggering 7.5 million young people aged 15–24 years not in employment, education or training (NEETs) and at a cost to the EU economy of €162 billion (in 2012), according to Eurofound research. The Youth Guarantee aims to ensure that young people under the age of 25 receive a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of leaving formal education or becoming unemployed. Funding from the Youth Employment Initiative and the European Social Fund is helping to implement the Youth Guarantee in regions that were especially hit by high youth unemployment rates. Member States have estimated that this funding would benefit more than 880,000 young people in 2014. Although Member States are committed to implementing the Youth Guarantee and have received country-specific recommendations from the Commission, it will take time to ensure that the structural reforms required for a successful implementation happen in the 2014–2020 period. For example, this means improving how public employment services function, improving vocational education and training systems, and improving cooperation between the public and private sector. Euronews at Eurofound On 24 February 2015, journalist Fanny Gauret of Euronews visited Eurofound and spoke with Research Manager Massimiliano Mascherini on Youth Guarantee implementation, early findings from pilot projects and whether and how the Youth Guarantee will succeed at national and European level. The Euronews team also visited the Ballymun Youth Guarantee pilot project in Dublin, one of 18 pilot projects across the EU. In a feature on youth unemployment on Portugal and Ireland on the Euronews Real Economy programme on 10 March, Mr Mascherini emphasised that short spells of unemployment are almost to be expected in a young person’s transition from education to employment. However, he highlighted that the major concern is long-term unemployment and long-term disengagement. There has to be a joint effort by governments, public employment services, employers and youth organisations to make the Youth Guarantee a success and get young people back into work. Coming soon Eurofound (April 2015): Youth entrepreneurship: Values, attitudes, policies Ongoing research Eurofound is currently investigating the early implementation of the Youth Guarantee in 10 Member States under the framework of its ‘Social inclusion of young people’ project which will result in a forthcoming consolidated report (autumn 2015).   Further reading on youth in Europe: Eurofound (2014): Mapping youth transitions in Europe Eurofound (2013): Working conditions of young entrants to the labour market Eurofound (2012): Youth Guarantee: Experiences from Finland and Sweden 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/how-can-the-youth-guarantee-best-succeed

The proportion of job losses attributable to closure (11%) substantially increased compared to the percentage reported in the third quarter (6%). The opposite trend was noted for bankruptcy: the proportion of jobs lost decreased from 13% in the third quarter to 8% at the close of the year. Internal restructuring continued to account for the great majority of announced job losses – 69%, somewhat less than the previous quarter. Consistent with figures from the previous quarter, announced job losses continued to outweigh announced job creation, pointing to a slowdown in the still hesitant recovery of the EU labour market.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0323	2015-02-27	UNK	Tackling the challenges in the world of work	Guy Ryder, Director-General of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), visited Eurofound on Friday 27 February for talks with Juan Menéndez-Valdés, Eurofound’s Director, and with staff, in an open and frank exchange about the future of work, evidence-based social policymaking and closer collaboration. The power of knowledge in policy-making is extremely important, emphasised Mr Guy Ryder, ILO Director-General, during his visit to Eurofound on Friday. ‘Investing in knowledge and developing research capacity has been a priority at the ILO since its foundation,’ he said, ‘we strive to provide our tripartite stakeholders around the world with answers to what initiatives work.’ Mr Ryder listened to presentations from Eurofound’s experts on the future of manufacturing, 30 years of social dialogue in Europe, and on active inclusion of those furthest from the labour market. He expressed his appreciation to meet with Eurofound’s staff, to hear and discuss opinions, in an informal setting. Mr Ryder was positive and upbeat about the new European Commission’s approach to social and labour market issues. ‘We hope to remain useful to Europe,’ he said. ‘I feel positive about the prospects of forging closer collaboration with the new European Commission.’ Looking forward, Mr Ryder outlined the ILO’s priorities in the runup to the centenary celebrations of the Geneva-based UN agency in four years time, which include a review of international labour standards, the impact on work of the UN’s millennium goals to end of poverty, a focus on decent work, promoting gender equality at work, and establish a sustainable approach to work and the environment. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-labour-market-industrial-relations/tackling-the-challenges-in-the-world-of-work
EUROFOUND_UNK_0324	2015-02-27	UNK	Listening to Eurofound’s stakeholders / Eurofound News, February 2015	In January, Eurofound launched a wide-ranging round of consultations with key stakeholders in Brussels to determine their immediate information needs and discuss medium-term priorities. Eurofound’s Director and Deputy Director had meetings with Stefaan Hermans, Head of Cabinet of Commissioner Thyssen, and with Michel Servoz, Director General DG Employment. A presentation of Eurofound’s achievements in 2014 and highlights of the 2015 work programme to the Employment and Social Affairs Committee of the European Parliament on 29 January provided the opportunity for informal exchange with a number of MEPs. Eurofound also touched base with the European social partners in meetings with Bernadette Ségol and Józef Niemiec, General Secretary and Deputy General Secretary respectively of the European Trade Union Confederation. Meanwhile, the views of BusinessEurope were explored with Markus Beyrer, Director General of the organisation. Consultations will continue and will inform the 2016 work programme as well as the medium-term strategy for 2017–2020.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/listening-to-eurofounds-stakeholders-eurofound-news-february-2015
EUROFOUND_UNK_0325	2015-03-05	UNK	International Womens Day on 8 March 2015	The goal of gender equality, now long established in the treaties and policy objectives of the European Union, continues to prove elusive. Gender difference is still evident in patterns of access to the labour market, in employment patterns and working conditions, all reflective of persistent gender segregation. The closing of gender gaps in labour market variables, such as employment and unemployment rates and pay levels, has been one of the main objectives of EU policy. Gender differences in time spent in paid and unpaid work are important in shaping working conditions for women and men. When paid working hours, hours spent in commuting to and from work and unpaid work time are all combined, the EWCS data found that women work, on average, 64 hours a week compared to the 53 hours worked by men. This can be explained by the fact that women spend 26 hours, on average, on caring activities, compared with the 9 hours spent by men, even though men devote more time to paid work (41 hours, compared with 34 hours spent by women). One of the main issues related to gender and paid work involves the prevalence of part-time work, which can be viewed both positively and negatively. Certain female- dominated occupations, such as care services and cleaning, have particularly high shares of part-time work. However, part-time work is often found at the lower end of the occupational distribution, with employees often excluded from benefits and disadvantaged in terms of access to promotion. Men are much more likely than women to work longer than the 48 hours set out by the EU Working Time Directive, with the exception of those in teaching and clerical jobs. However, there are also many women who work long hours – for example, in sales, hospitality management, agriculture and the service industry. Men in the public sector are around half as likely to work long hours as their counterparts in the private sector and for women the effect is even stronger. Most people in full-time work would like to work less, with men declaring a preference for a 38-hour week, and women a 33-hour week. Below is a selection of recent Eurofound publications highlighted on International Womens' Day 2015. ef1349image.png 5th EWCS - Women, men and working conditions in Europe Despite much legislative progress in gender equality over the past 40 years, there are still gender gaps across many aspects of the labour market. Inequalities are still evident in areas such as access to the labour market, employment patterns and associated working conditions. This report explores gender differences across several dimensions of working conditions, examining relevant country differences, analysing the different occupational groups of both men and women, and comparing the public and private sectors. It also looks at the impact of the crisis on gender segregation in employment. Based on findings from the fifth European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS), conducted in 2010, the analysis offers a striking picture of women and men at work across 34 European countries today. ef1266image.png 5th EWCS - Sustainable work and the ageing workforce Achieving work environments that make work sustainable over a lifetime is a key facet of the promotion of longer working lives. This study - based on the fifth European Working Conditions Survey - considers the dimensions of work that have proved essential to the understanding of work sustainability: working conditions; physical and psychological health; the expressive dimension of work; reconciliation of working and non-working time; and socioeconomic conditions. It examines the influence of these factors on how older workers perceive the sustainability of their work, taking account of differences between workers in terms of age, occupation and gender. ef1182image.png Fifth European Working Conditions Survey - Overview report Work plays a significant role in the lives of people, companies and society at large. Since its inception, the European Union has paid considerable attention to work, and improving working conditions is one of its key policy goals. The European Working Conditions Survey series (the ‘EWCS’) aims to: Measure working conditions across European countries on a harmonised basis; analyse relationships between different aspects of working conditions; identify groups at risks and issues of concern, as well as areas of progress; monitor trends over time; and contribute to European policy development, in particular on quality of work and employment issues ef1264image.png Third European Quality of Life Survey - Quality of life in Europe: Impacts of the crisis What determines life satisfaction and happiness? How do we value our social situation and immediate surroundings? How has this changed with the economic crisis? For the third wave of the European Quality of Life survey, 35,500 Europeans in all EU Member States were interviewed, in an effort to gain insights to these questions. This overview report presents findings and trends and shows that the impacts of the recession are indeed noticeable and measurable in some areas, while in others there are more long-term developments to be observed. ef1359image.png 3rd EQLS Quality of life in Europe - Subjective well-being This report assesses the impact of the crisis on the subjective well-being of Europeans. In 2011, GDP per capita in 22 out of the then 27 EU Member States was below 2008 levels, and unemployment rates were higher in 25 out of the 27. These indicators demonstrate worrying trends, but the report goes deeper, trying to answer various questions: What is the real impact on people’s lives? Who has been hit hardest? Where have there been positive wellbeing patterns? What explains the variation in well-being across Europe? How can policy increase or stem the fall in well-being in the future? It concludes that the crisis may not be affecting everyone’s well-being equally, nor all aspects of well-being. ef1458image.png Social partners and gender equality in Europe This report assesses the role of the social partners in advancing gender equality in Europe. It explores the actions taken within the different national frameworks of industrial relations and against the ranking of the Member States on the Gender Equality Index. Overall, significant actions are being taken by European and national social partner organisations and companies in support of gender equality. These tend to put the emphasis on campaigning and educational activities and the integration of work–life balance measures in national policies or collective agreements. ef1443image.png Psychosocial risks in Europe: Working conditions and interventions Acknowledging the complexity of the relationship between health and work, the report presents comparative information on the prevalence of psychosocial risks among workers and examines the associations between these risks and health and well-being. It also looks at the extent to which establishments take action to tackle psychosocial risks and describes interventions that can be adopted in companies. An overview of policies in six Member States is also included. This report assesses the role of the social partners in advancing gender equality in Europe. It explores the actions taken within the different national frameworks of industrial relations and against the ranking of the Member States on the Gender Equality Index. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/international-womens-day-on-8-march-2015
EUROFOUND_UNK_0326	2015-02-27	UNK	Increases in value of minimum wage in 2015 / Eurofound news, February 2015	Eurofound’s latest update to its EurWORK Observatory of Working Life looks at developments in the minimum wage across Europe’s Member States. While minimum wages have often been frozen or seen only moderate increases during the years of crisis, the past two years have witnessed a cautious return in most Member States to growth in the minimum wage. The lower level of inflation (or deflation in some cases) means that the value of the statutory minimum wage has increased in real terms as of 1 January 2015 – considerably in most Member States. However, recent developments in the euro exchange rate against the currencies of the EU’s main trading partners or the devaluation of national currencies not pegged to the euro will, in the main, increase prices of imported goods. It remains to be seen what effect this will have on the purchasing power of those on the minimum wage.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0327	2015-02-19	UNK	Eurofound extensively cited in Social Protection Committee report	The recently published annual review of the Social Protection Committee (SPC) assesses reforms in social policies and social protection over the period 2013–2014. Citing Eurofound’s work extensively, it also makes clear that the Agency’s research into quality of life played a key role in the creation of the review, making specific contributions in terms of content. Investing in children and childcare The Agency’s recently published work on early childhood care – Early childhood care: working conditions, training and quality of services – A systematic review –  fed into the review's discussion on developing a more skilled and motivated workforce – specifically, the benefits in terms of outcomes for children of continuous professional development in building practitioners’  competencies. In discussing investment in children as part of the Social Investment Package, the SPC review cites Eurofound’s report Quality of Life in Europe: Families in the economic crisis. The committee notes Eurofound’s findings on ‘the particular challenges facing lone parents, the greater difficulties facing jobless families since the onset of the crisis’ and the Agency’s call for ‘support policies that protect the most vulnerable types of families‘. Inequality and inclusion In the section on reforms in healthcare and long-term care, the review notes the points made in Eurofound’s recent report Access to healthcare in times of crisis: ‘Poverty and inequalities in access to health care translate into illness, disability to work, dependency and more poverty.’ The review also highlights the role played by Eurofound’s European Quality of Life Survey in providing information on the social and labour market inclusion of young people – specifically, the perceived social exclusion index derived from EQLS findings. This ‘represents a valuable complement to the AROPE [at risk of poverty or social exclusion] rate. The index measures the extent to which young people actually feel excluded.’ The Social Protection Committee and Eurofound The Social Protection Committee (SPC) advises national government ministers in the Employment and Social Affairs Council. As part of its mandate, the SPC monitors social conditions in the EU and the development of social protection policies in Member States – in particular, on the issues of social inclusion, health care, long-term care and pensions. Eurofound’s upcoming work on quality of life is expected to contribute to next year’s annual review. Key themes the Agency will explore in its research in 2015 include mobility and integration of migrants, the role of the private sector in delivering public services and further work on the quality of childcare services.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/eurofound-extensively-cited-in-social-protection-committee-report
EUROFOUND_UNK_0328	2015-02-27	UNK	Eurofound and the Latvian EU Presidency / Eurofound News, February 2015	Over the first half of 2015, Eurofound will be contributing its expertise in a number of key fields to Latvia’s Presidency of the European Council: job creation, social dialogue, job quality, social cohesion and youth employment. Eurofound will present new data from its research findings at a series of high-level conferences, meetings and events during the six-month Presidency. The Agency has already been involved in a number of events in Riga, presenting its findings at meetings of the Social Protection and Employment Committees and at a conference of the Eastern Partnership Youth Forum. On 30 March, Eurofound – in cooperation with the Latvian Presidency – will be launching the overview report of the third wave of its European Company Survey, in Brussels. And in Riga on 31 March, Eurofound will contribute to a Presidency conference – ‘The role of social dialogue in facilitating quality jobs’ – which also looks at promoting the transfer of best practices of social dialogue between Member States and social partners.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0329	2015-02-17	UNK	Big differences in incidence of industrial action in companies across the EU	"The global economic and financial crisis brought to an end an era of relative calm with regard to collective industrial action, and the highest incidence of industrial action was not surprisingly found in countries worst hit by the crisis. This is according to recent survey findings from Eurofound. Wednesday 18 February is the international day of action in defence of the right to strike, initiated by the International Trade Union Confederation ITUC. 	Eurofound’s 3rd European Company Survey 2013 shows that almost one in 10 private sector establishments in the EU28 was faced with a strike lasting a day or more between 2008 and 2013. 	Such strikes of a day or more were the most prevalent form of industrial action across Europe over the three years since the 2008 crisis (9% of private sector establishments), followed by work stoppages or strikes of less than a day (7%) and work-to-rule or refusal to do overtime (6%). 	Across the EU, one-third of industrial action was company specific, two-thirds were ‘general’ (such as sectoral or national level issues). In company specific industrial action, a balanced agreement was reached in 44% of cases, while in 35% of cases the action ended unresolved. 	Greece recorded the highest levels of work to rule (17% of establishments), strikes of less than one day (30% of establishments), strikes of more than one day (32% of establishments). Cyprus had the highest levels of blockade of occupation (16% of all establishments). 	Eurofound offers comparative data on days lost to industrial action, where information is available and comparisons are possible. Country specific focus Comparison of industrial action in 2013 and 2012, national statistical sources, not comparable across countries: Germany: Fewer days lost to strikes, from 630,000 in 2012 to 551,000 in 2012. Denmark: Fewer strikes (197 in 2013 compared to 225 in 2012) but massive increase of working days lost, from 10,200 in 2012 to 930,300 in 2013. Can be attributed to lockout of teachers in April 2013. Ireland: Low incidence of strike but more than doubled from 2012 to 2013 (12 strikes in 2013, 5 in 2012) with almost twice as many working days lost (14,965 in 2013, 8,486 in 2012). In the first half of 2014 the 11,000  days lost, added to the days lost due to industrial action in the first half of the year, brings the total for January-September 2014 to 19,238 – some 4,273 more than the 12-month total for 2013, with 2014 now set to the most disruptive year, due to industrial action, since 2009. Poland: Fewer strikes (17 in 2013 compared to 93 in 2012) but higher incidence of working days lost (12,900 in 2013 compared to 10,100 in 2013). Sweden: 2013 was a peaceful year despite a very big bargaining round. Seven conflicts occurred with 7084 working days lost due to conflict. This is much less than earlier years with similar bargaining rounds (National Mediation Office). UK: Official data on labour disputes published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on 19 March showed that, during the 12 months up to and including January 2014: the number of stoppages was 119 (50 public sector; 69 private sector); the number of working days lost was 447,000 (363,000 in the public sector; 85,000 in the private sector; and the number of workers involved was 369,000. The number of days lost and workers involved was substantially higher than in the 12 months to January 2013, though the number of disputes was slightly lower. In the month of January 2014, there were 15 stoppages (5 public sector; 10 private sector), 8,000 working days lost (1,000 public sector; 7,000 private sector) and 25,000 workers involved.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0330	2015-02-06	UNK	'Our young people need jobs and they need them now'	On 4 February, the European Commission proposed making €1 billion from the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) available as early as 2015. This move would increase by up to 30 times the pre-financing that Member States are receiving to boost youth employment. Funding the Youth Guarantee All EU Member States are making substantial efforts to implement the Youth Guarantee and are currently putting programmes in place at national level. This proposed increase to YEI pre-financing could help make the Youth Guarantee a reality faster in the 20 Member States with youth unemployment rates over 25% in 2012. The YEI will fund activities to help those young people aged under 25 (or 30 in some Member States) who are not in employment, education or training (NEETs) enter the labour market. For instance, this can mean a first job experience, traineeships or apprenticeships, further education and training, hiring subsidies, second chance programmes for early school-leavers or business start-up support. The €6.4 billion YEI funding is comprised of €3.2 billion from a new dedicated EU budget line to increase youth employment (frontloaded to the first two years of the Commission's 2014–2020 programming period) which is matched by at least €3.2 billion from the European Social Fund national allocations. Why increase pre-financing of the YEI? The new Juncker Commission has highlighted as a key priority a speedier Youth Guarantee implementation. Valdis Dombrovskis, Vice-President for the Euro and Social Dialogue said that with this new proposal ‘the Commission sends a clear signal that youth employment continues to be high on our political agenda.’ The initial pre-financing of 1% of the total YEI allocation (or 1.5% for Member States receiving financial assistance) has proved insufficient, leading to delays in implementing national programmes. The accelerated funding would increase the pre-financing rate to up to 30%, meaning that Member States could receive a third of the allocated €3.2 billion YEI funding once their operational programmes are adopted. In 2014, 28 out of the 34 operational programmes containing YEI funding have been adopted. The remaining four have been finalised and are pending adoption. It is estimated that up to 650,000 young people in the EU could benefit from the funding in 2015. Marianne Thyssen, Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, said: Our young people need jobs and they need them now. It is unacceptable that today more than one young person out of five on the labour market cannot find a job. By making more funding available sooner, we can get more young people back to work: I am determined to make this happen. The European Parliament and the Council will now have to discuss the Commission’s proposal and adopt it before it can enter into force. Need to help young people Eurofound has estimated the loss to European economies of having 7.5 million NEETs at €162 billion in 2012. The failure to secure a job is delaying their transition into adulthood and preventing them from achieving economic independence. On 29 January, Eurofound participated in the seminar ‘Youth Guarantee: From regional to local implementation’ in Brussels, organised by the European Association of Regional and Local Authorities for Lifelong Learning (EARLALL). Representatives from five local authorities in different Member States shared their early experiences of Youth Guarantee implementation. Across the majority of interventions, stakeholder cooperation in delivery, guidance and outreach activities, functioning VET systems and dual training provisions were highlighted as important components of putting Youth Guarantee measures in place.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0331	2015-02-02	UNK	Hungary: Social partners agree 2015 wage increases late in the year	Discussions on the minimum wage increase and the recommended wage increase started late in 2014, with the social partners having limited room for negotiation. The government had practically set the figures in its budget for 2015 and the relevant legislation was adopted by the parliament before discussions with the social partners gained momentum. In these circumstances, a substantial wage increase was not expected for 2015. The government and the social partners met several times in the fourth quarter of the year, but without tangible results. Legally, the government has the right to announce a new minimum wage without the consent of the social partners. An agreement was eventually reached by the social partners on 29 December 2014, and was then signed by the Minister of National Economy. This sets the minimum wage at HUF 105,000 (€340) a month and HUF 122,000 (€400) for graduates and skilled workers from 1 January 2015. The recommended wage increase, which orients collective bargaining at lower levels, is 3%–4%.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0332	2015-01-29	UNK	Eurofound launches the fieldwork for the 6th European Working Conditions Survey	Eurofound launches the sixth edition of its survey assessing working conditions across Europe (Dublin, Ireland): On Monday 2 February 2015 Eurofound will launch the fieldwork for the 6th European Working Conditions Survey (6th EWCS). Based on interviews with over 43,000 workers, this critical and timely research tracks the current state of working conditions in Europe, highlights the quality of work and employment, and monitors changing trends. The first findings of the 6th EWCS will be presented at the end of 2015. The European Working Conditions Surveys (EWCS) provide valuable and unique comparative information about working conditions, including issues such as working time, health and safety at work, work organisation, work-life balance, training, and overall satisfaction with working conditions. The underlying aim is to help policymakers improve overall living and working conditions. To date, Eurofound has carried out five European Working Conditions Surveys (1991, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010). This sixth wave of the survey will build on the lessons learned from the previous five surveys and will provide a rich portrait of workplace trends in Europe over the last 25 years. The survey offers an opportunity for workers to make their voices heard about the state of their working conditions and about how working conditions and quality of work affect their lives. In cooperation with Ipsos, Eurofound will interview around 43,000 workers in 35 European countries during the period February to June 2015. Interviews will be carried out face-to-face in the person's home. The collected information will be treated in the strictest confidentiality, guaranteeing the anonymity of interviewees. The survey targets a random sample of working people 1,000 to 3,300 people per country.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0333	2015-02-05	UNK	Marking 30 years of European social dialogue	It is 30 years since the launch of cooperation with European social partners at Val Duchesse which aimed to involve the European social partners in the internal market process. Three decades later, European social dialogue is well established. European tripartite social dialogue, between European institutions and employer and worker representatives, takes place within the Tripartite Social Summit for Growth and Employment, while European bipartite social dialogue between the European employer and trade union organisations takes place within the cross-industry social dialogue committee and 43 sectoral social dialogue committees, the latter covering more than 75% of Europe's workforce. To mark the 30th anniversary and to give a new impetus to social dialogue at EU level, the European Commission is holding a high level event on 5 March 2015 with leaders of European and national employer and worker organisations. With a view to strengthening social dialogue, the Commission will seek, together with the social partners, to ensure a more substantial involvement of social partners in EU governance and in EU policymaking as well as  to support the functioning of industrial relations and social dialogue in the Member States. Social dialogue has been at the core of Eurofound’s work since its inception in 1975. It investigates, for instance, worker participation, collective agreements and industrial relations at company, national and EU level. It also examines how the interests of business and workers may best be reconciled. It looks at the extent to which industrial relations have adapted to the emergence of multinational organisations. It also takes a global perspective, comparing industrial relations systems and outcomes in economies outside the EU, such as the US and Japan.

Marianne Thyssen, Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility commented ahead of the 5 March event: 'Social dialogue is a prerequisite to make our Social Market Economy work. Well-developed structures have been put in place at EU level, resulting in very concrete achievements. We want to build on what has been achieved over the past decades and give social dialogue a fresh impetus. We need a stronger involvement of social partners to develop adequate responses to the main challenges we are facing in Europe. I therefore look forward to the high level event on 5 March, which will bring together leading representatives from the Commission and social partners at European and national level.'	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/labour-market-industrial-relations/marking-30-years-of-european-social-dialogue
EUROFOUND_UNK_0334	2015-01-29	UNK	Member States continue fight against undeclared work / Eurofound news, January 2015	Undeclared work – any paid activities that are lawful forms of work but are not declared to the public authorities – continues to be a source of concern to public authorities across the EU. According to a Special Eurobarometer Report from 2014, almost a third of Europeans (32%) said they knew someone who had worked without declaring at least some of their income to tax or social security institutions. A recently published update from Eurofound’s EurWORK observatory demonstrates the steps that Member States are taking to combat undeclared work. Latvia has temporarily increased its monitoring of certain sectors most implicated in the shadow economy, Lithuania and Slovenia have each introduced their own service voucher system as an alternative to undeclared cash payments, while in Estonia the hiring of a new employee must be reported to the authorities at least one day before they start work, in contrast to the previous regulation whereby employers could wait up to 30 days after employment began.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0338	2015-01-23	UNK	Sustainable work is the future of work / Eurofound News, January 2015	The ageing of European societies requires that more of the working-age population is brought into work and everyone’s working life is extended. However, work itself is often the reason why people leave employment. Work may not adapt to the different needs of different people, may not change as workers get older, or may even damage their health, forcing them out of the workforce. To make work sustainable over the life course means adapting work so that people remain skilled, fit and motivated. Examining how this can be done in practice is a key research priority for Eurofound, highlighted by the recent publication of the latest issue of Foundation Focus, which takes as its theme Sustainable work: Towards better and longer working lives. The Focus will complement Eurofound’s latest online spotlight, ‘Sustainable work – The future of working life in Europe’. This will give visitors direct access to its latest findings on the topic, information on events and updates on developments in the area.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/sustainable-work-is-the-future-of-work-eurofound-news-january-2015
EUROFOUND_UNK_0339	2015-01-23	UNK	Gender equality and active ageing high on the agenda when ETUC visits Eurofound	Claudia Menne, Confederal Secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) visited Eurofound on 21 January 2015 for talks with Juan Menéndez-Valdés, Eurofound’s Director, Erika Mezger, Deputy Director, and senior staff. The focus was on gender equality and maternity protection, active ageing and the care economy in Europe. ETUC represents the interest of workers at EU level, working for a Europe with a strong social dimension, which focuses on workers' interests and well-being. It promotes the European social model that enabled Europe to become a prosperous, competitive region. ETUC is represented on Eurofound’s Governing Board by Józef Niemiec, Deputy Secretary-General of the ETUC. In the run-up to the joint 2015 European social partner collaboration programme, which will be put on the table at the end of February 2015, Claudia Menne heard presentations by Eurofound’s senior researchers on social partners and gender equality, maternity protection, and on the care economy in Europe. Policy recommendations are difficult, however, says Ms Menne, and ETUC is in dialogue with BusinessEurope, the European Commission and other actors on an on-going basis. With the new European Commission focusing on job creation and growth within the digital agenda, Ms Menne argues that avoiding stereotyping in this new approach is vital. Ms Menne is also adamant that the EU’s job creation and growth strategy is something that only the European social partners can deliver on. She wants to see more regular exchanges of information between ETUC and Eurofound in order to provide social policymakers with knowledge to assist in the development of social and work-related policies.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-labour-market-industrial-relations/gender-equality-and-active-ageing-high-on-the-agenda-when-etuc-visits-eurofound
EUROFOUND_UNK_0340	2015-01-16	UNK	Policy messages from peer review on Youth Guarantee	The Youth Guarantee is an ambitious model to help tackle the EU’s youth unemployment crisis. All 28 Member States have submitted their Youth Guarantee Implementation Plans and are putting them into action. They are now learning from peer review and looking to the first results of the Youth Guarantee pilot projects underway in various countries. Eurofound research on mapping youth transitions into employment and adulthood shows that damaging and prolonged absences from the labour market, education or training can be avoided via the Youth Guarantee. Peer review The peer review on the Youth Guarantee, hosted by the Finnish government in Helsinki in September 2014, resulted in a range of key policy messages. It brought together more than 30 representatives from 13 Member States and international bodies to discuss the experiences and practices at national level in implementing the Youth Guarantee. As well as Finland, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland and Sweden took part. This event was an opportunity to learn about the Finnish Youth Guarantee model, look at the first results of the Youth Guarantee pilot projects and discuss the experiences and practices taking place at national level.  In particular, it focused on the revised Youth Guarantee model introduced in Finland in January 2013. The Finnish Youth Guarantee scheme was first introduced in 2005 and initially revised in 2010. As highlighted in a Eurofound study on experiences in Finland, from 2013 the target group includes not only unemployed young people aged under 25, but also young graduates aged under 30. The scheme aims to reduce the amount of time young people spend in the NEET status (not in employment, education or training) by improving their chances of finding a job or an educational opportunity. The study shows the success of the guarantee in Finland in helping to reduce youth unemployment: in 2011, nearly 84% of young job-seekers received a successful intervention within three months of registering as unemployed. Pilot projects At a seminar in Brussels on 9 September, the European Commission met with coordinators of 18 Youth Guarantee pilot projects launched in seven Member States between August and December 2013 at the request of the European Parliament: Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Spain and the UK. The first findings report on the Youth Guarantee pilot projects (1.5 MB PDF) shows that they are ‘supporting innovation and development in the school-to-work and youth employment arenas’, allowing key aspects of the Youth Guarantee model to be tried and tested. A total of 3,218 young people have taken part in the pilots during the first half of the project period. The findings show there is potential to make positive changes to school-to-work transitions and youth employment services, with clear benefits also emerging from involving employers and working in partnerships. These partnerships are now encouraged to review the process and learn from it, to bring this knowledge into future planning on making projects sustainable, and to share outcomes, impacts and lessons learnt. The year-long pilot projects are intended to provide Member States with the practical experience necessary to assist in implementing their national Youth Guarantee schemes. They will do so using allocated resources from the €6 billion Youth Employment Initiative and the European Social Fund. Policy messages The key policy messages that emerged from the peer review relate to commitment and partnerships, engaging employers and monitoring and evaluation of Youth Guarantee schemes. Political commitment and partnerships Political commitment is a strong determining factor in effective design and delivery of national schemes. Partnerships between various organisations and actors, including young people, are crucial in the design and implementation of policies. These partnerships should be established at national, regional and local levels to maximise impact. Clearly allocating roles and responsibilities between partners can help create a coordinated service delivery and encourage a stronger commitment to the process. Sharing and centralising the data associated with each young person’s experience is central to supporting their Youth Guarantee journey. Employer engagement Employers’ involvement is necessary for the successful design and delivery of schemes. Employers can be encouraged to buy in to the scheme, for example if the administrative burden is minimised, there is a range of placement types or incentives are linked to the quality of the apprenticeships or on-the-job training. Monitoring and evaluation Ongoing monitoring of a scheme allows feedback to circulate to improve different elements of the scheme. Using a robust evidence base is key to determining what works and what does not. Assessing whether young people are receiving a good quality offer is an important step Read the full policy document: Key policy messages - Peer Review on 'Youth Guarantee' - Helsinki (656 KB PDF).  Avoiding a lost generation The Youth Guarantee will again be part of the agenda at a high-level seminar in Brussels on 19 January 2015, Avoiding a lost generation. The event will be hosted by Notre Europe – Jacques Delors Institute, the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and the European Economic and Social Committee. Participants include Heinz Koller, Regional Director for Europe at the International Labour Organization, Marianne Thyssen, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, László Andor, Senior Fellow at the Hertie School of Governance and former EU Commissioner, as well as representatives from the European Commission and government ministries.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0343	2014-12-19	UNK	Movement of workers within the EU rising slowly, but still low	The numbers of people moving country within the EU is on the rise again following a sharp drop during the economic crisis. In 2012 , 6.6 million EU citizens were working in an EU country other than their home country, according to the EU Labour Force Survey. The main destination countries are Germany and the United Kingdom. Outflows of nationals from southern European countries – Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain – have been increasing as a consequence of the economic crisis and rising unemployment rates in their countries of origin. Nonetheless, the biggest share of intra-EU migrant movements is still from eastern European Member States westwards. Labour shortages persist across the EU despite high unemployment; bottlenecks exist, and have done so for several years, in recruitment to high-skilled occupations in the health professions, ICT, engineering, sales and finance. The European Commission wants to see more dynamism in European labour markets and the use of mobility by countries as a means of tackling imbalances, thereby increasing employment across the EU as whole. National-level doubts The Commission, however, is up against rising resistance to immigration among politicians and the public in the Member States experiencing comparatively higher inflows of nationals from other EU countries – Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany and the UK. Public debate in these countries expresses fears that immigrants are abusing the welfare system, taking jobs from native workers, and enabling employers to undercut established pay rates. Evidence from research repeatedly finds that EU migrant workers are more likely to be economically active than nationals and less likely to claim social benefits. The employment rate of EU migrant workers, for instance, is consistently higher than that of nationals – 66% and 64.5% respectively in 2012, according to Eurostat data. Anxiety about immigration is hardly warranted by its magnitude: migration within the EU is low compared with other major economic blocks, at a level of just 0.3% across the 27 EU Member States in 2010, compared with the USA, for instance, where the figure is 2.4% across the 50 states. Impediments What is keeping mobility low? A Eurobarometer survey found that lack of proficiency in the language of potential destination countries is the major barrier, cited by over half of respondents. The next most common disincentive, cited by 24%, was lack of confidence among respondents that they would be able to find a job.  Practical difficulties encountered or expected in relation to working abroad (Special Eurobarometer, 337/ Wave 72.5) image002.png Policy responses Member States are not making major efforts to encourage mobility, even in countries where there are labour market shortages. Policy measures are few; for instance, publicly funded language courses are made available free to EU newcomers upon arrival in just 14 Member States. Cross-border mobility would also be easier if citizens' qualifications were recognised across the whole Union. The European Qualifications Framework (EQF) was meant to address this problem by providing employers with a means of translating any qualification presented by an EU national by reference to the EQF level, allowing them to compare it with qualifications in their own country. The EQF, however, has not yet been fully implemented. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to promoting greater mobility, as Member States face very different challenges. Eurofound’s recent report Labour mobility in the EU: Recent trends and policies examines the policy measures already adopted by governments and provides some pointers on further directions that policy could take.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/labour-market/movement-of-workers-within-the-eu-rising-slowly-but-still-low

It is testament to the vision of the European forefathers that in those early years they already saw the need to establish a European Agency with the unique mandate of providing knowledge on social and work-related issues.  The goal then was to help policymakers shape a better future for its citizens.  Forty years on and now charting 28 countries and 520 million people, that goal remains as critical today as ever before. As we embrace the challenges of the next decade and beyond, Eurofound will take this anniversary year as an opportunity to further deepen its links with our core stakeholders, the social partners, governments and Institutions, and build on our vast network at EU and national level to continue to provide high-quality, policy-relevant information which can be used by policymakers to mould the fair and competitive Europe to which we all aspire. To mark this occasion, a series of initiatives and events will take place and we have produced a 40 years anniversary brochure and desk calendar which we hope will serve as a positive reminder of the effort and progress made in the area of social policy over the previous decades, as well as Eurofound’s commitment to what still has to come. Created in 1975, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) was set up to contribute to the planning and establishment of better living and working conditions through action designed to increase and disseminate knowledge likely to assist this development.  Explore Eurofound's interactive 40th anniversary timeline and brochure. eurofound_timeline_director_deputy_directors_40th_anniversary.jpg   Sign up here for regular news and reminders about the publications, events and celebrations in 2015.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0345	2014-12-17	UNK	Austria: Court wage ruling a big blow for airline	The European Court of Justice has ruled that Austrian Airlines was acting unlawfully when it imposed the collective agreement of a subsidiary on all its 2,300 flight personnel. This is a major blow for the former national airline carrier which was sold to German carrier Lufthansa in 2008 and has struggled ever since to become profitable. As part of cost-cutting measures, management presented a new collective agreement with less favourable employment and working conditions in 2012. After the trade union and works council representatives rejected the proposal, the company urged the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber (WKÖ) to cancel the two existing agreements in May of the same of year – one for its ‘old’ personnel and the other for employees of its former subsidiary Lauda Air. At the same time the company transferred the flight personnel to its subsidiary Tyrolean Airways and began to impose the less favourable Tyrolean Airways agreement which, among other things, meant a 25% wage cut. In response to this measure vida, the trade union representing Austria Airlines’ flight personnel, cancelled the Tyrolean agreement. According to the European Court of Justice, the old agreements continue to apply until a new agreement has been reached. What exactly this means in terms of outstanding compensation for the respective workers remains to be decided by the Austrian High Court. The trade union has urged management to reopen negotiations about a new collective agreement.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-industrial-relations-law-and-regulation/austria-court-wage-ruling-a-big-blow-for-airline
EUROFOUND_UNK_0346	2014-12-17	UNK	Spain: Social partners gear up for the next tripartite agreement 2015–2017	Social partners appear to be going into the latest round of tripartite discussions with increased optimism. Juan Rosell, President of the Spanish Confederation of Business Organisations (CEOE), said improvements in the economic situation in the country meant any Agreement for Employment and Social Dialogue should include the prospect of salary increases. Tripartite talks began on 4 July 2014 when the Minister of Employment, Fátima Báñez, meet with employers’ representatives and trade unions. Discussions were held with Ignacio Fernández Toxo, General Secretary of the Trade Union Confederation of Workers’ Commissions (CCOO) and Cándido Méndez, General Secretary of the General Workers’ Confederation (UGT) over the enhancement of social dialogue and the signing of a new salary agreement. Also at the talks were Rosell and Jesús Terciado, President of the Spanish Confederation of SMEs (CEPYME) from the employers’ side. Although no specific agreement was reached, the meeting implied advancements towards future pacts among social partners. Two weeks later, on 29 July 2014, the Spanish government signed an agreement with social partners on a collection of proposals to be discussed to promote economic growth and employment. The aim of the meeting, attended by the President of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, was an agreement which presented several proposals and key issues to be discussed at tripartite level to improve the situation of the Spanish economy and the labour market. The discussions would be between representatives from the public authorities, trade unions and employers’ representatives. In September 2014, Toni Ferrer from UGT said the Agreement for Employment and Social Dialogue 2012–2014 had not yet been renegotiated. The deadline of the agreement was 31 December 2014 and social partners needed to agree on a new agreement for 2015. He also said the 2012–2014 agreement could not just be extended with the same terms and conditions, because the economic cycle had changed since it was signed. He said it was necessary to modify and adapt the agreement to the new economic situation. The new agreement was expected to cover the 2015–2017 period. Meanwhile, on 18 September 2014, Juan Rosell said the economic context had progressed over the last couple of years and agreed on the need for a new Agreement for Employment and Social Dialogue to include a sectorial perspective on salaries. He said that, while the 2012–2014 agreement saw the social partners settle for wage moderation, for the next deal it was expected that some salary increases would be approved for some specific economic sectors that were showing signs of economic recovery.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-industrial-relations/spain-social-partners-gear-up-for-the-next-tripartite-agreement-2015-2017
EUROFOUND_UNK_0347	2014-12-17	UNK	Croatia: New law on representativeness in Croatia	A new Law on Representation (OG 93/14) has defined the representativeness criteria for the conclusion of collective agreements in Croatia. If only one union represents an organisation’s employees, then that union must be recognised as the representative union for collective bargaining. This is regardless of the number of union members and the share of employees in union membership. If more than one trade union represents the employees at an organisation, then all these unions must agree which union or unions are the representative ones. The new law stipulates that a collective agreement is valid only if it is signed by the representative trade union, or unions that represent at least 50% of the members of the representative trade union. The agreement on the representativeness has to state the number of members of each representative trade union. If the trade unions cannot agree on the trade union representativeness, then it is decided by the Commission for determining the representativeness.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/industrial-relations-law-and-regulation/croatia-new-law-on-representativeness-in-croatia
EUROFOUND_UNK_0348	2014-12-17	UNK	Austria: Anti-wage dumping and social dumping law updated	Tough new anti-wage and social dumping laws have been introduced by the Ministry for Employment, Social Affairs and Consumer Protection (BMASK). Legislation was first introduced in 2011 in anticipation of the end of the transitional restriction for workers from the new Member States to access the Austrian labour market. The most important part of the new legislation specifies that underpayment of workers is no longer considered a matter of civil law. Employers who pay their employees less than required by collective agreements now violate administrative law. In Austria, more than 90% of the economy is covered by a collective agreement. This has two important consequences. First, the authorities can take legal action even if the affected worker does not want to sue their employer. Secondly, employers who are found guilty by the administrative court do not only have to pay the difference between what they paid and what they had to pay – including additional social security contributions – they also face a fine of up to €50,000. The amendment will expand the scope of control in the construction industry, the sector with the highest incidence of underpayments. In future, inspectors will not only check the basic wage and supplements, but all wage elements, including social security contributions. At the same time fines for not presenting proper wage documentation are increased from a maximum of €5,000 to a maximum of €10,000 and will be imposed per affected worker rather than as a lump sum. In cases where employers are fined for underpaying workers, the affected workers will be informed by the authorities to give them the opportunity to sue the respective employer for the outstanding salary. Finally the amendment also improves the possibilities for the authorities to demand security deposits from contractors in case of a reasonable suspicion that a subcontractor is underpaying its staff.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-labour-market-industrial-relations-law-and-regulation/austria-anti-wage-dumping-and-social-dumping-law-updated
EUROFOUND_UNK_0349	2015-01-12	UNK	Eurofound’s 2015 annual programme of work	(Dublin, Ireland): Eurofound’s 2013–2016 work programme outlines a dual challenge for the European Union and the Member States: finding a way out of the crisis while pursuing the mid-term ambition of achieving progress towards a competitive and fair Europe. Although the financial situation in Europe seems to have stabilised and most countries are technically out of the recession, the recovery is still very modest and needs to be consolidated. The crisis cannot be considered as being over. The year 2015 marks the third year of implementation of Eurofound’s four-year work programme 2013–2016, ‘From crisis to recovery: Better informed policies for a competitive and fair Europe’. The activities proposed in the annual programme for 2015 are designed to contribute to achieving Eurofound’s strategic objective of providing high-quality, timely and policy-relevant knowledge as input to better informed policies, in four priority areas: Increasing labour market participation and combating unemployment by creating jobs, improving labour market functioning and promoting integration Improving working conditions and making work sustainable throughout the life course Developing industrial relations to ensure equitable and productive solutions in a changing policy context Improving standards of living and promoting social cohesion in the face of economic disparities and social inequalities Many activities launched in 2014 were designed to be continued or complemented by follow-up projects during 2015. In addition, a number of new projects will commence. The 2015 work programme also takes into account the sequence and work processes of Eurofound’s flagship activities, its three pan-European surveys and the observatories, which require the allocation of resources in each annual programme. Eurofound will continue to pay specific attention to the global, sectoral and national dimension in its activities. Agreements with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and direct agreements with some other countries are in place to conduct the working conditions survey outside Europe, facilitating a comparison of these countries with the Europe-wide survey results. All Eurofound’s comparative findings are of great interest at national level. Where possible, contextual information at Member State level is provided, and multi-lingual summary pages help to increase the uptake of data and analysis for target groups at Member State level. Also, long-standing cooperation agreements with a number of EU Agencies are the basis for the exchange of data sources and for joint initiatives in the area of research, events and operation systems in 2015. These agencies are: the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE); the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA); the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop); the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA), and the European Training Foundation (ETF). Eurofound looks forward to collaborating with the Latvian and Luxembourg EU Presidencies, highlighting the results of the third European Company Survey, launching the first findings of the sixth European Working Conditions Survey and a series of other social and work related research. Also during the year, Eurofound will, for the first time, chair the Network of EU Agencies and drive on the priorities that unite all EU agencies in contributing to the lives of European citizens.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0350	2014-12-17	UNK	Spain: Inditex signs agreement to protect workers’ rights	Fashion retailer Inditex says it is helping protect the rights of workers by renewing a Global Framework Agreement. The agreement protects not only people working directly for the company, but also an estimated one million garment workers in around 6,000 supplier factories around the world. The agreement covering the management of the value chain was signed with the trade union federation IndustriALL in July 2014 at the headquarters of the International Labour Organization in Geneva. It sets out ways for monitoring and supervising the value chain, and establishing best practice in areas such as trade union rights, and health and safety. Inditex says that through this agreement it supports freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining as a key axis for a sustainable value chain, providing workers with the mechanisms they need to keep and reinforce their labour rights.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-industrial-relations/spain-inditex-signs-agreement-to-protect-workers-rights
EUROFOUND_UNK_0351	2014-12-17	UNK	Finland: Investment in staff training and worker well-being on the decline	A survey in Finland has found that investment in staff training and employee well-being is on the decline. The findings come from the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health and its annual survey on the state of strategic well-being in Finland. Slightly over half the respondents considered their supervisor to have ‘good or excellent motivation’ in leading work-related well-being. However, only a quarter thought their supervisor had the skills needed, and as few as 12% thought their supervisor had enough time to provide any improvement in the well-being of employees.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions/finland-investment-in-staff-training-and-worker-well-being-on-the-decline
EUROFOUND_UNK_0352	2014-12-17	UNK	UK: Trade union calls for reform of the ‘trigger mechanism’ for requesting works councils	New rules need to be introduced to encourage the creation of works councils, says the Trades Union Congress (TUC). On 17 July 2014, the TUC published a paper called Democracy in the Workplace: Strengthening Information and Consultation. In it the organisation called for a change to the ‘trigger mechanism’ rule requiring 10% of employees to request information and consultation (PDF 287 KB). The paper argues that this will strengthen the Information and Consultation of Employees (ICE) Regulations. It says the trigger mechanism should be replaced, and information and consultation procedures must be available in law if a minimum of five employees request them, or if they are requested by a trade union. The paper also says the introduction of the ICE Regulations did not have the anticipated effect on employer–employee consultation as they are not widely used or understood. It calls for the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS), the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and TUC to work together to produce a basic works council constitution. The research also draws on examples of practice in France, Germany and Sweden to argue the benefits of boosting workplace democracy.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/industrial-relations/uk-trade-union-calls-for-reform-of-the-trigger-mechanism-for-requesting-works-councils
EUROFOUND_UNK_0353	2014-12-17	UNK	Germany: Metalworkers’ union calls for ‘digital agenda’	German metalworkers are calling for new guidelines to protect their working conditions in the digital age. In August 2014, the German Metalworkers’ Union (IG Metall) demanded the drawing up of a ‘digital agenda’. It wants a ‘technological assessment of the anticipated shift in employees’ working conditions due to digitalisation and ‘Industry 4.0’ or ‘smart manufacturing’ – the strategy of the German government promoting the computerisation of the manufacturing industry. The union wants the introduction of guidelines for fair digital work to be implemented in works agreements and collective agreements. Alternatively, it wants legislation to protect employees’ interests and to safeguard minimum working standards.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-industrial-relations/germany-metalworkers-union-calls-for-digital-agenda
EUROFOUND_UNK_0354	2014-12-17	UNK	UK: Two-thirds feel under pressure to work extra hours	Almost two-thirds of UK workers feel under pressure to work extra unpaid hours according to a survey by the Institute of Leadership and Management (ILM). The survey, which covered 1,000 ILM members, also revealed workers typically work one day of unpaid overtime per week (PDF 27 KB). It found overtime was firmly embedded in UK working culture with 65% reporting feeling under pressure to work extra hours. Figures showed 53% felt that they had to work extra hours in order to complete their workloads.  Only 13% of respondents thought that they had a good work–life balance.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions/uk-two-thirds-feel-under-pressure-to-work-extra-hours
EUROFOUND_UNK_0355	2014-12-17	UNK	Germany: Court rules on dispute over subcontractors paying the national minimum wage	Public bodies cannot force their subcontractors to pay the minimum wage to workers, a court has ruled. On 18 September 2014, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) took a decision (C-549/13) against the public procurement legislation of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) which, under the act on binding collective bargaining regulation in public procurement, stipulates that at least a minimum wage (currently €8.62per hour) must be paid by any tenderer and his subcontractors. The court was ruling in the case of the city of Dortmund (NRW) which awarded a contract to the Federal Printing Establishment (Bundesdruckerei). The work was subcontracted to a Polish business operating in Poland. Under the NRW legislation, the Bundesdruckerei was obliged to pay the minimum wage. The ECJ ruled that this legal requirement prevents subcontractors established in other Member State from deriving a competitive advantage from differences in the respective rates of pay. It ruled that NRW legislation goes beyond what is necessary to ensure that the objective of employee protection is met.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-law-and-regulation/germany-court-rules-on-dispute-over-subcontractors-paying-the-national-minimum-wage
EUROFOUND_UNK_0356	2014-12-17	UNK	Germany: Long serving staff should be granted longer periods of notice says court	Workers who have been with companies for an extended period of time should be given longer notice periods says a German court. The German Federal Labour Court affirmed the principle according to which ‘in the case of planned dismissal longer legal periods of notice apply for employees with long tenure’. The court decided that this does not constitute indirect age discrimination. Even though the practice may in some cases possibly discriminate against younger employees, it is justified by the aim of giving older employees better dismissal protection.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/industrial-relations-law-and-regulation/germany-long-serving-staff-should-be-granted-longer-periods-of-notice-says-court
EUROFOUND_UNK_0357	2014-12-17	UNK	Ireland/UK: Construction workers’ unions agree to merger	Two construction unions in the UK and Ireland have agreed to merge. Ireland’s Technical Engineering & Electrical Union (TEEU) and the UK’s Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians (UCATT) concluded the ‘heads of agreement’ which will see members of both organisations covered by transfer of undertakings regulations. Officially, TEEU represents up to 40,000 members, while UCATT has a stated membership of 15,000 in Ireland, though it is understood the actual membership figure is around the 8,000 mark. Both unions have suffered membership falls during the crisis of the past six to seven years. The merged union may take a new name. There have also been talks with the Irish plasterers’ union, the Operative Plasterers & Allied Trades Society of Ireland (OPATSI) on a possible merger with TEEU and UCATT.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/industrial-relations/irelanduk-construction-workers-unions-agree-to-merger
EUROFOUND_UNK_0358	2014-12-17	UNK	Hungary: Forum set up to tackle long-standing transport problems	Moves have been made in Hungary to tackle what have been described as ‘long-standing serious technical, employment and workplace problems affecting public transport’ in the country. A Transport Conciliation Forum was set up by trade unions in Budapest at the end of August 2014. The process was initiated by the National Confederation of Transport Trade Unions (KSZOSZ). It said that by setting up the forum and inviting all political parties to join, it intended to direct the attention of the government and the public to Hungary’s public transport issues. The forum aims to develop ‘meaningful cooperation for better services, based on technical standards to be established jointly, in the spirit of genuine dialogue’.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/social-policies/hungary-forum-set-up-to-tackle-long-standing-transport-problems
EUROFOUND_UNK_0359	2014-12-17	UNK	New country groupings can help better target policymaking	Expansion of EU challenges policymakers Quality of life is becoming an increasingly important focus of policymaking, particularly given the growing interest at European level in moving beyond GDP as the sole measure of progress. Quality of life encompasses a number of different dimensions, including standard of living, access to education and employment, health, family, social and political participation, and subjective well-being. Surveys such as Eurofound’s European Quality of Life Survey generate vital data for decision-makers regarding the situation of European citizens. However, as the EU grows in size and diversity, making sense of the differences and similarities across the Union and gauging the appropriate target countries for particular interventions becomes more complex. Simple binary divisions, such as the ‘new’ Member States versus the EU15, have quickly become outdated, creating the need for classifications that better capture reality. New approaches can help  A recent Eurofound report, Developing a country typology for analysing quality of life in Europe, seeks to do just that, more effectively identifying the issues facing countries, and so enabling more effective responses. An approach that groups countries based on the nature of their dominant quality of life issues can form a useful guide to where policy attention is most needed. In some countries, unemployment is a pressing problem. In others, a low standard of living (even among those employed) remains an urgent issue. As well as helping identify the policy area where attention is most urgent, a grouping of countries on the basis of a multidimensional quality of life perspective allows the interdependence of the dimensions to be assessed and – in turn – a more appropriate policy response constructed. For instance, if unemployment in a country is strongly associated with low levels of education, then education and training needs to be part of that response. Grouping countries accurately For the 34 countries covered in the EQLS 2011–2012 (the 28 EU Member States plus the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Iceland, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey), the report proposes a sorting of the countries into eight groups; this grouping accurately captures differences in many of key domains of quality of life explored in the survey, such as material deprivation, public service deficits and overall quality of life. The use of this eight-country grouping is recommended at the most detailed level, where the focus is on the 34 countries and where the greatest precision is desired. When the focus is on the 28 EU Member States, the report recommends using a five-group system. It is also possible to use a three-group system to present results in an overview fashion; however, doing this will result in the loss of some information.   Countries Eight groups Five groups Three groups Denmark, Finland, Sweden, (Iceland) Nordic Nordic Nordic Austria, Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands Continental Continental and western islands Western Europe Ireland, United Kingdom Western islands Italy, Malta, Portugal, Spain Mediterranean (western) Mediterranean (western) Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia Central and eastern Europe Central and eastern Europe Central and eastern Europe Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania Baltic nations Cyprus, Greece, (Turkey) Mediterranean (eastern) Eastern Mediterranean and Balkan Bulgaria, (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), (Kosovo), (Montenegro), Romania, (Serbia) Balkan countries Note: Countries in parentheses are currently not Member States of the EU.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/quality-of-life/new-country-groupings-can-help-better-target-policymaking
EUROFOUND_UNK_0360	2014-12-17	UNK	UK: Survey shows that unpaid overtime is common in local government and schools	Unpaid overtime is common for many part-time UK workers according to a report by Unison. The union surveyed over 2,600 part-time workers in local government and schools. Over 60% of surveyed workers said they did unpaid overtime every week and 20% said that they were covering the work of a redundant or vacant post as well as their own. Part-time jobs are common in these sectors – 60% of all employees are part-time and 91% of these are women. Unison claims these figures show that workers are being exploited as a result of government cuts.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions/uk-survey-shows-that-unpaid-overtime-is-common-in-local-government-and-schools
EUROFOUND_UNK_0361	2014-12-17	UNK	Spain: Court rejects appeal on labour reform	A court has rejected complaints against sections of the government’s Labour Reform Act. The Parliament of the region of Navarre lodged an appeal with the Spanish Constitutional Court concerning three aspects of the Labour Reform approved in 2012 (Royal Decree-Act 3/2012) which it considered unconstitutional. In July 2014, the Constitutional Court rejected the appeal and ruled that the three sections were constitutional. The court ruling applied to the following aspects. The first is that the contract for entrepreneurs has a probationary period of one year. If the employer does not want to retain an employee after that period, they can dismiss them without giving any severance pay. Secondly, the National Consultative Commission of Collective Agreements (CCNCC) and its equivalent autonomous organisations can decide on the process of ‘descuelgue’ (which could be translated as the ‘leaving’ or ‘taking down’ process). The ‘descuelgue’ is an extraordinary measure which allows the company to stop applying the collective agreement (that is, the employer can apply working conditions that do not comply with the agreement). So if trade unions and employers’ representatives do not reach an agreement on the modification of working conditions, in order to solve the conflict consultative commissions have the power to decide if a company can ‘leave’ the collective agreement and apply different working conditions. Finally, company agreements take precedence over sectorial agreements on aspects relating to working conditions.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/industrial-relations-law-and-regulation/spain-court-rejects-appeal-on-labour-reform
EUROFOUND_UNK_0362	2014-12-17	UNK	UK: Self-employment at highest level in 40 years	Self-employment is at its highest level for 40 years in the UK, where it accounts for a large part of the total rise in employment since 2008. According to analysis from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), across the European Union the UK had the third largest percentage rise in self-employment since 2009 (482 KB PDF). The research shows self-employed workers tend to be older than employees and nearly half a million over 65s are self-employed. This proportion has more than doubled over the past five years. The number of women in self-employment is increasing at a faster rate than the number of men – although men still dominate self-employment. The most common roles are working in the construction industry and as a taxi driver. In recent years the number of self-employed management consultants has increased. Average income from self-employment has fallen by 22% since 2008–2009.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions/uk-self-employment-at-highest-level-in-40-years
EUROFOUND_UNK_0363	2014-12-17	UNK	UK: Welfare-to-work policies ‘incompatible’ with the European Convention on Human Rights	The High Court has ruled that emergency laws relating to the government’s welfare-to-work policies are ‘incompatible’ with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The case resulted from the successful legal challenge lodged by Cait Reilly, who had argued that mandatory participation in an unpaid work placement at a Poundland store had breached her human rights. As a result of the original decision the government introduced emergency legislation which came into effect in March 2013. This made clearer the obligations expected of jobseekers to do all they could to find work so as to retain eligibility for benefits. The legislation also sought to retrospectively legitimise sanctions applied under the previous rules. It was this amendment which the High Court ruling in July 2014 deemed incompatible with the ECHR. It is being reported that, if upheld, the government could be forced to pay compensation of £130 million (€164 million as at 28 November 2014) to those who had sanctions applied incorrectly. The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Iain Duncan Smith, has indicated that the government will appeal against the ruling.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-industrial-relations-law-and-regulation-social-policies/uk-welfare-to-work-policies-incompatible-with-the-european-convention-on-human-rights
EUROFOUND_UNK_0364	2014-12-17	UNK	Italy: Social partners sign deal on working time flexibility	On 14 June 2014 social partners in the steel pipe industry signed an agreement on working time flexibility.   Fim, Fiom and Uilm – the union federations bringing together metalworkers affiliated to Cisl, Cgil and Uil – completed the deal alongside works council representatives and Tenaris Dalmine, a multinational company located near Bergamo in Lombardy. The agreement means the company can change weekly working times, increasing them to up to 48 hours to cope with workload and orders. To avoid use of job security agreements or the wages guarantee fund, overtime hours will be used to compensate for time reduction periods, reducing working time to 32 hours a week. Workers will receive a bonus for work carried out above the daily working time and on Saturdays. The agreement was subject to a ballot in which 67.6% of workers voted in favour. It came into force on 1 July 2014.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/industrial-relations/italy-social-partners-sign-deal-on-working-time-flexibility
EUROFOUND_UNK_0365	2014-12-17	UNK	Estonia: New database fights undeclared work	Changes to tax rules in Estonia have been introduced to tackle the problem of undeclared work. In March 2014, Parliament approved changes to the Taxation Act which allowed for the creation of a database of employees. The aim is to address the issue of undeclared work and illegal ‘envelope wages’ in Estonia and to increase tax revenue. According to the Ministry of Finance, the change has been a success. Between July and August, employers made payments to more than 5,400 people who previously had not received any official income for a year. This has brought in an additional €1.4 million in taxes. A large number of the employees added in the database worked in the construction, retail, and food and drink sectors. The database aims to reduce the administrative burden on employers and increase employees’ sense of security. Employees can now check the database to see if an employer has registered its employees. Checks can be made on whether an employer has paid taxes on an employee and what social grants an employee is entitled to	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/labour-market-law-and-regulation-social-policies-business/estonia-new-database-fights-undeclared-work

The deal was signed by unions Fim-Cisl, Fiom-Cgil and Uilm-Uil, management at the company which is based in Borgo Panigale near Bologna, and its works council. The agreement introduces a seven-day rotation system. Weekly working time will be 30 hours and employees will have two days off every three working days. Wages will not be reduced and workers will be entitled to a hardship allowance. Ducati also pledged additional investment of more than €11 million over the next five years and the hiring of 13 new workers on open-ended contracts. The agreement, which came into force on 1 October 2014, was submitted to a vote by employees, receiving an approval rate of 71%.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-industrial-relations/italy-agreement-signed-on-working-time-flexibility-at-motorcycle-manufacturer
EUROFOUND_UNK_0367	2014-12-17	UNK	France: Law encourages employees to have a stake in their company	A new law in France aims to encourage employees to take ownership of the company they work for. Law No. 2014-856 of 31 July 2014 relating to the social and solidarity-based economy is intended to encourage ownership of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by their employees. It reinforces the sanctions envisaged by the so-called ‘Florange law’ by authorising the Labour Inspectorate to reject an employment protection plan if an employer (with at least 1,000 employees) has failed to comply with their obligation to find a new owner. The law also creates an obligation on owners to inform employees if a stake representing more than 50% of the shares in a company is being sold – otherwise the sale will be rendered invalid. The aim is to allow the workforce to submit their own bid to buy the company.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/industrial-relations-law-and-regulation/france-law-encourages-employees-to-have-a-stake-in-their-company

The main aim is to create a national focal point for dialogue between the unions. It offers a platform for discussions on issues such as occupational health and safety, threats to unemployment, active ageing, precarious work and bullying at the workplace. The President of Malta, Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca, started the process in collaboration of the Centre for Labour Studies (CLS) at the University of Malta.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0371	2014-12-17	UNK	Austria: Government reshuffle increases social partner influence	A major reshuffle took place in the Austrian coalition government in August 2014. It was triggered by the death of the President of the Austrian Parliament, Social Democratic member Barbara Prammer, and the sudden departure of the vice-chancellor and leader of the Conservative Party, Michael Spindelegger. As a result of the reshuffle, the social partners are said to have gained influence in the government. The new health minister, Sabine Oberhauser, appointed by the Social Democratic Party, comes from the trade union movement and was Vice-President of the Austrian Trade Union Federation (ÖGB). She will supplement the Minister of Social Affairs, Rudolf Hundstorfer, who was President of ÖGB before joining the government. The new Minister of Finance, Hans Jorg Schelling, appointed by the Conservative Party, has links to the Federal Economic Chamber (WKÖ), the main employers’ organisation in Austria, where he was a vice-president. The new Vice-Chancellor, Reinhold Mitterlehner, who is also the Minister for Economic Affairs, was the Deputy Secretary-General at WKÖ before joining the government. Four out of the 14 ministers in the government now have a social partner history. This is a remarkable development given that, only a few years ago, the debate was how to tame the influence of the social partners in the Austrian parliament.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/industrial-relations-social-policies/austria-government-reshuffle-increases-social-partner-influence

EUROFOUND_UNK_0373	2014-12-17	UNK	Germany: Minister calls for quotas to bring more women into the boardroom	A controversial plan to introduce quotas to increase the number of female board members in German companies has been criticised by social partners. The issue was highlighted at the beginning of July 2014, when the first Public Women On Board Index was released. The index monitors 225 public entities at national, state and local level. The results showed that around 25.1% of board members in public sector companies are female. Manuela Schwesig, the Federal Minister for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth said this proportion was too low. She is currently drafting a law introducing a quota for female board members. The German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) warned against a fixed quota for female board members. While DGB advocates a 30% quota for employer and union representatives, something suggested by the Minister, it says quotas for employee representatives needed to be more flexible and oriented towards the gender mix in an establishment. Otherwise, it believes male-dominated sectors would have serious difficulties filling these posts. Meanwhile, in July 2014, Martin Wansleben, Chair of the Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) also came out against quotas. He emphasised in an interview with the weekly publication, Der Spiegel, that a quota was the ‘wrong way’ to recruit more women to managerial positions.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/social-policies-business/germany-minister-calls-for-quotas-to-bring-more-women-into-the-boardroom
EUROFOUND_UNK_0374	2014-12-17	UNK	Germany: New legislation to make parental leave more flexible	Amendments to the laws on parental leave are to be introduced to make them more flexible. In September 2014, the Federal Parliament debated the draft version of an amendment to the 2006 act on parental leave and parental allowance. The Federal Council approved the draft version in June. The reforms will be introduced in early 2015. The original 2006 legislation was seen as successful in terms of raising the number of working mothers and the number of fathers who take on childcare duties. The new rules will combine parental leave and part-time work (for both mothers and fathers) and allow parents to take several periods of parental leave. The amended act will give parents the right to work part-time while drawing parental allowance – under existing legislation a parent receiving parental allowance may work part-time, but earnings are subtracted from parental allowances. If a parent works part-time, the duration of the parental allowance will be doubled. If both parents decide to work part-time – between 25 and 30 hours – parental allowances will be granted for an additional four months. Parents will have the right to take another 24 months of parental leave when the child between four and eight year-old. This 24 months of parental leave can be taken in two to three stages.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-law-and-regulation/germany-new-legislation-to-make-parental-leave-more-flexible
EUROFOUND_UNK_0375	2014-12-17	UNK	Norway: SAS pilots join trade union confederation	Pilots working for Norwegian airline, SAS, have followed cabin crew in joining the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions (LO). The pilots are members of the independent Norwegian SAS Pilots Association (NSF). NSF’s application was approved by LO’s executive committee in August 2014 and 350 pilots will become members of the union federation. The development puts LO in direct competition with Parat, the trade union that has traditionally represented pilots and cabin crew in Norway. Another trade union, Lufttransport flygerforening (LTFF) has also applied to be affiliated to the new pilot union within LO. The two pilots’ trade unions, NSF and LTFF, had previously been organised in the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association (NF), an independent trade union. They look likely to keep this affiliation for the time being.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/industrial-relations/norway-sas-pilots-join-trade-union-confederation
EUROFOUND_UNK_0376	2014-12-17	UNK	Netherlands: Funding reform leads to less training for works council members	There are fears that there has been a big drop in the amount of training offered to works council members following reforms to funding. The system for paying for works council training courses was overhauled in July 2013. Previously, employers were entitled to a subsidy when the training was done by a certified institute. Employers now have to pay all the costs themselves. The Social and Economic Council Committee for Stimulation of Worker Involvement (SER-CBM) recently published tentative figures on the training and education of works council members. There were fears, especially from the union side, that the funding changes, along with the financial crisis, would result in a dramatic drop in the use of training and education. The initial figures seem to confirm a decrease, both in the number of works council members receiving training and in the duration of the courses. The problems seem to be largely among smaller companies with up to five works council members. The figures also make clear that the traditional (certified) institutes have lost some 40% of their turnover.

In what he calls a ‘think piece’, Labour MP Jim Sheridan examines how workplace democracy can be enhanced (494 KB PDF) and considers the benefits of doing so. He suggests it would lead to better industrial relations and better outcomes for individuals in terms of their careers. Published by the Centre for Labour and Social Studies (Class), the work is inspired by examples from Sweden.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-industrial-relations/uk-mp-calls-for-greater-board-level-employee-representation
EUROFOUND_UNK_0378	2014-12-17	UNK	France: Government issues social dialogue roadmap	The third Grand Social Conference was held on 7 and 8 July 2014, bringing together government representatives and social partners to define social policy. The conference established a roadmap of initiatives, reforms and negotiations for the next 12 months on employment and social dialogue, to be developed in consultation with employers and unions. On the basis of the conference’s outcomes, the labour minister invited social partners to initiate negotiations at ‘interprofessional’ level (policy paper in French, 465 KB PDF ) on the quality and effectiveness of social dialogue in companies and improving worker representation. The talks began in September 2014 and are scheduled for completion by the end of the year so that the outcomes can be included in a draft law. Priorities are to find specific forms of employee representation in small enterprises, to streamline the various obligations surrounding collective bargaining and to simplify the structure of the various staff representative bodies.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-industrial-relations/france-government-issues-social-dialogue-roadmap
EUROFOUND_UNK_0379	2014-12-17	UNK	Ireland: Increase in collective bargaining activity	There has been an increase in collective bargaining according to figures from Ireland’s largest union, the Services Industrial Professional and Technical Union (SIPTU). The union, which has just under 200,000 members, released data on the pay deals it has concluded (some involving other unions) over the four years to mid-2014. The information shows 209 deals, split roughly evenly between the union’s three manufacturing sectors: pharmaceuticals, chemicals and medical devices (67); agriculture, ingredients, food and drink (64); electronics, engineering (49) and industrial production (29). In 2010 there were just five deals, as many took a pay freeze after the demise of national wage agreements in late 2009. It should be said that many of the companies involved in local bargaining would also have paid pay increases in 2008–2009 under the previous national wage deal, the Transitional Agreement. The figure rose to 35 deals in 2011, some 55 deals in 2012 and 74 in 2013, with 41 deals already concluded in the first six months of 2014.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-industrial-relations/ireland-increase-in-collective-bargaining-activity
EUROFOUND_UNK_0380	2014-12-17	UNK	Austria: New agreement will not be decentralised to regional level	After months of stalemate, social partners in the hotels and restaurants sector (horeca) agreed to a new collective agreement in early September 2014 which meant a 2.2% increase in wages. The agreement covers about 200,000 workers in the vital Austrian tourism industry. Negotiations broke down in April 2014 after employers’ organisations demanded a reduction in the mandatory daily rest period. This rest period is granted by Austrian law and not by the collective agreement. Employers also called for an extension of the averaging period for work hours – currently 13 weeks. According to trade union sources, the tourism and recreation department of the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber, which negotiates for the employers’ side, could not reach agreement. The employers suggested negotiating different agreements with the nine provincial representatives. There are already different wage tables in the collective agreement, reflecting the different costs of living in the provinces. The trade union representatives did not want wages to diverge further. In spite of these difficulties, the social partners reached a countrywide agreement. The 2.2% wage increase is slightly higher than the inflation rate. The minimum wage – the lowest wage category in the agreement – is increased to €1,349 per month. This is still considerably lower than the minimum wage the Austrian Trade Union Federation (ÖGB) would like to see of €1,500 per month.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-industrial-relations/austria-new-agreement-will-not-be-decentralised-to-regional-level

EUROFOUND_UNK_0382	2014-12-15	UNK	Finland: Wide ranging pension reforms agreed	A series of pension reforms will come into force in 2017 after public and private labour market organisations reached an agreement. The reform to the earnings-related pension system will extend working life and reduce the sustainability gap of public finances. It will also tackle issues around a growing elderly population and the rising cost of retirement provision. The labour market organisations that agreed on the deal included the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK), the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK), the Local Government Employees (KT) and the Finnish Confederation of Salaried Employees (STTK). The Confederation of Unions for Professional and Managerial Staff in Finland (Akava), representing 600,000 white-collar employees, rejected the deal unanimously and decided to stay out of the agreement. The deal includes a number of changes to the rules. The retirement age will be gradually raised for people born in 1955 or later. As of 2017, the earliest eligibility age for an old age pension will be raised by three months per birth-year cohort until it reaches 65. The upper age limit for the old age pension will be five years higher than the earliest eligibility age. As of 2027, the eligibility age for old age retirement will be linked to life expectancy so that the time spent working in relation to the time spent in retirement will remain at the 2025 level. The development will be monitored through tripartite negotiations every five years. The current part-time pension will be abolished and replaced by a partial early old age retirement. A person can draw either 25% or 50% of the accrued old age pension at the age of 61. In some cases, a strenuous and extensive working life may offer the possibility to retire at 63. Alongside the disability pension there will be a ‘years-of-service’ pension, which can be applied for after a working life spanning 38 years if the work is either physically or mentally wearing. The accrual rates of the earnings-related pension will change so that the annual pension accrual rate of people of all ages will be 1.5% of wages or salary. Further changes to earnings-related pension contributions will see benefits accrued from a full wage rather than a separate pensionable wage. Akava decided not to sign up to the agreement because it believed the new system was not sufficient to encourage people to continue at work until retirement age. The standardised pension accrual rate – in contrast to the previous system with higher accrual rates during the last few years on the labour market – is considered to discriminate against the highly educated, especially women, since a lengthy period of education and parental leave both shorten careers. In the current system, periods outside the labour market can be caught up during the last years at work, when the accrual rates are higher. However, according to an impact analysis by the Finnish Centre for Pensions, women will benefit more than men from the raised age limits. Because of their higher life expectancy, it is thought women may benefit proportionately more from their pension. The Finnish Construction Trade Union (Rakennusliitto) held a two-hour national strike on 22 August 2014 to oppose the plan to increase the current minimum age for retirement to 63. According to the union, only 20% of its members currently retire at 63, the other 80% receive a disability pension or similar before that.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-industrial-relations/finland-wide-ranging-pension-reforms-agreed

The Ministry of Social Affairs is planning to develop the law regulating labour relations as part of its ongoing reform of collective agreement and collective labour dispute resolution. On 1 July 2014, the Ministry sent other ministries the draft act of individual dispute resolution for approval. The new act aims to abolish the bottlenecks in current legislation. According to the draft act, LDCs would get more power and resources so that they would be able to solve most labour disputes. Currently, only disputes with financial limit of claims up to €10,000 can be dealt with, others will be settled in court.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/industrial-relations-law-and-regulation/estonia-government-aims-to-strengthen-the-role-of-labour-dispute-committees
EUROFOUND_UNK_0384	2014-12-15	UNK	Spain: Government approves Youth Guarantee system	The government has moved to ease concerns over unemployment among people under 25 years-old by approving a Youth Guarantee scheme. The Cabinet of Ministers approved the new system, together with a series of new employment incentives, via Royal-Decree-Act 8/2014 in July 2014. The aim of the Youth Guarantee system is that young people between 16 and 25 years of age, who are neither working nor studying, will be able to access a job offer, training programme or an internship. It is estimated there are around 845,500 youngsters in Spain classed as NEETs (not in education, employment, or training). It is hoped young people will be able find a job, training or internship under the system within a maximum of four months. All young people registered are included in a single list for the whole of the country that can be accessed by the Central and Autonomic Administrations. Young people will only have to fill in an online form to register; it is not necessary to provide extra information or documents, as the public administrations will amend  each candidate’s data. The success of the Youth Guarantee system will rely on a series of incentives to attract employers to hire young workers. One of the most interesting is a €300 payment for employers who hire youngsters via open-ended contracts. This incentive consists of a bonus of €300 per month for six months and will be available until 30 June 2016. The European Union is supporting this plan to the level of €6,000 million. In Spain, the budget is €1,800 million, to be distributed between 2014 and 2015.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-labour-market/spain-government-approves-youth-guarantee-system
EUROFOUND_UNK_0385	2014-12-17	UNK	UK: Fees regime for Employment Tribunals hits women and the low paid	Women and the low paid have been most affected by a new system which means fees must be paid to bring cases to an employment tribunal. A report by the national Trades Union Congress (TUC) looked at the impact of the new fees regime, introduced in July 2013. The report, At what price justice (PDF 193 KB), said that overall since the introduction of fees there had been a 79% fall in cases proceeding to tribunal. Tribunal claims from women have fallen most rapidly. Approximately three quarters of applications for financial assistance from low paid workers were found to have been turned down. The TUC argues that the fees regime has been a ‘huge victory for Britain’s worst bosses’.  The Law Society of Scotland also produced a report on the impact of the fees (265 KB PDF). Following the report’s publication, the Society wrote to Chris Grayling, the Lord Chancellor in the coalition government, and Kenny MacAskill, the Cabinet Secretary for Justice in the Scottish government, to ask for an urgent review of the fees.  In July 2014, the charity the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) published its own research suggesting costs were deterring many people from making valid claims. The research was based on analysis of 182 cases brought to the CAB’s attention between June and July 2014. The main findings were: four in five cases had a 50/50 or greater chance of success if they had gone to a tribunal; just 31% of the potentially successful cases were likely or certain to proceed to tribunal; in over half of the cases, fees or costs deterred people; under a quarter of claims worth £1,000 or less are likely to be, or are definitely being taken forward; a fifth contained discrimination as a basis for claim. The most common issues were non-payment or withholding of wages, along with disputes over holiday pay. Research published in May 2014 argued that the coalition government’s introduction of fees for tribunals and other policies echoes the policies of the 1980s and 1990s. The effects, while generally bad for workers, are not necessarily good for employers and do not necessarily reduce regulatory burdens.  	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/industrial-relations-law-and-regulation/uk-fees-regime-for-employment-tribunals-hits-women-and-the-low-paid

EUROFOUND_UNK_0387	2014-12-15	UNK	Malta: Social partners and government discuss impact of wage indexation mechanism	The issue of Malta’s Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) has been in the spotlight again. COLA is an annual wage increase given to every worker based on the inflation rate. It often becomes the subject of discussion when the government starts its consultation sessions for the setting of the country’s financial budget, which is normally presented in November.  The Malta Chamber of Commerce, Enterprise and Industry in its publication, Economic Vision for Malta 2014–2020, says COLA is ‘contributing to a steady erosion of Malta’s labour cost competitiveness’ and is ‘undermining Malta’s ability to compete unsustainably’. It urges the government and the trade unions to reform COLA so that it reflects productivity as well as inflation. Meanwhile the Malta Employers’ Association (MEA) in its memorandum, Curtailing a culture of entitlement: Proposals for National Budget 2015, states that it has always been critical of COLA as a wage indexation system which does not reflect productivity. For 2015, MEA is insisting that there should be ‘no tampering with this mechanism given the low inflation during the reference period of September 2013 to September 2014’. Low inflation will mean a low annual rise for workers. MEA added: ‘When COLA was calculated at €5.82 in 2010, employers still paid the full amount, even though many firms were being negatively affected by the international recession’.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-labour-market/malta-social-partners-and-government-discuss-impact-of-wage-indexation-mechanism

At a meeting on 18 August 2014, the Czech government announced that it had agreed with social partners on introducing so-called ‘kurzarbeit’ to deal with the impact of the Russian sanctions which have hit trade. Kurzarbeit or short-time working could be introduced from 1 January 2015. Employees would not be expected to work, but would still receive 90% of their normal salary. Only 60% would come from their employer with the additional 30% coming from the government. The proposal is supported by both employers and trade unions. Experts agree that a properly crafted short-time working proposal would benefit the economy. They say it is better for employers not to have to dismiss employees and then be faced with having to hire and train new ones when prospects improve.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-industrial-relations/czech-republic-short-time-working-initiative-to-tackle-impact-of-russian-sanctions
EUROFOUND_UNK_0390	2014-12-15	UNK	Greece: Workers and business owners oppose Sunday shop opening	The extension of shop opening times to Sundays has brought opposition from employees and small business owners. On 4 July 2014, a meeting took place between representatives of the Federation of Private Sector Employees (OIYE) and for the employers, the Federation of Private Sector Employees (GSEVEE) and National Confederation of Hellenic Commerce (ESEE). On 8 July 2014, the three organisations filed an appeal before the Council of State opposing the decision of the Deputy Minister for Development and Competitiveness compelling shops to open on the 52 Sundays of the year in 10 regions across Greece. They sought an injunction and temporary suspension of the decision. The government believes the new measure will generate growth and jobs, and stimulate consumer spending. Representatives of large shops from the Hellenic Business Retail Association (SELPE) welcomed the new rules and hoped they would lead to an increase in turnover. According to ESEE: 75% of merchants were dissatisfied by the measure and by their Sunday turnover; 64% of businesses felt the cost of Sunday trading was unaffordable, while 40%–50% of shops could not afford to open; 95% were not prepared to hire extra staff in the immediate future. On 12 September 2014, the Council of State responded to the appeal by the OIYE, GSEVEE and ESEE. It temporarily blocked the pilot opening of shops for the 52 Sundays of the year in 10 regions of the country.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-labour-market/greece-workers-and-business-owners-oppose-sunday-shop-opening
EUROFOUND_UNK_0391	2014-12-15	UNK	Austria: Ministry cracks down on abuse of intern system	Interns in Austria are being encouraged to post information about their employers on a new website – including abuses of the system. The Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Consumer Protection, the Union of Salaried Employees, Graphical Workers and Journalists (GPA-djp) and Plattform Generation Praktikum have launched an online platform, where interns can anonymously post details about their internship. The details are checked by the Social Security Fund, which may take action against the employer concerned. The platform was set up in response to a growing number of voluntary and mandatory internships. A study by FORBA – Working Life Research Centre has shown that employers increasingly use interns as a cheap alternative to regular employees. Rather than acquiring additional skills under the supervision of more experienced staff, interns are often used to carry out regular tasks. The problem is particular virulent among university graduates who often rely on internships as an entry into the labour market. As interns they perform standard work but are paid significantly less than regular employees and lack the social security associated with a regular employment relationship. The study has also shown that many interns lack information about their rights and support for enforcing these rights. The new platform is considered a first step to limit the abuse of interns. The ministry is also considering the adoption of new legislation regulating internships.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions/austria-ministry-cracks-down-on-abuse-of-intern-system

Faster administrative procedures – including setting binding deadlines for ruling by government departments and personal penalties for non-compliance – are among 15 proposals presented to Prime Minister Georgi Bliznashki by the Bulgarian Mining Chamber (BMGK). Some relate to measures that companies in the mining industry say are long-standing issues that have been presented to several governments. Others would need legislative changes and could be acted on only after the election. However, the issues behind the proposals are indicative of the way institutions work in Bulgaria in general – ranging from conflicts between regulations or practices and the imposition of much stricter limits than required by Brussels, to passivity in measures of safety for the workers and the provision of adequate education. This is why, according to BMGK, the government’s top priority should be the development and implementation of a package of measures to improve the business environment in the country to create conditions to attract investment.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/labour-market-business/bulgaria-mining-chamber-demands-improvements-in-the-business-environment

EUROFOUND_UNK_0399	2014-12-15	UNK	Spain: Public sector pay remains frozen despite union protests	Public sector workers in Spain are to have their pay frozen once more during 2015 – for the fifth consecutive year. The decision was made in mid-September 2014 as the Spanish government worked on its Public Budget Law, which determines the budget allocation for 2.5 million public sector employees. The government is to keep its austerity policies and public sector wages will remain frozen on the grounds that inflation was static at around 0%. The Independent and Civil Servants’ Trade Union Central (CSI-F) denounced the move, claiming that public sector employees had lost 30% of their purchasing power since 2010. CSI-F representatives had demanded a higher public budget allocation to fund an increase in civil servants’ salaries, as well as to improve the quality of public services. The proposal was also attacked by the Secretary of the Trade Union Confederation of Workers’ Commissions (CCOO) Ramón Górriz, who was unhappy that employees’ representatives had little leeway to negotiate higher salaries. At the end of September 2014, a preliminary Budget Law for 2015 was approved. As expected, the law included the freezing of civil servants’ salaries. To compensate for this, the government agreed to increase the ‘reposition rate’ – the number of new contracts awarded from the 2014 figure of 10% to 50% in 2015. Civil servants would continue to receive their two special payments at Christmas and in the summer, but restrictions on the hiring of personnel would remain.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-industrial-relations/spain-public-sector-pay-remains-frozen-despite-union-protests

These programmes are a major source of income for scientists in the state research institutions. Each project within a programme is awarded via a tender procedure. In 2014, some 28 research teams submitted proposals. The delays led to a number of scientists who had planned to work on the projects being made redundant, or forced to take extended unpaid holidays. The scientists involved blamed the Ministry of Education and Science, which finances much of the state-managed research programme, for the delays. The Latvian Science Council, an organisation responsible for science strategy and funding, and the Latvian Academy of Sciences (LZA), together represent more than 300 scientists. They accused the Ministry of Education and Science of violating the normal regulations of competition for 10 state research programmes, amid lobbying by two unsuccessful projects in the tender competition. Without funds for salaries, research institutions were forced to make researchers redundant or agree long-term non-paid holidays. Eventually extra projects were added on the basis of a special regulation adopted long after the competition had been held. The Latvian Trade Union of Education and Science Employees (LIZDA) did not take part in the dispute.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-industrial-relations/latvia-scientists-protest-over-delayed-research-programmes

The status was originally approved for the period from August to September and then extended to the end of November. The Russian import ban has led to a drastic fall in the amount of work in certain sectors of the food industry. The status of ‘temporary unemployment’ means that companies can ask employees to stay at home without dismissing them. The ruling means the ONEM will pay a proportion of a worker’s salary until the problem is resolved.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-industrial-relations/belgium-russian-import-ban-hits-food-sector-workers

They showed that, from January to June 2014, average gross and net earnings increased by 3% at companies employing at least five people, as well as budgetary and designated non-profit institutions, compared with the same period of the previous year. This is the first time in some years that workers have received a noticeable wage increase in both net and real terms. However, trade unions are demanding increases and a wage level high enough for all workers to achieve a minimum living wage. Employers are worried about increasing labour costs. They oppose any further increases due to low productivity and the lack of sustained demand. The government, meanwhile, is proud of the relatively favourable wage processes. According to the report by the National Tax and Customs Administration (NAV) published in early September, wage income from employment increased by 4.5% a year on average (report in Hungarian). The report says around 3.85 million people received an income from employment; their average annual income amounted to HUF 2.083 million (€6,791 as at 27 November 2014), representing a monthly average of HUF 174,000 (€567). This falls significantly behind the gross monthly wage HUF 215,779 (€703) published by KSH. The difference is because, while NAV calculates on the basis of tax declarations, KSH works only with data from companies with more than five employees. A medium-term wage programme (490 KB PDF, in Hungarian) was proposed by the Hungarian Trade Union Confederation (MASZSZ) before the autumn wage negotiation round. In a communication issued in September 2014, it demanded higher wages, stressing that it is the only genuine means to ease the social unrest created by the economic crisis.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-industrial-relations/hungary-favourable-pay-developments-but-unions-demand-a-living-wage
EUROFOUND_UNK_0403	2014-12-11	UNK	Germany: Misperceptions could hinder cooperation  between younger and older workers	The attitudes to work of people in different age groups are very similar, but they do not appear to realise it. That’s the finding of a new survey (in German) on the expectations of younger and older employees concerning their workplace by WIdO, the research institute of the Public Health Insurance Fund (AOK). The AOK report shows that, in many respects, younger and older employees have similar ideas on work and life but do not know it. Both groups like to have a secure workplace, a job they enjoy doing and to be able to balance work and family life. Interestingly, older employees overestimate the importance of career opportunities, flexible working time arrangements and high pay for their younger colleagues. Younger employees, on the other hand, have misconceptions regarding older employees’ desire for a secure workplace, enjoyable work and career prospects, and being able to work independently. Due to demographic change, companies need to retain the skills and knowledge of older employees longer. The researchers suggest that such mistaken perceptions might negatively influence the ability of older and younger people to work together. Having mixed teams with employees of different ages is, however, of great importance for companies. Introducing such teams and implementing a gender-sensitive management style is important for tackling demographic change. For the survey two groups were interviewed by telephone: the so-called generation Y (15–30 years-old) and ‘baby boomers’ aged 50–65 years of age. A total of 2,011 people took part in the survey in January and February 2014.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions/germany-misperceptions-could-hinder-cooperation-between-younger-and-older-workers
EUROFOUND_UNK_0404	2014-12-15	UNK	Ireland: Waste workers strike for 14 weeks over pay	A dispute over pay cuts led to 14 weeks of industrial unrest at Dublin firm Greyhound Waste Recycling. This dispute began on 17 June 2014 when Greyhound workers were asked to accept new employment terms, which included a cut of up to 35% in basic pay. Workers refused to clock on and a protest began which later became a full on strike at two Greyhound depots. Prior to the strike – called the Greyhound Lockout by the Services Industrial Professional and Technical Union (SIPTU) – there had been talks between Greyhound management and unions on cost reduction measures. This resulted in a Labour Court recommendation which recognised the pressing need for cost reductions and asked the parties to find ways to achieving them. However the two sides interpreted the court’s recommendations differently. The main argument by management was that Greyhound staff, who were on legacy pay rates from Dublin City Council before the service was privatised in 2012, were paid well above the industry average. The industry average is around the same as the national minimum wage of €8.65 per hour. When Greyhound employees went on strike, the company hired agency workers to operate its waste collection services. The strikers and some public representatives responded by blockading one of the Greyhound depots. Just after the dispute began, Minister for Jobs Richard Bruton asked several state bodies to report to him about conditions in the waste collection industry. The outcome of this consultation with the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Health and Safety Authority and the Competition Authority is awaited. During the dispute, the new Super Junior Minister for Business and Employment, Ged Nash, asked the Labour Court to establish a joint labour committee for the waste collection industry. In September 2014, Greyhound sought High Court injunctions, which could have resulted in the imprisonment of some of the people involved in the blockade. However, a two-week negotiation period was agreed, and on 22 September 2014, new terms were agreed by union ballot and the strike ended. The deal included a severance package of four weeks’ pay per year of service, as well as pay cuts ranging from 15% to 20% depending on the length of service. The deal was achieved on the basis of just 24 of the staff returning to work, with another 60 employees expected to leave.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/industrial-relations/ireland-waste-workers-strike-for-14-weeks-over-pay
EUROFOUND_UNK_0405	2014-12-11	UNK	UK: Midwives walk out for first time during wave of public sector strikes	A series of public sector strikes hit the UK in the third quarter of 2014. More industrial action was planned for later in the autumn, with another wave of stoppages scheduled for mid-October. The public sector strike led to debate about legislative change to industrial disputes procedures. A ballot by the National Union of Teachers (NUT) was singled out by Prime Minister David Cameron as evidence of the need to legislate.  Christine Blower, General Secretary of the NUT, said the ballot had been conducted within the current legislative framework which resulted in a vote for discontinuous action which would be ended only on the dispute’s resolution. Partly in response to the debates about strike ballot legislative change, the Trade Union Congress (TUC) wrote to Business Secretary Vince Cable on 18 July 2014. It urged him to consider allowing ballots to be cast digitally.  NHS workers in England were balloted on industrial action in July 2014, with midwives being balloted for the first time in their history. Unison, the Royal College of Midwives, and general unions GMB and Unite announced their intention to ballot members in response to the pay deal put forward by the coalition government in March. The government did not accept the recommendations of the independent pay review board. Passport workers took industrial action in July 2014 in a dispute over staffing levels and pay. A 24-hour stoppage took place at all eight of the UK’s Passport Offices – Belfast, Durham, Glasgow, Liverpool, Southport, London, Newport and Peterborough.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/industrial-relations-law-and-regulation/uk-midwives-walk-out-for-first-time-during-wave-of-public-sector-strikes
EUROFOUND_UNK_0406	2014-12-11	UNK	Estonia: Gender pay gap remains largely unexplained	The pay gap between men and women in Estonia remains largely unexplained according to a new study that evaluates gender wage differences (in Estonian, 3.9 MB PDF) from 2011 to 2012. To achieve the objective, a new combined database was created by Statistics Estonia (Statistikaamet). It consists of different datasets including the Estonian Social Survey, Estonian Labour Force Survey, Population and Housing Census data and Estonian Tax and Customs Board (ETCB) income data. In general, irrespective of the method used, the main results were similar and reliable. The gender wage gap is mainly explained and influenced by variables associated with type of employment, the job and the enterprise’s profile (sector, economic activity, location and size). In line with previous Estonian studies, the observed gender wage gap is mostly due to differences in remuneration linked to observed individual characteristics. This is the unexplained part of the observed gender wage gap and is higher than the observed gender wage gap and the explained portion of the gap. The size of the explained part is relatively small and it favours women. In general women have, for example, attained a higher level of educational attainment, have better language skills, have studied in fields where average wages are higher, and are working in occupations where average wages are higher. The conclusion from this is that women should be earning more than men.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions/estonia-gender-pay-gap-remains-largely-unexplained

EUROFOUND_UNK_0408	2014-12-09	UNK	UK: Tories pledge to make industrial action more difficult	Prime Minister David Cameron has said the Conservative Party would seek to legislate with tough new rules to control trade unions if it wins the next general election. He made his comments on 9 July 2014 – the eve of widespread public sector strike action. Current rules say a strike is legal if the majority of returned ballot papers are in favour. Conservative Party changes would mean a majority of all union members would need to vote in favour of action for any strike to be legal.  It is also being reported that the Conservatives would look to amend the time for which a ballot remains legal in the case of a union pursuing discontinuous action. The party is looking at rules that would demand a separate ballot for each stoppage. Discussion of industrial action legislation was prompted by a series of public sector strikes, with the ballot of the National Union of Teachers (NUT) receiving particular attention. Referring to the NUT strike ballot Cameron commented during Prime Minister’s Questions: ‘The strike ballot took place in 2012. It is based on a 27% turnout. How can it possibly be right for our children’s education to be disrupted by trade unions acting in this way? It is time to legislate, and that will be in the Conservative manifesto’. Support for the proposals is not shared across the coalition government. Liberal Democrat coalition partner and Secretary of State for Business Innovation and Skills, Vince Cable, interviewed on the BBC television on 13 July 2014 described the Conservative proposals as ‘nonsense’. The national daily newspaper, The Telegraph, also reported his criticism of the proposed reforms. When the Conservative Party published its proposals in a press release on 18 July 2014, the most significant elements were: a 50% turnout threshold for strikes; a requirement for unions to set out the exact nature of the dispute and for members to be balloted on each aspect of the dispute; the ballot paper to specify the nature of industrial action such as  the time of year and the duration; mandates to be limited to three months. The national Trade Union Congress (TUC) highlighted in its response to the proposals that the plans did not include measures to improve participation,  such as moving ballots online. It said the proposals would make legal strikes close to impossible and would fundamentally weaken the negotiating power of workers.  In a separate development, the July 2014 Labour Research Department newsletter reported that stipulations in the Procurement Reform (Scotland) Bill meant employee representation – including trade union recognition – could be taken into account when assessing a contractor’s suitability for a public contract. The Bill received Royal Assent on 17 June 2014.  Meanwhile, it was announced in August 2014 that the Carr Review (reported in Q2) would no longer be making recommendations regarding the law governing industrial disputes. Bruce Carr QC released a statement citing his concerns about ‘the ability of the Review to operate in a progressively politicised environment in the run up to the general election and in circumstances in which the main parties will wish to legitimately set out their respective manifesto commitments and have already started to do so’. It was confirmed that a report would still be prepared for publication in the autumn.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/industrial-relations-law-and-regulation/uk-tories-pledge-to-make-industrial-action-more-difficult
EUROFOUND_UNK_0409	2014-12-09	UNK	Estonia: Unions share collective bargaining best practice	Collective bargaining was the subject of a strategy conference organised by the Estonian Trade Union Confederation (EAKL). The conference, on 4 September 2014, took place as the collective bargaining ‘season’ was about to begin. According to the Collective Agreements Act, collective agreements are concluded for one year if the parties have not agreed differently, and many agreements expire at the end of the year. The aim of the conference was to share best practice. Delegates looked at how and what trade unions had done to protect employees rights and to improve their working conditions. They looked at how this improved trade union capacity and efficiency to protect employees’ interests in the future. Chair of EAKL, Peep Peterson, said the main focus of the conference was to convince employers to increase training and promote fast but sustainable wage increases. He also stressed the need to raise awareness of some legislative changes to be implemented in the near future.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/industrial-relations/estonia-unions-share-collective-bargaining-best-practice

A new report from Eurofound, Labour migration in the EU: Recent trends and policies, highlights the importance of the issue, and appropriate policy responses. The movement of workers between and within Member States could help address labour market imbalances, but mobility within the EU is low by international standards. Even in countries with labour shortages, policy instruments to encourage job-seekers to take up jobs outside their home country or even region are not widespread. A lack of proficiency in the language of potential destination countries is one of the main barriers to cross-border mobility; providing language courses could do much to overcome this. Implementing the European Qualifications Framework across all Member States would also be beneficial, since this could help employers and others to assess job-seekers’ qualifications.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0416	2014-11-24	UNK	Social cohesion and well-being in the EU	 The united Europe is currently experiencing the effects of the most severe economic and financial crisis of the last 70 years. It is still unclear what its deeper implications will be, or what long-term repercussions it will have on the societies of EU Member States: How will it affect social cohesion? What impact will the crisis have on quality of life and subjective well-being in Europe? What is clear, however, is that in view of the challenges ahead, a well-targeted and precisely calibrated Europe-wide social policy is needed to counter the polarizing and fragmenting forces in Europe. Substantial challenges call for substantial efforts. It is against this background that Eurofound and the Bertelsmann Stiftung decided to pool their expertise and to jointly explore the relationships between social cohesion and subjective well-being in the European Member States.  social_cohension_and_well-being_table.jpg The report found that social cohesion enhances people’s well-being in four of the five domains: better psychological functioning (strongest effect), less negative affect, higher life evaluation and higher social well-being. The contribution of social cohesion to subjective well-being arises mainly in the domains social relations and orientation to the common good, which perform very similarly. A high level of emotional attachment of citizens to major societal institutions (connectedness) seems to be of secondary importance, as compared to the other two cohesion domains. The positive effect of social cohesion is felt more strongly in the richer (West European) part of Europe, than in the less rich one. In the less affluent Member States of the European Union, life evaluation – life satisfaction and happiness – is enhanced by strong cohesion, but other dimensions of individual well-being are not. The report concludes that social cohesion has proved to be a positive factor for many aspects of citizens’ well-being. If the goal of public policy is to make a society more ‘liveable’ then the promotion of well-being through building of social cohesion appears a smart as well as inclusive approach. The strengthening of social networks, trust and tolerance and motivating people to show solidarity, to obey social rules and to engage in civil society are promising roads towards higher well-being. These are, of course, challenging goals, particularly regarding increasing trust in others. But reducing tensions or lack of trust between social groups can improve well-being for all and is an established element of social policy. The promotion of civic participation is a key route to promoting not only the sense of a common good, but also connectedness. This is particularly the case for the EU-15 countries. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/quality-of-life-social-policies/social-cohesion-and-well-being-in-the-eu-0

EUROFOUND_UNK_0420	2014-11-04	UNK	Eurofound and EU-OSHA publish joint report on psychosocial risks in workplaces	Eurofound and EU-OSHA publish joint report psychosocial risks in workplaces:  New report shows how healthy workplaces are managing stress One-quarter of workers in Europe report feeling stressed at work all or most of the time, and a similar proportion say that work affects their health negatively. Psychosocial risks — for example, monotonous tasks, high work intensity, tight deadlines, work-life unbalance, violence and harassment from the public or from colleagues — contribute to work-related stress. A new report, published as part of a Europe-wide campaign Healthy Workplaces Manage Stress gives a broad overview on psychosocial risks at European workplaces and gives examples on the way forward at political as well as company level —all illustrated with real-life examples and case studies. Psychosocial risks in Europe: Prevalence and strategies for prevention is published jointly by the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) and the European Foundation for the Improvement of Working and Living Conditions (Eurofound). The report acknowledges the complexity of the relationship between health and work and recognises that practical support is needed to bring about change. It provides a snapshot of working conditions and the incidence of psychosocial risks in Europe, discusses how to manage those risks in the workplace and outlines policy interventions. Director of EU-OSHA, Dr Christa Sedlatschek, described the report as an excellent example of interagency collaboration. ‘One of the key messages of our 2014–15 Healthy Workplaces Campaign is that psychosocial risks, although more sensitive, can be tackled in the same systematic way as “traditional” workplace risks. By combining their strengths, EU-OSHA and Eurofound have produced a state-of the-art review that will make an important contribution to the success of this campaign in getting that message across. In the same way, by working together, management and employees can tackle workplace stress effectively.’ Director of Eurofound, Juan Menéndez-Valdés, commented that ‘Reducing psychosocial risks and protecting workers from these risks is critical for allowing longer working lives and preventing early labour market exits. Evidence shows that policies are not developed to the same extent in all European countries, which can be explained by the different traditions of social dialogue and different governmental approaches, often related to the importance the country gives to psychosocial risks. We hope that our joint report will provide practitioners and policymakers with both the insight and incentive to overcome these challenges of psychosocial risks in the workplace. Research shows that the role of social dialogue and social partners is relevant to raise awareness and implement interventions.’ The report is being launched in Brussels on 16 October at a seminar bringing together policy-makers, occupational safety and health (OSH) professionals, researchers and representatives of employers and trade unions from across Europe to discuss and share approaches for supporting workplaces across Europe in managing psychosocial risks in the workplace. In the context of longer working lives, reducing the prevalence of psychosocial risk at work is essential. Policy-makers should consider specific psychosocial risks for different groups of workers, including women, to improve working conditions for all. Although fewer people report working long hours, as presented in the report, job insecurity has increased across Europe, and in some countries work intensity has increased in companies struggling in the economic crisis. Work-related stress is often seen as a ‘sensitive’ or ‘difficult’ area — a perception that may however differ from one country to another. In particular, managers of small companies find it difficult to tackle psychosocial risks because of lack of resources or expertise. The 2014–15 Healthy Workplaces Campaign aims to address those difficulties by providing practical advice and support, raising awareness and stimulating debate. This report and seminar contribute towards meeting that aim by supporting stakeholders with information and illustrating the benefits of working together. By pooling their expertise, Eurofound and EU-OSHA can reach out more effectively to policy-makers and Europe’s workplaces and provide them with the information and support they need to manage stress and make Europe a better place to work.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0421	2014-10-31	UNK	News in Brief / Eurofound News, October 2014	"Ensuring access to healthcare services Across Europe, people in a range of vulnerable situations have experienced reduced access to healthcare as a result of the economic crisis. Many Member States have cut spending on healthcare services; problems with access are compounded by reduced incomes for many households. A new report from Eurofound explores which groups have been particularly affected and what measures governments and service providers have taken to maintain access for such groups: economising, seeking funds from other sources, and leniency in enforcing copayments for people in need. Other strategies include developing care systems outside of institutions; reducing the duration of hospital stays; developing alternative care infrastructures; drawing on less costly workers; and ensuring basic services through scaled-down replacement services when a service provider closes.

Monotonous tasks an issue for almost half of workforce The demands that work presents can be a source of stress if workers are unable to handle them. The exposure of workers to a range of risks varies, as does their consequences. One of the most commonly reported risks is monotony of tasks; this seems to have a significant impact on workers’ health and well-being. Jobs involving repetitive, monotonous tasks can be demotivating and may contribute to psychosocial problems. On the other hand, very complex tasks might contribute to stressful situations for the worker involved unless they have the skills and job design necessary to cope with them.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0422	2014-10-31	UNK	Agencies join forces on employee well-being / Eurofound News, October 2014	"Workplace risk factors that adversely affect workers’ psychological well-being – heavy workload, intense work, harassment and job insecurity – can lead to reduced productivity, increased absenteeism and shortened working lives. And, as economic activity shifts towards the services sector and the nature of work changes, concern over these psychosocial risks is rising. Eurofound and its sister agency the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) have combined their expertise to publish a joint report examining the prevalence of different psychosocial workplace risks, their impact on health and well-being, and strategies for tackling them. The report was launched on 13 October at a conference entitled ‘How can we achieve the health and satisfaction of workers through better organisation of work and better leadership?’ Organised by the Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities of Slovenia in Brno, the event focused on work-related stress and how the organisation of work plays a critical role in determining workers’ well-being.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0423	2014-10-23	UNK	Spain: Companies cut investment in training	According to a report published by the human resources company Adecco, 60% of Spanish companies reduced the amount of resources devoted to training in 2013. This is an unexpected result, given that the labour market reforms approved in 2012 placed an obligation on employers to allow every employee take 20 days of leave for training, or to develop a specific training plan for the whole company. It was expected that these new compulsory requirements would lead companies to dedicate a higher level of resources to training activities.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-labour-market/spain-companies-cut-investment-in-training
EUROFOUND_UNK_0424	2014-10-31	UNK	Spotlight on urban–rural differences / Eurofound News, October 2014	Between 2007 and 2011, Europe became a predominantly urban continent. A majority of people (51%) now live in urban areas (up from 47% in 2007). A new report in the Foundation Findings series, based on results from the European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS), explores differences in quality of life between urban and rural Europe. While people in urban areas have higher incomes, this does not necessarily mean they have a higher standard of living and are less exposed to deprivation and hardship, as costs are higher in cities and there is greater inequality in general. The research finds that a larger proportion of urban dwellers have low trust in local government and are less satisfied with their accommodation than people in rural areas. Social exclusion is a factor common to both areas although stemming from different causes: arising from remoteness and inaccessibility in the countryside and from complex factors such as unemployment in cities which prevent people from engaging in the social life of the community.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0425	2014-10-23	UNK	Czech Republic: Women ask for a third less pay for top jobs	Salary expectations differ significantly between men and women in the Czech Republic, according to an analysis by the recruitment agency Profesia.cz. The agency examined over 50,000 CVs and found that women asked for considerably lower monthly earnings than men when applying for the same position. This was the case across all positions examined. The most significant difference in expected salary was among applicants for top managerial positions, with women looking for 32% less than men. Women also looked for substantially lower pay than men in the IT sector (lower by 21%) and human resources (lower by 15%). The smallest difference was found in the marketing and media sector.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions/czech-republic-women-ask-for-a-third-less-pay-for-top-jobs
EUROFOUND_UNK_0426	2014-10-23	UNK	Court ruling increases protection of parental leave	The European Court of Justice has delivered a judgement in which it adds to its body of case law protecting employees choosing to take parental leave. In this case, a woman employee was dismissed at the beginning of a period of part-time parental leave that followed her maternity leave. She did not accept that her protective award for dismissal should be calculated on the basis of her part-time salary. The Court of Justice found that the protective award had to be calculated on the basis of the remuneration applicable when the employee was working full time prior to parental leave. A reduction in the protective award would dissuade employees from taking parental leave and would therefore be contrary to the framework agreement on parental leave of 14 December 1995. The Court stated that Clause 2, Paragraph 4 of this agreement, which is intended to protect employees against dismissal in association with taking parental leave, ‘must be interpreted as articulating a particularly important European Union social right and it may not, therefore, be interpreted restrictively’ (Case C-588/12, Lyreco Belgium NV v.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0427	2014-09-24	UNK	Involving employees key to innovation	In light of the huge job losses of recent years, EU policy is seeking a ‘job-rich recovery’: but how best to achieve this? Job growth in the EU requires companies that are competitive, can innovate and can grow. This in turn means nurturing human capital – particularly that of young people – organising work more effectively, and improving conditions for workers both in the workplace and helping them achieve a satisfactory work–life balance. Innovative approaches to these issues can improve both performance and quality of work: ‘win–win’ outcomes for workers, managers, business and wider society. Eurofound’s latest issue of Foundation Focus explores how working conditions can be improved, innovation achieved and win–win practices implemented. In particular, it highlights the importance of employee involvement, training, human resources practices, active inclusion and social dialogue in boosting innovative work practices and ultimately improving working conditions and competitiveness.  Read Foundation Focus – Win–win practices: Building growth and competitiveness in European companies  	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/involving-employees-key-to-innovation
EUROFOUND_UNK_0428	2014-10-23	UNK	Ireland: Police win right to strike following EU ruling	In May, following a Council of Europe decision, the representative bodies of the Irish police force (the Garda Síochána or simply the Garda) won the right to strike, negotiate on pay and conditions, and affiliate to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. Prior to this, these bodies – the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors (AGSI) and the Garda Representative Association (GRA) – were restricted from engaging in such activities. EuroCOP president Anna Nellberg Dennis said the decision was not only a victory for the Garda, but would have important implications for forces across Europe, by drawing more attention to those Member States that are failing to adequately provide for the social rights of their police officers. The Irish government response was issued in June and stated: ‘It is critically important that the police and security services in the State are fully operational at all times and it must be emphasised that providing a right to strike to members of the Garda Síochána across the country would raise the most serious issues in respect of the capacity of the State to ensure the maintenance of law and order.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/industrial-relations-law-and-regulation/ireland-police-win-right-to-strike-following-eu-ruling

Eurofound Director Juan Menéndez-Valdés welcomed participants to the event, which had the overall banner: ‘The future of the European Social Model – New perspectives for industrial relations, social and employment policy in Europe?’ Professor Emeritus Richard Hyman (London School of Economics) and Professor Jonathan Winterton (Toulouse Business School) delivered keynote addresses, while tripartite industrial relations practitioners from Ireland exchanged views and experiences in a lively panel debate on Day 2. Over the three days, participants debated a wide range of topics in parallel workshops, ranging from transnational restructuring and social dumping to the social inclusion of migrant and vulnerable workers and the representativeness of the social partners. Download the presentations Regional measures help ease impacts of restructuring Large-scale company restructuring can have considerable effects at a regional level – with economic, employment and social impacts – but information on these regional impacts and how to deal with them is scarce. A new report from Eurofound aims to close this knowledge gap, using data analysis, a literature review and five case studies to identify and discuss the effects large-scale restructuring has had outside the firms involved. It also describes initiatives that successfully addressed the regional impact of restructuring. Among the success factors that emerge for such initiatives are: openness towards change; stakeholder engagement; an integrated approach and efficient implementation; and sustainable funding. Read Effects of restructuring at regional level and approaches to dealing with the consequences  Life satisfaction rises in Turkey The countries of southeastern Europe that are candidates for accession to the EU have experienced profound change over the last two decades, changes that have affected their citizens’ subjective experience of daily life. Three new reports look at trends in quality of life in Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and in Turkey. The fortunes of the three countries differ considerably. In Turkey, a decade of rapid economic growth between 2003 and 2012 appears to have markedly improved public services provision, with citizens giving more favourable ratings to their health service, pensions system and social services. Improvements have also been seen in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, where material deprivation has lessened considerably. In Croatia, however, disposable household income significantly decreased between 2007 and 2012, with around 30% of people – particularly older people and those with less education – having difficulty making ends meet. Read the reports for Turkey and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; that for Croatia is forthcoming. Disparities between occupations in health effects of work  People working in particular occupations in Europe face a number of disadvantages in their working conditions. For instance, those working as skilled agricultural and forestry workers, plant and machine operators, and craft and related trade workers are much more likely to say that their work has a negative effect on their health. In addition, workers in these occupations report having the greatest number of health problems (particularly skilled agricultural and forestry workers). A new report from Eurofound identifies those occupations that have multiple disadvantages, thereby making it difficult for people to stay in these jobs.

Of this group, 57% admit that part of their earnings is not declared to the authorities for tax purposes. The survey, conducted by the Centre for Social Prevention (Centrum Profilaktyki Społecznej) and the Department of Pedagogics of the Academy of Business (Katedra Pedagogiki Wyższej Szkoły Biznesu), was carried out in 11 cities in Poland on a large sample of 1,400 workers.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-conditions-labour-market/poland-over-half-young-workers-paid-partly-under-the-counter
EUROFOUND_UNK_0431	2014-08-11	UNK	Young people deserve support and guidance	Today marks UN International Youth Day 2014, where the spotlight is on ‘youth and mental health’. The mental health of young people appears to be linked to their employment status: Eurofound research has found that unemployed and inactive young people are more likely than others to feel socially excluded, to feel lonely, to face a lack of social support and to have lower levels of mental well-being. Recognising the gravity of rising youth unemployment, many EU countries have implemented or modified policy measures specifically targeting young people. Youth transitions Apart from the EU Youth Guarantee currently being rolled out, Member States have also been offering and funding programmes and measures to help facilitate smooth transitions from education to work as well as into adulthood. Some measures are aimed at particularly disadvantaged groups. A recent Eurofound study looked at a selection of good practices and policy measures that promote smoother and more successful school-to-work transitions. Particular attention was paid to the most disadvantaged young people and those that are furthest from the labour market, particularly those with health problems, a migration background or multiple disadvantages. For instance, in Germany, the Bonus for Apprenticeship Places (Ausbildungsbonus) offers financial incentives to employers to take on an apprentice who is socially disadvantaged, has a learning disability, has low or no qualifications or has been made redundant. In Sweden, the increased number and use of personal advisers have led to greater programme quality in the trial introduction programme for newly arrived refugees and job search assistance, coaching and counselling services, as well as the provision of work internships. The study found that labour market transitions are strongly linked with broader transitions into adulthood. Personal-related variables, like health, including mental health, level of education, age, work experience and working hours, generally affect the probability of staying in employment. Policy focus The study highlights that it is crucial to recognise that young people are a very diverse group with different characteristics and often multiple needs. Yet, it was difficult to find effective measures that successfully target those that are furthest from the labour market. Therefore, policies and programmes should recognise this group from the outset and structure services accordingly. In general, it was easier to identify measures geared towards people who were making the transition from school to work, than those for young people who had withdrawn from employment on grounds of ill-health or for other reasons. An important feature of successful programmes is the intensive and personalised guidance and support provided by personal advisers and mentors. Some programmes envisaged support not only for the young people but also for the employers. This proved to be particularly useful when dealing with the most disadvantaged young people where employers might need extra support. A smooth integration of young people into the labour market, avoiding spells of unemployment, seems crucial; this points to the great importance of addressing the current record levels of youth unemployment in the EU. Policy measures, such as the Youth Guarantee, are vital to avoid spells of unemployment that may negatively affect young people’s personal situation, their career prospects, future labour market attachment or their mental health.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0432	2014-09-02	UNK	Turkey: Life satisfaction rises though challenges persist	Over the the past decade, Turkey has undergone huge economic and social change. Newly published Eurofound research indicates that this was accompanied by a substantial improvement in people's life satisfaction. Findings from the Agency's European Quality of Life Survey indicate that over the period 2003 to 2012, Turkish people’s own ratings of their level of life satisfaction rose from 5.6 to 6.6 on a 10-point scale. By 2012, it was closer than ever before to the EU28’s population based average of 7.1. Similarly, average Turkish ratings of happiness increased.  Growing satisfaction with services  In contrast to the recession that struck most European countries from 2008 onwards, the Turkish economy boomed between 2003 and 2012. Real GDP per capita increased by 38% and the annual rate of GDP growth was as high as 5.3% in 2003. Despite recent economic troubles, the period of growth seems to have contributed to an improved provision of services. A universal health service was introduced, education was expanded, and state pensions and social services improved. Although they were generally dissatisfied with their public services in 2003, Turkish people are now more satisfied than people on average in the EU in regard to their health services and their own, self-assessed health; reported access to health services has also improved. Satisfaction with the education system has risen markedly (though it stayed constant in the EU) and satisfaction with pensions and social services has also improved.  Turkey and Europe 2020 targets Turkey measures well against many Europe 2020 targets. Employment rates have increased and poverty rates have decreased significantly. Problems, however, persist. Deprivation remains much higher than the EU28 average: in 2012, 40% of people overall said they had problems keeping their home warm enough, buying new clothes or affording a meal with meat every second day. Rates of female employment, early school leaving and tertiary education are still a long way from EU targets, as is expenditure on research and development.  New report details developments Eurofound's new report, Trends in quality of life Turkey: 2003–2012, explores these and a range of related issues in detail. In particular, it examines how the experience of different sociodemographic groups – young and old people, men and women, and urban and rural dwellers – has varied during the profound changes of the past decade.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/turkey-life-satisfaction-rises-though-challenges-persist

EUROFOUND_UNK_0434	2014-08-11	UNK	Women benefiting from changes in the occupational structure	Since the economic crisis, growth in employment has been skewed towards high-wage jobs. Middle-wage jobs have been destroyed in huge numbers because manufacturing and construction, the sectors most severely shaken by the crisis, have a concentration of jobs in the mid-paying range.  These developments are benefiting women workers and narrowing the gender gap in employment. From mid-2011 to mid-2013, women’s employment increased modestly by 60,000, while that of men fell by nearly 1.4 million. Sectoral gender differences The main reason behind this shift is the gender make-up of the different economic sectors. Manufacturing and construction are heavily male-dominated, while the sectors with most growth in employment – health and education especially – are traditionally dominated by women and tend to have jobs with higher hourly pay rates. The figure below shows the net employment change across five wage categories for women and men. Employment growth has been relatively strong in the highest wage category, and women have gained a larger share of this than men.  Only in the lowest-paying jobs has employment growth for men outpaced that of women. This is due in part to men who have been let go from manufacturing and construction jobs taking up lower-paid service jobs in the food and beverage, construction and retail sectors. Meanwhile, employment levels for women in the lowest-paid jobs have fallen due to job losses among cleaners and helpers working for private household employers, as well as a relatively sharp decline in female agricultural employment.         Part-time work An interesting gender-shift is taking place in part-time work – it’s becoming less dominated by women as male workers increasingly take up part-time jobs. Over 60% of net new male part-time jobs in the lowest wage category were in three typically female-dominated occupations – personal care workers, sales workers, and cleaners and helpers.   For women, new part-time employment has tended to be in professional and managerial occupations, notably business and administration professionals, health professionals and commercial or administrative managers. These jobs could represent existing full-time jobs being converted to part-time ones, as well as newly created part-time jobs.  More information on recent employment shifts can be found in the latest European Jobs Monitor annual report.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/women-benefiting-from-changes-in-the-occupational-structure

EUROFOUND_UNK_0436	2014-07-16	UNK	Youth Employment Initiative: Is it delivering?	Defining effective measures to address youth unemployment remains a key policy priority for the EU, but the process is complex and time-consuming. All Member States are making efforts to implement the Youth Guarantee and have submitted national Youth Guarantee Implementation Plans to the European Commission for evaluation. Launched in February 2013, the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) aims to tackle youth unemployment by supporting the implementation of the Youth Employment Package and the Youth Guarantee. In total, 20 Member States are eligible for YEI funding, which are those with youth unemployment rates above 25% in 2012. The countries not eligible are Austria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands. However, availability of funding under the YEI is slower than expected. Youth Employment Initiative In particular, the YEI aims to support young people aged up to 25 who are not in employment, education or training (NEETs) via measures such as first job placements, apprenticeships, traineeships or start-up support for young entrepreneurs. Eurofound research estimates the cost of the 7.5 million NEETs in the EU to be around €153 billion. A budget of €6 billion has been allocated for the YEI for the period 2014–2020. Half of the YEI funding comes from a new budget line dedicated to youth employment and has been frontloaded to 2014–2015. The other half will come from Member States’ European Social Fund (ESF) allocations. The idea is that activities receiving YEI funding should be strongly oriented towards achieving concrete results quickly. Slow implementation So far, the Commission has adopted YEI operational programmes for only two Member States – France (3 June) and Italy (11 July). Although the Youth Guarantee targets young people up to the age of 25, Italy will extend this to people aged up to 29.  On 11 July, experts from the European Commission and eligible Member States convened at a special seminar in Brussels to seek ways of speeding up the programming arrangements and practical implementation of the YEI (see press release). According to Eurostat, despite some reduction since May 2013, youth unemployment in May 2014 in the EU28 stood at 22.2%, corresponding to 5.2 million young people under 25 who remain jobless, with very worrying trends still in Greece (57.7% March 2014), Spain (54%), Croatia (48.7% March 2014) and Italy (43%).  Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion László Andor said that YEI funding ‘has a crucial role to play since it shall directly support young people by providing a first job experience, a traineeship, an apprenticeship or training courses’. The aim of the seminar was to work together on the programming of those schemes due to receive YEI funding so that Member States could receive the allocated funds as soon as possible and get initiatives up and running. Bulgaria, Croatia, Ireland, Poland and Sweden are also in the process of implementing projects to be funded by the YEI.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/youth-employment-initiative-is-it-delivering

EUROFOUND_UNK_0438	2014-09-09	UNK	Suicide among young people a major cause for concern	A new study by the World Health Organization (WHO) – Preventing suicide: A global imperative – shows there is a high level of suicides among young people aged 15–29 in high-income countries, accounting for 17.6% of deaths among this age group. Many of Europe’s young people have been experiencing stress and anxiety about work prospects and their future, largely crisis-induced, with many suffering from depression and other mental illnesses. On World Suicide Prevention Day today 10 September, it is important to stress that suicide is a significant social and public health concern.  Country differences Of the 54 high-income countries identified in the WHO report, 25 are EU Member States (Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania are the exceptions). Although in almost all regions of the world suicide rates are highest among those aged 70 or over, in some countries they are highest among young people. In fact, at a global level, suicide is the second leading cause of death among 15−29 year-olds, according to the report. It also shows there is a gender difference: in richer countries, three times more men die of suicide than women, but in low- and middle-income countries the ratio is halved at 1.5 men to each woman. However, as the report points out, it is highly probable that suicide (not to mention suicide attempts) is underreported, as it is a highly sensitive issue, is illegal in some countries or may be misclassified as another cause of death. In the case of Ireland, for example, suicide is a leading cause of death among young people, particularly young men. With the fifth highest rate of youth suicide in the EU, according to Eurostat data, youth suicide has been associated with increased prevalence of depressive illnesses, substance abuse or life pressures. Among the action areas of the Irish National Strategy for Suicide Prevention 2005–2014 (1 MB PDF) is the ‘promotion of positive mental health, problem solving and coping in the general population’. Increasing prevention Although the evidence suggests many suicides are preventable, ‘suicide is too often a low priority for governments and policymakers’, says the WHO report. Globally, with 8.5% of deaths among young adults caused by suicide, prevention efforts should be prioritised, it says. The WHO report reviews existing data on suicide and suicide attempts, and assesses what steps are being taken and what should be done at the policy level to raise awareness and increase prevention. It suggests that national prevention strategies ‘should ensure cooperation between the health and non-health sectors and involve communities and the mass media'. Furthermore, ‘communities, including schools, play a critical role in suicide prevention’, as they are key in providing social support for vulnerable groups and follow-up care, raising awareness of the issue, reducing stigma and supporting families bereaved by suicide. Taking action In 2013, all 28 EU Member States (part of the WHO European Region’s 53 countries), adopted the WHO Mental Health Action Plan 2013−2020. This plan aims to reduce suicide rates by 10% overall by 2020 and among specific groups by age, sex and ethnicity. It calls on Member States to implement suicide prevention strategies incorporating best evidence. Access to healthcare Eurofound’s report on Access to healthcare in times of crisis highlights that in those countries deeply affected by the recession, such as Greece and Ireland, suicide has risen. The report shows the crisis has had a major impact on health and access to healthcare services, increasing the need for certain services, particularly mental healthcare.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/suicide-among-young-people-a-major-cause-for-concern
EUROFOUND_UNK_0439	2014-09-24	UNK	Lower-skilled occupations face disadvantages	The working conditions experienced by a European worker depend substantially on the occupation they hold – in particular, on the level of skill required for the position. People working in customer services, the building trades, food processing and as plant and machine operators are likely to face disadvantage in terms of earnings, job and career prospects, working time and intrinsic job quality. A recently published report from Eurofound identifies those occupations that have multiple disadvantages, thereby making it difficult for people to stay in these jobs. It also finds that younger workers (aged 15–24 years) and men are more likely to be in occupations that combine multiple disadvantages. Creating more and better jobs throughout Europe – improving the quality of jobs and ensuring better working conditions – is a key priority of the European employment strategy and of the Europe 2020 strategy. Better working conditions will also help enable a longer working life and so facilitate sustainable work and employment.

A ‘natural complementarity': Michel Servoz on Eurofound At his visit to Eurofound’s premises on 4 July, Michel Servoz (pictured front, centre), new Director General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, spoke of the ‘natural complementarity’ between the Agency and DG Employment. Eurofound’s research interests closely reflect the challenges facing Europe that Mr Servoz highlighted in his address to staff, such as youth unemployment and growing disparities within and between Member States. Speaking of the tasks facing the next Commissioner, Mr Servoz highlighted the need for better aligment of the 28 separate labour markets with education systems, and simplifying social protection systems and making them more effective. Among those pictured with Mr Servoz are Erika Mezger, Deputy Director, Eurofound (front, left) and Juan Menéndez-Valdés, Director, Eurofound (front, right) and a number of Heads of Unit of the Agency. News in brief Mapping youth transitions Across Europe in 2012, some 14.6 million young people between the ages of 15 and 29 were not in work or in any form of education or training; this represents an estimated loss of around €163 billion in welfare transfers and lost incomes and taxes. And this figure doesn’t begin to address the long-term effects – personal and professional – of unemployment and disengagement. A new report from Eurofound finds that the economic climate and the collapse in demand for young workers have hindered young people in successfully moving from school to work and hence their transition to adulthood. However, the findings also demonstrate the tenacity of today’s young Europeans who continue to find and retain jobs in some of the most challenging conditions imaginable. The report will be launched at the second International Forum on Public Employment Policies on 24–25 July in Madrid. Download the report Enabling people aged 50+ to remain in work As the number of people aged over 50 in the EU rises, their participation in the labour market becomes increasingly important. Eurofound launched a new policy brief on this subject at a conference ‘From active inclusion to social investment’ jointly organised by the European Economic and Social Committee and Eurofound in Brussels on 16 June. The brief finds that employment rates among people aged 50+ have risen during the crisis, but that with more people aged 50+ in the labour market (women in particular), unemployment has also increased. About half of those of retirement age who are not in employment say they would like to work; however, many of those aged 50+ in employment would like to work shorter hours. The brief also identifies a number of policy pointers to help workers remain longer in employment, including facilitating part-time work, individualising working arrangements and facilitating caring responsibilities of workers. Read Foundation Findings: Work preferences after 50 Exploring the role of social dialogue In cooperation with the Greek EU Presidency, Eurofound organised a high-level conference ‘Social dialogue as a driver in shaping and improving employment and working conditions in the EU’ in Athens on 23 June. Bringing together representatives of government ministries, national and European social partner organisations, the European Commission, international organisations, and experts, the event provided a forum for participants to discuss how partners across the EU have tackled such issues as youth unemployment, the vulnerability of low-skilled workers and social exclusion. Giving the event’s keynote speech, Nobel Prize winner Professor Christopher Pissarides highlighted the need for comprehensive social dialogue to allow Member States to better distribute the gains of market economies. Presentations and photos are available Women benefit most from growth in top-paying jobs The global financial crisis had a significant impact on the gender employment gap, reducing the difference in the proportion of men and women in the workforce. Moreover, women have benefitted most from employment growth in the top income quintile, experiencing only modest declines in the middle quintiles compared with men. And women are over-represented in the top-quintile job that saw the highest growth – health professionals in the health sector – but under-represented in the construction and manufacturing jobs, which contributed to most lost employment in the middle quintiles. In the lowest-paid jobs, there was a modest rise in male employment, which relates at least in part to take-up of lower-level service employment by men displaced from the construction and manufacturing sectors.

Decline in volume of collective wage-bargaining mapped A new report from Eurofound finds that the economic crisis has triggered considerable changes in wage-bargaining regimes in a number of countries and further extended the existing tendency towards decentralisation in others. Changes to wage-setting mechanisms have been most extensive in (but not limited to) six countries that received financial assistance packages from the troika of the European Commission, ECB and IMF: Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Romania and Spain. Under the terms governing the packages, changes to wage-setting mechanisms were required in all countries except Spain. One change observed across a greater number of Member States has been a decline in the volume of collective wage-bargaining: in 10 of the 25 countries for which data were available, it was reported that the numbers of wage agreements concluded had fallen since 2008. However, in 19 countries there has been little or no change to wage-setting mechanisms since then. For a detailed analysis of the situation, see the report Changes to wage-setting mechanisms in the context of the crisis and the EU’s new economic governance regime  	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-july-2014-1

EUROFOUND_UNK_0443	2014-07-14	UNK	Press release, 14 July 2014	 Eurofound publishes it 2013 yearbook on living and working Europe: Europe is struggling to deliver improved living and working conditions for all Towards the end of 2013, labour market conditions showed signs of stabilising. However, unemployment remained high and the economic recovery remained fragile, and Europe is clearly struggling to deliver improved living and working conditions for all. Eurofound’s fifth annual yearbook ‘Living and working in Europe’, based on the Agency’s research from 2013, describes developments in the EU in the wake of the crisis, focusing on major topic areas including changes in labour markets and employment, efforts to tackle youth unemployment, innovation in workplaces and public trust in institutions. The yearbook is accompanied by the Annual activity report of the Authorising Officer 2013, which is the Agency’s formal reporting on operations, staff and budgets. While unemployment showed signs of stabilising in 2013, it remained high at 10.7%. Striking differences across Member States persisted: rates of 28% in Greece and 26% in Spain, contrasted sharply with rates of 5%–6% in Austria, Germany and Luxembourg. Manufacturing and construction continued to sustain the highest levels of job loss, while the greatest job growth was seen in high-skilled service activities, such as ICT and healthcare. Despite high unemployment, however, the first findings from Eurofound’s European Company Survey showed that 4 out of 10 European managers report having difficulties finding employees with the skills they need. The yearbook review of 2013 suggests that Europe is struggling to deliver improved living and working conditions for Europeans. Large differences exist not only between different groups of citizens, but between Member States. This state of affairs is antithetical to the goals of the European project and presents considerable challenges to policymakers. Eurofound’s mission is to contribute through the knowledge it creates to the work of policymakers as they address these challenges. Eurofound’s labour market analyses in 2013 showed that middle-paying jobs, which declined heavily in the crisis, continue to be lost. While growth is occurring in higher-paying jobs, it does not outweigh that job loss. The jobs being lost are those that employ men mostly. Meanwhile, employment of women has been growing modestly and they are taking a greater share of those high-paying jobs. Still, 7.5 million young people are out of work and not in any form of education or training, which represents an estimated loss of about €163 billion annually in welfare transfers and lost incomes and taxes. The failure to secure a job is delaying their transition into adulthood, preventing them from achieving economic independence (and often delaying their establishment of families), with potentially detrimental consequences for their long-term financial security and well-being. In this context, decline of trust in public institutions (parliaments and governments) across Europe comes as little surprise, but what is perhaps unexpected is that the main influence on people’s trust, uncovered by Eurofound’s research, is not the perceived economic situation of their country but the quality of public services. In this difficult context, Eurofound also focused its analysis on such issues as changing working conditions, the evolution of pay and undeclared work.

Yearbook 2013: Eurofound’s findings over 12 months The employment situation of young people was a special focus of Eurofound’s activities in 2013, with a number of EU institutions citing the Agency’s work in policy documents leading to the launch of the Youth Guarantee. This work and other flagship activities from last year are highlighted in Eurofound’s fifth annual yearbook Living and working in Europe, recently published. It documents the Agency’s findings of changes in the employment structure, with levels of employment rising and falling in different economic sectors and occupations. It also outlines the Agency’s research into innovative work organisation, which examined whether workers benefit from involvement in decision-making. Other major topic areas explored include job creation in home-care services; pay; gender differences in working time; trust in institutions; and the quality of public services. Eurofound’s formal reporting on operations, staff and budgets – Annual activity report of the Authorising Officer for the year 2013 – is published jointly with the yearbook.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0446	2014-07-09	UNK	Workers over 50: Getting the balance right	 Europe is growing older: between 2007 and 2012, the number of people aged 50 years and over in the EU rose from 178 million to 190 million. The future picture is one of an increasing number of retirees being supported by a shrinking population of younger workers; hence, the EU and Member States want to encourage older people to remain in employment for longer. One way to go about this is to find out what older workers actually want. A new policy brief from Eurofound, Work preferences over 50, uses data from the third European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) to map how older people work in practice and what forms of working life would suit their needs. When I’m 64? Working beyond retirement Employment rates for older workers are rising, partly due to some Member States' discouraging early retirement and raising the pensionable age. It seeems that a steadily increasing proportion of people are working beyond the age at which they are entitled to a pension – 65 years and over. The reasons for continuing to work go beyond the need for a better income and include the less tangible benefits of work: intrinsic satisfaction, better social inclusion and an improved quality of life. Indeed, findings from the EQLS and the European Social Survey indicate that up to one half of retirees not currently in paid work would in fact prefer to be working.   Working longer but working less, caring more While older Europeans may be keen to work longer in their lives, they are more likely to want to work fewer hours per week. People aged over 50 who are caring for a child, grandchild or disabled adult face a particular challenge: while they often want to work, they rarely want to work full time as this might compromise the care they deliver. While state and employer support is widely available for younger workers providing childcare, such support is less available for older workers looking after partners or elderly parents.  For working carers, therefore, work–life balance conflicts can be quite common. Adapting work practices  Given the diversity of older Europeans' lives, it’s not surprising that their working preferences differ greatly. Companies could introduce working arrangements that meet the needs of older workers and employers, such as adapting the content of the job to meet the particular abilities of older workers or facilitating different start and finish times in the working day. Earlier Eurofound research examined initiatives for adapting working practices to ensure greater sustainability of work and longer working lives for employees. This new policy brief highlights that many older workers may be seeking a new direction, for example, by becoming a mentor to newly recruited staff; such a development can both boost employment among older workers while helping to integrate younger people into the labour market.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0447	2014-06-24	UNK	Press release, 24 June 2014	 Eurofound publishes a new report on working time developments in Europe 2013: Working time and annual holidays divide Europe The average collectively agreed weekly working time in the European Union stood at 38.1 hours in 2013 (the same as in 2012), according to Eurofound’s latest annual working time update. The working week was on average 30 minutes shorter in the pre-2004 EU15 countries and over 90 minutes longer in the new Member States. The report provides a snapshot of working time developments in the European Union and Norway in 2013 as agreed between the social partners in collective agreements. The combined total of agreed annual leave and public holidays in the EU varied from 40 days in Germany and France to 29 days in Belgium – a difference of more than two working weeks. Collective bargaining plays an important role in determining the duration of working time in most of the 28 Member States of the European Union, though to a lesser or sometimes negligible extent in some of the Member States that joined the EU since 2004. This annual report provides a general overview of collectively agreed working time and any major developments taking place in 2013, and it includes data from all the EU Member States and Norway. Czech Republic, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and the UK were the only countries registering changes between 2012 and 2013. The Czech Republic, Slovakia, and the UK registered an increase of 0.1 hours per week, while Spain recorded a collectively agreed weekly working time which was 0.3 hours higher in 2013 than in 2012. Sweden registered a decrease of 0.2 hours compared with 2012. The report also looks at the average normal weekly working hours for full-time workers as set by collective bargaining in three sectors representing the manufacturing industry, services and the public sector – chemicals, retail trade and civil service. These sectors do not differ significantly in terms of average agreed normal weekly working hours in the EU: the civil service registered 38 hours; the chemicals sector, 38.1 hours; and retail, 38.3 hours. Actual weekly hours worked by full-time employees were longer than the average normal collectively agreed working week in 18 of the 29 countries analysed in the report. In the EU28, the actual working week was 39.5 hours in 2013, 0.1 hours less than in 2012; this was about 1 hour and 24 minutes more than the average agreed working hours. In the EU15, the working week was 39.3 hours, about 1 hour and 42 minutes longer than the agreed hours. In the 13 newer Member States, the working week was 40.1 hours, about 24 minutes longer than the average agreed working hours. In 2013, actual weekly hours worked by male full-time employees in their main jobs continued to exceed those of their female counterparts in all Member States, and Norway. Across the EU28, men worked on average two hours more than women. The gap is wider in the EU15 (2.3 hours) than in the other 13 (1.4 hours). The sharpest differences were observed in Ireland and the UK (3.3 and 3.4 hours more, respectively), in Italy (2.8 hours) and in Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, and Norway (between two and 2.4 hours more). An important factor in the overall length of working time is the paid annual leave to which workers are generally entitled, the report points out. All 28 countries studied have a statutory minimum period of paid annual leave, and the average figure for the EU28, including paid leave and public holidays, stood at 35.3 days – 36.7 days in the EU15 and 31 days in the NMS13. The report reveals big differences between countries, with employees in Germany and France enjoying up to 40 days of leave in total in 2013, followed by employees in Denmark (39 days) and Italy (37 days), while other notably low-leave countries included Estonia, Hungary, Poland and Romania, with 30 days, and Belgium with 29 days. Taking into account the agreed weekly hours, the days of leave and the public holidays, in 2013, the average collectively agreed annual normal working time was approximately 1,712 hours in the EU28 (roughly the same as in 2012), 1,679 hours in the EU15, and 1,819 hours in the NMS13.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0448	2014-06-19	UNK	Tapping the potential of born-global enterprises	Start-up and young enterprises are widely seen as a rich vein of job creation. Not all have a plan or the potential for growth, however. So for governments and policymakers seeking to boost start-ups in their efforts to stimulate job growth, it makes sense to identify those that intend to expand. One type in particular that tends create jobs at a faster pace than others are the ‘born globals’ – enterprises that internationalise rapidly from inception, deviating from the traditional approach of first building up a home market and then possibly going global. Eurofound presented results of its ongoing research on born globals at the recent International Council for Small Business (ICSB) World Conference on Entrepreneurship in Dublin, with the theme of ‘Entrepreneurship and sustainability’. More and better jobs This orientation towards targeting multiple international markets, alongside the process of establishing a business and intensive product development, not only at the same time but also rapidly (as the speed of the process is one of the main success factors), means that these enterprises are likely to need more resources than a conventional start-up. Almost one-fifth of born-global start-ups employ 10 or more workers, compared to 12% of start-ups focused on the home market. They also tend to offer better jobs – jobs that require high skills, promote teamwork, value creativity and pay well. And they’re not a minor phenomenon: Eurofound’s research suggests that around one-fifth of young European companies are in this category. Dynamic and innovative Innovation is at the core of the born global. Their products are usually specialised or differentiated by design, are targeted at niche international markets and are produced using cutting-edge technology. International networks, supported by internet-based communication technologies, play a crucial role in the design and implementation of their business model and create social capital. They also help to foster the development of other firms in the networks. Alongside their distinctive profile, they have distinctive challenges, which not infrequently sink them before they ever reach their potential. Their funding needs are much higher, but they have less access to finance because they lack a track record and have the image of being a riskier investment. Human capital costs are high because of their need for staff with knowledge of foreign markets and international business strategies, and technical staff with highly specialised product development skills. Globalisation is something of a double-edged sword as it exposes them to harsh global competition that can threaten to their emergence and sustainability. Invisibility Eurofound has found that across Europe born globals don’t figure much for policymakers, partly due to the lack of a common understanding of what a born global is. Hence specific support is rare. This, in general, is not too problematic as a wide range of public start-up, internationalisation and innovation support is available to born globals, if not explicitly targeted at them. At the same time, however, the research found examples of public support that implicitly disqualify born globals from eligibility, so room for improvement exists. Eurofound's report Born globals: The potential of job creation in new international businesses underlines the need for more visibility of born globals among European policymakers as a sound business model that can contribute to solving stagnant growth and unemployment in the aftermath of the economic downturn. Pinning down a concrete European definition of this business model would be a good place to start.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/tapping-the-potential-of-born-global-enterprises
EUROFOUND_UNK_0449	2014-07-10	UNK	Which jobs employ most people in the EU? Which are growing and declining most?	Close to 1 in 10 workers in the EU are employed in just two jobs – sales workers in the retail sector and teaching professionals in the education sector – according to findings from the European Jobs Monitor 2014, just published. This research identified over 3,000 jobs across the EU, defining a job as a specific occupation within a specific sector, and found that a small number of jobs account for a large amount of employment in all countries. One-quarter of EU employment is concentrated in the 10 below. In countries where agriculture is a big employer, such as Greece and Romania, 20 jobs or fewer employ half of all workers.   Growing jobs The research also examined which jobs have grown most in the recent past and which have declined most. What is most notable about the jobs that have shown most growth is that they have tended to be at either end of the pay spectrum. The top two jobs for growth – ICT professionals in computer programming and health professionals in the health sector – are in the top pay quintile. (This means that when all jobs are categorised into five categories of equal size on the basis of pay and ordered from lowest to highest, 1 to 5, these two jobs are in quintile 5). Two more of the top 10 for growth are in this quintile. Then the third, fourth and fifth jobs in the list are in the lowest-paying quintile, quintile 1.   Declining jobs The jobs that have declined most are nearly all middle-paying jobs (quintiles 2–4). Three are in the construction sector, where EU employment has decreased more or less continuously for five years. One is in agriculture, which is in long-term decline. According to some analysts, the decline of many middle-ranking jobs can be attributed to the nature of the tasks in those jobs: routine and systematic. These have been in decline over many years in developed economies as a result of workers being replaced by technology or jobs being lost because of offshoring and increased global competition. It is notable that the gains in jobs that showed growth have been much more modest than the losses in the jobs that contracted. In only 2 jobs were there net increases of over 100,000 workers, compared to 11 jobs that experienced the same scale of net job losses. This in part reflects the recession. It also reflects a greater relative concentration of losses in the top 10 declining jobs – 28% of total net loss occurred in these jobs – as well as a more even spread of gains across the growing jobs – only 18% of total net growth took place in the top 10 growing jobs. Note: The appearance of health associate professionals in the human health activities sector in the list of declining jobs is surprising, as health sector employment tended to grow throughout the crisis. One possible explanation is an upgrading of occupations within the health sector in some Member States, with associate professionals being re-categorised as professionals. The fact that the related occupation of health professionals in human health services was one of the jobs with greatest gains lends some support to this possibility.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/which-jobs-employ-most-people-in-the-eu-which-are-growing-and-declining-most
EUROFOUND_UNK_0450	2014-07-10	UNK	Stemming the trend of declining trust	In 2014, a year of European elections, much has been written on the disengagement of voters and the eroding of trust in institutions. Findings from Eurofound’s quality-of-life research, as recently published in its Yearbook: Living and working in Europe 2013, shed a surprising light on this seemingly most intractable of civic problems. Decline of trust across EU Trust in political institutions has been a casualty of the economic crisis. Public trust in the EU has been on a notable slide since 2010, as the crisis began to have a real adverse effect on people’s lives. Trust in national governments and parliaments across the EU as a whole is even lower. What influences trust in public institutions? The question is worth exploring as understanding what bolsters trust – or undermines it – is a starting point in providing policymakers with the information to enable them to reverse the erosion of trust at both national and European level. Through its pan-European Quality of Life Survey, Eurofound asked Europeans about their level of trust in a number of national public institutions – the parliament, legal system, police, press, government and local authorities. In-depth analysis then looked at how certain factors (or variables) affected people’s level of trust in these institutions.  Role of public services A key factor leading to greater trust on the part of citizens is, unsurprisingly, a perceived absence of corruption in public life. As might also be expected, how citizens perceive the economic situation in their country is also important, supporting the view that the economic difficulties since 2008 have been a major contributor to an overall decline in levels of trust. However, the number one factor in shaping how much people trust their country’s institutions is their level of satisfaction with the quality of public services.   Figure: Determinants of trust in public institutions A one-point increase in people’s satisfaction with public services raises their overall rating in trust in public institutions from 4.85 (out of 10) to 5.22. This suggests that if EU and national policy packages are successful in promoting public service delivery in ways that are recognised and appreciated by the public they may have the added, and considerable, benefit of boosting levels of trust. This also implies the need for more thorough and broader monitoring of the performance of public services. Further reading Eurofound's latest Yearbook gives a full update on the Agency's findings from 2013. The full analysis of the EQLS' findings on trust is available in the policy brief Political trust and civic engagement during the crisis.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0453	2014-06-12	UNK	Press release, 12 June 2014	"Eurofound publishes a new report on pay developments in Europe 2013: Purchasing power of EU workers rising, despite limited collectively agreed pay increases Nominal collectively agreed pay increases remained limited in the majority of EU Member States in 2013. However, because of lower inflation rates, employees in a number of European countries saw the purchasing power of their wages increase, reflecting a change from the post-crisis trend that had been observed since 2011. Looking specifically at the civil service, retail and chemicals sectors, pay freezes or pay cuts were found in a majority of countries. Eurofound’s annual update on pay reports on average increases of collectively agreed pay, outcomes of pay indexation mechanisms, pace-setting agreements and national or cross-sectoral agreements in all EU Member States, as well as minimum wage. 	Collective bargaining remains a major determinant of wage developments in Europe. There are, however, considerable variations between the EU countries and Norway in the coverage of employees by collective wage bargaining. Generally, the thirteen Member States that joined the EU since 2004 have lower collective bargaining coverage than the older Member States. In the latter group, only Portugal and the United Kingdom have low bargaining coverage. Slovenia is the only newer Member State that has high coverage. 	The highest coverage of collective wage bargaining in Europe is found in Austria and Belgium, where virtually all employees are covered. Furthermore, in the majority of countries, coverage appears to have decreased over the past decade. In 10 countries, there has been a considerable decrease in coverage (more than 10 percentage points). No Member State experienced a considerable increase in coverage. 	The report found that the change in real collectively agreed pay in 2013 was more positive than in 2012, for the majority of countries. In real terms, collectively agreed pay increased the most in Slovakia (2.0%) and Sweden (1.6%) while it decreased the most in the United Kingdom (-1.6%). 	The report also looks at the developments of statutory minimum wages in Europe. It found that minimum wage levels increased by 10% or more in Lithuania, Estonia, Romania and Bulgaria, while it decreased in Greece. In real terms, the minimum wage decreased in six countries. 	Eurofound has reported on developments in collectively agreed pay across Europe for almost two decades. This year’s annual update on pay reports on average increases of collectively agreed pay stemming from national databases, outcomes of pay indexation mechanisms, pace-setting agreements and national or cross-sectoral agreements. It explains these in relation to the national bargaining context and debate. The report also covers the outcomes of negotiations in three sectors: the chemical industry, the retail sector and the civil service. It also reports on developments in the area of statutory minimum wages.

Despite their crucial place in the economy, however, there has been little research done on such companies, particularly in terms of the implementation of fundamental workers’ rights – such as health and safety at work – and the role played by social dialogue. A new Eurofound report, Social dialogue in micro and small companies, highlights the important role that informal relationships between owners/managers and employees play in companies of this size. Indeed, it finds that while legal and other forms of regulation are important, the deciding factor in influencing social dialogue in these companies is the leadership and management culture, which is essentially driven (especially in micro companies) by the owner of the company. Download the report Conference looks at progress on active inclusion On 16 June in Brussels, Eurofound is jointly hosting a conference with the European Economic and Social Committee on the theme ‘From active inclusion to social investment’. Active inclusion focuses on ensuring that all citizens, particularly the most disadvantaged, can fully participate in society, and emphasises bringing those who can work into employment. The event sets out to examine the measures that have been taken to boost active inclusion since the EU launched its active inclusion strategy in 2008. The conference will examine the strategy’s slow progress to date, and look at how other policy platforms, such as Europe 2020, can support the implementation of the strategy and discuss the role that social partners and European institutions have to play. Eurofound will further contribute to debates around social inclusion and investment when it participates in the European Social Services Conference on 7–9 July in Rome, organised in cooperation with the Italian Presidency of the European Union. More information on the conference Partners debate changes in wage-setting mechanisms The economic crisis has reshaped the world of work in Europe, wage-setting regimes in some Member States having undergone profound change. On 18 June, in Brussels, Eurofound will host another in its successful series of social partners’ lunch debates. At the event – ‘Wage-setting mechanisms in the EU: towards further decentralisation and ‘marketisation’?’ – participants will discuss developments in wage-setting mechanisms in the context of the crisis and the EU’s new economic governance regime. Recent Eurofound research findings will feed into the debate, shedding light on changes in the different dimensions of wage setting in the Member States, economic and political factors influencing change, and the roles played by institutional actors – social partners, governments and European and international bodies.

Eurofound publishes annual update on pay The outcomes of collective wage bargaining are a major determinant of wage developments; they therefore influence the competitiveness of nations, sectors, and companies and employees’ income and so in turn shape aggregate consumer demand, a key factor in economic growth. For over a decade Eurofound has studied developments in pay; its annual update for 2013 finds that although average increases in nominal collectively agreed pay were roughly the same as or lower than those in 2012 in all the countries examined, lower rates of inflation meant that in some countries people’s purchasing power increased. The report also examines developments in statutory minimum wages and the outcomes of pay negotiations in the chemical industry, the retail sector and the civil service, a sector in which many countries have reported pay freezes or pay cuts.

Commissioner Andor visits Eurofound On 20 May, László Andor, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, visited Eurofound for a briefing on the latest research findings in the area of youth unemployment and young people’s transitions from school to the workplace, and to address the staff of the Agency. ‘The European Social Agenda has changed hugely over time,’ Commissioner Andor told staff. ‘A new vocabulary has come into being, including such terms as “Youth Guarantee” and “Social investment” that did not exist previously.’ The Commissioner argued that the economic crisis has led to greater polarisation and inequalities that must be addressed. ‘Europe is emerging from the crisis,’ he said, ‘but with greater imbalances than before’. Accompanying this is ‘a greater political polarisation’, which in turn makes finding answers more difficult. Without resolving these imbalances, he said, there will be continuing damage to Europe’s human capital and the resilience of the EU economy. Mr Andor stressed how important Eurofound has been to him personally in his role as Commissioner, and that more generally he is convinced of the value of all EU Agencies: ‘it is important that they get the appropriate respect and support; their contribution is vital’.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-june-2014-0

Internal restructuring still a major cause of job loss The European Restructuring Monitor (ERM), which covers large-scale restructuring events, recorded some 62,456 announced job losses and 51,918 announced job gains in the first quarter of 2014. Internal restructuring accounted for 66% of the announced job losses, somewhat less than in the previous quarter. The proportions of job losses attributable to closure (13%) and offshoring (5%) were somewhat higher than in recent quarters. Read more in the ERM quarterly News in brief Conference explores potential of social dialogue Although there are signs of recovery from the crisis, European labour markets and social conditions remain challenging. Social dialogue, too, has been affected: there is more decentralisation of collective bargaining, a decrease in the number of agreements and a fall in union membership. Recognising the potential role that social dialogue has to play in boosting working conditions, Eurofound, in cooperation with the Greek Presidency of the EU, is organising a high-level conference ‘Social Dialogue as a driver in shaping and improving employment and working conditions in the EU’ on 23 June in Athens. Bringing together around 100 participants, the conference will seek to draw lessons from the crisis and look to the future of social dialogue and its impact on working conditions in the EU. More information on the upcoming event Young, willing and able - supporting youth Efforts have been stepped up across Europe to alleviate the difficult labour market situation facing young people – notably in the form of the Youth Guarantee; it remains important however to explore what kind of public responses should be taken. Building on the success of Eurofound’s first national-level seminar on the Youth Guarantee in Madrid in November 2013, the next event in the series takes place in Bucharest on 4 June 2014, in cooperation with the Romanian Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Protection and Elderly. Staying on the topic of youth, the seminar ‘Young, willing and able: Supporting youth and the workplace’ aims to apply current knowledge in exploring the types of responses that could or should be taken at national and European level to help build a brighter future for Europe’s young people and their position in the labour market Jobs fall sharply in German solar manufacturing Demand for renewable energy and the injection of billions of euro in government investment stimulated a boom in German solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing in the first decade of this century. At its peak in 2008, the German PV industry produced one-fifth of the world’s solar PV panels and cells. But in recent years the industry’s fortunes have turned dramatically for the worse in the face of global competition from low-wage economies – especially China and Taiwan. And the scaling back of government subsidies has increased uncertainty over its future. Eurofound’s European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) has recorded a considerable number of large-scale job cuts in solar PV manufacturing firms since 2011. Between 2012 and 2013, employment in the sector in Germany dropped from 10,196 to 5,973. Most recently, in March, panel manufacturer Solon announced its relocation to the United Arab Emirates, with the loss of 230 jobs in Germany, while Bosch announced that it would cut 350 jobs in the closure of its PV operations. Download the latest issue of ERM quarterly Workers in banking more affected by restructuring and technological change Workers in banking have been significantly more affected by restructuring and the introduction of new technologies than the EU average. In line with other sectors, the proportion of employees reporting restructuring or reorganisation, or the introduction of new production processes and technologies increases with workplace size. However, there is a much greater prevalence of restructuring and new technology in micro-workplaces (those with fewer than 10 employees) than the sectoral average for the EU28.A series of information sheets from Eurofound compares working conditions across 33 sectors, banking included. An overview report highlights trends across sectors in working time and work–life balance, work organisation, skills and training, employee representation and the psychosocial and physical environment.

News in brief Examining the impact of the crisis The crisis that has gripped the global and European economy since 2008 has resulted in profound changes to both industrial relations and working conditions. A new report from Eurofound maps the impact of the crisis between 2008 and 2012. It finds that the trend towards decentralisation in collective bargaining has accelerated in many countries. Working conditions have also been affected, with less work available, less training, and less job security. Fewer choices are available and career mobility has diminished. Notably, men have been affected more than women in terms of working conditions, in part because of the particular impact experienced in the male-dominated sectors of manufacturing and construction. Despite these adverse impacts, the report also finds that job satisfaction has risen, the negative effect of rising job insecurity being compensated for by the satisfaction of still having a job. Read Impact of the crisis on industrial relations and working conditions in Europe Meeting the information needs of our audiences Eurofound’s latest policy brief on quality of life – Social situation of young people – has prompted an unprecedented level of interest. Eurofound recorded over 1,100 downloads of the brief within a week of its publication. Moreover, coverage of its key messages – the challenges facing young people in the face economic hardship – appeared in both European and global media. A key element in delivering on the Agency’s priority of timely, policy-relevant information is monitoring the takeup of our outputs and the response to them, in order to better meet the information needs of our stakeholders. The short, reader-friendly policy brief format is a result of a recognition of the need for a concise presentation of the findings in a policy context. As part of this ongoing drive to further improve its overall effectiveness and customer focus, the Agency has commissioned an external evaluation of its work programme, work on which has already begun. As well as reviewing its previous and current work, the evaluation will also inform the development of the new mid-term strategy for 2017–2020. Stakeholder enquiry service reports on steel sector The steel sector is a key economic player in Europe, employing over 350,000 workers. While workers in heavy industry are traditionally seen as being prone to physical injury, increasing attention is being paid to the psychosocial risks that employees in the sector may encounter. A new report from Eurofound details the industrial relations practices employed in three major steel companies – ArcelorMittal, Rautaruukki and Salzgitter AG – to limit stress and promote mental health and well-being. The report – Industrial relations practices related to psychosocial constraints at work in the steel sector – is part of Eurofound’s stakeholder enquiry service, a series of tailor-made research studies with a short turn-around time. Part of Eurofound’s drive to produce more on-demand studies and services for its main stakeholder groups, the service aims to meet their precise information needs to help them advance their own work. Download the report Rise in feelings of job insecurity since start of crisis Between 2003 and 2007, Eurofound found a general decrease in perceived job insecurity. From 2007 to 2012, however, job insecurity increased – dramatically, in the case of Slovenia, Cyprus and Greece (by over 20 percentage points). In only four countries (Belgium, Finland, Germany and Sweden) was there a decrease in job insecurity. This overall increase in perceived job insecurity correlates positively with the overall increase in the unemployment rate documented by Eurostat between 2007 and 2011.

Assisting families in the crisis The economic crisis has led to a deterioration of living and working conditions in many Member States and has increased inequalities between countries and groups of people; those who are already vulnerable are at an increased risk of poverty and social exclusion. Increasing inequality is also apparent between families: whether a child lives in poverty depends, in part, on the type of family in which he or she grows up. It is against this background that the EU’s Social Investment Package calls for Member States to focus on simple, targeted, conditional social investment. A recently published report from Eurofound, Quality of life in Europe: Families in the economic crisis, aims to help policymakers identify the types of families with children that need to be targeted. Using data from Eurofound’s European Quality of Life Survey, the report describes the changing quality of life across the EU for different types of families with children and compares their living standards and social situation. Launched at an EU Presidency conference in Athens on 28–29 April, the report is available for download.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-may-2014-1
EUROFOUND_UNK_0463	2014-05-02	UNK	Employment slides in green energy technology manufacturing	The once-booming solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing sector (which produces solar panels and cells) has seen its fortunes dive in recent years. In the 2000s, the industry flourished, recording growth levels in global capacity of 58% annually between 2007 and 2011. This expansion was largely driven by state subsidies, which have since been pared back. In addition, global competition, from China especially, has driven down prices. These two factors have triggered a crisis in the industry, leading to a scaling back of production and sharp job losses.  German job losses The latest issue of Eurofound's ERM quarterly highlights the situation in Germany, which dominates the industry in Europe. At its peak in 2008, Germany accounted for one-fifth of global production of PV panels and cells. Problems of global overcapacity and uncertainty about state financial support, however, have cost thousands of jobs since 2011. Between early 2012 and early 2013, employment in the sector in Germany dropped from 10,196 to 5,973. The case of solar panel manufacturer Solon is illustrative. In March this year, the company announced that it would be relocating its headquarters to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and closing its remaining facilities in Germany, with the loss of 230 jobs. The company had been an industry success story; founded in 1996, it had sales of €815 million in 2008 and employed nearly 1,000 people in Germany, France, Italy and the US. However, it filed for bankruptcy in 2011 and was later acquired by UAE-based Microsol. R&D potential The job-creation potential of the greening of the economy has given rise to much optimism. However, renewables equipment manufacturing is not likely to be a major part of this picture, as production has clearly shifted to Asian competitors. Job growth in this sector in Europe is more likely to be concentrated in R&D, installation and maintenance. The outlook for the renewable energy sector as a whole nevertheless remains upbeat. The European Commission’s Employment and Social Developments in Europe 2013 notes that the renewable energy employment share in energy production is expected to rise from 19% in 2010 to 32% by 2020. Green energy is more labour intensive than the traditional fossil-fuel energy sector, implying that the replacement of fossil-based energy by green energy will result in a net increase in employment. For a summary of developments in the green energy sector over the past decade, see Eurofound’s 2012 ERM annual report, pages 22–26.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/employment-slides-in-green-energy-technology-manufacturing

Sustainable work – a policy priority Smart growth – one of the priority areas of the Europe 2020 strategy – requires that we explore new approaches to working conditions and career paths so that workers can stay physically and mentally healthy, motivated and productive throughout an extended working life. In its Foundation Seminar Series over the course of this year, Eurofound will look at this issue of sustainable work. The first session on 22 May will prepare the ground by exploring the barriers that exist to making sustainable work a reality, and the benefits that accrue when measures for greater sustainability are implemented. It will also look at different types of sustainable work practices. The second session in November will look at initiatives that have introduced sustainable work practices at company level, with a view to promoting inclusion and competitiveness. Eurofound’s Foundation Seminar Series is an annual event designed to allow the exchange of national policies and practices between participants from a range of countries.

Helping families through the crisis In Europe, children are the age group most at risk of poverty and social exclusion. Their life chances can be particularly compromised if they grow up in jobless households; in some Member States, over 25% of children live in such households. In its research, Eurofound is looking at the kinds of policies and services that can best protect families from the risks of poverty and social exclusion, in such areas as social protection benefits, housing, childcare and healthcare. The Agency will be presenting some of the results of its work at an EU Presidency conference in Athens on 28–29 April – Families in the crisis: Finding work-life balance in difficult economic context – jointly organised by of the Confederation of Family Organisations in the European Union (COFACE) and its Greek member organisation, KMOP. With regular, contributions of research expertise to the rotating Presidency, Eurofound has just met with the Italian Minister of Labour and Welfare to discuss initial plans for joint actions for the Italian Presidency starting 1 July. Key areas for collaboration include the challenges facing young people and the social dimension of Europe.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0468	2014-04-08	UNK	News release, 8 April 2014	Eurofound publishes a new report on Industrial relations practices related to psychosocial constraints at work in the steel sector in Europe: Positive effects of steel workers’ direct participation in managing health, safety and psychosocial risks at the workplace (Dublin, Ireland): Direct involvement of all workers within an organisation with a view to achieving a culture of openness regarding psychosocial constraints at the workplace is one of the main challenges for the steel sector, according to Eurofound’s latest report on ‘Industrial relations practices related to psychosocial constraints at work in the steel sector’. Encouraging people to talk about their problems at work, especially psychosocial problems, is a key element in tackling the issue of the effectiveness of prevention strategies. The report looks at industrial relations practices regarding health and safety strategies in the European steel sector by analysing company practices in three case studies: ArcelorMittal in France, Rautaruukki in Finland and Salzgitter AG in Germany. The report compares the main findings on the role of social dialogue and company practices regarding prevention. It also highlights some specific company and sectoral features triggering psychosocial risks and their prevention. Although the three companies studied operate in different contexts (global, European, national, local), they are all confronted with psychosocial constraints at work. Issues such as stress, mental health and well-being are perceived as being not only detrimental to the health of workers, but as also having an economic impact on employers and civil society. The negative impacts of psychosocial problems arising at the workplace occur on economic performance (productivity) and human capital. For this reason, the three companies initiated a psychosocial risk assessment and subsequently compiled prevention measures. These took place in a wide variety of contexts, for example on the initiative of management, in the light of demographic change or following restructuring, but were part of the companies’ general policy and were supported by management. The report shows that the three companies have developed specific actions to deal with, reduce or prevent the incidence and negative impact of psychosocial constraints on both workers and the company. Real investments are therefore being made to implement awareness-raising programmes, train managers and prevent detrimental outcomes. The companies involve all workers, especially management, in addressing the issue. Triggering a collective behavioural change and involving all stakeholders within the organisation is therefore considered to constitute the key element and main on-going challenge. Existing formal and informal social dialogue channels represent an asset as they offer a place for an increased exchange of views between workers and employers.

A moment of change and opportunity 'Core, central and mainstream to the needs of the European Union' is how Secretary-General of the European Commission, Catherine Day, described the work of Eurofound on a recent visit to the Agency’s premises in Dublin. The EU is undergoing profound change, Ms Day stressed when she addressed staff on 11 April. While Europe is moving out of a recessionary era, many challenges persist: unemployment will take longer to resolve than even the banking and sovereign debt crises, and the solutions that applied in the pre-crisis era will not suffice in a new, post-crisis era. Combined with this, in 2014 the institutions of the EU are poised to change substantially: a new Commission, with a new President, will be in place at the end of the year, as will a new Parliament. And given the necessarily slow pace at which policymaking happens, Europe needs to be thinking now of the appropriate policies for 2019 and 2024. Against this challenging backdrop she highlighted the key contribution that Eurofound’s knowledge will play in helping the institutions make the best decisions possible: the Agency, she noted, can bring ‘enlightenment’ and a ‘factual basis for decisions’ to the decision-makers’ table. And Eurofound’s experience will in particular be called upon when it assumes the role of coordinating the troika of agencies in 2015.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-april-2014-1

Spotlight on pay in Europe The issue of wages has attracted considerable attention at European level since the onset of the economic crisis. Changes in economic governance, notably within the European Semester, have prompted discussions on wage-setting mechanisms. Overall, wage-bargaining regimes have remained relatively stable over time; however, substantial changes can be seen in those Member States facing more difficult economic circumstances. A new report from Eurofound, Pay in Europe in the 21st century, provides comparative time series on wage-bargaining outcomes across the EU Member States and Norway, discussing pay developments against the background of different bargaining regimes and looking into the link between pay and productivity developments. It also investigates and calculates the implications in all EU Member States of setting a hypothetical threshold for minimum wages (for example, set at 60% of the median in each country) and estimates the number and types of workers who would be affected by this development.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0472	2014-04-02	UNK	Societal shifts transforming labour markets	European societies are undergoing social, cultural and economic transitions that will have significant implications for the labour markets of the future. The European Commission has funded a research project, NEUJOBS, to analyse how labour markets are likely to develop in light of these transitions, and Eurofound will be taking part in a workshop organised in the context of this initiative. ‘Employment 2025 – How will multiple transitions affect the European labour market?’ takes place on 8–11 April in Bonn and will examine the possible impact of societal shifts on particular groups in the labour force, such as women and older people, and on different sectors of the economy, including health and social care. Eurofound’s Anna Ludwinek will participate in the discussion panel on care and social inclusion services. Care sector jobs The social-care services sector is likely to be a major source of job growth over the coming decades. As the population ages, the number of people with dementia, chronic illnesses and disabilities and in need of care is rising. At the same time, the provision of informal care by family members is dwindling as more women are working outside the home. The OECD expects demand for care workers to double or triple between now and 2050. However, the care sector has enduring labour shortages because of high staff turnover and failure to attract recruits in sufficient numbers. Existing and potential employees are discouraged by low pay, demanding working conditions and poor career prospects. Overcoming barriers Eurofound research on more and better jobs in home-care services sought to identify initiatives across Europe that overcame these barriers to recruiting and retaining care staff – such as home helps, social care workers, community workers and district nurses. The research identified a variety of successful initiatives. Some, for instance, were aimed at tapping existing labour market reserves, including the unemployed, migrants and disabled people; others were aimed at professionalising staff and giving them greater responsibility. The research found that some measures could successfully transfer to other organisations and regions, as long as the strategy was well thought out. It also concluded that such initiatives could be effective at integrating workers at the margins of the formal labour market.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/spotlight-on/employment/societal-shifts-transforming-labour-markets

News in pictures Internal restructuring main source of job loss: Internal restructuring continued to be the main source of announced job losses across the EU in the final quarter of 2013. Restructuring accounted for over 70% of the announced job losses, while the incidence of job loss due to bankruptcy (11%) and closures (9%) decreased compared to the previous quarter. Overall, more than 96,000 job losses were announced, and around 37,500 announced job gains. Read more on the EMCC website. News in brief Eurofound contribution to Greek Presidency In January, Greece took over the reins of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. Against a background of austerity, unemployment and shaken social cohesion across Europe, the Greek Presidency reaffirms the policy priorities for the EU of fostering growth, competitiveness and jobs, and ensuring stability and prosperity for all citizens. Eurofound is well placed to deliver the analysis that policymakers will require over the course of the Presidency; in particular, the Agency’s research findings will form a relevant input into the informal EU Employment Committee meeting on 7–8 April and the Senior Labour Inspectorates Committee meeting on 26–27 May (both in Athens). Eurofound’s contribution will culminate in a jointly organised conference with the Presidency on social dialogue as a way to develop and foster labour relations, on 23 June in Athens. For more information, visit www.eurofound.europa.eu/presidencies/index.htm Violence at work an ongoing issue Violence – physical or psychological – is a reality in the European workplace. Overall, some 6% of workers are likely to have experienced some form of workplace violence in the past 12 months. At the same time, research shows that both physical and psychological violence have serious implications for the health and well-being of workers. Workers exposed to such risks report significantly higher levels of work-related ill-health, the most common symptoms being stress, sleep problems, fatigue and depression. Greater understanding of the scope and the damaging nature of workplace violence has made it a focus of attention for policymakers, EU institutions, social partners, legal authorities and legislators. Download the full report Responding to the situation of young people It is estimated that around 14 million people in Europe between the ages of 15 and 29 are not in employment, education or training. Policy focus has intensified in recent years on these so-called ‘NEETs’. Along with its sister agencies Cedefop and the European Training Foundation, Eurofound will be contributing research findings and analysis at a conference addressing the needs of such young people. Organised by the Romanian government, the conference Keeping young people in employment, education and training: Common challenges - Shared solutions in Bucharest on 10–11 March will be opened by European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth, Androulla Vassiliou. Eurofound experts will provide specific examples of good practices aimed at reaching the most vulnerable groups as well as on policy measures targeted at easing school-to-work transitions. Eurofound continues programme of visits to the Agency On 23 January, a delegation from the Norwegian Union of Social Educators and Social Workers* visited Eurofound to learn more about the Agency’s work – in particular, its work on gender and diversity, on the social inclusion of young people, and on new forms of employment, labour trends and job creation.

Quality of life trends over past decade Overall subjective well-being has remained stable, but happiness and work–life balance levels have declined, and more people are having trouble making ends meet, according to a new report that looks at trends in perceptions of quality of life in Europe over the past decade. In the Member States with the lowest scores in 2003, well-being increased, and most of the other Member States show more or less stable scores. The main exception is Greece, where the economic crisis is linked to sharp falls in both life satisfaction and happiness between 2007 and 2011. Average levels of trust in other people declined between 2003 and 2011, and there was an even sharper fall in trust in institutions across all Member States. However, reported tension between social groups seems to be decreasing, with the exception of the EU12, where tensions between racial and ethnic groups are perceived as having increased between 2007 and 2011, a change in the downward trend between 2003 and 2007.

Investigating working conditions in sectors Workers in the transport and storage, accommodation and food and beverages sectors are especially likely to find that their working hours and family or social commitments do not fit well. Interestingly, in these sectors relatively large proportions of people work atypical and irregular hours. In contrast, sectors with reported good work–life balance, such as education, computer programming, and furniture, are also sectors where workers tend to work typical and regular hours. Many interventions to improve working conditions and job quality are organised and implemented at sectoral level. To support this process and provide appropriate knowledge to meet the needs of policymakers, a recently published report from Eurofound – Working conditions and job quality: Comparing sectors in Europe – uses data from the Agency’s fifth European Working Conditions Survey to compare 33 sectors in terms of working conditions and job quality. The report is complemented by information sheets for each sector.

News in brief Eurofound joins coordinating troika of EU Agencies The EU Agencies Network draws together more than 40 Agencies; these represent just 20% of the overall EU staff and 2% of the budget but play a very important role in providing research, information and expertise across the 28 Member States and beyond in their vastly different areas of work. The network facilitates the Agencies’ greater coherence and effectiveness, and so maximises the contribution they make. At a meeting on 12 March, Eurofound joined the rotating troika of Agencies that coordinates the network’s shared activities. At the same meeting, the chair of the troika was formally handed over to the Fundamental Rights Agency in Vienna; Eurofound will become the chair on 1 March 2015. A panel discussion that followed allowed an exchange of views on how the Agencies can better facilitate the increased involvement of national institutions, citizens and other stakeholders in the political processes. With less than 12 months to go before assuming the role, Eurofound has started to put in place the resources and processes to ensure a successful year (which will also mark a key milestone for the Agency, being the 40-year anniversary of its inception in 1975).  Eurofound's new Network of Correspondents meets A key strength of Eurofound’s work is the national-level expertise it brings together to gain a comparative picture of industrial relations, working conditions and restructuring across Europe from its Network of Correspondents. On 19–20 March, Eurofound launched a new four-year collaboration with the network at its premises in Dublin, after a comprehensive public tender procedure. Experts in their fields, the members of the network are Eurofound’s ears and eyes on the ground in all 28 EU Member States, regularly reporting on developments relating to working conditions and industrial relations, living conditions and quality of life, and employment and change; many have been working with Eurofound over a number of years. Their input feeds into Eurofound’s comparative research work and is published on the Agency’s website. Towards a European industrial renaissance? In the wake of the financial crisis, policymakers in many EU Member States are looking to industrial policy as a strategy to re-activate growth, create jobs and foster productivity. At a Liaison Forum lunch debate organised by the European Commission in Brussels on 10 March, Eurofound Research Manager Stavroula Demetriades presented the findings of a new Eurofound study on the role of social dialogue in industrial policies. The study explored the use of different industrial policy measures in six economic sectors – agro-food, steel, textiles, chemicals, automotive and defence – and found that innovation policy, and research and development (R&D), were among the most widely used initiatives. It concludes that involving the social partners in formulating and implementing policy at both national and European level can harness valuable expertise in labour market, social and industry domains. In turn, this has the potential to make industrial policy initiatives more robust, relevant and timely. Read Role of social dialogue in industrial policies Engaging citizens in Europe Disengagment from civic and political processes is a key concern in social policy. To discuss how to tackle this, and to promote a greater engagement in the upcoming European Parliament elections in May, the Confederation of Family Organisations in the European Union (COFACE) together with Eurofound and COFACE’s German member organisation AGF are organising a conference 2014: Citizen action for better family policies in Berlin on 28 March.

Spotlight on social situation of young people Despite high levels of youth unemployment across Europe, young people are generally optimistic about the future, as analysis of Eurofound survey findings makes clear. On 25 March, Eurofound will co-host an event in Dublin with the National Youth Council of Ireland, at which Eurofound’s latest policy brief, Social situation of young people, will be launched. The brief draws on findings from Eurofound’s 2012 European Quality of Life Survey, bringing analysis of these data together with evidence from other Eurofound projects to formulate a number of policy pointers. It focuses on such dimensions of quality of life for 18–29 year-olds as living arrangements, social exclusion, relationships and sources of support, as well as participation in society and social/cultural activities. The brief illustrates the scale of the impact of the crisis on young people’s lives: more young people in 2012 were living with some form of deprivation than in 2007; in addition, more were living with their parents.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0481	2014-03-24	UNK	News release, 25 March 2014	 Eurofound publishes a new report on the social situation of young people in Europe: Increase in young people living at home across EU since onset of economic crisis (Dublin, Ireland): The number of young people living at home with their parents across Europe has increased from 44% to 48% between 2007 and 2011. This holds true especially for young men, according to new research by Eurofound into the social situation of young people in Europe. Nearly half of young people in the EU live in households experiencing some form of deprivation with 27% at moderate levels and 22% experiencing serious deprivation. The ‘Social situation of young people in Europe’, presented to policymakers in Dublin today, puts emphasis on both social and employment issues affecting young people. The policy brief offers a comparative insight across EU Member States of the social situation of youth in Europe and evolving trends. In most EU28 Member States, more young people were living with their parents in 2011 than in 2007. This increase is significant for both the younger age group (18–24 years), and the older group (25–29 years), and for both men and women. Young men are more likely to live with their parents than young women, and, as expected, those aged below 25 are  more likely to live with their parents than those aged between 25 and 29. These proportions vary greatly by country. There were especially large increases in some countries: the greatest increase recorded in Hungary (36%), followed by Slovenia (21%), Lithuania (17%) and Poland (15%). ‘Tackling youth unemployment continues to be a policy priority for European and national governments, but the need to directly address the risk of social exclusion and the need to look at the broader aspects of social inclusion are increasingly recognised in the public debate,’ says Juan Menéndez-Valdés, Director, Eurofound. ‘Remaining outside the labour market has far-reaching consequences – not solely economic. These include a loss of confidence, an undermining of trust and expectations, and an increasing risk of social exclusion and disengagement from society. With this report, we have put the spotlight on the social situation of young people most at risk, in an effort to further the debate and facilitate the tackling of these challenges. ’ Anna Ludwinek, research manager, Eurofound explains: ‘This report shows that the economic crisis has forced a growing number of young people to continue to live at home, with serious implications for their independence, transition into adulthood and even on their perceived levels of social exclusion.’ The report confirmed that both unemployed young people seeking work and inactive young people would like to work if they could freely choose their working hours. This includes inactive young mothers and fathers looking after their children. Not surprisingly, the report found that unemployed and inactive young people are more likely than others to feel socially excluded, to feel lonely, to face a lack of social support, and to have lower levels of mental well-being. It also found that young people are less likely to trust institutions in 2011 than they did in 2007, with the exception of the police, whom they trust as much as before. Finally, it found that young people are more likely than older people to perceive tensions between ethnic or religious groups, as well as between groups of different sexual orientation. The new report is based on Eurofound’s European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS), a representative survey of those aged 18 and over in Europe, covering all EU countries and some acceding, candidate and potential candidate countries. The survey aims to present a multidimensional picture of quality of life in Europe, including questions on both the objective circumstances of people’s lives (such as living conditions, income, deprivation) and their subjective feelings and perceptions (such as life satisfaction and feeling of social exclusion). The most recent iteration of the survey took place in 2011.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0482	2014-03-06	UNK	News release, 6 March 2014	 Eurofound publishes report on Pay in Europe in the 21st century: Wage setting mechanisms and minimum wages under the spotlight in Europe (Dublin, Ireland): While wage-bargaining regimes have remained stable over time in many countries, the post-crisis period after 2009 saw an acceleration of collective bargaining being delegated to more decentralised bargaining structures and reduced bargaining coverage. Comparing collectively agreed pay with actual compensation, the Central and Eastern European countries are catching up with European averages. The Pay in Europe in the 21st century report provides comparative time series on wage-bargaining outcomes across the EU Member States and Norway. It also investigates the different systems and levels of minimum wages in Europe at present, evaluating the implications of a hypothetical scenario of a minimum wage set at 60% of the median national wage and discussing the possibilities and difficulties of coordination in this matter. The report will be presented to government representatives of EU Member States on Friday 7 March 2014. The issue of wages has attracted particular attention at European level since the onset of the economic crisis. Changes in economic governance, notably within the European semester, have brought discussions on wage-setting mechanisms to the fore. While overall, wage-bargaining regimes have remained rather stable over time in many countries, the most substantial changes were seen in programme countries and in other Member States facing more difficult economic situations in the post-crisis period after 2009. The report found, however, that the acceleration of decentralisation, with more bargaining being delegated to the company level, has not affected the predominant level of central or sectoral bargaining in most Member States – at least, not for the time being. When looking at actual levels of compensation during the period between 1998 and 2012, the report found that actual compensation per employee rose on an annual average between 0.9% in Italy and 22% in Romania, with the European median at 3.5% per year. Higher growth rates of actual compensation per employee, mainly in the new Member States, reflect how the countries in Central and Eastern Europe are catching up with European averages, ranging from 4.5% in Croatia to 10% in Latvia. The lowest increases took place in Italy, Germany, Austria, Cyprus and France, all between 1% and 3%. In terms of wage share within the economies, the overall trend was that of a declining one in most Member States (except in the Czech Republic, Finland and the United Kingdom, where the wage share is growing). However, in the majority of countries with decentralised bargaining systems and low coordination, the wage share declined during the crisis. In contrast, in the majority of countries with other systems, real unit labour costs increased. The report found that increases in collectively agreed pay were lowest in the country group with sector-level and highly coordinated bargaining, while they were highest in countries with intermediate-level bargaining and a low degree of coordination. At the sectoral level, disparities in terms of collectively agreed pay have increased over time between the public sector (local governments and civil service) and the private sectors covered in the study (metal, chemicals, retail and banking), mainly because in the public sector of many countries across Europe, pay was frozen or only moderately increased. Collectively agreed pay remains an important driver of actual pay in many countries, and it is the component of pay that can be most influenced by the actors involved. Collectively agreed pay refers to basic wages only, while actual wage bills include overtime payments, bonuses, stock options or other forms of variable pay. Minimum wages can be considered as a cornerstone of the ‘European Social Model’. They exist in all EU Member States, even if they are set up and established in very different ways and do not cover all those who are employed in all Member States. In general, minimum wages are not explicitly aimed at reducing wage inequality and poverty, but at establishing a minimum rate under which any employment relationship is considered to be unacceptable - in other words, the establishment of morally based labour standards. In the majority of EU Member States, minimum wages are set by government regulation. Germany together with Austria, Denmark, Finland, Italy and Sweden are the exceptions, where minimum wages are set by collective bargaining agreements and do not cover all workers. Monthly statutory minimum wages or average collective agreed minimum wages in EU Member States are estimated at between €122,7 (Romania) to €1,788 (Luxembourg). The report evaluates the implications of a hypothetical scenario of a minimum wage set at 60% of the median national wage and discusses the possibilities and difficulties of coordination in this matter. The quantitative impact of such a policy would vary considerably across countries: it would be largest in the Baltic countries, Germany, Ireland, Poland, Romania and the UK, and smallest in Belgium, France the Nordic countries, Portugal and Slovakia. Germany stands out from the rest, where almost one in four German workers would see their wages increase with the establishment of a minimum wage threshold of of 60% of the median. The report also found that a minimum wage set at 60% of the median would disproportionately affect women (21.5% of female workers versus 11% of male) and young workers (35% of those in 20-24 years age group, 16% of those in 25-29 age group, versus 12% of those in 30-55 years age groups). The biggest impact would be in the personal services sectors and in small companies.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0484	2014-03-21	UNK	Eurofound data highlighted in new Eurostat publication	"On Thursday 20 March, the second International Day of Happiness was celebrated worldwide. Established by the United Nations General Assembly in 2012, the day reflects the increasing recognition that policymakers around the world are paying to the subjective dimension of human development. In its resolution, the UN spoke of ‘the need for a more inclusive … approach … that promotes … happiness and the well-being of all peoples’. But not just the UN: the European Commission, in its Communication 'Beyond GDP', stressed that ‘citizens care for their quality of life and well-being’ with such objective elements as income, health and public services being means to that end. And in the OECD Guidelines on measuring subjective well-being"" the organisation cautioned that while ‘ultimately, it is well-being that is the focus of policy …. there is a shortage of comparable international data on subjective well-being.’ Using Eurofound data That shortage is being addressed, however. Eurostat has just released a new online publication 'Quality of life indicators' – appropriately enough, on International Day of Happiness 2014. The indicators comprise the so-called ‘8+1’ list: eight indicators that combine objective factors and subjective perceptions (such as material living conditions, health and environment), complemented by one solely subjective dimension that measures the overall experience of life. For this dimension, Eurostat has chosen Eurofound data on life satisfaction from the Agency’s third European Quality of Life Survey in 2011–2012. Life satisfaction measures how people evaluate their life overall, taking all life circumstances into account; it can be viewed as a person’s measure of their success in life. Over the three waves of the survey from 2003 to 2012, people were asked to rate how satisfied they were with their lives on a scale of 1–10.  What influences life satisfaction? With almost 44,000 people interviewed in 34 countries in 2011–2012, Eurofound has been able to map relationships between life satisfaction and a wide range of key variables. People stuck in long-term unemployment are much less satisfied with their lives than those with jobs. Having a strong sense of purpose in life is correlated being more satisfied with one’s life. Those who have a high income are more satisfied. Age is also a factor: younger people are more satisfied with their lives. In most countries, life satisfaction falls consistently until the age of 65, after which it increases again, sometimes resulting in senior citizens being as, or even more, satisfied with their lives than the youngest generation. However, in some countries life satisfaction decreases continuously with age; locating which policies may best address this is a necessary step in ensuring the greatest well-being for all."	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/eurofound-data-highlighted-in-new-eurostat-publication
EUROFOUND_UNK_0485	2014-02-10	UNK	How is the Youth Guarantee being rolled out?	Implementing the European Youth Guarantee in the EU is a massive challenge for Member States. Government and social partners recognise the need for earlier intervention in preventing youth unemployment, lowering the number of young people not in employment, education or training (NEETs) and adopting a more collaborative approach in tackling the very difficult situation facing Europe’s young people. Action is underway and with youth unemployment declining in some Member States, things appear to be moving in a positive direction. It is hoped that the Youth Guarantee will contribute to attaining some of the Europe 2020 objectives: a 75% employment rate of the population aged 20–64; rates of early school-leaving below 10%; and lifting 20 million people out of poverty and social exclusion. Current state In April 2013, EU ministers adopted a Council recommendation on establishing a Youth Guarantee (736 KB PDF) with the aim of getting young people under the age of 25 into employment, education or training within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education. Since then, the EU Member States have been finalising their Youth Guarantee Implementation Plans and so far, according to a press release by the European Commission, 17 countries have submitted plans. These include Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Sweden. The Youth Guarantee and other measures to tackle youth unemployment will be co-financed by the European Social Fund (ESF). But those countries with a high number of NEETs and very high youth unemployment – that is, rates in certain areas above 25% – will receive additional support from the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI). This group of 20 countries, which includes Ireland (24.6% youth unemployment), Greece (59.2%), Italy (41.6%), Portugal (36.3%) and Spain (54.3%) (Eurostat, December 2013), was required to submit their implementation plans by the end of 2013. Three were still outstanding by mid January (Slovakia, Slovenia and the UK). The remaining seven Member States not eligible for this funding have until early 2014 to submit plans – Austria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands. What next? While the Commission assesses the implementation plans already submitted, and provides feedback in due course, Member States are pressing on in preparing their operational programmes. These programmes will specify where each Member States plans to target the ESF and YEI funding over the course of 2014–2020. It is obvious that the cost of implementing youth guarantee schemes is huge, but as Eurofound estimates have shown the cost of inaction is much higher, with NEETs estimated to cost the European taxpayer €153 billion a year, not to mention the knock-on cost to individuals and the wider society. Member States will look to the experiences of youth guarantee schemes in Finland and Sweden which have already been explored by Eurofound research. Youth agenda Continuing the process of dialogue on youth issues and how young people can contribute, a number of recent events have marked the importance of youth issues on the policy agenda. For example, the ‘European young leaders: 40 under 40’ group, led by EuropaNova and Friends of Europe, met on 31 January in Brussels to contribute ideas on topics like the role of young voters in European election campaigns, the EU’s impending leadership change and the EU’s energy policy, among others. On 5 February, in the UK, the 8th Annual National NEET Conference 2014 focused on how to ‘Engage, enable, empower and employ NEETs’.

News in pictures ECS maps autonomous teamwork across Europe: In autonomous or semi-autonomous teams, workers decide among themselves on the division of tasks to complete a product or service and are held collectively responsible for achieving these tasks. Autonomous teamwork is most commonly practised in Finland, Denmark and Sweden (in between 42% and 43% of establishments), followed by Slovenia and Austria. An initial range of findings from Eurofound’s Third Company Survey (ECS) have been made available in the interactive survey mapping tool on the Agency’s website. Data can be presented in the form of maps and bar charts, and downloaded for further use. Explore the Survey Mapping Tool News in brief Young workers face tough job market The crisis has hit young workers in Europe particularly hard, with widespread job losses and less job security for those who keep their jobs. Young workers and young labour market entrants (with less than two years in the labour market) face a grim prospect: the evidence shows falling youth employment rates, high unemployment rates (23% by mid-2013) and high levels of non-standard forms of employment – temporary, part time, or without a contract – which young workers usually accept as stepping stones to better positions. While temporary jobs were cut during the recession, there has since been a relative increase in such contracts, employers being reluctant to create permanent jobs in an uncertain climate. These are some of the findings of two recently published reports from Eurofound – Working conditions of young entrants to the labour market, and Young people and temporary employment in Europe. Exploring disadvantage in poor quality of life Eurofound’s most recent report on quality of life in Europe – Quality of life in Europe: Social inequalities – highlights how certain sociodemographic characteristics are correlated with poorer quality of life. People who are unemployed or have a limiting health condition or disability, for example, are more likely to be unable to afford everyday goods and services. They are also more likely to feel a lack of autonomy in their lives, and to feel that they are not treated with dignity and respect. Meanwhile, older people – especially those aged over 80 years – are at greater risk of loneliness and more often lack social support and feel socially isolated. The report, part of a series of secondary analyses of data from the most recent European Quality of Life Survey in 2012, captures the multidimensional nature of quality of life by looking at different factors that contribute to it, such as health, social life and living standards. The full report, plus the other secondary analyses in the series, are available Focus on income and pay across Europe Recent Eurofound research on pay, income and material well-being points to wide-scale, long-term change. The latest issue of Eurofound’s magazine Foundation Focus – Feeling the squeeze? Pay, wages and income under pressure – looks at the issues surrounding these in the face of sustained, difficult economic circumstances. Between 2007 and 2011, the proportion of households experiencing difficulties in making ends meet rose from 38% to 45%. The crisis has also changed the pattern of employment in Europe, as measured by pay: the loss of jobs in the middle of the pay scale means that there are now relatively more low-paid and high-paid jobs. This has the potential to increase wage inequality, at a time when social cohesion is being tested. The crisis appears also to have reinforced the rising trend of retirees returning to the workplace to augment their pension and to maintain contact with wider society. Download Foundation Focus Exploring the challenges facing the Youth Guarantee In advance of the rollout of Youth Guarantee implementation plans by Member States in January 2014, Eurofound organised a seminar on the theme of The European Youth Guarantee – From concept to reality, in Madrid, on 28 November 2013.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0487	2014-01-31	UNK	Less trust all round – Europe in the wake of the crisis	‘Divided and unequal societies are not only unjust, they also cannot guarantee stability in the long term’ (Council of Europe) The effects of the economic crisis continue to be felt across Europe. To get an insight into precisely what those effects are on the lives of Europeans, a new report from Eurofound looks at trends in quality of life over the last decade, using findings from Eurofound’s European Quality of Life survey to gauge both the long-term trends in people’s lives and see what effects the the onset of the crisis in 2008 may have had. A key element in people’s quality of life is the society they inhabit – its social relations and institutions. A clear trend that emerges from examining the survey’s findings is that the extent to which people in Europe trust one another has diminished over time – and unevenly across Europe. In 2003, people in the then EU Member States (the EU15) rated the extent to which they trusted other people as 5.8 out of a possible 10; in the countries that were about to enter the EU at the time (the EU12), trust in other people was markedly lower – 4.9. However, in 2007, the gap had almost halved – not because people in the EU12 had become more trusting but because citizens in the EU15 had become much less trusting of others. And in 2011, the gap enlarged again as levels of trust in the EU12 fell by more than those in the EU15. Decrease in trust in other people by country group, 2003–2011   2003 2007 2011 EU15 5.80 5.30 5.28 EU12 4.90 4.83 4.62   In the long term, trust in public institutions is vital for the overall dem­ocratic legitimacy of a system. However, the trust of many Europeans in their political institutions has been shaken since the onset of the crisis. In 2011, people in Europe reported less trust in their parliaments, legal systems, press, police forces and governments than they did in 2007. And for three of these four public institutions – the legal system, police and press – there was a larger fall in trust (and from a lower starting point).   Changes in trust in public institution by country group, 2007–2011   Trust in parliament Trust in the legal system Trust in the press Trust in police Trust in government   2007 2011 2007 2011 2007 2011 2007 2011 2007 2011 EU15 4.90 4.38 5.44 5.08 4.54 4.41 6.31 6.22 4.84 4.16 EU12 3.57 3.06 4.27 3.80 4.92 4.28 5.23 4.95 3.79 3.23 EU27 4.61 4.10 5.20 4.82 4.62 4.39 6.09 5.96 4.62 3.97   For tensions between different social groups, the report finds a more complex picture. In the EU overall, people perceived less tension in 2011 between different racial and ethnic groups than in 2007 – a declining trend since 2003. Given the extent of migration over recent years, this may appear surprising; however, it may indicate that people are becoming more used to newcomers to their country. The picture is quite different in the EU12 group, however: here people perceive more tension. There is less migration to countries in the EU12, so this may reflect tension between internal racial and ethnic groups (for example, the Roma people).

Restructuring before and after the crisis Six million fewer Europeans are in employment now than at the start of the economic crisis, many of these jobs having been lost in the manufacturing and construction sectors. By contrast, employment levels have held steady or have grown in some knowledge-intensive service sectors, such as health, education, and information technology. And one manufacturing sector that has seen employment grow is the auto/transport sector, principally in eastern Europe. The European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) annual report for 2013 presents a retrospective of over a decade of its work in measuring the impact of large-scale restructuring activity across Europe – in particular, comparing activity in the pre-crisis period (2003–2008) and the post-crisis period (2008–2013). The report takes its data from the ERM’s online restructuring database, a resource containing details of over 16,000 large-scale restructuring events (involving at least 100 job losses or gains). The report also notes the role that austerity policies have played in job losses in the public sector: many of the large cases of restructuring since 2008 have been implemented in public administration.

Industrial relations, working conditions in 2012 The economic growth experienced by many countries in 2011, which brought them them officially out of recession or resulted in a slightly more positive outlook, came to a halt in 2012. In response to this, national governments across Europe, as well as social partners, took steps to address the negative economic trends; many of these initiatives affected both working conditions across the Union and the shape of industrial relations. Eurofound’s flagship report Industrial relations and working conditions developments in Europe 2012 looks in detail at industrial relations and working conditions trends in the former EU27, plus Croatia and Norway; it covers the economic background, industrial relations developments and takes a life-course perspective on employment conditions (wages, health and safety, skills and competencies, and working time).

EUROFOUND_UNK_0491	2014-01-20	UNK	News release, 20 January 2014	 Eurofound publishes unique online database on collective wage bargaining in Europe over the past decade: Understanding Europe’s wage-setting mechanisms While arrangements for wage setting remain the competence of the social partners in line with national industrial relations practices, increasingly they are becoming part of a coordinated approach to macroeconomic policies in the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Eurofound launches a quantitative and qualitative information tool on collectively agreed pay developments in Europe since 1999, which provides information about the different wage bargaining systems in Europe and how collectively agreed pay has developed over the past decade. Wages are an important component of production costs which in turn affect the competitive position of companies and, ultimately, of the economy as a whole. Wage setting, however, is a complex and diverse process across the Member States. There is a multitude of different approaches as to how wages are negotiated, how minimum wages are agreed upon in social partner negotiations or set unilaterally by government, how wages are indexed so that they reflect price developments or how they are adjusted. This process of wage setting takes place at different levels: centrally in the form of government recommendations; cross-sectoral negotiations; at sector level; or at company level. Moving towards a coordinated European-wide approach to wage setting requires a good understanding of the different wage setting systems in the Member States and recent changes to these systems. It also requires an understanding of the outcomes of collective wage bargaining that these different systems have produced, as well as the link between wage setting mechanisms and broader economic indicators. The new database allows users to chart trends and changes in level of wage bargaining and coordination, as well as outcomes, in terms of nominal and real percentage change over time, in a graphically useful and appealing user interface. While wage setting mechanisms have remained rather stable overall in terms of the predominant bargaining level, a trend towards more decentralised bargaining within the existing system is apparent in many countries.  Evidence indicates, however, that while wage-setting mechanisms may differ substantially from one another, they can lead to similar outcomes – in terms of pay and labour productivity. Conversely, similar mechanisms may result in different outcomes Trend-setting agreements, in which certain sectors take the lead in the annual bargaining rounds while other sectors follow the agreements made there, are rather common in the Nordic countries. Higher-level laws or agreements at national or inter-sectoral level as a starting point for sector level negotiations can mainly be found in some of the southern European and some of the new Member States – although they have become less widespread during the past years. Company-level bargaining is the dominant feature of the system in the UK, Ireland and many of the new Member States. Sector level bargaining, with no centralised coordination is by and large a feature of the central and western European countries. Finally, four Member States (Belgium, Luxembourg, Cyprus and Malta) have indexation mechanisms in place.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0492	2013-12-09	UNK	Is skills deficiency causing high unemployment?	The first results from Eurofound’s European Company Survey (ECS) 2013 include the finding that 4 out of 10 establishments in the European Union have difficulty recruiting employees with the right skills. So, despite an unprecedented level of unemployment in the EU, it seems that neither workers who have become unemployed nor young workers entering the labour market are the workers that employers are seeking. Cyclical or structural? The finding is interesting in light of the view among some economists that there has been a fundamental shift in the nature of the labour market, with the effect that much of current unemployment is structural rather than temporary (or cyclical). It means that the economy is failing to match workers to jobs. One typical contributor to structural unemployment is a mismatch between the skills employers are looking for and the skills that workers have to offer. Structural unemployment implies that high unemployment will persist even when the economy recovers – a jobless recovery. If unemployment is cyclical in nature, however, demand for labour is weak as a whole and sluggish economic conditions are a major factor behind the unemployment rate. It follows that employment improves once the economy recovers. Disentangling cyclical and structural unemployment is important because they demand different policy responses. Cyclical unemployment suggests policies be directed at stimulating demand, whereas structural unemployment demands measures to tackle poor matching, such as reskilling workers or developing more effective public employment services to improve the interface between job-seekers and employers. The European Commission in the Labour market developments in Europe 2013 report, published in October, concludes that cyclical unemployment is substantial in most EU countries. It notes that construction and industry were the two sectors that were most heavily hit by unemployment during the crisis. However, since 2011 there has been a rapid reduction in the proportion of unemployed people who were previously employed in these sectors. Labour market mismatching Nevertheless, the report identifies a rise in structural unemployment in several countries. It finds that since 2000, labour market matching has worsened in the euro zone countries that were most severely affected by the economic crisis, as well as in the Baltic states, Hungary, Sweden and the UK; by contrast, matching has improved in Germany. The analysis also shows that skills mismatches persist among unskilled workers and workers who lost jobs in retail and the public sector Findings from three waves of the ECS are consistent with the Commission's analysis. The ECS has found evidence that skills mismatches are an enduring and increasing problem in the EU. When Eurofound conducted its first survey in 2004–2005, 35% of establishments reported difficulty recruiting employees with the right skills. The figure rose to 37% in 2009, and by a further 2 percentage points to 39% in 2013. Targeted education and training policies need to be considered to reduce labour market mismatches, to reskill unemployed workers, to support job-seekers in the process of job-seeking, and to prevent long-term unemployment from transforming into permanent alienation from the workforce.  	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/is-skills-deficiency-causing-high-unemployment

EUROFOUND_UNK_0494	2013-12-19	UNK	Offshoring – Not a spectre of doom, after all	Offshoring is typically seen as the dark side of globalisation, for developed countries at least, with the leaching of jobs overseas to countries where labour costs are lower. Accumulating research indicates, however, that despite the lure for companies, offshoring is not so great a menace to developed economies as it is made out to be. The annual report of the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) finds that fewer than one in ten of all job losses recorded in the ERM database* each year over the past decade went abroad. The level of offshoring halved with the onset of the 2008–2009 recession and has remained low ever since. However, loss of jobs to offshoring affected smaller, long-standing Member States to a much greater extent than the EU as a whole. In Denmark, Ireland and Portugal, 17%–18% of jobs lost in restructuring went overseas, compared to 4%–7% in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK, and just 1% in Poland and Romania. Dispelling another misconception surrounding offshoring, the ERM report notes that the main destination of jobs offshored from EU countries is not China and India (which together account for a quarter), but the newest Member States. These 12 together absorb around one-third of offshored jobs. Business showing caution The report reasons that the main cause of the recent slackening off is likely to be a reluctance among companies to make a major investment in moving business processes abroad during a period of economic uncertainty. But since it appears to be pro-cyclical, a return to economic growth could see a resurgence in offshoring. One US-based analysis estimates that, in principle, in or around a quarter of jobs in the US could be offshored – a figure equally applicable to the EU. And there is broad agreement among researchers on the subject that jobs requiring higher, not lower, levels of education are at potentially greater risk of offshoring. Future trends This means that the character of offshoring in the future is likely to be different from its current guise. To date, it has affected mostly low-skilled jobs in developed countries; in the future, is likely to affect jobs in higher occupational groups, requiring higher education levels with above-median pay levels. * The ERM database is a record of large-scale restructurings in the EU and Norway announced in the media. At present, it is the only European data source that enables estimates to be made of how much of large-scale restructuring job loss is accounted for by offshoring.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/offshoring-not-a-spectre-of-doom-after-all
EUROFOUND_UNK_0495	2013-12-15	UNK	Delivering a good life? Examining subjective well-being	Since 2003, Eurofound’s European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) has asked Europeans how they feel about their lives – how happy and satisfied they are generally, and how they rate particular aspects of their lives, such as their health, the state of their family lives, and the condition of the societies they live in. A recently published analysis of the findings of the third wave of the survey from 2011–2012 seeks to discover what promotes subjective well-being among European citizens, and the risk factors that make it less likely to be realised. The report finds that the key determinants of subjective well-being are freedom from material deprivation, good health, freedom from a limiting disability, a reasonable work–life balance, satisfaction with public services and good social relationships.  Policy responses Drawing on this, the report concludes that the well-being of Europeans would benefit from a number of targeted policy responses: a focus on efforts to tackle poverty, and a recognition that material deprivation encompasses such elements as being unable to engage in social and leisure activities; integrating people with disabilities more fully into society; reducing working hours and assisting people achieve a better work–life balance; maintaining the quality of public services in the face of austerity – particularly in southern Europe; assisting those who are without close support – this might be support around the house, or having someone to talk to, whether facilitated directly by the state or through the non-profit sector. Impact of the crisis Between the second and third waves of the survey – in 2007 and 2011 – Europe entered into a financial  crisis that continues to reverberate socially, economically and politically. The report examines the impact that the crisis has had on quality of life in Europe – specifically, how Europeans feel about their lives. It concludes that, overall, well-being has stagnated during the crisis. While levels life satisfaction in fact rose slightly between 2007 and 2011, Europeans overall feel less happy, and they also believe that there is more social exclusion than previously.* However, the increase in life satisfaction was experienced only in certain countries and regions, and it was enjoyed by wealthier citizens, in the highest income quartiles; by contrast, the biggest falls in well-being/satisfaction were experienced by people in the lowest income quartile. The report highlights the risk to social cohesion should these trends be allowed to continue unaddressed.  The full report Quality of life in Europe: Subjective well-being is available online. * Although they sound similar, the concepts of life satisfaction and happiness are in fact different. 'Life satisfaction' refers to an evaluation of life as a whole; 'happiness' is more emotionally driven and less determined by standard of living.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/delivering-a-good-life-examining-subjective-well-being

New package of analysis on quality of life The economic crisis that has gripped Europe since 2008 continues to affect every aspect of life – including how people view the quality of their public services and their societies, how satisfied they are with their lives and the extent of equality, or inequality, across society. A new series of reports from Eurofound looks in detail at a range of aspects of quality of life and the changes in these that have taken place as a result of the crisis. Three of the reports analyse findings from the third European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) conducted in 2012, and compare them with findings from the wave in 2007; they address the themes of subjective well-being, quality of society and public services, and social inequalities. In addition, two policy briefs use EQLS findings to offer policy options in the areas of political trust and civic engagement, and of the burden of informal debts for over-indebted households.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0497	2013-12-04	UNK	Press release, 5 December 2013	 Eurofound publishes its 2013 annual report of the European Restructuring Monitor: The economic crisis has significantly reduced the rate of offshoring in Europe (Dublin, Ireland): The economic crisis has significantly reduced the rate of offshoring in Europe, according to the 2013 annual report of the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) - Monitoring and managing restructuring in the 21st century. The report, which is launched at a high-level EU-Japan tripartite meeting on employment and social issues in Tokyo today, found that the offshoring share of restructuring job loss in Europe peaked before the 2008–2009 crisis and has remained lower ever since. The report also presents a retrospective of over a decade of monitoring the impact of large-scale restructuring activity in Europe. In the last decades, significant offshoring has accompanied dramatic changes in the international division of labour. However, offshoring accounts for a low share of large-scale restructuring job loss, less than 12% in every quarter since the ERM restructuring events database started in 2002. The main destination for offshored jobs are the central and eastern European [CEE] countries. China, India and other Asian countries account together for around a third of offshored jobs. Half of offshored jobs remain in Europe. Offshoring job loss tended to be higher in smaller, western European member states. At least one in every six jobs (17%) lost through restructuring in Denmark, Ireland and Portugal was offshored, much higher than the EU average of 6%. Manufacturing accounts for the majority of offshored jobs in all Member States except the UK, where services offshoring predominates. By firm nationality, foreign-owned firms accounted for a higher share of offshoring job loss post-2008 (46%) compared to 2003–2008 (66%). The share of domestically owned firms declined. More than a quarter (28%) of offshoring job losses in non-domestic, EU-owned firms were the consequence of cases of either full reshoring or partial reshoring to the country of ownership. German and Italian firms were those most likely to reshore. The 2013 annual report from the European Restructuring Monitor also presents a retrospective of over a decade of measuring the impact of large-scale restructuring activity in Europe. In particular, the report focuses on comparing activity in the pre-crisis period (2003–2008) with the post-crisis period (2008–2013) in order to identify changes in the prevalence of different restructuring practices, and to show which sectors have been disproportionately affected, in employment terms, by the global recession. The crisis and post-crisis periods have seen a notable increase in the share of restructuring job loss attributable to bankruptcy or closure, and a decrease in the share attributable to offshoring or relocation as well as mergers and acquisitions. The destruction of employment has been felt most acutely in manufacturing and construction. Together, these two broad sectors account for well over 100% of the net employment losses experienced since 2008. Austerity policies have seen a rise in the public sector share of restructuring job loss from 2011 onwards. Many of the largest recent ERM restructuring cases have been in public administration. This is in contrast to the period of global crisis (2008-9) when employment held up well in predominantly publicly funded sectors. More recently private services employment growth has been much more resilient.

News in pictures Biggest job losses, gains in manufacturing - Manufacturing experienced the most restructuring activity in the third quarter of 2013 – in announced job losses and job gains – as the latest issue of the ERM quarterly makes clear. Overall, job losses outweighed job gains: nearly 18,000 being announced, as against almost 11,000 new jobs. The European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) offers a unique searchable database of restructuring events. News in brief Self-employed, or not really? In recent years, practices such as outsourcing and contracting-out have increasingly blurred the boundaries between employment and self-employment. While some people are entirely self-employed and running their own business, others depend on a single employer for their income and thus have no real autonomy. The status of such ‘economically dependent’ workers is similar in some ways to that of employees. However, they are likely to be in a less favourable position than either employees or the self-employed, as a new background paper illustrates: while they must build up their own social contribution rights, for example, the expense means they frequently fail to do so. However, such workers tend to enjoy a relatively good work–life balance. Read more on this topic Pay in Europe in the 21st century Eurofound has an extensive background of work on pay and wage setting; its annual review of developments in collectively agreed pay across the EU, for instance, dates back to 2002. Wage setting has once again moved centre stage in the EU policy arena, in light of the proposal in the Pact for the Euro that European competitiveness might be improved by adjusting wage-setting arrangements or wage-indexation mechanisms. To contribute evidence and analysis to the discussion, Eurofound is hosting a social partners’ lunch debate in Brussels on 19 November. The invitation-only event will create a forum for discussing key developments within the context of wage-related policies at European level and illustrate different wage-setting mechanisms across the EU – in particular, major trends in policies and approaches at national and sectoral level. Findings from the forthcoming Eurofound report Pay in Europe in the 21st century will form the point of departure for the debate; the report builds on Eurofound’s new online, interactive database of information on collective wage bargaining. More information on this event First findings of third European Company Survey Eurofound will launch the first findings of its third European Company Survey (ECS) at a joint seminar conducted with the European Economic and Social Committee in Brussels on November 26. First carried out in 2004, and again in 2009, fieldwork for this third wave of the pan-European survey was performed across the EU28 in 2013, and in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Iceland, Montenegro and Turkey – a total of 32 countries. Human resources (HR) managers in over 30,000 establishments were interviewed; in around 9,000 of those establishments, employee representatives were also interviewed. Designed to provide information on workplace practices and to facilitate the evaluation and development of socioeconomic policies, the third ECS focuses on work organisation, HR practices, employee participation and social dialogue. The event will bring together around 60 stakeholders (at EU and national level) and will also be open to the media. More information on the event.

Exploring gender and working conditions Gender equality has progressed considerably over the past 40 years; however, gender gaps persist in many aspects of the labour market. Women and men are employed in different occupations and industries, and under different contracts; men are paid more than women; and, while men spend more time on paid work than women, women work longer when domestic and care duties are factored in. A new report from Eurofound continues the series of in-depth analyses of data from the Agency’s fifth European Working Conditions Survey. Its rich set of data – encompassing some 44,000 workers across 34 European countries – was used to explore gender differences across several dimensions of working conditions, and to look at relevant country differences. Strikingly, just five of the 20 occupational groups that employ the most workers have a balanced gender mix. And, while men enjoy greater well-being at work than women, women who remain in employment still have greater well-being than those who leave the labour market.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0501	2013-11-07	UNK	Press release, 7 November 2013	Eurofound publishes analysis on subjective well-being levels across Europe: Inequalities in well-being rise in Europe during crisis While life satisfaction increased marginally across the European Union between 2007 and 2011, happiness and optimism levels have fallen and perceived social exclusion has increased, indicating a decline in overall well-being in many European countries during the crisis. Eurofound’s new report assesses the impact of the crisis on the subjective well-being of Europeans, drawing policy-relevant findings from its third European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS). It is the first in a series of reports which covers social inequalities, quality of society and public services, and trends in quality of life in Europe over the past decade. The results from the latest EQLS, fielded in all 28 EU Member States as well as six further European countries, shows how the crisis is affecting some groups more than others.  The report identifies Europeans limited by illness or disability, those who are separated or divorced, and individuals in the middle-age bracket of 35–49 years as more likely to have low well-being. The lowest levels of subjective well-being are reported by people who are unemployed. The report goes on to identify particular dimensions of well-being where countries do poorly but also where they do well: for example, high levels of stress are found in France, high levels of loneliness in Italy and low levels of vitality in the UK; conversely, a high level of education satisfaction is noted in Romania and the Netherlands reports low levels of time pressure. Many countries with higher levels of life satisfaction in 2007reported lower satisfaction in 2011. In countries where there have been increases in well-being, they tend to have been enjoyed by those in the highest-income quartiles. Conversely, the largest falls were experienced by those in the bottom-income quartile, indicating that the gap in well-being between the wealthiest and the poorest members of the population has grown during the crisis. At the national level, the analysis sounds warning bells for Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden – all witnessing declining levels of subjective well-being despite the relatively moderate impact of the economic crisis in these countries. Nevertheless, the countries in the cluster of least unequal countries, i.e. the Nordic countries and the Netherlands – continue to enjoy the highest levels of well-being on most measures. The Netherlands also has the lowest level of well-being inequality in Europe. It is important to note that these countries do not perform well just because they are wealthy. Denmark and Sweden have lower GDPs per capita than Ireland, and Finland has a lower GDP per capita than Germany. Data on well-being allow policymakers to identify the groups and countries that are bearing the brunt of the economic crisis, as well as those that are doing better than expected, and provides a new layer of evidence to aid policy. Analysing well-being at a time of crisis is more relevant than ever before as it shows how different aspects of quality of life are affected, thereby informing debate on policy trade-offs. The report explores new empirical evidence on possible protective factors, showing for instance that not being in debt is an important factor for the well-being of people on low income. As Rob Anderson, team leader of Eurofound’s European quality of life survey, explains 'these analyses help policy-makers identify the types of measures that could protect people who are already in vulnerable situations against loss of well-being'. The report presents an innovative way of looking at inequalities in well-being; to measure the distribution of well-being within a country, differences in life satisfaction between the 20% with the highest life satisfaction and the 20% with the lowest life satisfaction in each country were computed. In addition, in each country it presents the average distance in life satisfaction between two individuals chosen at random. These analyses identify Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovakia, Cyprus, Romania, the UK and Austria as having particularly large differences in well-being inequality. The evidence suggests clear benefits from reducing income inequalities within a country. Rising inequality may be linked to declining well-being in the countries with higher levels of life satisfaction in 2007, despite rising average incomes. Improving the situation of the least well-off is most likely to result in the largest gains in well-being. This report is one of a series of new reports from Eurofound which examine the results from the third EQLS and changes in recent years. These include the overview report Quality of life in Europe: Impacts of the crisis (Eurofound, 2012) and the new reports on subjective well-being, social inequalities, quality of society and public services, and trends in quality of life in Europe over the past decade 2003–2012.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0502	2013-11-26	UNK	Youth Guarantee: EU leaders intensify efforts to tackle youth unemployment	On 8 November, the European Commission published a memo on ‘EU measures to tackle youth unemployment’, quoting findings from Eurofound research on young people not in employment, education or training (NEET). It drew attention to the difficult situation facing young people and the high number of young Europeans (7.5 million) aged 15–24 who fall into the NEET category. €45 billion funding A group of 24 European leaders subsequently met in Paris on 12 November and agreed to mobilise €45 billion in an intensified effort to fight youth unemployment through the EU Youth Guarantee and other measures (see EurActiv video). According to Eurostat, in September 2013, the youth unemployment rate was 23.5% in the EU28, accounting for almost 5.6 million young people aged under 25 who are out of work. The aim of the funding is to reverse these rising unemployment figures over the next few years. Eurofound research highlights the high cost of this unemployment (€153 billion annually) and that investing in young people pays off. Previously, the EU pledged €6 billion but this amount does not seem enough to achieve implementation of the Youth Guarantee. Therefore, €7 billion more per year will be added from the European Social Fund (ESF) and €6 billion from the European Investment Bank. This brings the total to about €45 billion to be spent on tackling youth unemployment between 2013 and 2015. The funding will commence on 1 January 2014 for those countries with plans in place to implement the Youth Guarantee. Youth Guarantee actions Under the Youth Guarantee, there are initiatives aimed at improving the entry rate of young people to the labour market. First, via training and traineeships, EU leaders have agreed to intensity efforts to ensure that young people receive the necessary qualifications to meet future labour market needs. Second, they aim to integrate into the world of work those young people who are in the greatest difficulties and furthest from the labour market. Third, they want to encourage young people to create jobs for themselves, which may require some policy change. On 28 November, Eurofound hosts a seminar on ‘The European Youth Guarantee – From concept to reality’ in Madrid. With the support of the Spanish Economic and Social Council, the event will bring together representatives of public authorities, workers, employers and youth organisations from Member States particularly affected by youth unemployment: Ireland (28%), Italy (40.4%), Portugal (36.9%) and Spain (56.5%) (Eurostat, September 2013). The discussion will focus on the challenges faced by these countries in tackling the high youth unemployment as a result of the crisis and also in implementing the Youth Guarantee. Current research Eurofound is monitoring the situation facing young people across Europe, particularly NEETs, and has also been researching the working conditions of young entrants to the labour market, as well as their labour market transitions. Job mobility could be one way of helping to tackle youth unemployment and could be further developed across the EU. Eurofound will soon present findings from current research on ‘Mapping youth transitions in Europe’. Also coming soon are two EU-wide comparative studies on: Working conditions of young entrants to the labour market Young people and temporary employment Read more Eurofound research on the situation of young people in Europe.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/youth-guarantee-eu-leaders-intensify-efforts-to-tackle-youth-unemployment
EUROFOUND_UNK_0503	2013-11-08	UNK	Postal services in flux after deregulation	National postal services across Europe have been cutting their workforces as they restructure operations to cope with full liberalisation of the EU market. In July, for example, Romania’s national postal service Posta Romana announced plans to cut its workforce of 33,000 by 3,650. Hungary’s Magyar Posta shed 875 jobs in the first quarter of 2013 through a process of mutual agreement with employees. Both countries are in the group of 11 Member States that were permitted to postpone liberalisation for two years until 2013; the other 16 Member States opened their markets by the end of 2010. Postal services in this latter group are suffering too, however; Italy’s Poste Italiane last year cut 1,000 jobs with the closure of 83 branches in Lombardy. This is part of a country-wide restructuring plan, yet to be rolled out, that trade unions say will see the loss of 10,000 jobs. Private sector optimism Meanwhile, private postal services are taking advantage of the opportunities provided by the single postal market and expanding operations. In September, Dutch company TNT Post announced it would create 1,000 new jobs as part of its UK rollout of services in Manchester, and Total Post, a young Romanian company, created 180 jobs earlier in the year to support the expansion of its network. The latest ERM quarterly examines recent restructuring in the postal sector. It also includes the regular items on quarterly job losses and gains in European labour markets. It reports that the manufacturing sector saw the greatest number of job gains and job losses during the third quarter of this year, although losses were greater than gains. Employment is forecast to continue falling in the EU; however, the quarterly notes that employers’ hiring intentions appear to be improving in some sectors, such as manufacturing, services and construction.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/postal-services-in-flux-after-deregulation
EUROFOUND_UNK_0504	2013-11-22	UNK	Press release, 26 November 2013	Eurofound publishes first findings of the third European Company Survey: Despite recession, EU companies have difficulties finding workers with the right skills In the midst of Europe’s greatest recession, 40% of all EU companies have difficulties finding workers with the right skills. For innovative companies, this is even more challenging. This emerges from Eurofound’s third European Company Survey (ECS), launched in Brussels today, which provides a snapshot of human resource management practices, employee participation and social dialogue at the workplace, and performance and innovation. In some countries, both social partnership is strong and a high level of social dialogue is taking place, and there is also extensive innovation in work organisation. In-depth analysis will explore whether and how these phenomena are linked in differing national settings, sectors of activity and company types. Workplace innovation is increasingly recognised as a driver for reaching the Europe 2020 targets of smart, inclusive and sustainable growth, contributing to creating jobs, developing human capital and boosting productivity. The European Company Survey (ECS) maps what is happening in companies across the European Union. Over a third of companies and establishments in Europe have introduced innovation measures and report that their financial situation has improved. Changes like product and process innovation or changes in technology at company level are helping firms to be more resilient and exit the recession. How companies organise their work is important in facilitating innovation, improving performance and ensuring good job quality. The third ECS found that more than two-thirds (68%) of staff monitor external ideas and technological developments for new products, services and processes and almost as many (62%) document good practice or lessons learned so that these may be shared with colleagues. Almost two-thirds of companies and establishments (63%) use some kind of variable pay, and this is most commonly linked to individual performance. In companies and establishments with a formal employee representation, nine out of ten employee representatives report that they are informed by management about the financial and employment situation. The survey also found that social partnership is strong and a high level of social dialogue is taking place in Europe’s companies and establishments. It found that almost nine out of ten establishments and companies (88%) have structures in place for employee representation, in which workers are informed about the most important recent decision affecting working conditions. In seven out of ten workplaces (69%), employees are asked to give their views before any decision is taken, and in six out of ten (60%) workplaces employees are involved in joint decision-taking with management over the decision. The third ECS provides new data on how organisations are organised – in particular, how employees and their representatives are involved in improving work organisation and work processes. In doing so it aims to contribute to a better understanding of how to facilitate economic growth for Member States and better outcomes for employees. It maps practices in establishments with 10 or more employees across the EU28 with regard to work organisation, human resource (HR) practices, employee participation and social dialogue, and how these practices support ‘smart growth’. The fieldwork for the third ECS was carried out in the spring of 2013, involving senior decision-makers responsible for staff and employee representatives in 30,000 companies in 32 countries.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0506	2013-11-07	UNK	In-depth reports explore quality of life	A new series of reports from Eurofound – launched on 7 November – looks in detail at a range of aspects of quality of life and the changes in these that have taken place as a result of the crisis. Three of the reports analyse findings from the third European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS), conducted in 2011–2012, and compare them with findings from the 2007 wave; they address the themes of subjective well-being, quality of society and public services, and social inequalities. Bearing up? Some aspects of life and society in Europe have deteriorated, and more so for certain groups: the extent of material deprivation rose between 2007 and 2011, particularly for people with a limiting disability or health condition, the long-term unemployed and people aged between 50 and 64 years. Other aspects of society have weathered the storm: encouragingly, levels of trust in other people remain largely unchanged.  Taking an in-depth look at the survey data reveals some surprising findings: it emerges that harsh though material deprivation may be, it is the social aspects of such deprivation – not being able to invite guests over for dinner, for instance – that weigh  most heavily on people. And, given the pressure that economic circumstances can place upon people to move region or country in search of work, it is sobering to learn that while face-to-face contact with friends strongly improves well-being (as might be expected), indirect contact – on the phone or by email – has almost no positive impact. Debts and trust  The package of publications also contains two policy briefs; these use EQLS findings to explore policy options in the areas of the burden of informal debts in over-indebted households, and of political trust and civic engagement. The first policy brief points out that much of the policy debate on over-indebtedness has focused on formal debts such as arrears on utility bills, rents or mortgages. However, when they urgently need money, most people in the EU say they would turn to relatives or friends. Problems may arise in making payments related to these informal debts as well as to formal debts. Moreover, what may appear to be limited problems in formal debt arrears may mask more substantial informal arrears. The second brief makes clear that, in most countries, trust in both national and European political institutions has eroded substantially since the onset of the economic crisis. Among EU residents trust in the EU used to stand at a considerably higher level than trust in their own national governments or parliaments, but this ‘surplus’ of trust has diminished in recent years. Visit the Eurofound website to access the five reports on tracking quality of life.  OECD How's Life? Also this week, the OECD published the report How's Life? 2013: Measuring well-being. It finds that OECD countries have made much progress in many dimensions of well-being over the past two decades. However, this progress has been uneven across the dimensions measured and with considerable variation in progress between countries and between different population groups within countries. It records declines in life satisfaction, housing conditions and trust in governments over the period of the crisis, again with much variation between countries and population groups.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/in-depth-reports-explore-quality-of-life
EUROFOUND_UNK_0507	2013-11-01	UNK	A new working life after retirement	In one branch of the SuperElite supermarket chain in Italy, the employee who runs the deli counter is 73 years old, having ‘retired’ over 11 years previously, from another, nearby supermarket. His key reason for coming back into the workforce is to support his three adult children, who are coping with unemployment, eviction and post-divorce financial problems. However, he also enjoys the work, and says, ‘I live for my clients, contacts with other people and smiles of people ... I will die if I stop.’  Despite this, however, complex and unclear regulation can be a barrier to work after retirement: the deli operator does not know if this new income will affect his monthly pension of €900 per month.  Need to work, or want to work? The numbers of people who are over official retirement age and yet working are increasing – rapidly – in the EU. The employment rate for people aged 65–69 rose from 8.4% in 2004 to 11.1% in 2013. The example above indicates some of the key motivations for older citizens pursuing employment in what has been traditionally seen as a time for leisure after a lifetime’s work. Approximately two-fifths of people aged between 65 and 80 years who work do so purely because of financial need. For the majority, however, work is pursued for the contacts with colleagues and clients it offers, and for the opportunity to learn and contribute. Barriers to getting back to work The complexity of the picture of older working Europeans was highlighted by Eurofound research officer Hans Dubois at the recent 2013 National Conference on Ageing in Moscow. Retirees run the risk that they may not benefit financially from working, where pensions are income dependent. Even where policy and legislation changes to make it easier for people to work after the age of 65, this may not be effective. In Denmark, for instance, a 2008 change in the law, which allowed retirees to earn up to a certain amount per year with no impact on their pensions, had little impact on employment rates – partly because many retirees did not know about it.  While retirees may experience difficulties in re-entering the labour market, many employers are seeing the benefits of employing them. Employers are attracted by the loyalty they observe among post-retirement workers, their high levels of motivation and their willingness to be flexible. In addition, companies want to have workforces that reflect the broader society – which has an ever-larger proportion of retirees. Millions of Europeans past retirement age are already working; in an environment where people are living longer, and concerns are growing about whether pensions can be both adequate and sustainable, retirement practices created for a different set of circumstances may need to be updated to match this new reality. More of Eurofound's work on income after retirement is available online.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/a-new-working-life-after-retirement

EUROFOUND_UNK_0509	2013-10-25	UNK	Focusing on the impact of the crisis	The economic crisis has profoundly changed the quality of life of Europeans – changes described in the latest issue of Eurofound’s magazine Foundation Focus.  A comparison of the findings from the second and third waves of the European Quality of Life Survey in 2007 and 2011 – as documented in the Focus – reveals the extent of the impact of the crisis and of disparities in quality of life both across the continent and between social groups. Europeans are finding it harder to make ends meet, particularly those who have had to cope with pay cuts or unemployment. Many European residents, particularly those who are already suffering disadvantage, experienced a worsening of their health in the years between 2007 and 2011. In particular, the indicators for poor mental health are notably worse among Europe’s young people, who are especially affected by unemployment. However, elderly people suffer their own forms of disadvantage, being much more likely to lack sources of social support than younger Europeans. Rating public services Public services, such as healthcare, are an important component of overall quality of life, and in times of difficulty they can support and protect citizens. But sharp cuts in government finances have affected many countries’ ability to provide services at the levels required or expected. Substantial differences emerge between Member States in terms of their residents’ rating of the quality of public services in 2011, and in terms of how that rating has changed since 2007. In a number of countries residents rate public services in the aggregate as being better than the EU average, and give them a higher rating than in 2007 – Austria, Germany, Luxembourg and the UK. (Also included in this group is Spain, despite the economic difficulties it has faced since 2008). Meanwhile, for a large group of countries – 17 in all – ratings for services in 2011 are worse than they were in 2007; of these, 11 have poorer ratings than the EU27 average. Notably, this group comprises 9 of the 10 eastern European Member States (together with Ireland and Greece).  Restricted expenditure This issue of Foundation Focus also includes an interview with John Halloran of the European Social Network who sets out his ideas for building the foundations for a new welfare state in Europe, and who warns ‘This situation of restricted expenditure is permanent’. Findings on best practice in household debt-assistance services are outlined, as are quality of life findings for Croatia, Europe’s newest Member State. This issue also looks at the challenges that arise from juggling care tasks with employment, the effect of austerity measures on the delivery of public services at the national level, and the impact of the crisis on working conditions and social dialogue in central public administration.

News in pictures On 25 September, Eurofound, together with three sister EU Agencies, held a joint seminar in Brussels – ‘The European Social Model – a key driver for competitiveness’. Pictured at the event are (from left) Eurofound’s Director, Juan Menéndez- Valdés, with Christa Sedlatschek, Director of EU-OSHA, Madlen Serban, Director of ETF and Christian Lettmayr, Acting Director of Cedefop. (© Juha Roininen EUP-Images 2013) News in brief New Foundation Focus looks at quality of life The economic crisis that has gripped Europe since 2008 has had wide-ranging consequences for Europeans; not least, it has negatively affected a number of key elements of quality of life – most obviously, the ability to make ends meet, particularly among people who have had to cope with pay cuts or unemployment. The crisis has also had less obvious effects: many European citizens, particularly those who are already suffering disadvantage, experienced a deterioration of their health between 2008 and 2011. And social cohesion and trust in public institutions have weakened in the face of austerity measures. The latest issue of Foundation Focus uses comparative data from the second and third waves of the European Quality of Life survey (from 2007 and 2012 respectively), and from the broader body of Eurofound research, to examine the impact of the crisis upon quality of life, the state of public services, working conditions in central public administration and the state of play of social dialogue in the public sector against a background of austerity in the Member States. Download Foundation Focus Ensuring sustainable pensions into the future Triggered by the demographic trend of longer lifespans, and the economic crisis, pension reform has become a political priority across Europe. Key priorities are making public pensions sustainable and raising the effective retirement age; however, some of the proposed changes have proved very controversial. A new report from Eurofound, Social partners’ involvement in pension reform in the EU, explores the engagement of the social partners in the reform process in different countries and outlines the different approaches they take to the process. While employers have tended to back reforms in order to boost the financial sustainability of pension systems, trade unions have often been opposed to changes on the grounds that they do not address the issue of strenuous working conditions or of how to make work more sustainable generally. Based on contributions from 28 EU Member States and Norway, the report includes good practice examples from countries where social partners have successfully negotiated proposals for reform. Dowload the report Bringing Eurofound research to the national level Eurofound is organising a series of thematically based national-level seminars across several Member States. The first of these one-day seminars, ‘The European Youth Guarantee – concept to reality’, to be held on 28 November in Madrid, examines the theme of youth employment. The seminar will bring together public authorities, workers’ and employers’ representatives and youth organisations from Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, the Member States that have been particularly affected by youth unemployment since the onset of the economic downturn. Participants will discuss the challenges that partners in these countries face in tackling the dramatic rise of youth joblessness, and in implementing the Youth Guarantee. At the seminar Eurofound will also present some first findings from its research into young people’s transitions into the labour market. Read more about the event New version of survey mapping tool launched Eurofound’s Survey Mapping Tool (SMT) is an interactive online application that allows users to explore Eurofound survey findings. First launched in 2008, the SMT has just been made available in a new more advanced version; this uses recent data from the European Quality of Life Survey, available in 24 European languages, and covering 34 countries. Data can be displayed in an interactive map, a bar chart, a table or in a range of other visualisations, and saved as a high-definition image. Data can also be broken down by age, income and gender, and downloaded for use in a spreadsheet. The next survey findings to be made available for the SMT will be the third wave of the European Company Survey, to be launched on 26 November.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0511	2013-09-26	UNK	Press release, 25 September 2013	The European social model, a key driver for competitiveness The European social model is more important than ever to help tackle the jobs crisis in Europe, participants were told at the joint EU agencies and European Parliament event on the European social model and competitiveness in Brussels on 25 September 2013. The European social model relies on partnership, trust and consultation for finding fair and productive solutions. Enshrined in the EU treaties, social dialogue is an integral part of the system. The recurring question debated at the event was whether Europe can afford its social model and still be among the most competitive economies in the world. ‘The theme of the seminar is most appropriate’, said Xavier Prats Monné, Deputy Director-General for Education and Culture, European Commission, in his opening keynote speech. ‘The essence of the European social model is not just that solidarity and social protection are a good thing in themselves, but that, in order to achieve higher rates of employment, sustainable growth and competitiveness, the European Union must protect social integration and combat discrimination’. ‘The work and contributions by the four EU agencies are more important than ever in these times of economic and employment crisis. We are overwhelmed by negative economic studies and reports in the media but, as policymakers, we need more evidence-based policy recommendations on employment creating measures and fewer aspirational statements of further austerity measures, says Pervenche Berès, Chair of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, European Parliament. ‘Europe needs to repair its business model,’ says László Andor, Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, European Commission. ‘Solidarity within EU Member States can only be strengthened if solidarity between Member States improved. Therefore, there is an urgent need to step up social partners contribution to social dialogue debate, to provide a stable, transparent input required to the EU semester.’ Christian Lettmayr, Acting Director of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) stressed that vocational education and training is essential for Europe’s competitiveness. He demonstrated how Europe must get the best out of its people in order to be competitive, calling on companies to increase work-based learning by taking on more apprentices. Enterprises have to become learning organisations, he added. Ms Christa Sedlatschek, Director of European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) outlined that good health and safety is good for business, and safe and healthy workplaces are indeed more productive. She argued that small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and microbusiness will create jobs and drive the economy, and that health and safety is an integral part of running a business independent of size. Ms Madlen Serban, Director of European Training Foundation (ETF) provided clear evidence that improved education and training in the neighbouring countries of the EU enhances employability, competitiveness and entrepreneurship. Mr Juan Menéndez-Valdés, Director of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) provided compelling research findings that there is no inherent trade-off between a fair and a competitive society. Four EU agencies - Cedefop, ETF, Eurofound and EU-OSHA – and the EP Employment and Social Affairs Committee joined forces on 25 September 2013 to examine and highlight how each one is contributing to a strengthened European Social Model – in its own unique way. Assessing how exactly the European Social Model can contribute to increased competitiveness, the Agencies provided different perspectives in the context of the current crisis. Considering the challenges for Europe’s businesses, workers and young people, the Agencies presented a multidimensional approach to a better and more sustainable future for the Europe of tomorrow.

Promoting diversity in European workplaces On 3–4 October, Eurofound concluded its 2013 Foundation Seminar Series. Exploring the theme ‘Promoting diversity management: A strategy for inclusion and competitiveness’, the second session of the year took place at the premises of the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights in Vienna. The key area covered here was company diversity policies and programmes. Bridging the second and first sessions (which took place in Dublin), some key diversity issues were discussed: compulsory and voluntary rules and actions, policies addressing ethnic diversity, the Roma population, and gender management. The Series seeks to facilitate mutual sharing, learning and debate. With seven company case studies presented at the event, by organisations ranging from SMEs to international organisations, a variety of approaches to promoting an inclusive growth strategy were illustrated, as was the need for good management practices. The next Foundation Seminar Series, in 2014, will focus on sustainable work. More information on the event	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-october-2013-2

New database on collective pay bargaining Although collective wage bargaining is fundamental to the operation of the European labour market, the way in which it operates – or how widely it is used – varies greatly from one Member State to another. As part of its research into pay developments, Eurofound has mapped the practices of collective wage bargaining across Europe in a new database. The characteristics recorded for each country include the primary level of bargaining (company, sectoral or national), the bargaining system, the timing and duration of agreements and whether derogation is possible. The database displays the evolution of agreed wages between 1999 and 2012; these can be compared with a range of data, such as unit labour cost, actual compensation and productivity. This collective wage bargaining database provides a highly visual and easy-to-use interface to a wide range of information on collective pay bargaining, which it is planned to update regularly. As with Eurofound’s updated Survey Mapping Tool, maps generated in the online database can be exported both in low and high-resolution formats.

More and better jobs in home-care services With the population ageing, care budgets shrinking and the incidence of chronic disability and ill-health on the rise, can Member States ensure that there is an adequate supply of skilled, motivated people working in home and community care? On 12 September, Eurofound published a new report, More and better jobs in home-care services, that seeks to answer that question. Launched at a one-day conference in Brussels, organised by Eurofound under the auspices of the Lithuanian Presidency, the report assesses the policy challenges posed by the growing need for long-term care and personal household services, particularly in relation to job creation and the quality of jobs in the sector. Key issues include recruiting and retaining skilled workers who can successfully support adults with disabilities and chronic health problems – physical and mental.

(© Eurofound 2013) News in brief Quality of life in enlargement countries A recently published set of reports highlights the diversity of six of the enlargement countries, studied as part of Eurofound’s European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) in 2012: the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Iceland, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey. (Croatia, now the newest EU Member State, took part in the survey at the same time.) With a population of 328,000, Iceland is the smallest country, but it scores relatively high on quality of life indicators, often exceeding the EU average. With a population of over 72 million, Turkey is the largest of the countries discussed, bigger than all the others together. Alongside regular reports by these countries and the European Commission on their progress in adopting EU standards, and key country statistics, the EQLS contributes to the development of a more comprehensive portrait of European societies. Read more on this topic Central public administration - challenging times ahead Over recent decades, central public administration systems across Europe have been subject to a number of structural reforms, aimed at modernising the sector and improving the delivery of public services. Moreover, since the start of the economic crisis in 2008, the drive to reduce public spending has imposed pay freezes and pay cuts on civil servants, as well as reductions in public sector jobs. A new report from Eurofound examines the impact of reform and austerity on working conditions in central public administration. Based on reports from national experts in the 28 EU Member States and Norway, it finds that working conditions have generally deteriorated, with a negative impact on social dialogue, leading to a widening split between social partners over the applied reforms. Dowload the report Listening to the voices of young people Seeking to adapt policy to better support young people across Europe, the Lithuanian Presidency hosted an EU Youth Conference and meeting of the Directors General for Youth Affairs on 9–12 September 2013 in Vilnius, organised by Lithuania’s Ministry of Social Security and Labour. The purpose of the event was to discuss youth policy priorities, social inclusion issues and the results of the Structured Dialogue with young people on their participation in democratic life. On 10 September, in a session on ‘Social inclusion of NEETs in Europe’, Eurofound Research Manager Massimiliano Mascherini presented recent findings on the situation of young people ‘not in employment, education or training’ (NEETs). He outlined the difficulties that arise for young people, possible ways to improve their position and how to ensure that young people enter or remain in employment, education or training. Read more on this topic in Spotlight-on Mapping wage setting in Europe On 11–12 July, Juan Menéndez-Valdés, Director of Eurofound, presented preliminary findings from the Agency’s research on developments in wage setting at an Informal Meeting of EU Ministers for Employment and Social Affairs in Vilnius. The picture of wage setting across the EU is a complex one. Between 1999 and 2012, profound changes took place in wage setting in a number of European countries. In Ireland, for instance, centralised bargaining shifted instead to the company level, and in Slovenia and Romania, to the sectoral level. Moreover, evidence indicates that while wage-setting mechanisms may differ substantially from one another, they can lead to similar outcomes – in terms of labour productivity, for instance. Conversely, similar mechanisms may result in different outcomes. More on Eurofound’s work on wage setting	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-september-2013-3

EUROFOUND_UNK_0521	2013-09-20	UNK	Home-care services will be a major job creator	The long-term care sector is a growing source of jobs. Rising numbers of older people, and longer lifespans, alongside the declining availability of family care providers are increasing the demand for paid care. The size of the long-term care workforce is expected to double by 2050. However, the sector is generally characterised by difficult working conditions – low pay, demanding work, irregular working time and poor career prospects – which means it struggles to attract new recruits and retain its existing workforce. Research findings just launched by Eurofound propose a number of strategies to avert future staff shortages in home-care services – services that support older people and those with disabilities or chronic illnesses to live independently in their homes. Based on case studies of successful initiatives across Europe, the research report suggests that job quality can be improved by professionalising the sector by providing opportunities for professional development, improving career paths and making training more accessible. Precarious work There is slim evidence at present of efforts being made to address working conditions in the sector. According to Kai Leichsenring, a researcher at the European Centre for Social Welfare Policy and Research, who spoke at the launch, there is ‘more a “race to the bottom” rather than improvements in working conditions’ in the context of the current crisis. He noted that new forms of precarious work with even lower pay and fewer social rights are emerging in relation, for example, to migrant carers, not only in economically troubled countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain, but also in Austria and Germany. He believes that ‘professionals, management and users need to discuss much more what is important to them, how this can be realised and how different interests may be reconciled’. However, the framework conditions for such dialogue are largely absent in the context of home care. Innovation Nevertheless, there are some initiatives that show that innovative change is possible and these are highlighted in the case studies. One such initiative is Netherlands Neighbourhood Care (Buurtzorg Nederland), which started when a group of district nurses came together to transform nursing and care at home. The project gives small, self-organising district teams of highly skilled workers full responsibility for the nursing and care of clients at home. These teams enhance the services available to clients by supporting the contribution of volunteers or by helping clients to access the formal health and social care system. The organisation believes its approach improves the quality and efficiency of home care and enhances the attractiveness of the jobs of district nurse and orderly. The long-term care sector offers a way to tackle both the demographic and employment challenges confronting Europe. Increased professionalisation of the sector as well as expectations of quality services from users may well drive improved quality standards in working conditions.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/home-care-services-will-be-a-major-job-creator
EUROFOUND_UNK_0522	2013-09-19	UNK	Employment of marginalised youth – Time to invest and innovate	Eurofound was represented at the national conference on ‘Investing in youth employment’ in Sydney on 19–20 September, organised by Yfoundations, Australia’s main youth homelessness organisation. The event brought together business leaders, government decision-makers and representatives of non-governmental organisations (NGOs), social partners and education providers to discuss ways to increase the employment of marginalised youth. On 19 September the Head of Eurofound’s Living Conditions and Quality of Life Unit, Rob Anderson, presented findings of recent Eurofound research on issues affecting young people across Europe, particularly marginalised youth. Participants at the conference discussed school-to-work transitions, well-being for young people at work, engaging young people in training and what employers want. His presentation emphasised that the main debate in the EU has centred on unemployment among young people (at 23% of 15–24 year-olds in the EU), the risks of that unemployment and the knock-on effects, particularly for marginalised groups such as those described below. NEETs One key group of marginalised youth are those young people who are not in employment, education or training (NEET). The size of the NEET population across Europe (7.5 million aged 15–24) has led to a renewed sense of urgency to understand and deal with the problem. Eurofound’s report Young people not in employment, education or training shows that certain categories of young people are at higher risk of becoming NEET: for example, those with a low level of education, with an immigration background or with a disability. Mr Anderson indicated that the main challenge at EU level has been designing and implementing measures to reintegrate these young people into the labour market. Young people with disabilities Another marginalised group is made up of young people with health problems or disabilities. According to the Eurofound study on Active inclusion of young people with disabilities or health problems, an integrated approach from local authorities, social partners, employers and NGOs is essential for the inclusion of vulnerable young people, particularly in creating measures that are flexible to meet differing needs. This includes skills development, training and job placement, thus empowering individuals to take control of their own career paths. Employers also need support with recruitment, training and retention of young people with disabilities. Innovation in EU countries As the conference looked for innovations in the area of youth employment, Mr Anderson presented some positive examples of social innovation in various EU Member States, drawing on the report Social innovation in service delivery: New partners and approaches. This report looks at new relationships and roles for social partners, local government and youth NGOs.   Mr Anderson’s presentation concluded by highlighting policy responses taken at EU level. He spoke about the adoption of the Youth Guarantee in April 2013 and looked at its strengths and weaknesses as it aims to ensure that ‘young people up to age 25 receive offer of a job, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of leaving education or becoming unemployed’.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0523	2013-08-28	UNK	Steel industry sheds jobs	With 360,000 workers employed in the steel industry across Europe and countless dependent jobs in other sectors downstream, European leaders are clearly worried for the future of steel in Europe as it falters in the face of the economic slump and changes in worldwide demand. Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship Antonio Tajani stated earlier this year ‘Without steel, there is no Europe.’ In June, the Commission issued an action plan for the steel sector outlining steps the Commission will take to support demand for EU-produced steel, to cut costs for the industry, including those arising from EU regulation, to address skills needs and to promote innovation. ArcelorMittal downsizes  A recent EIRO update reports on the latest restructuring plans at ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, in the Walloon region of Belgium. In January, the company announced that it would permanently close 7 of its 12 manufacturing lines in Liège, involving the layoff 1,300 workers. The update highlights the ripple effects of such a downscaling for the region. The union for the Walloon self-employed, UCM, estimated that 6,300 indirect jobs would be threatened if the plan went ahead. A survey by the union among 2,700 local companies found that nearly half expect turnover to decrease over the coming three years. A similar percentage did not plan to hire any new staff, even on a temporary basis, in the near future. In July, the company proposed a new plan reducing to some extent the proposed closures in Liège. However, this is just one in a series of measures by ArcelorMittal to reduce output and cut jobs across Europe since the economic crisis hit. In 2012 alone, voluntary redundancy and early retirement programmes saw the loss of 1,200 jobs in Galaţi, Romania, and 1,000 jobs across Poland, while the company permanently closed two idle blast furnaces with the loss of over 600 jobs in Florange, France, in the face of strong government opposition. This year, it prolonged the temporary closure of its plant in Madrid, which relocated 290 employees to other plants in Spain, and closed the doors of its works in Schifflange, Luxembourg, indefinitely. Widespread impact Steel prices have fallen as a result of the slowdown in construction, while prices for iron ore, the source material, have risen because of high demand from China. Steel manufacturers across Europe are reducing production and shedding jobs. In May this year, German steel multinational ThyssenKrupp announced a plan to cut 3,000 of its 15,000 administrative positions worldwide over the next three years, including 1,500 jobs in Essen, Germany. In July, it initiated the closure of its plant in Valencia, Spain, with the loss of 165 jobs. In November 2012, Indian multinational Tata Steel announced plans to cut 886 jobs across the UK.  The Russian steelmaker Evraz Steel laid off 200 workers in 2012 at its plant in the North Moravia region of the Czech Republic and announced a temporary shutdown of operations in early July 2013. Addressing such patterns of employment loss will not be easy. The Commission will take stock of progress under the action plan after 12 months and Commissioner Tajani has undertaken to adapt the support efforts as needed.  	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/steel-industry-sheds-jobs
EUROFOUND_UNK_0524	2013-09-12	UNK	Press release, 12 September 2013	"Eurofound publishes new research on more and better home-care services in Europe: Unlocking the job creation potential in the home-care services sector in Europe Europe can harness large-scale scope for increased job creation in the home-care services sector as its ageing population continues to generate demand for more and better jobs in long-term care.  Despite employment growth in the sector, however, difficult working conditions and inadequate skills and low wages threaten to slow further development.  In this context, Eurofound launches a new report looking at how successful recruitment and retention measures in home-care and support services can contribute to employment growth at a high-level conference under the Lithuanian EU Presidency in Brussels today. Home-care services was one of the few sectors that experienced a growth in employment figures during the past five years, with an increase of nearly 6% during the period 2008-2010 and 2.6% between the years 2010 and 2012. There are currently more than 13 million people working in the health care sector and nearly five million workers in Europe providing home- care services. 'The long-term care sector offers ways to tackle the demographic and employment challenges Europe faces. If we do things right, we will be able to provide more and better jobs while at the same time improving accessibility and quality of services,' says Juan Menéndez-Valdés, Eurofound’s Director. 'Overall, there is currently an increasing trend towards more community-based care promoting the greater independence of people with functional limitations, user preferences and the potential of assisted-living technology.' There are barriers to job creation in this sector, the report found, mainly shortage of recruits and budgetary constraints, but also demanding working conditions. In the long-term, the report predicts increasing shortages, especially in the area of better-qualified personnel. 	Eurofound’s research looked at initiatives in 10 EU Member States that were successful in either creating more jobs in the provision of social care for adults in the community, or in improving the quality of jobs, with the aim of both attracting new recruits and retaining existing staff, and improve the quality of service. 	Attracting young people to the home care sector is particularly important as it can help decrease the high rates of youth unemployment, the report argues. It can also ensure that the current home-care workforce can be replaced in the future. This is particularly important in the health and social care sectors in which nearly one third of the workforce is 50 years old or more. Apprenticeships in home care services can also help young people who are currently not in education, employment or training improve their situation.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0525	2013-09-11	UNK	Mapping urban and rural inequalities	While income is the standard measure of material well-being, or of material strain, it is an imperfect one: non-financial dimensions influence quality of life as much as income. Capturing these other dimensions, then, and understanding their impact, is a vital element in assessing quality of life in Europe. This was the message that Hans Dubois, Eurofound Research Officer, delivered in a presentation at the fourth congress of the Association of Geographical Societies in Europe (EUGEO) in Rome on 5–7 September. In his presentation, he focused on the role that rural–urban differences play in shaping social inequalities in Europe, and what changes have resulted in this regard from the economic crisis. For instance, people at the bottom of the income scale living in rural areas have had greater difficulties in the past in making ends meet than their urban counterparts. However, between 2007 and 2011 there was a much greater increase in hardship among poorer urban dwellers, reducing the difference considerably. Health inequality Drawing on data from Eurofound’s most recent European Quality of Life surveys – in 2007 and 2011 – Mr Dubois outlined how findings from the surveys point to the need for multifaceted policy responses to limit inequalities, rather than focusing solely on income. The survey findings highlight inequalities in terms of health and healthcare, public services, the quality of the local environment, social exclusion, and the perceived quality of society. In 2011, for instance, 5% of those in the top income quartile said that their health was ‘bad’ or ‘very bad’ – unchanged since 2007. By contrast, the figure for those in the bottom income quartile was 17%, having risen from 14% – an increase in health inequality.  Where you live plays a role: people on low incomes in rural areas, and those who are experiencing problems with their local neighbourhood, are more likely to feel that their health is poor. People in rural areas experience greater difficulty in accessing such services as public transport, postal and banking services, and cultural facilities, such as cinemas or theatres (although they are much more satisfied with the quality of their local environment).  Social exclusion The surveys investigated social exclusion through measuring people's agreement with such statements as ‘I feel left out of society’, and ‘Some people look down on me because of my job situation or income’. While there was little change on average across the EU between 2007 and 2011, there was a big increase in the proportions of people agreeing with such sentiments in rural areas in Cyprus and Spain, and in towns and cities in Greece and Malta. Across Europe, people in urban areas generally feel more socially excluded. And people in urban areas – particularly those who feel socially excluded and who are struggling to repay debts – are also more likely to express little trust in their local government. This raises a practical dilemma: it is local government that is best placed to offer help to those in need. One response, Mr Dubois proposed, is for local government to look at involving NGOs in service delivery. The theme of social inequalities is explored in depth in a forthcoming report from Eurofound, Quality of life in Europe: Social inequalities. This is one of four reports conducting further analysis of the 2011 third European Quality of Life survey. The other three, due to be published over the autumn, will look at quality of society and public services, subjective well-being, and trends in quality of life from 2003 to 2012. More information is available on the quality of life section of the Eurofound website.  	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/mapping-urban-and-rural-inequalities
EUROFOUND_UNK_0526	2013-08-26	UNK	Challenges facing migrants in employment	The recent controversy in the UK over government-funded notices on vans threatening illegal immigrants with deportation is just one, national example of the highly politicised debate over migration in Europe. Such anti-immigrant sentiment also colours the policymaking arena, as highlighted in a recently published report by the European Network Against Racism (ENAR).         Overqualification, unemployment and poverty  The ENAR report, How EU policies support or hinder the hiring of migrants in Europe, documents the organisation’s fourth Equal​@work meeting, which took place in December, in Brussels. Eurofound Research Manager Anna Ludwinek participated in the meeting, bringing her experience with Eurofound’s work on integration of migrants to the discussions. She stressed that, while many third-country migrants are overqualified for the jobs they do (given the difficulties in getting professional qualifications recognised), another real problem is unemployment – youth unemployment being a particular issue. Third-country nationals have lower employment rates than native-born residents. However, second-generation migrants are more likely to face unemployment even than first-generation migrants. And the visibility of challenges related to issues around migrants is a real concern: even in anti-poverty circles, Ms Ludwinek noted, migrants may be overlooked, despite the high rates of poverty in migrant communities. Issues hindering employment of migrants As the ENAR report makes clear, a key issue for migrants working in the EU is the complexity and lack of harmonisation of laws granting permission to work. Ms Ludwinek pointed to the lack of ‘an integrated, coherent approach to EU migration policies’: currently, legislation operates at the Member State level. Three key issues hamper the development of legislation to enable migrants to readily gain good-quality employment. Policies are defined politically by the non-migrant majority; moreover, they tend to derive from a context of anti-immigrant feeling. This also then affects how policies are assessed.  Integration of migrants is a long-term process. However, electoral politics operate on short-term cycles; this lack of continuity can hinder the construction of integration policies.  In terms of work, employers and trade unions are clearly key stakeholders. Currently, however, they are insufficiently engaged at the policy level, and do not participate in the key discussions and decisions. This situation is problematic enough, but it exists against a backdrop of austerity, limiting both funding to facilitate the cooperation of busineses, trade union representatives, policymakers and activities and dampening the motivation to combat discrimination in employment. Unfortunately, as Ms Ludwinek went on to highlight, NGOs and local stakeholders advocating for migrant rights are not sufficiently engaged in the European-level policymaking process. An important step would be for EU institutions to cooperate with social partners at the local level, since integration largely succeeds (or fails) at this level.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0527	2013-08-19	UNK	Supporting young people through social innovation and investment	As a topic high on the EU agenda at present, social innovation is being seen as a tool to help achieve key objectives outlined by the European Commission in its Social Investment Package (SIP) ‘Towards social investment for growth and cohesion’, launched in February 2013. Modernising social protection systems All Member States are dealing with structural, social and demographic challenges, and they have to adapt to ensure that their social systems are both adequate and sustainable. Modernising social policies is a concern at EU level and doing so means supporting people at critical points in their lives so that they can participate to their full potential in social and economic life. Young people are a key target group as many of them have found themselves outside the labour market and society in the crisis period. To avoid more young people being at risk of social exclusion and poverty, Europe recognises the need to invest in expanding young people’s skills and modernising social protection systems. As outlined in the SIP, ‘social innovation must be an integral part of necessary adjustments by testing new policy approaches and selecting the most effective ones.’ Promoting social innovation Eurofound’s report Social innovation in service delivery: New partners and approaches explores how the social partners, civil society and people in vulnerable situations are involved in social innovation – defined as new ideas that simultaneously resolve societal challenges, meet social needs and create new social relationships among the groups concerned. It looks at programmes in six countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Ireland, Italy, Poland and Sweden) and presents three case studies from Ireland, Slovenia and Sweden. Among the examples of social innovation mentioned in the report, some show what can be done to support young people. In Austria, Go West, an association for homosexual, bisexual and transgender people, runs a project geared at young teenagers and aims to motivate students to question prejudice and stereotypes. Junior Achievement Bulgaria is an example of an NGO and the private sector working together in the social innovation field. It provides entrepreneurship education for children and young people with the help of volunteer business advisers. In Ireland, Young Social Innovators engages young people aged 15–18 in civil society activities with the objective of enabling them to deal with difficult issues and to advance change. In Puglia in southern Italy, the Bollenti Spiriti Programme aims to enable young people in the area to participate in all aspects of community life. The Włącz się (Join in) project in Poland aims to integrate marginalised young people, people with disabilities and victims of domestic violence into the labour market. The Social Incubator in Slovenia, hosted by the student organisation of the University of Ljubljana, provides a supportive business environment for students and graduates of the university who want to become social entrepreneurs. In Stockholm County, Sweden, the UMA (Utveckling mot arbete) project helps people aged 16–64 who are outside the labour market, many for a long time for reasons such as mental disorders, alcohol or drug abuse, social problems or stress. The aim is to provide them with opportunities to find and keep a job, as well as increase their acceptance by society, especially by employers. Many initiatives are co-funded by the European Social Fund (ESF). Social innovation is set to play a greater role within the ESF as an effective way to help achieve the objectives of the SIP.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/supporting-young-people-through-social-innovation-and-investment
EUROFOUND_UNK_0528	2013-07-31	UNK	Addressing risks facing young people: What kind of policies work?	Although different groups of workers have been badly affected by Europe’s economic situation, the crisis in youth unemployment (23.2% in the EU27, June 2013) is the most critical. In particular, the 14 million young people aged 15–29 across the EU who are not in employment, education or training (NEET) are most at risk of disengagement and social exclusion. The risk of becoming NEET Certain categories of young people are at a higher risk of becoming NEET, based on their social or economic circumstances. Education – Young people with a low level of education are three times more likely than their peers to become NEET.Immigration – Those with an immigration background are 70% more likely.Disability – Those with some kind of disability are 40% more likely.Divorce – Young people whose parents are divorced are 30% more likely.Unemployment – Having parents who experienced unemployment increases the probability by 17%.Household income – Those with a low household income are more likely.Location – Young people living in a remote area are 1.5 times more likely. What policies work to combat these challenges? Given the current financial restrictions on many EU Member States as a result of the crisis, it is vital that any investment to support these young people and in integrating them back into the labour force is spent effectively. Therefore, the question being asked in the policy debate is ‘what works?’ A study by Eurofound, Effectiveness of policy measures to increase the employment participation of young people, looked at 25 policies for tackling youth unemployment across some EU Member States. The analysis highlights a number of insights into the design of effective programmes. Successful programmes specify the target group and find innovative ways to reach them. Young people vary in their level of labour market readiness, so policies have to cater for a range of needs, from minor to complex. Young people should be set on a long-term sustainable pathway, rather than given low-quality quick fixes. Measures that aim to increase the employability of young people should focus on labour market needs and ensure a buy-in of employers and their representatives. Youth unemployment requires flexible responses, which have to be adapted to economic cycles, whereas social exclusion is a structural issue and has to be addressed consistently. Read more about the situation of young people in Europe in the Eurofound Yearbook 2012: Living and working in Europe. Presenting Eurofound research In the coming months, Eurofound plans to present findings from its current research at various events in Europe and beyond, particularly the G-20 Youth Summit in August in Saint Petersburg, the EU Youth Conference under the Lithuanian Presidency in September in Vilnius and also the Investing in Youth Employment Conference in September in Sydney.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/addressing-risks-facing-young-people-what-kind-of-policies-work
EUROFOUND_UNK_0529	2013-08-07	UNK	Better jobs – Not there yet	Too many workers in the European Union continue to labour in inferior jobs. One-fifth have jobs that Eurofound has judged to be of low quality – jobs that pay poorly, offer little chance of career progression and give little sense of fulfilment. These jobs are found disproportionately in companies with fewer than five employees and are more common in the private sector. A further 29% of workers have jobs that pay relatively well, but entail a poor work–life balance. Aspiring to quality of work is worthwhile if for no other reason than that better jobs enrich lives and improve well-being. But there is also an economic motivation, one that the European Union has put its weight behind since the Lisbon summit of 2000 with the concept of ‘more and better jobs’. In building its employment strategy the EU has taken the stance that focusing on job quality will give the EU a competitive edge against worldwide competition. Good working conditions develop the potential of the workforce and are a basis for innovative and dynamic business environments that will drive economic growth. Soaring unemployment rates have made some EU Member States desperate to find solutions that will create jobs; in such employment troughs, quantity takes precedence over quality. Will the goal of better jobs be shelved until Europe's economy gets back on track? Does economic stability come first? The research that Eurofound conducted found that countries with greater economic development had fewer low-quality jobs. A summary of Eurofound’s analysis of job quality in the EU can be found in the 2012 Eurofound yearbook; full findings are in the report Trends in job quality in Europe.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/better-jobs-not-there-yet
EUROFOUND_UNK_0530	2013-08-14	UNK	Supporting employees with care responsibilities	Caring for a sick or disabled family member is demanding enough in itself; working in paid employment at the same time, as many Europeans do, is particularly hard. However, despite the contribution that working carers make – both to the economy and in terms of providing care – the need to support them in their dual role is only starting to be recognised, at both company and policy level. Without support, it is likely that something will have to give: carers may be unable to contribute optimally in the workplace; they may be less able to provide the kind of care needed; or they may overstrain themselves in the effort to do both.  Company initiatives to support carers At a conference held in the University of Leeds, UK, on 13 August, Carers and work–care reconciliation, Eurofound’s Robert Anderson highlighted a number of examples of company initiatives to support working carers that Eurofound has documented. Some companies facilitate employees in remaining in employment, through flexible working hours, for instance, or permitting short interruptions of the working day for them to monitor, organise or provide care. Others enable longer periods of either leave or part-time working, some with financial support – by part payment for the time taken. While work-related measures are most common, initiatives also exist whereby employers help organise care-related support – such as information, counselling and supports for the costs of care or in finding care services.  Changes needed in the workplace Mr Anderson went on to stress what needs to happen next in order for working and caring to be seen as normal, and for such support to become a mainstream feature of employment. Crucially, awareness of the situation and needs of working carers should be raised; it is a lot lower than in relation to working parents. Managers, supervisors and staff all need to learn more about what it means to juggle work and care commitments, and the benefits that stem from creating a more supportive atmosphere. Particularly important is the role of the carer’s line manager: it is through negotiation with their manager that carers typically resolve day-to-day issues. Interestingly, despite the demands of their dual role, carers who are in employment still fare better than those who are not. Carers not in the workforce suffer worse health, more distress, deeper financial hardship and greater social exclusion.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0531	2013-07-25	UNK	Dealing with the exodus of healthcare staff	With Europe’s population ageing, the healthcare sector is of crucial importance. However, across the EU, labour shortages challenge the capacity of health services to deliver effective care. Easing labour shortages in the EU15, healthcare workers have moved in substantial numbers from the 10 newer Member States in central and eastern Europe (the ‘EU10’). This movement has in turn created severe labour shortages in these countries. A number of key motivations push healthcare staff to leave. These include: poor working conditions; low pay; a lack of career opportunities for doctors; low social status for nurses; shortcomings in infrastructure and equipment. Return migration What can be done to stem the flow? Some countries have sought to encourage the return of highly skilled nationals; Bulgaria, for instance, has made this a priority in its new strategy on migration. However, even where healthcare staff find themselves working abroad in positions for which they are over-qualified, the fact of labour shortages in the EU15, as well as those countries’ better living and working conditions, will likely ensure most will remain there.  One alternative is for the EU10 to encourage the inward migration of skilled professionals from third countries. However, this raises political difficulties: in an environment of high unemployment, encouraging immigration is unlikely to be a popular move. Also migrants are likely to use a Member State in the EU10 as a stepping stone to better-paid jobs available further west. Within the EU10 there is a general perception that labour shortages should be solved by wage increases, improving working conditions and retraining – which some Member States have explored. Cutbacks in health spending, however, make such measures difficult.  Reforms Various reforms have been introduced; in Hungary the state is taking over the running of hospitals from municipal authorities in an effort to manage them more efficiently. To offset the massive loss of investment in terms of education resulting from emigration, training programmes in Slovakia require a compulsory, stipulated period of service after graduation; alternatively, graduates must provide financial compensation if they leave the country. The issue is likely to become only more prevalent over time: those countries waiting to join the EU will probably face similar challenges as those currently being experienced in the EU10.  For more, see the recently published Eurofound report Mobility and migration of healthcare workers in central and eastern Europe. Also, in September 2013 a one-day conference, organised by Eurofound under the auspices of the Lithuanian Presidency, launches the Eurofound report More and better jobs in home-care services.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/dealing-with-the-exodus-of-healthcare-staff

News in pictures Immediately in advance of Croatia’s accession to the EU on 1 July 2013, Eurofound welcomed some of its new Croatian Governing Board members to the June meetings of the Groups in Dublin on 27–28 June. Pictured from left are Juan Menéndez-Valdés, Director of Eurofound, Marija Hanževački, trade union representative to the Board, Dubravka Matić, representing the Croatian government, Nenad Seifert, employers’ representative, and Erika Mezger, Deputy Director of Eurofound. To mark the country’s accession, research findings from the Agency on living and working in Croatia are presented here. News in brief East–west divide in working time Overall, workers in the eastern European EU Member States work more than their counterparts in the west. This is a key finding from Eurofound’s latest annual review of working time. In 2012, citizens in Estonia had the longest hours in the EU, working 1,856 hours over the course of the year. By contrast, people in France had the the shortest hours – 1,573 hours). Based on an analysis of collective agreements, the report provides a detailed breakdown of agreed working hours and annual leave in EU countries, as well as the actual hours worked and public holiday. At 30 days, agreed annual leave is longest in France, Denmark and Germany; in many countries, however, workers are entitled only to the the 20-day minimum laid down in the Working Time Directive. Read Developments in collectively agreed working time 2012 – in particular the section on annual working time Eurofound contributing to Lithuania’s EU Presidency With Lithuania now holding the EU Presidency for the second half of 2013, Eurofound is well placed to contribute its research findings to the Presidency’s social priorities: better jobs, rights of workers, the social dimension of the EU and gender equality. In particular, the Agency’s ongoing work on young people not in education, employment or training (NEETs) is very relevant to the Presidency’s goal of strengthening the social integration of young people. Over the six-month period, Eurofound will contribute to a number of Presidency events, including a high-level event in Brussels in September where Eurofound will present a new report More and better jobs in home care services. The one-day conference will assess the policy challenges for long-term care as well as personal household services, particularly in relation to job creation and the quality of jobs in this sector. For more, go to www.eurofound.europa.eu/presidencies/index.htm Call for tender for national correspondents launched Eurofound has recently launched a public call for tenders for national- and EU-level correspondents to provide expert input into the Agency’s research work. Since 1996, Eurofound’s network of experts has grown in scope and reach. Reporting on developments in three broad fields (industrial relations, quality of work and employment, and changes in employment and restructuring), its work forms a popular source of online information, widely used by Eurofound’s user base; it is also a key resource for further research and studies carried out by Eurofound and other research bodies. Under the terms of this new tender, the network will also assist Eurofound in reaching out to its stakeholders at Member-State level. The deadline for submitting tenders is 15 August 2013.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0533	2013-07-24	UNK	Press release, 24 July 2013	"Eurofound published its European Restructuring Monitor Quarterly for the period April-June 2013: Europe in the slow lane of economic recovery There are continued high levels of restructuring activities across Europe with more jobs lost than created, against a backdrop of weak economic growth perspectives and sustained high levels of unemployment, according to the new European Restructuring Monitor quarterly. It reports that the unemployment rate in the EU27 has hit its highest level ever. 	The European economic outlook remains uncertain, the current recession being forecast to give way to modest growth in 2014, according to the latest ERM quarterly. In May 2013, the EU unemployment rate reached a new peak of 11%, or 12.2% for the euro zone, equivalent to over 26.5 million unemployed people. In particular, there has been an unprecedented widening of the gap between the euro zone unemployment rate and the average OECD rate since the onset of the crisis in 2008, of over four percentage points. And within Europe, the divergence of European unemployment rates continues: overall, the unemployment rate increased in 17 Member States and fell in 10 over the last year 	The European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) quarterly recorded a total of 347 cases of restructuring between 1 April and 30 June 2013. Of these, 210 were cases of announced restructuring involving job loss, 132 were cases involving announced job creation and 5 were cases involving both job losses and job creation. These cases generated 70,608 announced job losses and 45,968 announced job gains. Manufacturing experienced the most restructuring activity, both in terms of announced job gains and job losses. It accounted for over 45% of total announced job losses, and 37% of total job gains. 	The largest single case of job loss recorded in the quarter involved the announced closure of Greek public television and radio broadcaster, Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT), which will result in 2,902 job losses. German multinational Siemens announced the loss of 2,900 jobs in its industry divisions in Germany due to falling demand. It plans to close two of its four mechanical drives factories, resulting in 500 job losses, and will offshore 200 additional jobs to the Czech Republic. In terms of geographic distribution, Germany recorded the highest number of announced job losses, at 14,054 jobs, followed by France (8,828), the UK (8,372), Austria (5,925) and Italy (5,831). Poland (with 7,717 jobs) and the UK (with 7,258) recorded the highest numbers of new jobs, followed by France (6,459), Romania (5,404) and Germany (4,745). 	The European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) has been monitoring the employment impact of large-scale restructuring events in the 27 EU Member States plus Norway since 2002. The ERM offers a searchable database of over 16,000 restructuring events based on announcements in national media sources.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0534	2013-07-24	UNK	Job losses continue to outpace job gains	The ERM quarterly in its latest edition again records more job loss announcements than job gains, reflecting the persistent rise in unemployment in the European Union. Two-thirds of announced job losses in the second quarter of 2013 arose from companies shedding jobs, 16% from closures, 13% from bankruptcy and 5% from offshoring. Announced job losses were greatest in Germany at just over 14,000, while the biggest announced job gains were in Poland (7,717) and the United Kingdom (7,258). The manufacturing sector experienced most restructuring activity, accounting for 45% of announced job losses and 37% of job gains. The bulletin reports that the biggest job loss announcements came from Greek public television and radio broadcaster ERT and German multinational Siemens. The closure of ERT will result in the loss of 2,902 jobs, while Siemens plans to shed a similar number from its industry divisions in Germany due to falling demand. UK frozen-food retailer Iceland and French bank Banque Postale made the biggest job creation announcements, with each planning to create 2,000 new jobs. The ERM quarterly has more details on these restructuring events as well as discussions on recent restructuring in the construction industry and public supports for restructuring in Croatia.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/job-losses-continue-to-outpace-job-gains

Working in Europe – crisis leaves its mark Among its many impacts, the worst economic crisis in living memory appears to have boosted feelings of job insecurity and levels of work intensity for European workers while triggering greater decentralisation in European industrial relations. Two new reports from Eurofound look at the impacts of the crisis on working conditions and industrial relations using data from 2008 to mid-2012. The picture is a mixed one: the use of fixed-term contracts has declined in some countries, but has risen in others. Although workers feel more stress at work, they are also more satisfied with their jobs. While trade union density has been steadily declining, greater visibilty for unions as a result of the crisis has seen their membership rise in some countries. And despite the pressure that the crisis has undoubtedly put on industrial relations, in some cases social partners have come together in an attempt to mitigate its worst effects.

Only modest real pay increases in 2012 Although average nominal agreed pay increases were slightly higher in 2012 than in 2011, overall, European citizens’ purchasing power fell over the course of the year because of the rising cost of living. Eurofound’s annual update on pay developments is being launched on 11 July by the Agency’s Director, Juan Menéndez-Valdés, at an informal meeting of EU Ministers for Employment and Social Affairs in Vilnius. The report finds that, in real terms, only a handful of countries enjoyed increases in the collectively agreed rates of pay and these were modest: Sweden, at 1.7%, Austria, 0.8%, Germany, 0.6% and France and Belgium at 0.4%. In addition to looking at collectively agreed pay overall, the report also looks at collectively agreed pay increases in the sectors of metalworking, banking and local government, and the issue of statutory minimum wages. In addition to launching the report Mr Menéndez-Valdés is presenting preliminary findings from Eurofound research into the relationship between types of wage-setting systems and macroeconomic outcomes.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0539	2013-07-10	UNK	Press release, 11 July 2013	Eurofound launches its annual update on collectively agreed pay development in Europe 2012: Quicker growth in agreed pay in 2012 eroded by price hikes Agreed pay rose more quickly in 2012 than in 2011 in many EU countries, but price hikes reduced purchasing power in the majority of Member States with available data. These results come from Eurofound’s annual analysis of collectively agreed pay for 2012, published today. More in-depth preliminary findings on collectively agreed pay developments in Europe into the 21st century are being presented to the informal meeting of EU Ministers of Employment and Social Affairs taking place in Vilnius today. EIRO’s annual analysis of collectively agreed pay for 2012 finds that on average nominal agreed increases were slightly greater than in 2011 in many countries, but the rise in prices diminished people’s purchasing power. In real terms, only a handful of countries had positive collective pay increases on average – and even then these were modest. In 2012, these included Sweden (+1.7%), Austria (+0.8%), Germany (+0.6%), France (+0.4%) and Belgium (+0.4%, already including indexation) in 2012. While wage setting is a complex and diverse process across the Member States, wage setting mechanisms have received considerable attention in the context of macroeconomic policy debate. In particular there has been much focus on recommendations concerning issues such as decentralisation, indexation and derogation clauses, which aim to align wage developments more closely with productivity growth.  However, early findings from other new Eurofound research suggest no systematic link between these specific features of wage-setting systems, and the relationship between wage developments and productivity. Similarly, Eurofound also finds that in relation to minimum wage, outcomes with respect to wage equality/inequality are not determined by the institutional arrangements for setting minimum wages. For example, among countries with a statutory national minimum wage, some, like France, have fewer than 7% of workers earning less than 60% of the country’s median wage while others have figures of over 15% (UK and Ireland).  At the same time, in countries where no national minimum wage exists (albeit minimum wages are collectively agreed for some sectors and occupations), over 20% of workers fall below the threshold in Germany, while the figures are less than 7% for Finland and Sweden. The majority of Member States (21) have national minimum wages, which (with few exceptions) set the floor for actual pay.  Because of continued freezes or modest increases in nominal terms, national minimum wages declined in real terms in most countries; they were positive only in those countries where the minimum wage is at a very low level. Bulgaria and Estonia increased the minimum wage by 16.7% and 4.3% respectively in 2012 following a freeze in 2011. In contrast, three countries froze their minimum wages in 2012, having increased them in 2011: Portugal (2.1% in 2011), Spain (1.3%) and Latvia (11.1%). In Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland, nominal minimum wages were frozen for both 2011 and 2012. Outcomes of pay bargaining in relation to three sectors shows that while in the metalworking sector in general positive increases were granted, agreements in banking were a bit more moderate, whereas pay in local governments continued to be frozen or was rather moderate in several Member States. This report is part of an on-going annual exercise, which Eurofound has carried out since 1998 through its European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). For the first time, the annual report includes Croatia as a new Member State. Read the full report here.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0540	2013-07-15	UNK	Extra €2 billion pledged for youth jobs	Tackling youth unemployment remains a hot topic on the European policy agenda and a number of recent events focused on best practices across Europe. They heard of substantial extra funding for the worst-affected countries, record levels of youth unemployment in some countries and the need for a diverse approach. More funding to support youth employment On 3 July, EU leaders met at a high-level Conference on Youth Employment in Berlin, hosted by German Chancellor Angela Merkel (see videos from the event). In attendance were labour ministers, heads of employment agencies and representatives of large companies based in the EU. The aim was to discuss best practices to help young people back into work. The EU had already pledged €6 billion to tackle youth unemployment under the Youth Guarantee scheme. However, at the Berlin event, EU leaders agreed to concentrate national and EU resources to achieve progress more quickly, and thus pledged an extra €2 billion to support youth employment, particularly in countries with a youth unemployment rate above 25%. Job creation and better outcomes for young people Following the Berlin summit, Eurofound participated at other youth events. On 4–5 July, Research Manager Massimiliano Mascherini took part in the IZA/OECD Paris seminar 'Reforming European labour markets: Stimulating job creation and better outcomes for youth' where he presented an overview of the European Youth Guarantee and findings from Eurofound research on young people not in employment, education or training (NEET). He drew attention to the EU youth unemployment rate, which reached 23.5% in March 2013, with about half of Member States recording their highest level during the crisis. Speaking about the Youth Guarantee, he emphasised that success in implementation is highly dependent on other public policies in place such as apprenticeships and traineeships, and on the capacity of public employment services to provide adhoc tailored support to young people. Effective policies for reintegrating youth into labour market Massimiliano Mascherini was in action again on 8 July in Brussels at the meeting of the Youth Working Party of the European Council, one of the first events under the Lithuanian Presidency, where he spoke about risk factors and effective policies for the reintegration of young people into the labour market. Drawing on Eurofound research on youth in Europe, he highlighted that effective policies are those that diversify approaches, take labour market readiness into account, are innovative, focus on clients and not providers, involve stakeholders and set young people on a long-term pathway. For instance, he argued that countries with well-developed apprenticeships and vocational education and training systems performed better in terms of the levels of youth unemployment. On 12 July, Eurofound Research Officer Lidia Salvatore participated in the Seminar on Youth Employment and the Youth Guarantee in Dublin, organised by Irish MEP Emer Costello, focusing on how the Youth Guarantee should be implemented in Ireland. Presenting Eurofound findings, she spoke about the urgency of tackling youth disengagement from the labour market and society in terms of personal, social and economic costs. To fuel the discussion, she also presented findings on experiences of youth guarantee schemes in Finland and Sweden, their strengths and risk factors and results in terms of evaluation of these measures.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/spotlight-on/youth/extra-2-billion-pledged-for-youth-jobs
EUROFOUND_UNK_0541	2013-06-28	UNK	Changing fortunes in Europe's newest Member State	While Croatia formally become a Member State of the EU on 1 July, Eurofound’s European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) has been covering Croatia for six years – since 2007. From the survey findings emerge a picture of  a country in transition, and one with marked generational differences in terms of outlook and attitudes. Generally, people in Croatia are less satisfied with their lives than are EU residents on average: on a scale of 1 to 10, they rate their satisfaction with life at 6.8 – below the EU average of 7.1. However, this picture changes when we look at young people in Croatia. Not only are young people the most satisfied of all age groups with their lives in the country; they are also more satisfied than the average for their counterparts in the EU27. People here are more optimistic than are EU residents on average, but there are many countries where optimism is more widespread. Again, however, young Croatians are far more optimistic about the future than the older generations (those aged 65 and over). Material hardship is a key issue for many people: almost a third of people have difficulties making ends meet. While it is especially difficult for those aged between 40 and 49, younger people find it much easier. This same pattern is found in the other countries that were formerly part of Yugoslavia. This suggests that the consequences for people joining the labour market in times of crisis (in this case the Balkan wars of the 1990s) are large, negative and persistent.  Eurofound research has found that health, income, and age are the most important factors in people’s level of well-being. Interestingly, in Croatia, being unemployed has less of an impact on how satisfied people are with their lives than in many other EU countries, where the unemployed are much less satisfied with their lives than others. That suggests that people here may have support networks that make them less dependent on the job alone.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/changing-fortunes-in-europes-newest-member-state
EUROFOUND_UNK_0542	2013-07-01	UNK	Youth issues remain high on EU Presidency agenda	Following on from the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union, Lithuania takes on the role for the first time from 1 July 2013 and keeps youth issues high on its agenda (read about Eurofound and the Lithuanian Presidency). This is positive for young people across Europe as Member States look for ways out of the crisis and to get young people back into employment. Presidency focus At a European Movement briefing on the Lithuanian Presidency and Croatian accession to the EU held at the European Parliament Office in Dublin on 25 June, the Lithuanian Ambassador to Ireland, Vidmantas Purlys, highlighted the priorities for the Lithuanian Presidency which will focus on the three goals of a credible, growing and open Europe. Youth employment remains among the top priorities for ‘Growing Europe’, with youth guarantee schemes and the alliance for apprenticeships highlighted as means to achieve this. Over the next six months, Eurofound will participate in various Presidency events on different topics, among them the following on youth issues: Youth Working Party meeting, 8 July; EU Youth Conference, 9–12 September; Meeting of Chairs of Employment and Social Affairs Committees of the parliaments of EU Member States, 10–11 November. Research from Eurofound feeds the debate Eurofound will present findings from its research on the situation of young people in Europe, particularly those who are not in employment, education or training (NEET). The research shows that youth unemployment in Lithuania, for example, was among the highest in the EU in 2011, standing at 32.9%. The NEET rate among 15–29 year-olds was around 15.2% in 2011, costing the country an estimated 1% of GDP per year. The focus of these events and Eurofound’s research to date ties in with the Committee of the Regions (CoR) recently published report Youth employment: Making it happen which brings together findings and examples of best practices from 15 EU Member States and policy proposals for boosting youth employment, including Croatia which joined the EU on 1 July (see more about Eurofound’s research on Croatia). Drawing on Eurofound’s study on NEETS: Characteristics, costs and policy responses in Europe, the CoR report highlights the urgency of the situation facing young people across Europe and the high cost of NEETs to the economy and society. It emphasises that European initiatives are needed to help create jobs and tackle youth unemployment, thus safeguarding the European social model for the future of youth in Europe and that ‘we have to find answers now that give [young people] the opportunity to shape that future for themselves’.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0543	2013-07-02	UNK	Securing jobs by innovating in work practices and organisation	An economic environment where jobs are constantly under threat concentrates minds on how to strengthen underperforming enterprises so that existing jobs are secured. A lot of optimism has been invested in the potential that innovating in work practices holds for improving productivity. This is not a matter of simply putting a squeeze on workers to work harder; current thinking on workplace innovation emphasises that improving the quality of work is inherent in the process, to sustain long-term performance. It's a move away from the hierarchical control practices of Taylorist management towards practices that aim to elicit commitment from workers and devolve decision-making to them. But does this scenario of mutual benefit exist only on the pages of textbooks and policy documents? Eurofound has just published the results of a study that back up the theory, providing evidence that it is borne out when these innovations are put into practice. The research is based on case studies of three Irish manufacturing companies (producing car parts, packaging and medical devices), each of which was dealing with problems related to quality or production costs. All three introduced changes in the organisation of work, such as teamworking, lean production (minimising the amount of time and resources used in the production process) and cellular manufacturing (grouping people and resources in a self-contained unit to produce an entire product). Culture shift These changes in the practical organisation of work were underpinned by a shift in organisational culture, which placed much greater priority on employee involvement in decision-making and shifting more responsibility from management to employees. Following these transformations, productivity improved in all enterprises, alongside benefits for staff such as improvements in pay, more opportunities to avail of training, greater job satisfaction and increased autonomy. There was also evidence that social dialogue and the involvement of worker representatives made a valuable contribution. Trade union representatives facilitated employee acceptance of the innovations and implementation of the changes in all three companies. There is a downside, however, because improvements in efficiency reduce the number of staff needed. In one company, staff numbers fell through natural wastage as the plant’s efficiency increased, while the other two anticipate staff reductions in the future. However, if improved efficiency eventually leads to growth, jobs could conceivably be recouped in the future. The benefits of workplace innovations are not uncontested. Other research has found while employees may benefit through increased job satisfaction or profit-sharing, such benefits may entail intensification of work and increased stress. Or the organisation may profit while the gains for employees are relatively minor. The key, then, is to identify and introduce those innovations that create mutual gains for employees and organisations alike. To examine the findings in more depth, read the report Work organisation and innovation in Ireland, which was launched by the Irish Minister of State for Research and Innovation, Sean Sherlock.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/securing-jobs-by-innovating-in-work-practices-and-organisation
EUROFOUND_UNK_0544	2013-06-26	UNK	Press release, 26 June 2013	Eurofound launches its flagship annual working time update for 2012: Differences in working time remain large across Europe The average collectively agreed weekly working time in the European Union, including Croatia, stood at 38.1 hours in 2012, the same as for the EU27 in 2011, according to Eurofound’s latest annual working time update. The working week was on average 30 minutes shorter in the pre-2004 EU15 countries and over 1 hour and 30 minutes longer in the new Member States. The new report provides a snapshot of working time developments in the European Union and Norway in 2012 as agreed between the social partners by collective agreements. The combined total of agreed annual leave and public holidays in the EU varied from 40 days in Germany to 28 days in Estonia – a difference of over 2 working weeks. Collective bargaining plays an important role in determining the duration of working time in most of the 28 Member States of the European Union, though to a lesser or sometimes negligible extent in some of the Member States that joined the EU since 2004, the NMS13. This annual report provides a general overview of collectively agreed working time and any major developments taking place in 2012, and it includes data from Croatia, a Member State of the European Union from 1 July 2013, and Norway. Belgium, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and the UK were the only countries registering changes between 2011 and 2012. Slovakia continued in a decreasing trend whereas Spain halted an upward trend: both countries registered a fall of 0.1 hours in collectively agreed weekly hours. Sweden and the UK registered an increase of 0.1 hours per week, while Belgium recorded the highest increase, of 0.2 hours per week. The report also looks at the average normal weekly working hours for full-time workers as set by collective bargaining in three sectors representing the manufacturing industry, services and the public sector – metalworking, banking and local government. The banking sector recorded the shortest average agreed normal weekly working hours from the three in the EU, with 37.6 hours, followed by the local government sector, with 37.8 hours, and metalworking, with 37.9 hours. Actual weekly hours worked by full-time employees were longer than the average normal collectively agreed working week in 21 of the 29 countries analysed in the report. In the EU, full-time employees in Romania reported the longest actual weekly hours in their main jobs in 2012 – 41.2 hours, or 0.1 hours less than in 2011. They were followed by employees in Luxembourg (41.1 hours), the UK (40.8 hours), Germany (40.5 hours), Croatia and Cyprus (both 40.3 hours), and Bulgaria (40.2 hours). Employees in Finland worked the shortest hours (37.6). This was 3.6 hours less than their counterparts in Romania, or over 4.5 weeks of work in Romania in a full year. Across the EU28, men worked on average 2 hours more than women. In the EU15, men worked 2.3 hours more per week than women; by contrast, in the NMS13, men worked around 1 hour and 30 minutes more than women. Again, these averages conceal more stark national situations: men’s actual weekly hours exceeded women’s by 3 hours or more in Ireland, the UK and Italy (3.6, 3.4 and 3 hours, respectively), by less than 1 hour in Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania, and by less than 20 minutes in Bulgaria. An important factor in the overall length of working time is the paid annual leave to which workers are generally entitled, the report points out. All 28 countries studied have a statutory minimum period of paid annual leave, and the average figure for the EU28, including paid leave and public holidays, stood at 35.1 days – 36.6 days in the EU15 and 30.3 days in the NMS13. The report reveals big differences between countries, with employees in Germany enjoying up to 40 days of leave in total in 2012, followed by employees in France and Italy (39 days), while other notably low-leave countries included Hungary, Lithuania, Poland and Romania, with 29 days, and Estonia with 28 days. Taking into account the agreed weekly hours, the days of leave and the public holidays, in 2012, the average collectively agreed annual normal working time was approximately 1,712 hours in the EU28, 1,678 hours in the EU15, and 1,824 hours in the NMS13.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0545	2013-06-27	UNK	Press release, 27 June 2013	Eurofound launches report on work organisation and innovation in Ireland: Innovation and workplace organisation in Ireland, a leading light and good example for Europe Employers, employer associations and trade unions have an important role to play in promoting work organisation innovations which can provide win–win benefits for employers and workers alike in Irish workplaces. This is according to a new report by Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU agency. The report will be launched today by Sean Sherlock TD, Minister of State for Research and Innovation within the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. Innovations in work organisation have the potential to optimise production processes in companies and improve employees’ overall experience of work. It may also lead to wider innovation in products and services, which could result in employment growth. The Work organisation and innovation in Ireland report explores the links between innovations in work organisation – under the broader label of high performance work practices (HPWPs) – and the potential benefits for both employees and businesses. It draws on empirical evidence from three case studies in the manufacturing business (car parts, packaging and medical devices) in the Republic of Ireland, where workplace innovations were a response to business and marketplace pressures, turning these into positive outcomes. In Ireland, considerable policy interest has been given to social partnership and fostering innovation in employment practices over the past two decades, although this has come under increasing pressure as a result of the financial crisis. In all three case studies, trade union representatives played a significant role in facilitating employee acceptance of the innovations and in implementing the changes. Trade union sources also provided inspiration for some of the elements of partnership working and problem-solving through the work of the Ideas Institute, set up by the trade union SIPTU. ‘It is clear that the policy stimulus to promote social partnership in Ireland and the work over the past 10 years to promote work organisation innovations have had a positive legacy,' says Sean Sherlock TD, Irish Minister of State for Research and Innovation. ‘Within the case study organisations reviewed in Eurofound’s report, the adoption of innovative practices has helped to secure and sustain employment and workplaces.’ The report encourages the Irish government to take the opportunity, following its Presidency of the Council of the European Union, to engage with its successor Presidencies to promote the diffusion of HPWPs across the European Union and to showcase the innovations that have taken place within workplaces in Ireland to inspire employers in other Member States. The report will be launched by Sean Sherlock TD, Minister of State for Research and Innovation within the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation at 14:00 on Thursday 27 June, in Eurofound’s offices in Loughlinstown, Dublin 18. The event is open to the media.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0546	2013-06-18	UNK	Press release, 18 June 2013	Eurofound launches it flagship Yearbook of Living and Working in Europe 2012 report: EU faces ongoing challenge as report highlights growing divergence between, within EU countries Growing differences between and within EU Member States are revealed in Eurofound’s new yearbook, Living and Working in Europe 2012 which provides an annual snapshot of the state of living and working conditions across Europe. As the impact of the economic crisis continues, the divergence between ‘core’ and peripheral’ euro zone countries is increasingly apparent according to the report.  In those countries most affected by the economic crisis, for example, substantial numbers of people report great difficulty in making ends meet.  These countries also show a greater decline in trust in public institutions, particularly national governments. In general, citizens also report more tension between rich and poor and between racial groups. The EU has responded to this crisis with a multi-faceted policy drive – one that Eurofound works to inform, monitor and support at policymaking level. The EU and its citizens faced enormous challenges in 2012 as the limited economic recovery of the previous year stalled, GDP fell and unemployment began to grow again. Governments in many Member States were caught between the need to cut spending to control public debt and at the same time provide more support to citizens. The overall deterioration in employment at EU level belies considerable divergence across Member States, especially between ‘core’ and ‘peripheral’ euro zone countries. In December 2012, unemployment stood at 27% in Greece and 26% in Spain. But labour markets in Austria and Luxembourg have been largely unaffected by the crisis, and unemployment barely ever rose above 5% in either. As in previous years, the manufacturing sector was a major source of job loss, accounting for 36% of announced job losses in the first half of 2012, reversing the slowdown in job cuts in 2011. However, some manufacturing subsectors showed resilience, and over a third of new jobs announced were in manufacturing, mostly in higher-tech sectors – computers, electronics and communication equipment as well as the automotive industry. The destruction of employment has been strongly polarising in terms of the distribution of jobs when considering wages. It has led to the elimination of mid-paying and mid-low-paying jobs and a shift towards high-skilled, white-collar employment. This contraction in the middle was accentuated in particular during the peak of the financial crisis (2008–2010) primarily as a result of huge falls in employment in construction and manufacturing. The strongest relative growth in this period was in higher-paying jobs, mostly in publicly funded services (health, education and public administration). Living and working in Europe 2012 depicts a region experiencing fracture across economic, geographic and social boundaries – between core and peripheral states in the EU, between insiders and outsiders in the labour market, between workers with good jobs and workers with poor jobs in the workplace, between haves and have-nots in society. This current course of division weakens the European Union, and only by reversing it can the goal of deeper integration to address the crisis of the last four years be achieved. As the EU has responded to the crisis and to growing divisions within Europe, Eurofound has worked to inform, monitor and support the policymaking response.

News in brief Finding ways to stay at work for longer Positive advances in quality of life and healthcare provision mean that people in Europe are enjoying a longer and healthier old age. However, in order to relieve pressure on social security and pension systems, governments are faced with the challenge of keeping people at work longer. A recently published Eurofound report looks at government and social partner initiatives to keep older workers in the labour market. While some involve financial incentives, others look at ways to enhance working conditions, including flexible working time and health initiatives. Based primarily on the contributions of 28 national correspondents of Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO), the research includes seven case studies carried out in six countries that underline the role of the social partners both in implementing measures and in raising awareness among employers and employees. Read Role of governments and social partners in keeping older workers in the labour market A year in the life of Europe – Yearbook 2012 published One of the starkest findings to emerge from Eurofound’s research in 2012 was the divergence between and within countries. Some Member States have suffered greatly; groups that were already vulnerable are suffering more in the crisis and countries are diverging on quality of life measures; higher-paid jobs have proved more resilient than lower paid jobs and have grown in number. Eurofound’s fourth annual yearbook Living and Working in Europe 2012, just published, draws together the threads of Eurofound’s output in 2012 into a narrative that follows developments in the daily and working lives of Europeans. Key sources include the latest waves of the European Working Conditions Survey and the European Quality of Life Survey. Other major research areas look at young people not in employment, education or training (NEETs), the continuing effect of the economic crisis on the labour market, and sustainable work to support longer working lives. Published jointly with the yearbook is the the annual activity report of the Authorising Officer, which describes Eurofound’s research and information and communication programmes. Download the Yearbook 2012 Social services – boosting quality of life for EU citizens Social and public services play a key role in fostering a better quality of life for European citizens, as Eurofound’s research has discovered. In a workshop at the 21st European Social Services Conference on 17–19 June in Dublin, Ireland, Eurofound will present the results of Eurofound’s latest European Quality of Life Survey on satisfaction with public services – particularly in relation to the impact of the crisis. Focusing on health, childcare and long-term care, the workshop will examine the extent to which cost, availability, access and quality impact on people’s use of these services. And it will also seek the views of participants as to how such analyses can assist policymaking. In addition, Eurofound Director Juan Menéndez-Valdés will speak on addressing the challenges to social care posed by the pressure on public finances and high unemployment levels.

Out of the shadows – focus on undeclared work Undeclared work is an ongoing concern for the EU and its Member States. The consequences for individuals and society are especially apparent in times of economic and social crisis. With this in mind, the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) is preparing an opinion that will outline a strategy to tackle the shadow economy and undeclared work. On 5 June in Brussels, Eurofound contributed its expertise at a hearing organised by the EESC, and launched a package of new research on the subject. More examples of measures used to fight undeclared work have been added to the database first set up in 2008 to include examples from Croatia and four candidate countries. Research shows that not enough formal evaluation of measures is being conducted, making peer learning difficult; furthermore, the combination and sequencing of measures needs to be assessed more systematically if policymakers are to identify what works best. During the hearing, the European Commission announced the establishment of a European platform to fight undeclared work. Providing a unique input to the work of the platform, Eurofound’s extensive mapping and analysis of measures are available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/labourmarket/undeclared-work.htm. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-june-2013-1

Benefits of employee workplace involvement In the EU27, most of the workforce is employed in organisations that provide only limited opportunities for employees to participate in decision-making, whether regarding their own job or wider issues that affect their work. A new report from Eurofound illustrates the extent of employee involvement and the factors associated with it: levels of involvement are highest in the Nordic countries, in work involving extensive use of computer technology, in more highly skilled jobs and in organisations with a well-developed human resource capacity or institutionalised channels for social dialogue. It has been argued that organisations with high levels of involvement are especially successful in fostering employee motivation and well-being and so contribute to economic development. Based on findings from Eurofound’s fifth European Working Conditions Survey, the report highlights the organisational benefits associated with greater involvement – fewer physical symptoms of stress, greater psychological well-being, and less absence due to health problems. Launched on 12 June at a conference on ‘Innovative practices in work, organisation and regional development’ in Linköping, Sweden.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0552	2013-05-30	UNK	Building a better future for young people key focus of OECD Forum 2013	Eurofound’s findings on the problems facing young people across Europe and the economic cost of non-integration of those not in employment, education or training (NEETs) were referenced several times at the OECD Forum 2013 on 28–29 May in Paris. Low growth, record high unemployment among young people and their lack of trust in institutions means more needs to be done to rebuild confidence and improve prospects for Europe’s youth. A central aspect of inclusive growth, as one of the main priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy, is to increase employment, especially for young people, invest in their skills and training, as well as modernise labour markets and welfare systems. But the challenge is not unique to the EU and the issue was at the forefront of discussions during the two-day OECD Forum. Among others, the sessions on ‘The Unemployees’ and ‘Scars of the Crisis’ highlighted youth issues and specifically economic and social costs of non-integration of young people into the labour market. Trust in institutions, social exclusion and mental health issues were also prominent in the debate. In addition, young people participating at the Forum highlighted the issues surrounding the provision of internships and establishing a quality framework for their implementation. The Forum feeds into the Ministerial Council Meeting on 29–30 May, where government leaders and ministers will hear more on the OECD’s Youth Action Plan, which is currently in the pipeline and aims to ensure that young people are given a good start. Find more on the Forum 2013, see photographs and follow the debate at www.oecd.org/forum/. Eurofound findings Research carried out by Eurofound on youth issues reveals that: youth disengagement from the labour market has a high cost and lasting effects for the individual and society; those with low levels of education are more likely to be ‘not in employment, education or training’ (NEET) compared to those with tertiary education; young people are a diverse group, with different levels of labour market readiness, and need tailored policy interventions that address specific needs; youth have difficulties gaining a ‘foothold’ in the labour market due to lack of work experience, low levels of qualifications or mismatch between their skills and what employers need; they should be equipped with the skills needed to improve their employability, through apprenticeships, internships or training/re-training courses; young people with a disability or those with caring responsibilities have complex support needs and efforts are needed to remove practical and logistical barriers to labour market access; the role of mental health problems as a factor in the social exclusion of young people needs to be addressed more effectively; NEETs have a lower level of political interest, political and social engagement and a lower level of trust than non-NEETs.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0553	2013-06-11	UNK	Press release, 5 June 2013	Eurofound publishes comparative research on undeclared work in Europe during the recession: Europe is winning the war on undeclared work A wide range of policy approaches and measures introduced in all EU Member States over the past five years have had a significant impact on preventing businesses and people from engaging in undeclared work, new research from Eurofound has found.  It recorded an incremental decline in the size of the undeclared economy from the equivalent of 22.3% of GDP in 2003 to 18.4% by 2012, although with big differences between countries. Eurofound launches today a comprehensive package of research comparing approaches and measures on how EU Member States, Croatia and four EU candidate countries, have tackled undeclared work since the onset of the economic recession in 2008, at a hearing in the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) in Brussels, Belgium. Two contrasting views exist regarding what happens to the size of the undeclared economy in times of economic crisis. One is that it grows relative to the declared economy, with firms and households seeking to save on costs. The other is that the undeclared economy declines due to the lower demand for undeclared labour because of less money being available, and undeclared work being substituted by ‘flexible’ and cheaper declared labour. Since the publication of Eurofound’s previous reports on how undeclared work is being tackled in the 27 Member States of the European Union and Norway five years ago, the ongoing recession took hold. The aim of this report is to provide an updated overview of the policy approaches and measures that have been implemented to tackle undeclared work during the interim period, in the EU27 Member States, Croatia and the four EU candidate countries. This report also provides pointers of potentially good practice policy measures. By 2010, 27 out of the 30 countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland had implemented policy measures to help prevent businesses and people from engaging in undeclared work from the outset. 19 of out these countries were using measures to enable the transfer of undeclared work into the declared realm, and 20 of these had adopted commitment measures to try to facilitate a greater commitment to ‘tax morality’. However, the range of measures implemented remained relatively narrow. The majority of policy approaches and measures to tackle undeclared work that have been introduced across the EU27 over the past five years were designed to detect and punish non-compliance. However, while it remains the dominant approach across the majority of Member States, there has been wider take-up of an enabling approach since the onset of the recession. This approach provides encouragement and incentives for people and businesses to join the formal economy. By 2012, the average size of the undeclared economy across the EU27 was equivalent to 18.4% of GDP, although this varied significantly between Member States, ranging from 7.6% in Austria to 31.9% in Bulgaria. The research concluded that most of the Member States with relatively large undeclared economies in 2012 are either east- central European or southern European Member States. Those with below-average undeclared economies, meanwhile, are largely west European and Nordic Member States. This signals a clear north–south and east–west divide within the EU27 concerning the relative size of the undeclared economy. Who is being affected by this decline depends on where one is in the EU27. The research found that in Nordic countries, those in declared work who have traditionally topped up their earnings using the undeclared economy, are suffering more than others from the decline of the undeclared economy during the current recession. In southern Europe, the unemployed are suffering most from this decline. This is also the case in western and east-central Europe, and the EU27 as whole. Even when unemployed people get undeclared work, it is less well paid and the annual income from it is lower than that earned by employed people engaged in such work. The overview report on undeclared work in the EU27 and Norway, and the overview report on undeclared work in Croatia and the four EU candidate countries, plus national reports from the same, and a database with 186 cases of good practice, are available on the Eurofound website.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0554	2013-06-12	UNK	Press release, 12 June 2013	Eurofound launches report on work organisation and employee involvement in Europe: Involving employees at the workplace pays off in higher levels of work performance (Dublin, Ireland): Research shows that employee involvement can support employers’ objectives to raise levels of work performance and can also enhance the quality of employees’ lives at work. However, new data from Eurofound shows only about a quarter of employees in Europe (27%) are working in high involvement organisations, casting doubts over the ambitious Europe 2020 strategy aimed at attaining ‘smart’ growth through the development of higher-quality jobs in higher value-added industries and ‘inclusive’ growth in which all citizens have access to high-quality employment opportunities. The report is presented at the International Helix Conference 2013 in Linköping, Sweden, today and available online below. Innovations in work organisation have the potential to optimise production processes in companies and improve employees’ overall experience of work. In the EU27 overall, however, most of the workforce is in organisations that provide very limited opportunities for employees to participate in decision-making, either in their immediate job or in relation to wider organisational issues affecting their work. While 38% of employees were in low involvement organisations in 2010, just 27% were in high involvement organisations, with 35% in organisations that offer intermediate levels of involvement. The broad pattern was very similar for both men and women. Given the importance of a highly skilled workforce for economic growth, the need to develop systems of work organisation to foster employee motivation and well-being is likely to become increasingly important to the policy agenda. The research found that higher levels of employee involvement are more likely to be found in companies with relatively advanced technology and a more skilled workforce. There were marked differences between countries in the control that employees can exercise over their work tasks, their involvement in wider organisational decision-making and the likelihood that they work in a high involvement organisation. The Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland and Sweden) had the highest levels of involvement, while the Southern countries (Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain) and the East-South countries (Bulgaria and Romania) had particularly low levels of involvement. The research analysis found that there was also a strong association between the level of employee involvement and the opportunities for informal and formal learning at work. Nearly 60% of employees in high involvement organisations had received training in the previous 12 months compared to just over 42% of those in low involvement organisations. Greater involvement was also associated with stronger employee motivation in terms of commitment to the work task and to the wider organisation. Those reporting that work organisation is motivating performance rose from 47% in low involvement to 76% in high involvement organisations. It also found that greater opportunities for involvement in decision-making were associated with higher levels of psychological well-being – for both men and women. It was also consistently related to fewer physical symptoms of stress. There were clear benefits in terms of working and employment conditions from being employed in an organisation that provided greater scope for involvement in decision-making. At present, relatively little is known about the prevalence of employee involvement across the EU and the factors that encourage it. The extent to which employee involvement leads to mutual benefits for the employee and employer is also controversial. The report Work organisation and employee involvement in Europe draws on data from Eurofound’s fifth European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) of 2010 to investigate these issues and to strengthen the evidence available.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0555	2013-06-10	UNK	Working in the shadow economy	With decreasing opportunities in the legitimate labour market, it would seem plausible that growing numbers of unemployed workers would be willing to work informally to secure a livelihood, adding to the shadow economy. However, this undeclared economy – paid work that is legal, but not declared to the authorities for tax purposes – has shown an incremental downward trend over the past decade, one that has been largely unaffected by the economic crisis. That said, it remains substantial, estimated to be almost one-fifth of GDP in the EU. The undeclared economies in southern and eastern European Member States are estimated to be above the EU average, the largest being that of Bulgaria, at nearly one-third of GDP. Undeclared work is not confined to the unemployed – employed workers, too, top up their incomes with informal work on the side. In fact, in the Nordic countries of Denmark, Finland and Sweden, proportionally more employed workers do undeclared work (12%) than unemployed workers (9%). In the rest of Europe, the reverse is true. In the countries of southern Europe, for instance – Cyprus, Greece, Spain, Italy, Malta and Portugal – 12% of the unemployed work undeclared, compared with 2% of the employed workforce. (Note that the figures quoted here should be treated with some caution as they are based on indirect methods and survey responses.)  Reinforcing marginalisation For unemployed workers in many ways undeclared work reinforces their disadvantage. Their undeclared work is less well paid and their total annual undeclared income is lower than that of employed people engaged in such work. The average hourly undeclared wage of an unemployed worker in the EU is €8.04, for example, but that of an employed worker is 75% more at €14.08. Workers in the undeclared sector have none of the legal protections of workers in regular work and have little recourse if things go wrong. And because they don’t contribute to social security and pension systems, their entitlement to benefits is curtailed. Apart from creating a marginalised group of workers, the undeclared economy leads to loss of tax revenue for governments and unfair competition for legitimate businesses. Eurofound published the results of research into policy approaches across Europe to tackling undeclared work at a hearing of the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) on 5 June, part of the EESC intervention on the issue. This work includes a knowledge bank of measures that have been implemented across the EU, which  may enable actors in the Member States to identify tried and tested initiatives and expand their repetoire of measures.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/working-in-the-shadow-economy
EUROFOUND_UNK_0556	2013-05-21	UNK	Restructuring in SMEs – Upsides and downsides for jobs	Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are major employers in Europe, providing around two-thirds of private sector jobs. Reorganisation of these enterprises – for reasons such as expansion, internal change or avoiding bankruptcy or closure – can have a significant impact on employment. In 60% of SMEs that took part in a study by Eurofound, staff numbers fell as a result of restructuring and in these cases the net reduction in staff was between 15% and 20% on average. Lay-offs can be particularly difficult within SMES, as employers work closely with their staff and have built relationships with them. Given that SMEs experience greater difficulties attracting skilled staff, firms also risk losing expertise that they will have difficulty replacing in the event of an upturn in business. For these reasons, in crisis situations, SMEs tend to delay dismissals and often opt for alternatives to lay-offs: one-fifth of the SMEs studied reduced working time, while a similar proportion implemented pay freezes or cuts. On a brighter note, about 40% of the restructurings gave rise to new jobs. Increases were in the order of 20% to 35% net on average, but a comparatively high number of companies expanded their workforces by 60% or more; several even doubled their staff numbers. Job quality Aside from the effect on staff numbers, restructuring has an impact on job quality. In half of the companies studied, staff were trained to equip them with new skills for new responsibilities. On the downside, workload increases and stress were reported among some. In a quarter of companies the restructuring caused a worsening of the working atmosphere, conflicts among staff and resistance among the workforce, in spite of efforts by management to communicate its plans and goals. However, more than 20% experienced an improved atmosphere, with increased commitment and motivation among the workforce. In just 5% of the restructurings was a deterioration of the workplace climate a long-term outcome. Employment effects are just one topic in this major research project on restructuring in SMEs recently published by Eurofound. Given that SMEs have been recognised as key drivers of growth and innovation by the European Commission, the distinct and specific challenges they face warrant attention. Eurofound’s findings, launched at a European Parliament Working Lunch on 14 May 2013, comprise: an overview report; 27 national reports from Member States; a database of 85 company case studies; a comparative analytical report on public policy and support for restructuring in SMEs. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/restructuring-in-smes-upsides-and-downsides-for-jobs
EUROFOUND_UNK_0557	2013-05-17	UNK	Stark generation gap in Ireland's fortunes	The Irish Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) has just published a report finding that the financial and economic crisis in Ireland has affected younger households much more than older households. The report The effect of unemployment, arrears and negative equity on consumption: Ireland in 2009/10 finds that between 2004–2005 and 2009–2010, the disposable income and consumption of households headed by someone younger than 35 fell by around 25% and 41% respectively. By contrast, where the head of the household is 55 or older, income rose by 62% and consumption by 50%. This stark change in fortunes reflects the national-level effect of a broad pattern of hardship that Eurofound’s third European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) has documented across the EU. The EQLS highlights that some countries – including Ireland – have been particularly affected by unemployment and in many cases that young people have fared more badly than other groups. Unemployment The ESRI research emphasises that it is the economic circumstances of Ireland’s younger households, rather than their age as such, that makes them so vulnerable. In addition to the burdens of mortgage or other debt arrears and negative equity, younger households in Ireland are particularly affected by unemployment. And the EQLS finds that a key factor in hardship is unemployment: across the EU, 80% of people living in households where at least one person is unemployed are likely to have difficulties in making ends meet. Similarly, when figures for difficulties in meeting housing costs are explored, an age difference emerges. Across the EU27, only a little over 5% of those aged over 64 said their household had been in arrears for rent or mortgage payments over the previous 12 months. By contrast, nearly 15% of those aged between 24 and 34 had been in arrears. For those aged between 35 and 49, the figure was 13%.

News in brief Saving Europe’s lost generation With rising unemployment across Europe, especially among young people, there is an urgent need to put the issue of skills and education high up on the agenda. A skills and education summit – Saving Europe’s ‘Lost Generation’ – organised by Friends of Europe on Wednesday 15 May in Brussels will bring together senior stakeholders for a lively debate on the future of Europe’s employment and education policies. Taking place in association with the Irish EU Presidency and with the support of Eurofound, the conference’s themes include skills mismatch, education systems and possible gaps, encouraging entrepreneurship, the roles of stakeholders and what an EU-wide jobs strategy should look like. Speakers include Ruairí Quinn, Ireland’s Minister for Education and Skills, and Androulla Vassiliou, EU Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth. Eurofound’s Research Manager Massimiliano Mascherini will give a presentation on Eurofound’s report NEETs Young people not in employment, education or training: Characteristics, costs and policy responses in Europe. Setting the style for information and communication Eurofound’s brief is to provide European decision makers across the 27 Member States with the information they need to create policies that benefit all European workers and citizens. This means that the information it offers should be delivered in language that is clear, concise and accessible. To help authors and editors to communicate Eurofound’s work in the most effective way, Eurofound has published an updated, expanded version of its editorial style guide. The guide sets out important standards, rules and conventions for writing and editing documents and creating print and online publications in English. Included for the first time is a section on writing in plain language – particularly important to ensure that the language used is as transparent as possible for non-native speakers of English. Explore the guide Spotlight on Europe’s food and drink sector Operating at both a European and global level, the food and drink sector comprises over 300,000 enterprises and employs nearly 4.8 million people in Europe. While job levels have fallen due to the economic crisis, the industry has not been as badly hit as other sectors. In terms of representation, it is highly fragmented: nearly half the countries with available data in the sector have four or more trade unions while over a third have four or more employer associations. These are some of the findings contained in Eurofound’s latest ‘representativeness’ study, devoted to the food and drink sector. Later in the month, Eurofound will publish studies on the live performance and sport and leisure sectors in Europe. In the autumn, further studies will explore the textiles and clothing, construction, and cleaning sectors. The aim of the representiveness series of studies is to identify the national and supranational social partner organisations in each sector to be consulted under the provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Dowload the report Links between work environment and well-being Clearly linked to labour market participation, productivity and sustainability, health and well-being play a central role in the lives of individuals and how society functions. Eurofound’s new report Health and well-being at work examines the close relationship between work, health and well-being. Drawing on the findings of Eurofound’s fifth European Working Conditions Survey, the report examines work-related stress and the psychosocial work environment in relation to specific health conditions. It looks at quality of work and job security, revealing a positive association with well-being, and explores the prevalence of absenteeism and presenteeism among European workers. Huge differences are found in the levels of health and well-being across countries, sectors, individuals and job characteristics.

Supporting diversity in the workplace The first session of the 2013 Foundation Seminar Series (FSS) takes place on 23–24 May at Eurofound’s premises in Dublin under the banner of ‘Promoting diversity at the workplace: a strategy for inclusion and competitiveness’. Research indicates that diversity – in terms of age, ability, ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation and religion – can be an asset for companies, resulting in higher productivity and competitiveness. However, proper management practices are needed to put an inclusive infrastructure into place. The FSS aims to contribute to the Europe 2020 strategy by demonstrating the importance of diversity management practices as a way to promote inclusive growth. This first FSS session will examine demographic trends and the labour market situation of specific groups of workers and discuss types of practices for diversity management. It provides a setting for the exchange of knowledge on policies and initiatives supporting diversity management practices at workplace level.

Bridging the gap on restructuring in SMEs May sees the release of Eurofound’s ground-breaking study Restructuring in SMEs in Europe. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) make up over 99% of European businesses and about two-thirds of private sector jobs, making them the backbone of the European economy. While there is a considerable body of research on restructuring, most studies to date have concentrated on restructuring in large companies. This report, based on 85 case studies, addresses this knowledge gap. It outlines the particular features of SME restructuring, the drivers of change and success factors. It shows how restructuring affects companies and workers and offers pointers on policies to support successful SME restructuring. Eurofound’s research on SMEs also includes a database of the case studies, 27 national reports and a comparative study on public policy support for restructuring in SMEs in EU Member States. The report was launched at a working lunch for Members of the European Parliament on 14 May, addressed by Research Manager Irene Mandl, Head of the Employment and Change Unit Donald Storrie and Eurofound Director Juan Menéndez-Valdés. It is being further promoted at two events in Dublin supported by the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union: a workshop on competitiveness for growth and jobs on 29 May and the EuroSME2013 conference on 11–12 June.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0561	2013-05-13	UNK	Press release, 14 May 2013	"Eurofound publishes new comparative research on restructuring in SMEs in Europe: Understanding restructuring in SMEs in Europe Small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) make up more than 99% of European businesses and account for about two thirds of private sector employment. SMEs are subject to change as large businesses, but public and policy discussions on restructuring is mainly focused on large-scale restructuring because of the greater immediate effects, often neglecting specific characteristics and needs of SMEs. Eurofound has carried out comparative research to highlight the challenges facing restructuring in SMEs in Europe, specifically in the area of policy and support measures.  This package of research, which includes a database of 85 company case examples, is presented to members of the European Parliament in Brussels, Belgium, today. Restructuring in SMEs is less visible and less publicised than that in larger firms, which makes headlines almost on a daily basis. Yet, SMEs are the backbone of the European economy, accounting for more than 99% of European enterprises and about two-thirds of private sector employment. Restructuring is likely to have different manifestations in SMEs than in larger firms and until recently little has been known about the details of restructuring in SMEs and its outcomes. 	Eurofound has now carried out an EU-wide research study which investigated the relevance of different forms of restructuring for SMEs, the drivers of change, the main characteristics, success factors and constraints of SME restructuring as well as the effects of restructuring on companies and employees. The research found that internal restructuring, business expansion and (avoiding) bankruptcy/closure are the most common forms of restructuring in SMEs, and restructuring in SMEs tends to be carried out in a reactive, unplanned way and without formal restructuring plans. Restructuring in SMEs is driven by a combination of company external and company internal factors, hardly ever by a single event. While company external factors are in general the same as for large firms, the company internal factors are very specific for SMEs. These are related to the strong role of the owner/manager in the firm, and the limitations in terms of human resources and financing, and the often prevalent dependency on a few key clients and suppliers. Common for SMEs is that once restructuring is underway, decisions are taken quickly and flexibly. The owner/manager has a core role in SME restructuring, supported by various internal and external stakeholders. It is not common for staff representatives to be involved, however, as the majority of SMEs have no formal staff representation structure. The research findings suggest that policymakers should consider improvements in the support services to SMEs, by offering more comprehensive packages, easier access through one-stop-shops, reframing eligibility criteria; and prioritising access to finance, and the anticipation of change within the company. An overview report, with an executive summary, national reports from all 27 EU Member States and a database with 85 company cases, are available on the Eurofound website.

Industrial relations in the EU at a glance Do you need to understand how industrial relations work in each of the EU Member States? Who are the main actors, how does social partnership operate in practice and what are the main issues on the collective bargaining agenda? Since 1996, Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) has provided a unique depth and breadth of information on industrial relations developments across Europe. EIRO’s set of industrial relations country profiles provide detailed information on the nuts and bolts of industrial relations in 34 European countries. Recently updated, the profiles include an overview of the main features, actors, processes and outcomes in each country. Speaking in Brussels on 11 April at the launch of the European Commission’s report on ‘Industrial relations in Europe in 2012’, Employment Commissioner László Andor said that there was ‘a clear need to revitalise industrial relations across Europe’ in light of the recent crisis. Eurofound contributed to the report with its research findings on industrial relations, as well as drafting the chapter on ‘Greening the social dialogue’.

Source: European Quality of Life Survey 2012 News in brief Social partners debate employment of older workers Boosting the employment rate of older workers is one of the cornerstones of the Europe 2020 Strategy. Eurofound has invited the social partners to discuss developments regarding active ageing policies within the context of the ongoing crisis at a lunch in Brussels on 23 April. The discussion will focus on the approaches at national or sectoral level taken by governments and social partners in order to keep older workers in the labour market, especially through the improvement of working conditions. Key to the discussions will be the forthcoming Eurofound report on the Role of governments and social partners in extending and improving the quality of working lives, and findings from the latest Eurofound research on sustainable work and workplace age management. Proceedings will be opened by Eurofound Deputy Director Erika Mezger while Eurofound research experts Oscar Vargas and John Hurley will introduce the debate. Fritz von Nordheim Nielsen from the Commission’s DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion will comment on Eurofound’s report during the event. Over 60% of construction jobs lost in Ireland Ireland’s relatively small and trade-dependent economy is highly globalised and open. It was severely affected by the 2008–2009 global recession and the massive construction and financial sector bust. Since 2008, over 60% of construction sector employment has disappeared and employment levels have shrunk by 15% overall. However, unemployment in Ireland – while high at over 14% – has stabilised since late 2011 and the Irish economy is currently experiencing output growth. Cost competitiveness has improved and Ireland still attracts both high levels of foreign direct investment and foreign human capital. This fact sheet from Eurofound’s European Monitoring Centre on Change describes recent developments in the Irish labour market, including the top restructuring events and the contrasting situations of the construction and IT sectors. Read the fact sheet Busy calendar of events for Eurofound The European Chemical Industry Social Partners Conference was held at Eurofound’s Raymond-Pierre Bodin Conference Centre on 10 April and Eurofound staff contributed to several sessions. Among the April schedule of other events with Eurofound input are the launch of the European Commission’s Industrial relations in Europe report (Budapest), the Irish Presidency conference on gender equality and Europe 2020 (Dublin), the Irish Presidency and EU-OSHA conference and best practice awards on occupational safety and health (Dublin), the Eurofound social partners lunch debate on ‘Keeping older workers in the labour market’ (see above) and Irish trade union SIPTU’s event on work innovation (Dublin) with ministerial and social partner involvement. In May, Eurofound will host the first session of the Foundation Seminar Series 2013, on the theme of ‘Promoting diversity at the workplace: a strategy for inclusion and competitiveness’. Industrial relations in the audiovisual sector The audiovisual sector in Europe includes a broad spectrum of activities: cinema, video and television programme production, sound recording and music publishing, television programming and broadcasting. While employment in the sector does not seem to have been unduly affected by the economic crisis, the workers are particularly subject to atypical work, part-time work and unsocial working time. In addition, there is a large share of self-employment in the sector. All this results in low levels of industrial relations, a high degree of fragmentation in employers’ representation and low union density rates. Consequently, collective bargaining coverage is highly polarised and weak in most countries. These are some of the findings contained in Eurofound’s latest ‘representativeness’ study on the audiovisual sector. The aim of the series of representativeness studies is to identify the relevant national and supranational social partner organisations in the field of industrial relations in selected sectors.

Promoting investment in social cohesion Social investment involves helping people to deal with life’s challenges, and so create a stronger, more resilient society. In a time of economic crisis, this is especially critical. For social investment to work, it needs to focus on those areas that make a real difference to people’s lives: childcare, education, training, active labour market policies and health services. In all these areas, even a small investment can yield long-term benefits. To boost social investment – and specifically address the risks of poverty and social exclusion, the European Commission launched the Social Investment Package in February last. On 2–3 May, the first Presidency conference to discuss the package will address the theme of ‘Investment, Innovation and Involvement’. Taking place in the Leuven Institute for Ireland in Europe, the event is jointly organised by the European Commission and the Irish EU Presidency, together with Eurofound. It will present the Package to a range of actors in the field of social investment, with a view to generating proposals for future joint actions to support its implementation. At the conference, Eurofound Director Juan Menéndez Valdés will co-chair a workshop on ‘What needs to be done to embed the social investment approach in our policies and programmes at EU and Member States level?’ More information about the package and the event	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-april-2013-0

EUROFOUND_UNK_0568	2013-04-11	UNK	Press release, 24 March 2009	Eurofound publishes its Second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS) Czechs rate the quality of their health care system and access to it on a par with countries of the former EU15 Czechs rate the quality of their health care system and access to it on a par with countries of the former EU15, well above many of the new EU Member States, according to the Second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS), carried out by Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU Agency. Czechs rate the quality of their transport system equally positively. The trust in political institutions among the Czech population is however among the lowest in Europe. The survey, to be launched under the Czech EU Presidency in Prague on 25 March, also reveals that Europeans are generally satisfied with their quality of life despite big variations between both levels of life satisfaction and happiness, especially among the 12 new EU Member States. Four out of five people (81%) across the European Union say that health is very important in determining their quality of life. On the state of their health, more than two out of three people (67%) rate their health as very good or good, one in four (24%) as fair, and one in ten (9%) as bad or very bad. More people in the 12 new EU Member States and the three candidate countries rate their health as ‘bad or very bad’, in particular the women in these countries. Reporting poor health is, not surprisingly, associated with increasing age: in the EU27, fewer than 2% of people aged between 18 and 34 years report bad health, as opposed to 18% of those aged 65 and over. The survey also reveals that a substantial number of Europeans have difficulty in accessing health care services. One in four (25%) report problems because they are too far from their doctor or hospital, while more than two in five (38%) experience delays in getting medical appointments and more than one in four (27%) have difficulty meeting the expense involved in seeing a doctor. Similarly, the survey reveals that family life is also key to quality of life with seven out of ten people in Europe (68.7%) saying a good family life is very important for quality of life. The survey shows that one in three people across the EU27 (30%) report that they are involved in childcare on a daily basis, with small differences between the NMS12 (33%) and the EU15 (29%). In terms of actual time spent, women report spending 33 hours per week, and men over 18 hours, in caring for and educating children. Women also report spending 18 hours per week cooking and doing housework, as against 10 hours per week for men. One in five (20%) in the EU15 feel that they do more than their fair share of housework, and somewhat less (18%) in the NMS12 and in the CC3 (17%). The perceived quality of society is another fundamental element of the multidimensional concept of quality of life. The dimensions of societal – and not only individual – well-being are emphasised in the Lisbon Strategy and are a focus of EU social policy. The political and economic impact of the two recent rounds of enlargement can be seen in the income distribution, trust in institutions and social relations. The level of trust in political institutions is lowest in Poland, Hungary, Lithuania and the Czech Republic among the 12 new EU Member States, and in Italy, Portugal and the UK among the EU15 countries. When asked to rate their level of trust in other people in their country on a scale from one to 10, people in the Nordic countries and the Netherlands express the highest levels of trust. People living in Cyprus express the lowest levels of trust, followed by the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). ‘The challenges arising from social exclusion, unemployment, an ageing population, changing family structures, new gender roles as well as EU enlargement have pushed quality of life issues to the fore in the EU policy debate,’ says Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director. ‘The European Quality of Life Survey documents not only living conditions and the economic circumstances of people in Europe, but also how they feel about them, and about the society in which they live.’ In the EQLS, social relations are examined in terms of tension between groups, as well as attitudes towards migrants. In the EU15, the survey shows that the highest levels of tension between men and women and between the young and the old are found in Luxembourg (23% and 25%), followed by Spain (20% and 19%) and Greece (18% and 21%). At the other end of the scale is Denmark (6% and 5%). Among the 12 new Member States, Hungary stands out in this area (20% and 30%), followed by Bulgaria, Cyprus and Malta. Enabling citizens to develop some balance between family life, personal commitments and working life has become central to the social policy debate. Still, almost half (48%) of citizens in paid employment in the EU27 say that, at least several times a month, they are too tired as a result of their work to do household jobs. The report shows that men and women in the EU27 struggle with work-life balance almost to the same extent. Some 22% of working men state that they are too tired several times a week to do household jobs, while 21% of women report the same problem. Meanwhile, 11% of men find it difficult several times a week to fulfil family responsibilities because of work, as do 10% of women. The survey shows clearly that people’s material conditions, standard of living and well-being strongly depend on income as well as the economic wealth of the country in which they live. According to the EQLS, about one in four households in the CC3 and one in five in the NMS12 were unable to pay their utility bills on time. These figures are considerably higher than for the EU15, where about one in 10 households were unable to pay their bills on time. ‘In this survey, we have face-to-face interviews with 35,000 people in 31 countries across Europe, which were carried out between November 2007 and February 2008,’ says Robert Anderson, Head of Unit, Living Conditions and Quality of Life team at Eurofound. ‘The survey offers a unique and timely insight into the multidimensional concept of quality of life in Europe and provides information about the standard of living and quality of life of Europeans which is essential for policymakers and interested groups whose aims are to seek improvements in that quality of life.’ The full report is available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef0902.htm The survey mapping tool, presenting the data from the report in an easily accessible format, is available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/qualityoflife/eqls/eqls2007/results.htm A resumé is available in all 22 official EU languages at www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef0852.htm A press pack on the Quality of Life Survey is available from http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/press/presspack/eqls2007/index.htm For further information, contact Måns Mårtensson, Press Officer, on email: mma@eurofound.europa.eu, or telephone: +353-1-204 3124 or mobile +353-876-593 507 Note to the editor The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) is a tripartite EU body, whose role is to provide key actors in social policymaking with findings, knowledge and advice drawn from comparative research.

Youth disengagement in Europe - what cost? Eurofound joined forces with the European Youth Forum in organising a seminar on youth disengagement in Brussels on 28 February, hosted by the European Parliament Intergroup on Youth. The focus of the discussion was Eurofound’s recent research on young people ‘not in employment, education or training’ (NEETs). Participating at the event, Eurofound Director Juan Menéndez-Valdés and Research Manager Massimiliano Mascherini emphasised the importance of policy initiatives for young people in Europe, particularly NEETs. Mr Menéndez-Valdés highlighted the high number of NEETs across Europe (7.5 million aged 15–24 and 3.4 million aged 25–29) and the costs of around €153 billion to the European economy. He pointed to the policy challenges in addressing the social disengagement of these young people, arguing that being NEET is not just a problem for the individual but for societies and economies too. On the same day, the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) reached political agreement on a ‘Youth Guarantee’ which will help integrate young people into the labour market. The debate on youth and social inclusion continued at another event held in Dublin on 11–13 March: the EU Youth Conference, a major event in the Irish EU Presidency programme.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-march-2013-0

EUROFOUND_UNK_0573	2013-03-15	UNK	Press release, 15 March 2013	Eurofound publishes its European Jobs Monitor 2013: A polarising crisis: higher paid jobs prove most resilient More than four years after the onset of the economic and social crisis, there are five million fewer people in work in the 27 European Union Member States. Eurofound’s second annual European Jobs Monitor report ‘Employment polarisation and job quality in the crisis’ finds that the destruction of employment during the crisis has been sharpest in mid-paying jobs, while sparing in large part jobs at either end of the wage distribution. Higher paid jobs in service sectors in particular have proved most resilient. New well-paid employment has come primarily in knowledge-intensive service sectors, such as ICT, business consultancy, health and education. During the peak period of the recession (2008–2009), employment growth in well-paid jobs was concentrated in predominantly publicly funded service sectors, principally health and education, but has shifted to private sector services more recently (2011-12). Some low-paid jobs have also increased employment – for example, cleaners and personal care workers in social work and residential care. In general, jobs in the lowest quintile have fared much better than those in the “shrinking middle”. The majority of construction and manufacturing jobs are near or just below median pay levels and these have suffered the brunt of employment losses. As these sectors are predominantly male, the aggregate impacts of the crisis have been very different for men and for women. Female job losses have been much more modest. Indeed, the recession can be seen as accelerating the catch-up process of women in the labour market, both in terms of employment numbers and access to higher layers of the employment structure. Women have increased their employment share, particularly in ‘mid-paid’ and ‘good’ jobs (those in the higher quintiles). In part, this has been because women are overrepresented in certain growing sectors such as health and underrepresented in declining sectors. But it also reflects higher levels of educational attainment by women at a time when qualifications are an even more important requisite for access to better quality jobs. An alarming illustration of the damage caused by the crisis to the prospects of younger, labour market entrants is that over the last year more of the net EU growth in well-paid, third-level graduate jobs was accounted for by those in the post-retirement age group (65+) than by workers under 30.

News in pictures  EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion László Andor (right) shares a platform with Eurofound Director Juan Menéndez-Valdés at Eurofound’s Foundation Forum – ‘Social and employment policies for a fair and competitive Europe’ – which took place in Dublin Castle on 14–15 February last. News in brief Committee of the Regions visits Eurofound Eurofound played host to participants of the two-day EU Committee of the Regions conference, ‘An agenda for new skills and jobs: Regions and cities contributing to training and active labour market policies’, which took place in Dublin on 28 February–1 March last. Organised in the framework of the Irish EU Presidency, the event explored the potential of local and regional authorities to improve education and training and respond to the need for more flexible careers, in line with Europe’s growth strategy. On the morning of 28 February, participants paid a visit to Eurofound, where they were welcomed by Director Juan Menéndez-Valdés. During the course of their visit, Research Managers John Hurley and Irene Mandl presented recent Eurofound research in the areas of shifts in job structure and restructuring at regional level post crisis respectively. Commission launches Social Investment Package The European Commission presented its ‘Social Investment Package: Towards social investment for growth and cohesion’ on 20 February 2013, to address the growing risk of poverty and social exclusion arising from the economic crisis. According to the Commission, investing in people will raise people’s standards of living, boost the economy and help the EU emerge from the crisis in a stronger position. The Commission stresses the need for Member States to invest in social policy, to improve the links between social assistance and activation, to address the needs of children through trans-generational policies, to strengthen skills and to spend EU funds – mainly the European Social Fund – more effectively. Much of Eurofound’s recent and current research is relevant to these topics, in particular the European Quality of Life Survey, and research into the issues of young people not in employment, education or training (NEETs), sustainable work and the ageing workforce, active inclusion measures and childcare and parenting support. Helping parents to help themselves One of the challenges of modern families is juggling working life with family and care responsibilities. Public measures to support parents can help to alleviate stress, provide practical assistance and bring parents together with people who are dealing with similar issues. Eurofound has analysed parental support measures in seven EU member states. These range from very practical help at early stages of child development (for example, encouraging breast feeding) to increasing parents’ self esteem and confidence through training and education. The report shows that there is a wide variety of approaches with regard to integration into other services, level of qualifications of staff, target groups and evaluation. It also emphasises the need to maintain these programmes during times of crisis, as this form of social investment will pay off later. Eurofound hosts high-level visitors Since the beginning of 2013, Eurofound has opened its doors to diverse visitors from around Europe. Swedish Minister of Employment Hillevi Engström visited Eurofound on 7 February, the visit culminating in an exchange of views on Eurofound’s added value for the EU and Swedish policy making. On 21 February, seven representatives of the Labour Relations Agency in Belfast met with research staff to discuss the impact of the crisis on working conditions and industrial relations. On 11 March, Deputy Director Erika Mezger delivered the welcome speech at a Public Hearing organised by the Single Market Observatory (SMO) of the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) at Eurofound’s Conference Centre. Finally, the EESC’s Communication Group held their annual meeting at Eurofound’s Conference Centre on 12–13 March at which Eurofound Director Juan Menéndez-Valdés welcomed the participants.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-march-2013-2

Crisis deepens wage polarisation Europe’s labour market has changed radically since the golden era of job expansion (1995–2007), when nearly 30 million jobs were added in that buoyant period. The Great Recession (2008–2010) and the stalled recovery in 2011–2012 have seen a net loss of five million jobs. This loss has been far from uniform, however. While the period was characterised by the large-scale destruction of mid-paid jobs, particularly in construction and manufacturing, at the same time the number of higher-paid jobs continued to grow, as well as the employment share of women, particularly in mid-paid and ‘good’ jobs. The polarisation of the jobs market in terms of wages was already known, but became much more pronounced in the recession. Eurofound’s new report, Employment polarisation and job quality in the crisis: European Jobs Monitor 2013, describes and analyses in detail the structural shifts in employment in European labour markets by wage distribution and sector/occupational category. It also sets out a new multidimensional measure of job quality, the non-pecuniary job quality index. This index is based on collecting information about a wide range of job attributes linked to workers’ well-being.

Impact of greening on job quality and quantity Much has been made of the potential for job creation as businesses adopt green practices in response to climate change. However, evidence from the latest Eurofound research suggests that these hopes may have been unduly optimistic. The findings indicate that while implementing green business practices seems to have redistributed jobs between sectors, it has had little impact on absolute employment levels. The reduction in public support as a result of the economic crisis has slowed down the pace of greening across industry in the EU. Case studies conducted as part of the research show that companies are finding it hard to balance the need to respond to climate change and the pressure to stay afloat in the crisis. They also show that in practice companies do not anticipate green change, but just manage it as the need arises. As for job quality, the study confirms that greening results in very few new occupational profiles but mostly stimulates the development of existing skill sets.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0578	2013-03-01	UNK	Press release, 28 February 2013	Involving young people in making the youth guarantee work (Dublin, Ireland) Today’s decision at the Council of Employment and Social Affairs Ministers EPSCO on the proposed Youth Guarantee Recommendation was welcomed by participants at the joint event between Eurofound and the European Youth Forum on ‘ Disengagement – what costs and what remedies?’, hosted by the European Parliament Intergroup on Youth. Member States should now put in place measures to ensure that young people up to age 25 receive a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of leaving school or becoming unemployed. During the debate, Eider Gardiazábal Rubial, Spanish MEP and chair of the Youth intergroup of the European Parliament, commented that ‘Eurofound’s report has shown that the cost of doing nothing to support young people not in employment, education or training is very significant: almost €153 billion, more than the Multi Financial Framework deal per annum, agreed in the EU Council for the next 7 years. We welcome the agreement in the Council on the youth guarantee and we will make sure that there is enough money in the next MFF to secure an effective implementation in all the EU countries.’ Peter Matjašič, President of the European Youth Forum, said ‘Youth unemployment is a huge cost to Europe, and in more ways than one. We are pleased to see that after the European Parliament and the European Commission, also Member States have realised that a Youth Guarantee is needed in Europe: we call now on Member States to quickly implement it and concretely build solid schemes to upskill and bring young people to the labour market.’ The panellists and participants welcomed in particular the ambitions in adopted Council Recommendation of consulting and involving young people in designing and further developing the Youth Guarantee scheme. ‘It is important to involve young people in job creation, and to understand what are the barriers prohibiting them fulfilling their ambitions,’ said Massimiliano Mascherini, Research Manager in charge of the NEETs research at Eurofound. ‘Member States should adapt good practices to their national context when thinking to the transferability of these policies,’ commented Juan Menéndez-Valdés, Eurofound’s Director. ‘The success of youth guarantees is highly dependent on other public policies in place, i.e. apprenticeships, traineeships. We cannot afford to lose a generation.’ For further information, contact; -          Måns Mårtensson, media manager, on email: mma@eurofound.europa.eu, telephone: +353-1-204 3124, or mobile: +353-876-593 507.  -          Letizia Gambini, European Youth Forum, Telephone: + 32-491-041 378, or email: press@youthforum.org NOTES TO THE EDITOR The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) is a tripartite EU Agency which provides social partners, governments and EU decision makers with relevant, timely and unbiased research results so that the lives of European citizens can be improved.

News in pictures Irish Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Enda Kenny and President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso at the launch of the European Year of Citizens at Dublin City Hall on 10 January 2013, at which senior Eurofound staff were present. News in brief Addressing the needs of vulnerable families Eurofound participated in an Irish Presidency conference on vulnerable families, co-organised by the Confederation of Family Organisations in the EU (COFACE) and the Irish Countrywomen’s Association (ICA), which took place in Dublin Castle on 4–5 February. The conference addressed the difficulties facing families struggling in the economic downturn and in a shrinking labour market. Debating the issues and challenges were NGOs, policymakers, public authorities and researchers. Eurofound Director Juan Menéndez-Valdés delivered one of the keynote speeches, while research Head Robert Anderson put forward possible solutions. Using recent Eurofound research on the topic, Research Officer Daniel Molinuevo made a presentation on ‘Access to parenting services for Roma and migrant families’. Debt crisis eases but challenges remain The debt crisis in the euro zone seems to have slowed down, but unemployment is still rising and the overall economic outlook for the EU remains poor, according to the latest issue of the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) Quarterly. More than 26 million Europeans were unemployed in November 2012, two million more compared to one year ago. Job losses are still more than two times higher than job gains, with internal restructuring accounting for almost 70% and closure for 18% of job losses. The periodical investigates how this negative trend plays out in Sweden, following on from impressive growth over the previous two years. It examines support measures offered by the government, social partners and NGOs in Ireland to enterprises undergoing restructuring. There is also a focus on the European print media, where falling circulation and technological changes are squeezing the sector. Download the newsletter Social partners exchange views on wages Wage-setting in Member States has come under pressure in recent times, due to recessionary brakes, austerity policies and growing unemployment. In February 2013, the European Employment Committee and DG Employment invited the European and national-level social partners to exchange views on current developments in the area. While the social partners were critical of the format and felt that the autonomy of the national level should be preserved, the meeting provided an opportunity to exchange positions and practices on wage developments, productivity and wage inequalities. Eurofound contributed to the debate with a paper analysing current developments and policy responses in Member States concerning collective bargaining and wage-setting, as well as the mechanisms for establishing mininum wages. It also touches briefly on the implications of the crisis for the so-called ‘working poor’. Read the Eurofound paper on this topic Youth disengagement and unemployment Eurofound is organising a seminar in conjunction with the European Youth Forum in the European Parliament on the issue of Youth Disengagement - what costs and what remedies?. Taking place in the European Parliament on 28 February, the seminar will analyse Eurofound’s October 2012 report on NEETs – young people ‘not in employment, education or training’. The report investigated the economic and social consequences of young people’s disengagement from the labour market and education. Targeted at policymakers, government representatives, social partners and youth groups, the seminar represents a unique opportunity for a broad public discussion on Eurofound’s findings on NEETs. The debate will address youth unemployment policy responses, in light of the the Youth Employment Package and the European Commission proposal for a Council Recommendation on Youth Guarantees.

Start-ups: Strong potential for growth and jobs Some new businesses go international rapidly after starting up. These ‘born global’ firms are seen as innovative and growth-oriented and therefore as having particularly strong potential for economic recovery and job creation. At the same time, born global businesses face extra challenges in addition to those confronting any new business. As well as business start-up and product development, they take on the costly and complex process of building international markets, which can place heavy demands on them in terms of management expertise, commitment and capital. Despite their potential, there has been relatively little research into born global businesses and how best to support them. Eurofound has addressed this knowledge gap with a study that aims to describe and raise awareness of born globals. It examines existing public support schemes for business start-up, innovation and internationalisation and how well these match the needs of born globals. The report also suggests how support schemes – at both national and European level – can better support these start-up businesses and help them to achieve their potential.

Four-year work programme gets under way Eurofound has begun to implement its new four-year work programme 2013–2016: From crisis to recovery: Better informed policies for a competitive and fair Europe. Over the next four years, Eurofound will focus on four priority areas where it aims to provide high-quality, timely and relevant knowledge to contribute to creating policies aimed at getting Europe ‘back on track’. Chosen to reflect the current policy challenges of coping with the crisis and working towards a competitive and fair Europe, these four priorities are: labour market participation, improving working conditions, developing industrial relations and improving standards of living. In addition, specific themes – youth, jobs growth, quality of life and public services, mobility and migration, and employment and care of older people – have been highlighted in order to cluster outputs and streamline communication. Through its Europe-wide surveys and observatories, case studies and action research, Eurofound will continue to monitor trends and developments in these areas, with the overall aim of contributing to the debate among its stakeholders and fulfilling the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0584	2013-02-08	UNK	Press release, 8 February 2013	Eurofound launches the fieldwork for its 3rd European Company Survey: Surveying how European workplaces have managed in the economic downturn (Dublin, Ireland) In 2009, more than 60% of employees in Europe were covered by a trade union or a works council at the workplace, according to the European Company Survey. At the same time, four out of five workplaces were found to have a good work climate. This week across 32 countries, Eurofound launches the fieldwork for the new edition of European Company Survey, aimed at providing insights to changes in workplace and human resource management practices, employee participation and social dialogue at the workplace, and performance, since the inset of the economic downturn. European companies play a crucial role in getting out of the crisis and in reaching the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy for sustainable, inclusive and smart growth. The European Company Survey (ECS) gives an overview of workplace practices and how they are negotiated in European establishments. It is based on the views of both managers and employee representatives, and it is designed to provide information on workplace practices to develop and evaluate socioeconomic policy. First carried out in 2004, and the second edition in 2009, the fieldwork for the third edition of the European Company Survey (3ECS) starts this week. The fieldwork will be carried out simultaneously in 32 countries (27 EU Member States and Croatia, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Iceland, Montenegro and Turkey), targeting 29,950 companies and establishments, ranging from 300 to 1650 depending on the size of the country. Interviews are carried out with a manager responsible for human resources and an employee representative at workplace level. The main focus of the 3ECS is work organisation, workplace innovation, employee participation and social dialogue. The survey will map a number of practices used in European workplaces, as well as how they are discussed and negotiated at workplace level as well as some of their outcomes. The questionnaire was prepared in cooperation with Eurofound's tripartite stakeholders and experts in the relevant fields. Information and research data from the Second European Company Survey (2ECS) are available.  More information on the third ECS. First results are anticipated at the end of the year.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0587	2013-01-16	UNK	Press release, 17 January 2013	Eurofound publishes new report on active inclusion of young people with health problems or disabilities: Active inclusion of young people furthest from the labour market (Dublin, Ireland) Young people with health problems or disabilities are currently being missed by both employment policy and practice. Eurofound argues in a new report on active inclusion of young people with health problems or disabilities that there is a need and opportunity to bring these young people into focus. There are good practices across the European Union, that include flexible benefits, promotion of better school-to-work transitions and taking a pathways-to-employment approach. However, until now public policies have not given enough support to implementation of this positive and pro-active approach. The report will be presented at a joint international conference with the Dutch Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment in The Hague, The Netherlands, on 17 January 2013. Nearly all Member States are experiencing with high levels of unemployment and economic inactivity amongst young people. Even before the onset of the crisis there were increasing numbers of young people with health problems or disability who very often due to mental health problems, in large numbers, were entering into disability or social assistance schemes A number of countries have been paying more attention to this group (including Norway, the UK, Denmark, Finland and most of all the Netherlands where the dramatic increase was quite evident because of a separate benefit scheme for youngsters). The social and economic disadvantages associated with ill-health or disability are reflected in the employment rates for persons with very severe and severe degrees of disability, currently at 20% and 44% respectively. In 2009, the  poverty for persons with disabilities which was 70% higher than average. The ongoing crisis makes the situation even more difficult. A range of policies are relevant to the situation of young people with health problems or disabilities. The most appropriate strategy seems to be 'active inclusion' with its emphasis on joined up actions across the pillars of flexible income support, inclusive labour market measures, access to social and health services and lifelong learning. This Eurofound study examines the situation of young people with health problems or disabilities in 11 countries (Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain and the United Kingdom) and at EU level. The main aim of the research is to examine how the policies have been implemented to move young people with health problems or disabilities from inactivity into employment. The report showcases 44 innovative case studies across the member states. The report identifies a trend towards dealing with the needs of people with health problems or disabilities in mainstream rather than specialist services. However the targeting of young people with disabilities or health problems by these measures varies considerably across the Member States. The good practice examples show hot to strengthen the integrated approach to skills development, training and job placement. The cases underline the value of rapid placement in a real job to ensure momentum is maintained. The role of mental health problems as a factor in the social as well as economic exclusion of the target group needs to be addressed more effectively. Finally some employers need support with the recruitment, acknowledgment and retention of staff with disabilities.

A conference jointly organised by Eurofound and the Dutch Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment, Welfare reform for active inclusion of young people with health problems or disabilities, will be held in The Hague on 16–17 January. Drawing extensively on Eurofound research, the conference will examine ways of integrating these young people into work using active inclusion policies and welfare reform.

The tool makes available the full data of this uniquely detailed picture of life in Europe, which features: responses for all 125 questions across the eight topics covered; results presented in an interactive map to give an overview of findings; separate breakdowns by age, gender and income. Information can be retrieved in alternative formats, such as bar chart, data table or data matrix. It is also possible to export high or low-resolution images, to download question data and to create bookmarks for easy retrieval of information captured. Use the SMT to explore EQLS findings Staying at work over the long term What are the conditions that make work sustainable over a lifetime and are therefore likely to promote a longer working life? Eurofound’s new report, Sustainable work and the ageing workforce, examines the factors that contribute to active ageing in employment and the underlying conditions conducive to job sustainability. Based on an analysis of Eurofound’s fifth European Working Conditions Survey, the findings highlight aspects such as job quality, self-evaluated health and workers’ attitudes to working beyond the age of 50. The report reveals that some factors that once protected older workers from exposure to painful working conditions are being eroded by demographic evolution and changes in work organisation, raising the policy need to address work organisation in the context of an ageing workforce.

Foundation Forum 2013 The fall-out of the ongoing economic crisis in Europe is becoming more apparent, resulting in growing inequalities between and within Member States, mass unemployment and economic insecurity. If we are to find a way towards recovery for the EU as a whole, Europe will have to find new approaches and solutions. Eurofound’s Foundation Forum will address the topic of ‘Social and employment policies for a fair and competitive Europe’. Taking place on 14–15 February in Dublin Castle, the event (the fifth in a series organised by Eurofound since 2002) is co-hosted by the Irish government, who will draw on their recent experience of Ireland in economic crisis. Policymakers, academics and opinion-formers will debate ways towards a more sustainable future. Topics include whether the economic crisis can trigger social structural change, how to achieve equitable sharing of the social costs and what future there is for the European Social Model. On the final day, Commissioner László Andor will present his vision on how social investment could offer a way out of the crisis.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0591	2012-11-28	UNK	Press release, 29 November 2012	Eurofound publishes its 3rd European Quality of Life Survey (3EQLS) ‘Quality of life in Europe: Impacts of the crisis' Declines of quality of life in all EU Member States, alarming levels in some, survey says (Dublin, Ireland) Declines of over 20% in levels of optimism and happiness are reported in some countries across the EU and over a third of people indicate a deterioration in their financial situation over the past five years. These results, from Eurofound's third European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) published today, largely reflect - with some interesting exceptions - the economic reality, with highest optimism levels reported in Denmark, Sweden and lowest levels in Greece, Italy, and Portugal. Trust in key public institutions, governments and parliaments has also fallen significantly across the European Union, with the largest declines obvious in those countries facing the most serious economic difficulties, such as Spain and Greece. The survey results paint a comprehensive picture of life experienced by Europe's citizens over the last five years of the economic crisis. Since the last survey in 2007, more people who had good income and were in good quality housing are now struggling with unemployment, debts, housing insecurity and access to services.  The survey also highlights that it is harder for many people to make ends meet: 7% report ‘great difficulty’ making ends meet, with large differences between Member States, ranging from 22% in Greece to 1% in Finland. When asked to whom they would turn to urgently borrow money, most Europeans (70%) would ask a member of their family or a relative for a loan. Another 12% would ask a friend, neighbour or someone else, while 8% would turn to a service provider or institution. One out of ten (10%) report they would not be able to ask anybody; this was particularly true among people in the lowest income quartile (15%). Overall, 8% of people in the EU have been unable to pay back informal loans according to schedule. In the EQLS, European citizens rate their life satisfaction at 7.1 on average on a scale from 1 to 10. Denmark still tops the scores in terms of life satisfaction and happiness while Bulgaria and Hungary report the lowest life satisfaction scores. There is no difference in life satisfaction levels between men and women, but those aged between 50-64 show lowest levels of satisfaction, as do people unable to work, the unemployed and single parents. Throughout, the role of the family remains important as a pillar of support.  People rating their health as ‘good’ or ‘very good’ have significantly higher life satisfaction and happiness than the average, and subjective well-being declines with worsening health status. Most Europeans say their health is good or very good (64%).

The European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) is an established tool for documenting and analysing quality of life in the EU. It explores issues pertinent to the lives of European citizens, such as employment, income, education, housing, family, health, work–life balance, life satisfaction and perceived quality of society. The survey measures resources and living conditions through objective and descriptive indicators but also consistently includes the subjective dimension ‘where people’s feelings are treated as paramount’.  Fieldwork for the 3rd European Quality of Life Survey in the 27 Member States took place from September 2011 to February 2012, with most interviews being completed in the last quarter of 2011.

Impacts of the crisis on EU citizens The economic impact of the recession that has hit the EU has been extensively analysed and discussed, but how has the life of European citizens been affected since its onset? How do people feel about their immediate surroundings and how optimistic are they about the future? Eurofound has just published the third edition of its European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS), in which 43,636 Europeans across 34 countries were questioned on a variety of topics pertaining to the quality of their life. While the findings show that overall EU life satisfaction levels have not changed much, optimism about the future and trust in institutions have declined markedly in the countries most affected by the downturn. Speaking at the conference in Brussels to launch the report on 29 November, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion László Andor declared that ‘the European Quality of Life Survey indicates that satisfaction with one’s personal situation remains higher than satisfaction with the quality of society or the local environment. EU policies should take this into account and pay particular attention to strengthening governance and empowering local communities.’ The full report, summary video and Eurofound’s innovative survey mapping tool are available	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-november-december-2012
EUROFOUND_UNK_0594	2012-11-06	UNK	Press release, 6 November 2012	Eurofound launches its 2012 Report from the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM): After restructuring: labour markets, working conditions and life satisfaction New EU-wide restructuring report reveals wide variations in consequences across country, sector, employees (Dublin, Ireland) High levels of restructuring activities across the European Union have resulted in five million fewer jobs in 2012 compared to 2008, according to the 2012 report from the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM). With just over a third (37%) of EU27 employees reporting that restructuring occurred at their workplace in the previous three years, the report also looks at the consequences of restructuring for the individual employee. The report, which is a unique source of EU-wide information on reported restructuring developments, is launched at the European Parliament today, aimed at contributing to discussions on the future of the European Globalisation Fund. At a macro level, the report shows that while announced job loss from restructuring has fallen from the high levels experienced at the start of the economic crisis, overall there are still more cases of announced job loss than job gain reported in the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM). The consequences however, have varied hugely across Member States, with Ireland shedding a significant 16% of its pre-recession employment, Luxembourg adding a similar percentage of new jobs and larger countries such as Austria, Poland and Germany, employment actually showing modest growth since 2008. Employment in the manufacturing sector suffered the largest job loss accounting for nearly four million jobs, while three million jobs were lost in the construction sector between 2008 and 2012 Change in employment levels in these sectors showed a -17.3% decrease in the construction sector and a 10.6% decline in manufacturing, followed by agriculture, forestry and fishing (-5.9%) and wholesale and retail (-3.8%). The main employment-shedding subsectors within manufacturing were textiles, mainly in Italy and Poland; in basic metals, mainly in the UK and Spain; and wood/paper production mainly Spain and France. The pharmaceutical sector was the only manufacturing subsector to grow. The report also provides a comprehensive analysis of the consequences of restructuring for the individual employee. It focuses specifically on which employees lost their job at the onset of the crisis, which of them found a new job and the implications of this for their life satisfaction, and what effects restructuring have on people that remain in their jobs. It found that having long tenure protects against job loss, but long-tenured workers who lose their job are less likely to find a new one. ‘One significant finding is that those who are most at risk of losing a job are those who have the least chance of finding a new one. These tend to be people with serious health problems, from a minority group and of lower professional status,’ says Donald Storrie, Eurofound’s expert on restructuring. ‘As restructuring hits already vulnerable groups in these two respects, it suggests that policy efforts should focus more on how to protect these employees during restructuring and target them for more intensive labour market policy measures.’ According to the report, the ‘stayers’ - those who remain in jobs- are most likely to be in higher occupational groups and working in larger establishments, as well as employees working in traditionally state-funded sectors. In addition, the research reveals that restructured workplaces are more likely to offer higher levels of employee autonomy, more access to training, a higher incidence of teamwork, and employees having greater influence and involvement in how work is organised - the hallmarks of high performance work systems.

Eurofound gears up for the Irish Presidency Eurofound is getting ready for the 1 January kick-off date when Ireland takes over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. Ireland’s seventh EU Presidency coincides with the 40th anniversary of its membership of the European Union. Eurofound plans to contribute through its research and findings to the main issues and priorities of the Presidency, particularly in the areas of stimulating employment and growth and tackling youth unemployment. In addition, during the six-month period, Eurofound will open its conference centre to a series of Presidency meetings. In the first quarter, Eurofound will liaise on the meetings of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) on 7–8 February, the Commission’s Social Protection Committee (SPC) on 7–8 March and Employment Committee (EMCO) on 11–12 March. In April, Eurofound’s work on working conditions and gender, notably its fifth European Working Conditions Survey, will be relevant to the debate at two Presidency events: on occupational safety and health and on gender equality. Events in May and June include a European Social Fund event to be held at Eurofound’s premises (22–23 May) and a meeting of the heads of EU Public Employment Services (20–21 June).  	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-november-december-2012-1

News in pictures Eurofound research manager Tadas Leončikas speaking at the conference in Brussels on 29 November to launch the findings of Eurofound’s third European Quality of Life Survey.       News in brief Innovation in the workplace Changes in work organisation practices and innovative forms of work formed the basis of discussions at a seminar in Brussels on 30 November entitled: ‘Boosting Europe: Innovative work practices can make it happen!’ Organised jointly by the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) and Eurofound, the seminar highlighted Eurofound’s recent research into innovative work practices. According to the EESC, innovation at the workplace can be used to remodel organisational activities in a sustainable way while at the same time improving both productivity and the quality of work. At the seminar, Eurofound’s study on workplace innovation – Work organisation and innovation – based on extensive desk research and a comparative analysis of 13 company case studies, was launched. The audience of 100+ included social partners, MEPs, experts and government representatives. Download the report Trend of retirees heading back to work Increasing numbers of retirees in the EU are taking up paid work – and many more would like to work if they could find suitable employment. In 2011, just over 10% of people aged 65–69 years were employed. It appears that most retirees work not out of financial need but because they find the work fulfilling. However, the pay of those retirees in employment makes up half of their income on average. A Eurofound report just published explores why Europeans go back to work or why they continue to work beyond the statutory retirement age in their countries, and what sorts of opportunities are available to them. It suggests that removing barriers to employment for retirees who want to work could contribute to the sustainability of pension systems. Read the report Income from work after retirement in the EU Foundation Forum 2013 takes shape  Preparations are well underway for Eurofound’s fifth Forum which will take place in Dublin Castle from 14–15 February 2013 under the banner of ‘Social and Employment Policies for a Fair and Competitive Europe’. The Foundation Forum, which takes place at four-year intervals, is recognised as Eurofound’s ‘flagship’ event. With Ireland’s EU Presidency adding an extra dimension this time around, the Forum aims to provide a high-level platform for debate and discussion of key social policy issues facing Member States. As in previous years, the participants – including leading decision-makers and opinion-formers – will address the most pressing issues in the social and employment arena to arrive at original, workable solutions that could contribute to the policymaking process. From visions to actions: Close of European Year 2012 Eurofound will take part fully in the closing conference of the European Year of Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations, which also marks the end of the Cyprus Presidency of the European Union. Organised by the Cyprus Social Welfare Services of the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance, with the support of the European Commission (DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion), the event aims to celebrate the main achievements of the Year; provide a forum for discussion on ways to press ahead with the momentum gained to develop concrete actions; enhance the commitment from key EU and national actors for political measures that are necessary for all generations; and identify good practices related to current policy reforms. Eurofound Research Manager Agnès Parent-Thirion will make a presentation on ‘Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations’, based on data from the fifth European Working Conditions Survey and the third European Quality of Life Survey.

Five million fewer people are in paid employment in 2012 compared to 2008 – a multi-year contraction of employment levels unprecedented in recent history. Large-scale restructuring in Member States is a central element in the canvas. At a Working Lunch, sponsored by MEPs Marian Harkin and Alejandro Cercas, that takes place in Brussels on 6 November, over 20 MEPs from different political groups and committees will join Eurofound’s director and researchers to debate and exchange views on the issue of what impact recent job loss and restructuring has for employees, both those who lose their job and those who remain at the restructured company. The event will provide an opportunity to present findings from Eurofound’s European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) Annual report 2011, entitled After restructuring: Labour markets, working conditions and life satisfaction. As well as examining the effects that job loss and subsequent re-employment at the onset of the crisis has had on employees’ overall personal situation and sense of life satisfaction, the report also explores the impact on working conditions for the employees who continue to work at the restructured company. Working time and productivity: a complex relationship Companies in search of improved productivity use a wide range of approaches, from financial incentives and skills upgrading and training to increased autonomy of individuals and teams. Working time flexibility has the added advantage in that it can benefit both workers and employers: it gives workers more control over their work–life balance and allows companies to adjust more easily to changing economic circumstances. Eurofound research studied five companies in manufacturing and retail in Belgium, Hungary and the Netherlands. It found that national and sectoral factors play a big role in determining the use of certain types of flexibility. However, there is evidence that introducing new working time arrangements can improve productivity if it is well-planned, properly negotiated and in line with other company policies. Read the recently published report, Organisation of working time: Implications for productivity and working conditions Exchange of best practices on the gender pay gap Eurofound will contribute its research and findings at the forthcoming tripartite Cyprus EU Presidency event in Limassol on 29 and 30 October, organised by the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance. One of the aims of the conference is to highlight practices and measures that enterprises could implement in order to eliminate the gender pay gap and promote the principle of equal pay. Eurofound research officer Christine Aumayr-Pintar will focus on recent policy developments in Austria with regard to creating income transparency as one means of reducing the gender pay gap, while Isabella Biletta will present findings from the fifth European Working Conditions Survey to show the impact of occupational segregation on female and male workers. More information on the event Employment and social dialogue in the Horeca sector With employment levels in decline across all Member States and most sectors since the onset of the economic recession, one sector which has seen some employment growth in recent times is the Hotel, restaurant and catering (Horeca) sector: 200,000 new jobs were created in the sector between 2008 and 2010, mainly in the food and beverage division. Eurofound’s newly published report examines the economic background of the sector and explores the representation of social partner organisations and levels of social dialogue at both national and European level for each Member State. The report finds that as the Horeca sector employs many young people (about 60% of the total was under the age of 39 years in 2010), it therefore represents an important vehicle of labour market entry for young job-seekers. Other aspects that set the sector apart from other industries is that there is a large female workforce (55% of the total), employment is often part time (one third of all workers) and there is a high seasonal element, given its links to tourism.

Policy focus on youth unemployment The immediate future of Europe depends on the 94 million Europeans aged 15–29 years. With mounting unemployment levels across the EU, the greatest urgency is with the 14 million young people currently ‘not in employment, education or training’: the so-called NEETs. Eurofound launched its latest comparative research findings on NEETs at the EU Presidency conference on employment priorities in Nicosia, Cyprus, on 22–23 October 2012. Young people in Europe have been hit particularly hard by the recession. Only 34% of persons were employed in 2011, the lowest figure ever recorded. Serious as these statistics may be, they do not adequately capture the situation of young people: 7.5 million of persons aged 15–24 and an additional 6.5 million aged 25–29 were not in employment, education or training. Eurofound estimates that the economic loss due to the disengagement of young people from the labour market is €153 billion (2011 data), which corresponds to 1.2% of European GDP. At the high-level Cyprus event, Eurofound Research Manager Massimiliano Mascherini presented the latest findings on NEETs while Research Manager Robert Anderson made a presentation on European best practices in activation measures. Publication of the study is timely, in light of the forthcoming Youth employment package to be adopted by the Commission on 5 December.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0601	2012-10-19	UNK	Press release, 22 October 2012	Eurofound contributes to EU Presidency conference on ‘Developing sustainable youth employment policies in an era of fiscal constraints’ 22-23 October 2012: Economic cost of Europe’s youth not in employment, education or training estimated at over €150 billion (Dublin, Ireland) With unemployment levels for young people at unprecedented levels across the EU, a new report published today by Eurofound reveals how the greatest urgency lies with the 14 million young people currently not in employment, education or training (NEETs). Eurofound’s latest comparative research findings on NEETs show that the economic loss to society of not integrating NEETs is estimated at €153 billion, in addition to the inestimable costs for their disengagement from society in general. The report’s findings will be presented for the first time in full at the EU Presidency Conference on Employment Priorities in Nicosia, Cyprus, on 'Developing sustainable youth employment policies in an era of fiscal constraints'. Young people in Europe have been hit particularly hard by the recession. Only 33.6% were employed in 2011, the lowest figure ever recorded. The unemployment figures also testify to an appreciably more difficult labour market for young people; since the start of the recession, youth unemployment has risen by 1.5 million, reaching 5.5 million (or 21%) in 2011. Serious as these statistics may be, they do not adequately capture the situation of young people. Some 7.5 million young people aged 15–24 and an additional 6.5 million young people aged 25–29 were not in employment, education or training. Alarming is not only the amount of people affected, but also the significant increase over time: in 2008, the figure stood at 11% of 15–24 year olds and 13% of 25–29 year olds. By 2011, these had increased to 13% and 15% respectively. There are also huge variations between countries, with rates for 15-24 year olds varying from around 7% in Luxembourg and The Netherlands to above 17% in Bulgaria, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Romania and Spain. Some young people are at greater risk of being NEET than others. Those with low levels of education are three times more likely to be NEET compared to those with tertiary education, while young people with an immigration background are 70% more likely to become NEET than nationals. Young people suffering from some kind of disability or health issues are 40% more likely to be NEET than those in good health. Being NEET has a negative effect on the individual as well as on society as a whole. Eurofound estimated that, in 2011 figures, the economic loss due to the disengagement of young people from the labour market was €153 billion. This is a conservative estimate and it corresponds to 1.2% of European GDP. There are, again, great variations between countries, but Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia and Poland are paying an especially high price of 2% or more of GDP Moreover, NEETs are at higher risk of being politically and socially alienated. Eurofound discovered that in comparison with their non-NEET counterparts, NEETs have a dramatically lower level of political interest, political and social engagement, and a lower level of trust. This is in particularly true for NEETs in the English-speaking, and continental and east European countries. However, NEETs in Mediterranean countries seem to have a higher political engagement, with large numbers of young people occupied in the same issues. However, common for all is that they did not identify with the main actors of the political area. EU Member States have in recent years been actively engaged in designing and implementing measures aimed at re-integrating young people into labour market. Policies that have been implemented to date are very diverse in their aims, objectives and activities. Eurofound argues that young people have to be set on a long-term, sustainable pathway, and that youth employment measures should be client-centred, not provider-focused. They need good-quality, stable and sustainable employment. This includes equipping them with qualifications needed for successful labour market integration.

Key role for social partners in Europe’s future Closer social partner cooperation and clearer roles for policymakers representing the interests of workers, employers and governments, in creating tomorrow’s labour market, were the aims outlined out by László Andor, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, during his visit to Eurofound on Monday 1 October. The Commissioner marked the International Day of Older Persons with a visit to Dublin to give the keynote speech at the 'Third Age' conference. This was followed by a visit to Eurofound, where he had bilateral talks with Lucinda Creighton, Irish Minister of State for European Affairs, and Eurofound Director Juan Menéndez-Valdés. Addressing invited representatives of Irish workers and employers later, the EU Commissioner emphasised that progress of EU integration is not only about the development of a banking union, but that social pillars have to be included in the process as well. The event provided an opportunity for Eurofound to present its latest findings from the third European Quality of Life Survey (to be launched next month in Brussels), as well as on NEETs – 'Young people not in employment, education or training'. 'Social dialogue is clearly a key to this new model of EU governance that Commissioner Andor proposes and Eurofound is happy to contribute to the making of this,' commented Mr Menéndez-Valdés after the visit.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0603	2012-10-12	UNK	Press release, 19 September 2012	Eurofound publishes its annual update on pay developments in Europe 2011: Agreed pay increases not enough to maintain purchasing power in Europe (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Workers in the Czech Republic and Sweden saw their average collectively agreed pay increase, in real terms, during 2011, according to the latest Eurofound annual update on pay developments in Europe, while workers in all other countries saw their pay reduced in real terms. The pay reductions were primarily due to inflation, since the growth in consumer prices outpaced the collectively agreed pay increases in almost all countries. The gender pay gap remains wide across all countries. Wage setting is at the core of industrial relations in all EU Member States and Norway, and within the context of the economic crisis, the debate on wage levels and wage setting mechanisms is back at the top of the agenda. A considerable decline in real pay rates across almost all countries and sectors was visible in last year’s edition of Eurofound’s annual update on pay developments. From the 13 European countries that are covered in the report, Slovakia experienced the highest nominal collectively agreed pay increase (3.7%), followed by the Czech Republic (2.9%). The agreed increases in Austria, Belgium, Germany, France, Netherlands,  Slovakia, Spain and the United Kingdom were higher in 2011 than in 2010. Belgium registered the highest increase from 0.6%, in 2010, to 2.6%, in 2011. In the Czech Republic, Italy, Sweden, Malta and Portugal, agreed nominal pay was lower in 2011 than in 2010. Taking the evolution of prices into account, reflecting real pay increases, Sweden (0.9%) and the Czech Republic (0.8%) top the 2011 comparison. At the other end of the scale, the UK (-2.6%) experienced the highest decrease of collectively agreed pay in real terms, followed by Malta (-2.2%) and Portugal (-2%). The changes in collectively agreed pay increases in real terms were, however, considerably lower in 2011 compared to 2010, with most countries presenting negative figures. The report also examines collectively agreed pay increases in three sectors, manufacturing (chemicals), services (retail) and the public sector (civil service), respectively. The agreed pay increases in the chemicals sector ranged from 0.5% in Malta up to 16.7% in Slovenia. The majority of countries, where data on collectively agreed pay increases are available, registered higher increases in 2011 than in 2010. In retail, the agreed pay increases ranged from a minimum of 0.7% in Malta up to a maximum of 6% in Hungary. In the vast majority of countries with data available, the pay increase in the civil service was lower than the average collective agreed pay increase for the whole economy. Sweden was the only exception with an increase slightly higher in the civil service. In effect, Cyprus, Estonia, France, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain and the UK registered nominal wage freezes for civil servants, whereas the ‘agreed’ increases for civil servants in the rest of the countries were considerably lower than the national averages. In 2011, there were changes to the levels of statutory minimum wage in 15 of the 20 countries with such provision. In Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, Ireland and Lithuania, the levels remained the same. In Greece, Netherlands, Slovenia and Spain, some relatively moderate increases compared to other countries were registered. Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Sweden and Norway do not have statutory minimum wages set at national level. There were no significant changes to the specific national minimum wage rates for younger workers (almost always lower than the respective full adult rates) provided in some member states.

Eurofound and the Cyprus Presidency During the six-month Cyprus EU Presidency, which kicked off on 1 July, Eurofound is committed to working with the Cypriot government to bring its latest research findings, data and recommendations to European policymakers. Adopting the slogan ‘Towards a Better Europe’, the Cyprus Presidency aims to make the European Union more relevant to its citizens and to the world, by working to achieve sustainable growth, social cohesion and job creation through efficient and integrated policies. Eurofound can contribute to these goals through its work on job creation (daily updating of its restructuring events database and the European Jobs Monitor), youth and employment (specifically its recent findings on young people not in employment, education or training – NEETS), and social cohesion (recent research on the active inclusion of young people with disabilities or health problems). It can also provide insights into developments at EU, national and company level relating to sustainable employment, the gender pay gap, work and care, and the ageing workforce. Furthermore, Eurofound’s resource pack on active ageing provides a timely contribution to the ongoing policy debates during the 2012 Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations.  	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-september-2012-0
EUROFOUND_UNK_0605	2012-10-02	UNK	Press release, 2 October 2012	Clearer role for social partners in building tomorrow’s Europe (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Closer social partner collaboration and clearer roles for policymakers representing the interests of workers, employers and governments, in creating tomorrow’s labour market, were the ambitions outlined out by Laszlo Andor, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, during his visit to Eurofound on Monday 1 October.  On the International Day of Older Persons 1 October, Làszló Andor, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, visited Dublin to attend the ‘Third Age’ conference together with Juan Menéndez-Valdés, Eurofound’s Director. The presentation to the conference in Dublin was followed by a visit to Eurofound. The visit to Eurofound was an opportunity for Lucinda Creighton, Irish Minister of State for European Affairs to meet for bilateral discussions with the Commissioner and Eurofound’s Director. Addressing representatives of Irish workers and employers in additional bilateral discussions, the EU Commissioner emphasised that progress of EU integration cannot only be about the development of a banking union, but that social pillars have to be included in the process as well. David Begg, General Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), and Brendan McGinty, Director, and Eamonn McCoy, of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation (IBEC) were told during the meeting that social partners ought to be given a clearer role in the political governance of Europe in the future. ‘Social dialogue is clearly a key to this new model of EU governance that Commissioner Andor proposes, giving the social partners a relevant role in the process.  Eurofound is happy to contribute to the making of this,’ commented Juan Menéndez-Valdés, Eurofound’s Director, after the visit.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0606	2012-10-18	UNK	Press release, 18 October 2012	Eurofound contributes to EU Presidency conference on children’s well-being: Investment in good childcare and parenting support services required to offset rising child poverty and social exclusion in EU The social consequences of austerity measures across Europe have had a proportionally more negative impact on the most vulnerable groups in society, resulting in growing forms of child poverty and social exclusion. The Cyprus EU Presidency is addressing these issues at the conference on ‘Investing in Children: Preventing and Tackling Child Poverty and Social Exclusion, Promoting Children’s Well-Being’ in Nicosia, Cyprus, on 18-19 October 2012. It argues that more investment in children is needed and remains feasible as long as it is recognized as a priority and mainstreamed into all policy areas. The ultimate aim is to generate a dynamic political commitment for the actions ahead. Eurofound is contributing to this event with research findings from projects that have looked at employment developments in childcare services for school-age children, company initiatives for workers with care responsibilities for disabled children or adults, and parenting support in Europe. Robert Anderson, Eurofound’s expert on quality of life, will also provide a snapshot of what people say about family life and work life balance, and accessibility and quality of services, in a preview of the first findings of the new Third European Quality of Life Survey, the results from which will be launched at the end of November. The debate about work–life balance and the well-being of children has to date focused on issues such as childcare services, flexible work arrangements and child allowances. It is only recently, however, that parenting support and education have come to be viewed as a social investment that contributes towards reducing parental stress and helping parents to successfully manage work and family commitments. Good parenting skills have a highly positive impact on the physical, emotional and intellectual development of children. As part of its ongoing research on families and working life, Eurofound found that defining clearly what constitutes parenting support, its boundaries and goals is crucial for the successful delivery of services. As parenting support touches on a number of areas such as health, education and social welfare, it is necessary to establish clear guidelines about the role of services in order to avoid gaps and overlaps in provision. Eurofound’s most recent work found that almost one in ten (8%) have used, or someone close to them has used, childcare services over the past 12 months. Looking at what is preventing people from accessing childcare services, almost six out of ten people say that cost and availability are the main obstacles. Distance or opening hours are preventing one in four (41%), while more than one quarter (27%) claim that the lack of quality services is their biggest challenge to accessing childcare services. The research shows big differences between countries. The proportion of people reporting difficulties in accessing childcare services are among the highest on all counts in Greece, and costs were identified as a problem for people especially in Malta and the United Kingdom. Availability is especially an issue in some countries but the lack of services is evidently widespread. Eurofound has also studied employment developments in childcare services for school-age children as a way to improve quality and address the lack of initiatives designed to increase and support employment in the sector.

Work prospects for young people in Europe The latest issue of Foundation Focus – Youth in Europe: Best days of their lives? – looks at the situation of young people in Europe, focusing on how they have been affected by the current economic crisis. Youth unemployment rates have reached unprecedented levels across Europe, with all Member States (except Luxembourg) experiencing sharp growth in youth unemployment figures since the onset of the recession.The growth of the NEETs cohort (those ‘not in employment, education or training’) is testament to this. Several initiatives have been put in place by Member States to tackle the situation, but with mixed results so far. Migration is an option, but does it help in the long run? And what about the working conditions of those who have a job? How easy is it to gain work experience and find training to move into more stable, permanent employment? Eurofound presents its latest research in articles on such topics as job creation initiatives, job quality, active inclusion policies for young people with disabilities, job mobility and sustainable working conditions, as well an interviewwith Luca Scarpiello from the European Youth Forum.

Eurofound will contribute its latest research on active ageing at the event, which will outline priorities for the coming five years for improving the quality of life of people of all ages.   News in brief Eurofound at Jobs 4 Europe conference Eurofound contributed its knowledge and expertise at the high-level conference on employment policy – ‘Jobs for Europe’ – organised by the Commission in Brussels on 6–7 September last. The objective of the conference was to stimulate the drive for strong employment policies as tools for ensuring recovery in Europe. Eurofound Director Juan Menéndez-Valdés chaired the session on ‘Active ageing – The labour market dimension’ while research expert Robert Anderson participated in the session on ‘Barriers to women’s employment and work–life balance’. The event built on the Commission’s 2012 initiatives – the Employment Package and the European Semester – and conferences organised during 2011 to explore new dimensions of employment policy, in particular the functioning of European labour markets, wage developments, flexicurity in a crisis context, and inequalities. Key speakers included Commission President, José Manuel Barroso, President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy and Director-General of the ILO, Guy Ryder. Read about this event Constructing an EU gender equality index Eurofound has agreed to collaborate with the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) in the development of a European gender index. This was the outcome of a visit by EIGE Director, Virginija Langbakk, Acting Head of Operations, Jolanta Reingarde and Communications Assistant, Christian Veske to Eurofound on 3 September last. Eurofound will make relevant data from its three surveys available to the agency, as well as specific gender analysis and comparative overviews. EIGE is one of five EU agencies to have signed a memorandum of understanding with Eurofound. During the meeting, both parties discussed the draft work programmes of the two EU agencies for the coming year. EIGE’s visit to Ireland included meetings with the Irish government on its EU priorities and the Irish social partners. Read about EIGE’s gender quality index Measuring job quality in Europe over 20 years Levels of job quality across the EU have remained constant over the past two decades – a finding that is startling given the extent of technological and organisational change over the same period, not to mention the several EU-level directives aimed at improving it. The new study Trends in Job Quality in Europe, based on analysing the findings of the 5th European Working Conditions Survey, constructed four indices to assess quality: earnings, ‘prospects’, intrinsic job quality and working time quality. It found that 14% of jobs in Europe are ‘high-paid’ good jobs; 37% are ‘well-balanced’ good jobs; 29% are ‘poorly balanced’ jobs; and 20% are ‘poor quality’ jobs. The report also found wide variations in job quality across industries, with the information and communication and finance and insurance sectors coming out tops in quality ratings across all indicators.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0611	2012-08-16	UNK	Press release, 16 August 2012	Eurofound publishes its Annual Update on working time developments in the European Union 2011: Gap between agreed and actual working time across the EU remains wide (DUBLIN, IRELAND) The actual working week for full time workers stood at 39.7 hours across the 27 EU Member States in 2011, according to Eurofound's latest annual update of working time developments, an average of 1.6 hours more than the agreed working hours. This comprises, nevertheless, a widening of the gap between agreed and actual working hours in the EU15, but a narrowing in the Member States that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007. Men continue to work longer hours than women on paid work - on average 2.1 hours more per week. The difference between countries at either end of the spectrum of leave entitlements in the EU remains huge at almost two and a half working weeks. Eurofound's annual update on working time developments looks at a number of issues related to the time spent at work across all Member States of the European Union and Norway. The report provides a comparative overview of the present state of play and recent developments. Collective bargaining continues to play an important role in determining the duration of working time in most of the EU27 countries, though to a lesser or sometimes negligible extent in some of the Member States that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 (NMS). Collective agreements set the working time conditions for an average of three quarters of all workers across the European Union, with large differences between countries. The relationship between bargaining and legislative provisions on working time continues to vary between countries. In 2011, average collective agreed weekly working time in the European Union stood at 38.1 hours. The only reported changes in comparison to 2010 took place in Slovakia and Spain. France remains the country with the shortest average collectively agreed working week at 35.6 hours. The Nordic countries, together with the UK and the Netherlands, continued to register an average agreed normal working week below the EU15 average of 37.6 hours in 2011. In most of the NMS there is a uniform 40-hour working week, which corresponds in general to the statutory normal week in those countries. This is the case in Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania and Slovenia. The report also examines working time developments in detail in three sectors – chemicals, retail and civil service. The retail sector recorded the longest average agreed normal working week with 38.3 hours, followed by the chemicals sector with 37.9 hours and the civil service with 37.6 hours. The largest difference between the NMS and the EU15 countries can be found in the civil service sector, in which the normal agreed working week in the former group of countries is three hours longer than in the older Member States. The gap is 2.1 hours in the chemical and retail sectors. In the EU27, the actual working week was 39.7 hours in 2011, 1.6 hours more than the agreed working hours. Across the 27 EU Member States, full-time employees in Romania worked the longest actual weekly hours in their main jobs in 2011 – 41.3 hours, the same as in 2010. They were followed by employees in Luxembourg (40.7), Germany (40.6), Estonia and the UK (both 40.5), Austria and Bulgaria (both 40.3), and the Czech Republic and Poland (both 40.2). Employees in Finland worked the shortest hours (37.8). This was 3.5 hours less than their counterparts in Romania or 4.5 weeks of work in Romania in a full year. Actual weekly hours worked by full-time employees were longer than the average normal collectively agreed working week in 21 of the 28 countries covered in the report. The 2011 data shows a widening of the gap between agreed and actual hours in the EU15 countries, while it narrowed in the NMS. Ten of the 12 NMS had actual weekly working hours at or above the EU27 average of 39.7 hours, compared with only seven of the EU15 countries. Only Slovakia and Malta had an actual working week that was slightly shorter than the EU27 average (39.6 hours). In the EU15, the longest actual full-time hours were worked in Luxembourg (40.7), Germany (40.6) and the UK (40.5), and the shortest in Finland (37.8), France (38.1) and Ireland (38.2). In 2011, actual weekly hours worked by male full-time employees in their main jobs continued to exceed those of their female counterparts in all Member States. Across the EU27, men worked on average 2.1 hours more per week than women. The gap is wider in the EU15 than in the NMS. In the EU15, men work 2.3 hours more per week than women do; whereas, in the NMS, men work around 1.6 hours more. The combined total of agreed annual leave and public holidays varied in the EU from 40 days in Germany to 27 days in Hungary and Romania – a difference of around 48% or 2.5 working weeks in a year. Other notably high-leave countries in 2011 included Italy and Denmark (with 39 leave days in total), while other notably low-leave countries included Estonia with 28 days, Poland with 29 days, and Belgium, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia with 30 days. The average figure for the EU27 was 34.2 days – 35.9 days in the EU15 and 29.4 days in the NMS.

MEPs join debate on wages in the crisis The recession has put increased pressure on wages and working conditions in many EU countries. At a working lunch in Brussels on 10 July, a group of 18 MEPs and 4 European social partner representatives joined Eurofound’s director and staff to debate the evolution of wages in Europe in recent years. The event provided an opportunity for Eurofound to present findings from its latest report, Wages and working conditions in the crisis. The report reveals that the crisis of 2008–2010 has impacted on pay in most Member States, leading to wage deceleration, pay freezes and sometimes pay cuts. Low-skilled, young and migrant workers have been hit particularly hard. The report provides an overview of the main trends in the evolution of wages and the relationship between wages and other working conditions across the EU27 and Norway during the crisis. In summing up the event, Pervenche Berès, chair of the Parliament’s Employment and Social Affairs Committee, remarked, ‘the results of the report did not come as a huge surprise. However, they show that policymakers should focus on helping the vulnerable groups most affected during the crisis.’ Read the full report	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-july-2012-0

Snapshot of Europe in 2011 Eurofound’s 2011 Yearbook, Living and Working in Europe, brings together highlights from Eurofound’s research published in 2011. It provides a snapshot of the quality of work and life in Europe, amidst the euro currency crisis and attendant economic gloom. The scope of the Yearbook’s review is broad, ranging from the challenges faced by disadvantaged young people looking for work to links between work practices and company performance and the role of volunteering in building the social capital of communities. It demonstrates how Eurofound’s research gets beyond the headlines, exposing the more nuanced dynamics at work in the issues of greatest concern in Europe. For example, it shows that while jobs were shed massively in construction and manufacturing, workers in the highest-paying jobs were largely cushioned from the recession. On another subject – employee performance – the Yearbook draws attention to findings suggesting that teamworking and training practices may have a greater motivational effect than incentive pay.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0614	2012-07-31	UNK	Press release, 31 July 2012	"Eurofound publishes a report on the development of working conditions in the retail sector over the past decade: Working conditions in the retail sector under scrutiny (Dublin, Ireland) A new report from Eurofound shows how the transformation of the retail sector in recent years, due to technological innovations and the increasing dominance of large retailers, has affected career patterns, working conditions and employment status. The comparative report ‘Working conditions in the retail sector’ covers the EU27 countries and Norway between 2001 and 2010. The retail sector is a significant part of the EU economy, accounting for about 4.2% of the EU’s gross domestic product and 20% of European small and medium enterprises (SMEs).  Over the past decade, employment in the sector increased from 17 million to over 19 million and it represented about 9% of total employment in Europe in 2010, the new report shows. Large companies have been growing while the small and micro businesses that once characterised the sector in most countries have diminished. The report also illustrates a significant decline in the number of self-employed and a substantial increase in the number of part-time jobs and non-permanent contracts. The sector remains one of the main entry gates to the labour market for young people and a re-entry point for those who had left the labour market for personal reasons, such as women giving up work to look after their children. The considerable expansion of the sector is associated with changes in the regulatory framework, a transformation in its competitive structure and much greater use of technology. ‘Our report shows that the changes in the sector have affected career patterns, offered new job opportunities, but also introduced some potential new risks to employees’ health, especially psychosocial ones. These play a crucial role in the retail sector because of increasingly aggressive behaviour from third parties, mainly customers,’ says Juan Menéndez-Valdés, Eurofound’s Director. ‘Although a number of Member States continue the liberalisation process, especially eastern countries and Italy, there are calls in other countries to reverse this process because of risks in terms of social cohesion. Initiatives by social partners seek to regulate flexibility and working time arrangements, promote training, reduce the risk of robbery and enhance employee well-being.’ Social partners in several countries have promoted a number of initiatives aimed at tackling new psychosocial risks. However, evidence shows that efforts are still needed to facilitate the transition of part-time and non-permanent workers to full-time and highly qualified job. Work accidents in the retail sector are less frequent than in the overall economy. The main new risks are anti-social behaviour, from verbal abuse to physical violence and robbery by third parties, difficulties of reconciling work and life due to irregular working schedules and increased intensification following the introduction of ICT. ‘In conjunction with activities at national level, we have focused our efforts at EU level in trying to tackle the challenges of psychosocial risks in the sector. Already in 2010, we agreed to a multisectoral approach and put guidelines in place to tackle work-related third-party violence and harassment, involving all social partners representing the commerce sector, private security, local governments, education and hospital sectors in Europe,’ says Christian Verschueren, EuroCommerce Director-General.  ‘In addition, in our social dialogue work programme for 2012–2013, we are also committed to cooperating on stress at work, ergonomics, addressing skills mismatch through the establishment of a European sector skills council,’ commented Oliver Roethig, UNI Europa Regional Secretary. ‘As far as the issue of part-time and fixed-term work are concerned, we intend to have an exchange of views further to the publication of the European Commission impact assessment study on the concerned directives due to be published next autumn.’ According to Eurofound’s fifth European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS), 83% of workers in the retail sector at EU level reported they were well-informed about their risks at work and 86% considered their health and safety was not at risk because of their work. However, the survey also found increased exposure to ergonomic risk factors and that non-permanent workers are most exposed to this kind of risk.

News in pictures Members of Eurofound’s Governing Board and Eurofound staff photographed together on the occasion of the 85th Governing Board meeting on 29 June 2012.       News in brief Flexicurity: Down but not out Flexicurity, once the cornerstone of the EU strategy to increase employment rates, seems to have lost its appeal during the financial crisis. This is mainly due to the fact that security is hard to maintain in times of economic crisis, especially for vulnerable groups of workers. However, Eurofound research has found that companies are in fact employing strategies that could fit into the flexicurity bracket, although they might not be labelled as such. The report Flexicurity: Actions at company level analyses measures targeting both younger and older workers as well as women. It found that such strategies generally require a good business case to be successful, and that the main driver for their implementation is to maintain or increase the diversity of the workforce. Most of the measures are aimed at developing or updating skills and combining work with family responsibilities. Read the report Governing Board approves four-year programme The Governing Board of Eurofound held its 85th meeting on Friday 29 June 2012 in the Raymond Pierre Bodin Conference Centre on the agency’s premises in Loughlinstown. Its main business was the approval of the 2013–2016 programme ‘From crisis to recovery – Better informed policies for a competitive and fair Europe’. The meeting also provided feedback on Eurofound’s proposals for its 2013 activities. The recent agreement (12 June) between the European Parliament, Council and Commission on a common approach for the functioning and governance of the agency was discussed in terms of its implications for tripartite representation – governments, trade unions and employer organisations – per Member State in the Governing Board. In advance of the meeting, Eurofound staff presented new findings related to the EU Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generation. Science and its potential for active ageing Dublin played host to the international Euroscience Open Forum Dublin 2012 on 11–15 July, which included several events, including a 10-day science festival with activities for citizens and experts across the city. Eurofound research managers took part in discussions at the ancilliary conference in Dublin Castle on 9–11 July, ‘Active ageing – the potential for society’. Sponsored by the European Commission and linked to the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations, this event aimed to showcase a positive approach to ageing and its potential for society, presenting international scientific research on active ageing and identifying future research challenges. Eurofound research manager Klára Fóti chaired a parallel session on social participation, while Head of Unit for Living Conditions and Quality of Life Rob Anderson presented Eurofound research findings at Panel 2, ‘Economic dimensions of ageing/economic impulses’. Role of men in gender equality Improving equality between women and men is a vital component in the EU’s response to the current economic crisis, according to the Commission’s annual report on gender equality published in April. Greet Vermeylen, research manager in the Working Conditions and Industrial Relations unit in Eurofound, will participate in the conference organised by the Commission on the role of men in gender equality, which will take place in Brussels on 14 September. Eurofound has built up a considerable body of research on issues related to gender equality, not least through its European Working Conditions Survey, which sheds light on the way men and women work, as well as gender segregation at work. The aim of the conference is to exchange ideas and opinions on ways in which men can contribute to achieving gender equality, in order to enable policymakers in the EU Member States and EFTA countries to take into account men’s views when establishing and implementing gender equality policies.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-july-2012-2

EUROFOUND_UNK_0618	2012-06-29	UNK	Press release, 29 June 2012	"Eurofound publishes its 2011 Yearbook on Living and working in Europe: Key trends identified in Eurofound’s new Living and working in Europe report (Dublin, Ireland) More jobs were lost than created across Europe in 2011, and although company restructuring, job losses and site closures caused significant industrial action, many countries still experienced little or no strike activity. The recession and its aftermath were particularly severe on young workers, who found that education no longer offers protection against unemployment. Eurofound’s second annual Yearbook on Living and working in Europe highlights key trends in Europe’s development, crucial for understanding the changing challenges it is encountering. Europe’s social policy agenda is wide but its goal is, broadly, to improve the quality of life of people living in the EU. Volunteering is an expression of social connectedness, a recognition by individuals of their responsibility to contribute to the common good. To raise awareness of volunteering and to improve the opportunities for participation in voluntary activities, 2011 was designated the European Year of Voluntary Activities Promoting Active Citizenship. Eurofound uncovered considerable differences in the extent of volunteering across the EU. In total, one-fifth of respondents to the European Quality of Life Survey engaged in organised voluntary work. It was highest in northern and western European countries, reaching 40%–45% in Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Austria and the Netherlands, which suggests a strong tradition of volunteering in those countries. Participation was lower in southern and eastern Europe, with rates averaging between 10% and 15%. ‘Our second annual Yearbook on Living and working in Europe provides a bird’s-eye view of what Eurofound presented by way of policy-oriented research during the course of 2011,’ says Juan Menéndez-Valdés, Eurofound’s Director, about the new report. ‘While we do not claim to present all of our work during the last year here, the Yearbook conveys the main findings of some of our key currents of research – in particular, results and analysis from our three pan-European surveys on company practices, working conditions and quality of life.’ Eurofound’s research on employment trends showed that the lost jobs were mainly middle- and lower-paying jobs in construction, manufacturing and retail, while the new jobs were mostly higher-skilled and better-paying jobs in knowledge-intensive services. There were big differences between countries: some countries experienced job growth skewed towards the top of the pay distribution, some experienced polarisation, with growth at the lower and upper ends of the pay distribution, but contraction in the middle, and other countries saw downgrading, with greater job destruction in higher-paid jobs and growth or small declines in lower-paid employment. The greater impact of the crisis on male-dominated sectors had a narrowing effect on the gender gap in employment. Most (80%) of the net decline in employment affected male workers, in jobs that tended overwhelmingly to be in middle- and mid- low-paid categories. Job losses among women were exclusively in middle- and low-paid jobs, in occupations such as retail salespersons and blue-collar workers in textiles and clothing manufacture and agriculture. 2011 also saw developments in policies to maintain older workers in work in nine Member States - Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Employment rates for older people have increased over the past decade in these countries, although they vary widely. In Sweden, for example, over 60% of workers aged 60–64 years are in work, compared to less than 20% in Belgium and Hungary. Young workers struggled where older workers gained in 2011. The recession and its aftermath were particularly severe on young workers; youth unemployment rose to 21% across the EU by mid-2011, equal to around five million workers, and reached as high as 43% in Spain. In the current economic stasis, education is no longer a protection against unemployment. Of great concern is the group of young people ‘not in employment, education or training’  - or NEETs. Eurofound’s research show that around 7.5 million young people between 15-24 are in the NEET group, and proportions vary greatly across Member States, from 4% in the Netherlands to 22% in Bulgaria. The annual cost of NEETs to society is estimated at about €120bn.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0619	2012-06-29	UNK	Press release, 27 April 2012	"Eurofound publishes the new format European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) Quarterly 1 2012: Rise in restructuring activity in EU in first quarter (Dublin, Ireland) For every three jobs lost in the European Union in large-scale restructurings, two new ones were created during the first quarter of 2012, the latest European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) quarterly reveals. The first issue of the newly designed quarterly provides an overview of the employment effects of large-scale restructuring in the EU27 and Norway, as well as links to online data which is updated on a daily basis. A fresh focus on the essentials of economic activity reveals a weakening EU economy with an increasing likelihood that the Union is already in a double-dip recession. Output growth was negative in the most recent quarter (-0.3%, 2011Q4) and predicted to be negative also in the first quarter of 2012. Unemployment has risen persistently in the past year though the pattern of labour market performance remains very diverse across Member States. The ERM recorded a total of 342 cases of restructuring between 1 January and 31 March 2012, nearly a hundred more cases than in the previous quarter. Of these, 213 were cases of announced restructuring involving job loss, 126 were cases involving announced job creation and three cases involved both job loss and job gain. They amounted to 86,013 announced job losses and 62,878 announced job gains. Internal restructuring accounted for almost 70% of the announced job losses. Compared to the previous quarter, the ERM recorded an increase in the incidence of bankruptcies (13%), closures (9%), offshoring and delocalisation (5%) as well as mergers and acquisitions (4%). In terms of geographic distribution, the countries which recorded the greatest number of announced job losses were Germany (12,416 jobs) and Hungary (12,301 jobs), followed by Spain (10,199 jobs), the United Kingdom (8,081jobs) and France (8,036 jobs). Romania (12,326 jobs) recorded the highest number of new jobs, followed by the United Kingdom (11,600 jobs), Poland (10,623 jobs) and France (10,430 jobs). The restructuring cases with the biggest employment impact during the quarter both took place in the public sector. The Polish police force announced the recruitment of 5,100 new police officers in January 2012 while the Hungarian state administration announced the loss of over 6,700 civil servant jobs in the same month. Manufacturing (36,309 jobs) was by far the sector the most affected by job losses. Other notably affected sectors were transport, storage and communications (12,939 jobs), financial intermediation (12,235 jobs), public administration (10,492 jobs) and real estate/ business activities (4,245 jobs). The highest number of announced job creations were recorded in manufacturing (15,280 jobs), followed by retail (12,226 jobs). Other sectors that display job growth during the quarter are real estate and business activities (7,375 jobs), transport, storage and communications (6,784 jobs) and electricity, gas and water supply (5,880 jobs). The quarterly also focuses on the effects of restructuring in the case of Finnish mobile phone manufacturer Nokia moving some 2,200 jobs from their Romanian factory to production plants in Asia. It also highlights the new EMCC qualitative database incorporating government or social partner-based restructuring support instruments from the EU27 and Norway, which has recently been added to its existing database of restructuring cases.

News in brief Openness and acccountability to EU citizens Eurofound’s openness, transparency and accountability as a European public body came under scrutiny during the recent visit by European Ombudsman P. Nikiforos Diamandouros. The role of the European Ombudsman, based in Strasbourg, is to investigate complaints on behalf of the European citizen about maladministration in EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. The visit on 15 May was part of a series of visits undertaken by the Ombudsman to all EU agencies, aimed at identifying and promoting best practice by the agencies in their relations with citizens. During his half day at Eurofound, Mr Diamandouros was briefed by Director Juan Menéndez-Valdés and Deputy Director Erika Mezger as well as by senior staff on Eurofound’s policies in relation to selection and recruitment procedures, tenders and contracts, and dealing with requests for information from the public Data analysis for 3rd EQLS in process Fieldwork for the third European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) was completed in the 27 EU Member States in February 2012, and is currently ongoing in seven candidate or pre-accession countries: Croatia, Iceland, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Serbia and Turkey. So far, 35,500 people have been interviewed in the EU27, and the dataset is currently being analysed internally by Eurofound. By the time the fieldwork is completed in all 34 countries, over 42,500 people will have been interviewed. The first results of the survey will be available in an overview report and résumé, which are expected to be published at the end of 2012. It is planned to make the survey dataset available to the public in spring 2013. Read more about the EQLS EMCC website gets new look There are changes afoot in the European Monitoring Centre for Change (EMCC). Online readers may have noticed a new look and feel to the EMCC website in recent weeks. The changes, which are being rolled out on a phased basis as part of a development plan, include revamped web pages, a new web page presenting both past and ongoing research projects in selected labour market thematic areas and a searchable database containing data on over 14,000 large-scale restructuring events across Europe. A new database from the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) gives information on 400 support measures for companies across the EU27 and Norway. Finally, the ERM quarterly has taken on a smart, new, four-page format, designed to facilitate rapid reading for busy users. Check out the new design and read the latest issue of the ERM quarterly Earning money after retirement In the wake of the economic and financial crisis, concerns have been expressed about the adequacy and sustainability of pensions. A recently observed phenomenon is the increasing number of people who take up paid work after retirement. Selected experts in the social field including NGOs, academics and social partners will debate the findings of new research by Eurofound at a special workshop, ‘Income from work after retirement’, in Brussels on 15 June. Steered by Eurofound research experts Rob Anderson and Hans Dubois, the meeting will look at case studies documenting experiences over the past five years on the type of paid work retirees take up and their motivations, taking into account genger differences. It will also examine relevant government policies for employment and self-employment after retirement. The workshop will compare EU experiences with the USA, where employment rates post-retirement have traditionally been high. Eurofound plans to publish the report and case studies in the second half of 2012.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-june-2012-2

Young people at risk of being left behind In the midst of the economic crisis, Europe’s young people are facing a crisis of their own. The group of most concern is the so-called NEETs, young people ‘not in employment, education or training’. These individuals run a high risk of falling out of the system, becoming isolated from society and left behind. The rate of NEETs in the EU is 15.2% among those aged 15 to 29; however, as with youth unemployment, there are huge differences between Member States, ranging from 5.8% in the Netherlands to around 22% in Ireland and Italy and 23% in Bulgaria. The economic and social costs are huge, both for the individuals concerned and for society. Eurofound research estimates the total cost to be around €120 billion per year for the EU as a whole. NEETs are also less likely to have trust in institutions such as the government, to vote or to volunteer.

Making work more sustainable A significant proportion of workers are exposed to working conditions that impact negatively on individual well-being, according to findings from the fifth European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS). If recovery from the current economic crisis is to be realised while maintaining the ambitious Europe 2020 goals of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, then it follows that work must be made smarter, more sustainable and more inclusive. There are a number of factors driving the debate about work in Europe today: the ageing of European society, which is likely to lead to a reduction in the size of the labour force; the increased participation of women in the workforce – and the policy objective of pursuing this further; and the economic crisis, which puts pressure on both public finances and the social climate. While the combined impact of these factors is unknown, the new overview report on the fifth EWCS argues that ensuring that work is sustainable and inclusive will be a necessary part of responding to them.

News in brief Martin Schulz, President of the European Parliament, and Juan Menéndez-Valdés, Eurofound Director, welcome participants to the joint conference on ‘Quality of work and employment’ in Brussels on 12 April.     Eurofound connects with ageing conference The International Federation on Ageing’s 11th global conference – ‘Ageing Connects’ – aims to contribute to the European Year of Active Ageing by exploring social trends and evaluating policy developments in the area of population ageing. Taking place in Prague from 28 May until 1 June, the event will provide self-advocates, family members, professionals, and their organisations from all over Europe with a platform to exchange information on current policies and practices with a wide range of stakeholders. Head of Unit Rob Anderson will chair the symposium ‘Income from work after retirement’, during which Research Officer Hans Dubois will present findings from current Eurofound research into this topic. Eurofound will also present its research at the sessions on ‘Care and support for caregivers’ and ‘Work and the ageing workforce’ Nokia's move east sparks debate on subsidies Nokia’s decision in December 2011 to close its factory in Jucu, Romania and move production to Asia, as part of a global restructuring plan, signalled the loss of 2,000 jobs in the region. It also sparked a national debate about the use of state aid for international companies in Romania, as the factory had been set up in 2008 with financial support from the Romanian government. Fortunately for workers in the region, three international companies have recently announced the creation of up to 3,100 new jobs on the former Nokia site, mainly in manufacturing. The bulk of new jobs in the Jucu Tetarom industrial park will be created by German global engineering and electronics group Bosch. More on this and other restructuring developments feature in the latest ERM quarterly A lethal mix - alcohol and drugs at work Up to 30% of workplace accidents in European countries could be related to alcohol or drug use, according to findings from a new Eurofound report. But safety risks are just one of the problems linked to the use of alcohol or drugs in the workplace. Poor performance, reduced productivity and conflicts with colleagues are some of the other negative outcomes. While testing for substance use at work may be justified where safety risks are high, this can be controversial as it invades the privacy of workers. Most European countries have legislation or collective agreements to ban or control the use of alcohol and drugs at work, but the issue clearly needs more consideration. Prevention programmes, developed as part of more general strategies for health and safety at work, could produce more positive results for workers than sanctions and controls. Download the report Europe in action 2012 Eurofound will participate in the Europe in Action 2012 conference aimed at fostering work opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities, which takes place in Brussels from 31 May to 2 June. Research manager Anna Ludwinek will present findings from a Eurofound study on the active inclusion of young people with disabilities or health problems, including mental health problems. Good practice examples from a number of countries will illustrate how service providers and local and national organisations are helping to move young people with various mental health problems or learning difficulties from inactivity to employment. The case studies focus on innovative practices carried out in an integrated, joined-up approach.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-may-2012-2

EUROFOUND_UNK_0626	2012-04-27	UNK	Press release, 11 April 2012	Eurofound co-organises conference on ‘Quality of work and employment’ with the European Parliament: New research highlights importance of sustainable quality of work for Europe (Dublin, Ireland) Results from the European Working Conditions Survey indicate that a significant proportion of workers are exposed to working conditions that are associated with reduced wellbeing. If recovery from the current economic crisis is to come through the ambitious Europe 2020 goals of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, then policy must further focus on work and how to make it also more smart, sustainable and inclusive, participants at the joint European Parliament and Eurofound conference on ‘Quality of work and employment: a policy tool towards an inclusive and sustainable growth’ will hear in Brussels tomorrow, 12 April. A number of factors are driving the debate about work in Europe today. First and foremost, the ageing of Europe which is likely to lead to a reduction in the size of our labour force; increased participation of women into the workforce – and the policy objective of pursuing this further; and the economic crisis which puts pressure on both public finances and the social climate. While the combined impact of these factors is unknown, ensuring that work is sustainable and inclusive will be a necessary part of responding to them. ‘To get a smart, inclusive and cohesive growth, as spelled out in the Europe 2020 Strategy, we must widen the policy agenda on quality of work and employment to ensure that it covers two key dimensions: a concern for the future of workers who hold job which combine a number of unfavourable features, such that the future participation in the labour market and career development of the workers is at risk; and the increased individualisation in society and the associated variety of individual preferences, which highlights the potential of the life course approach,’ says Juan Menéndez-Valdés, Eurofound’s Director. To help further the debate, Eurofound is organising a conference entitled ‘Quality of work and employment: A policy tool towards an inclusive and sustainable growth’ with the participation of the President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, and the support of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, in Brussels on 12 April 2012. With participants drawn from among EU and international institutions, social partners and experts, the event provides an opportunity for Eurofound to present findings from its latest European Working Conditions Survey. The fifth European Working Conditions Survey (5EWCS) is based on interviews with 44,000 workers across 34 European countries. The first survey was carried out in 1990. The European Working Conditions Survey series aims to measure working conditions across European countries on a harmonised basis, to analyse relationships between different aspects of working conditions, to monitor trends over time, and to contribute to European policy development, in particular on quality of work and employment issues. Analysis of the recent survey data helps to identify how certain working conditions are associated with better wellbeing among workers. Chief among them are creating a positive working climate that has no tolerance for discrimination, violence or bullying, and encourages social support by colleagues and managers; giving workers a voice, enabling them to be heard and to make improvements that clarify their roles and tasks; and creating a safe working environment, which encourages collaborative work. But important also are ways to address job insecurity, to take steps to improve workers’ career development and their participation in work over the life course, and to facilitate a good work –life balance. See more information about the joint European Parliament and Eurofound event. Follow the event on 12 April 2012 live on Livestream.

NOTES TO THE EDITOR: The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) is a tripartite EU body that provides European social policymakers with comparative data, research and recommendations. The fieldwork for the fifth EWCS took place from January to June 2010, with almost 44,000 workers interviewed in their homes in the EU27, Norway, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkey, Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo. Figures from the EWCS are estimates, based on a representative sample of European workers and not on the whole population. Differences over time and between countries need to be interpreted with caution. The report discusses only those differences that are likely to reflect true differences rather than being the result of sampling errors.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/press-release-11-april-2012

EU-level debate on quality of work At the launch event of the overview report for the fifth European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS), jointly organised by Eurofound and the European Parliament in Brussels on 12 April, leading European social partners debated the importance and realities of quality of employment and work. This major conference, entitled ‘Quality of work and employment: A policy tool towards an inclusive and sustainable growth’, kicked off with a presentation of the main EWCS findings, which acted as an appetiser for the subsequent debates on quality of work and how to attain the Europe 2020 goals. In the first panel debate, Members of the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee, the European social partners and the Danish Presidency discussed the current challenges, exploring what policies are needed and how to go from policy orientation to implementation. In the second panel, participants reflected on how to achieve ‘sustainable and inclusive work’, from a multilevel and multifactorial perspective.

Eurofound explores situation of older workers The eight series of the Foundation Seminar Series (FSS) 2011–2012, aims to contribute to the EU active ageing strategy by putting forward arguments and presenting case studies showing how improved working conditions may help to keep older workers in the labour market. The current series of the FSS is particularly timely given that 2012 is the European Year of Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations. The first session of the FSS took place in Dublin on 7–9 November 2011, while the second session will take place in Rome on 28–30 May. This session will be hosted by ISFOL (Istituto per lo Sviluppo della Formazione Professionale dei Lavoratori), a publicly-owned research institute dedicated to the investigation of labour market issues, training systems and social policies. It represents the ideal platform for the exchange of examples of company measures and government or social partner initiatives aimed at improving the labour market integration of older workers. Participants from 14 EU countries will be involved in plenary sessions and break-out workshops to present their national situations and to discuss the presentations given by companies, researchers and key actors on the topic. The seminar is organised around three main areas where older workers can face particular challenges: training, health and work organisation.

Towards a more sustainable quality of work A major conference organised by Eurofound in Brussels on 12 April addressed the challenges inherent in achieving the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy towards ‘smart, sustainable and inclusive growth’. Entitled ‘Quality of work and employment: A policy tool towards an inclusive and sustainable growth’, the event was organised with the participation of the President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, and the support of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats. With participants drawn from among EU and international institutions, social partners and experts, the event provided an opportunity for Eurofound to present findings from its latest European Working Conditions Survey – the fifth in the series of five-yearly surveys produced since 1990. Chaired in turn by Eurofound director Juan Menéndez-Valdés and deputy director Erika Mezger, the panel debates addressed two key questions related to the quality of living and working conditions for European citizens today: how the current changes in employment policies will impact on the quality of societal and economic progress in Europe and how a stronger integration of work and employment into wider policies can contribute to a more sustainable and inclusive working life for everyone.

News in brief On the occasion of his visit to Eurofound on 29 March last, Koos Richelle, Director-General, DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, poses for a photo with Eurofound Director Juan Menéndez-Valdés and Deputy-Director Erika Mezger.     Youth employment and inclusion in times of crisis With around 5.5 million people under the age of 25 unemployed in the European Union, the forthcoming Danish Presidency conference on youth will prioritise topics such as access to the labour market, social inclusion and maintaining skills at a time of crisis. Taking place in Horsens on 26–27 April, the event will focus on young people’s access to employment in the current recession and the role of governments, social partners and private actors. Eurofound’s Rob Anderson, Head of Unit, Living Conditions and Quality of Life, will present results from a recent study showing how the principle of active inclusion using a joined-up approach can succeed in moving young people from inactivity into employment. Roma face higher risk of ill-health and disability The living conditions of the Roma are among the worst of any ethnic group in Europe. Almost two-thirds live in housing without basic sanitation, such as an indoor toilet or shower. They are also more likely to live in overcrowded conditions, in areas segregated from the rest of the community and lacking basic services. These are the findings of a new Eurofound report, which also describes how inferior living conditions impact negatively on the health of the Roma, increasing their risk of general ill-health, mental illness, domestic accidents and drug-related problems. The report recommends improving access to adequate social housing for vulnerable groups, especially in central and eastern European Member States that have a high Roma population. Read the report Helping households get their finances back on track Many Europeans are struggling to service their mortgages and consumer credit, and to pay their rent and utility bills. In 2010, 11.6% of households were in arrears with payments related to such debts or bills, up from 9.9% in 2007. In 2010 Eurofound produced a working paper exploring the problem of household over-indebtedness, identifying groups at risk, the causes and consequences, and necessary responses. A follow-up project explored the role of debt advisory services in tackling the problem, highlighting the need for improved access to and quality of such services. Drawing on evidence from across the EU, and from case studies in Hungary, Ireland, Portugal and Sweden, the project culminated in a report which has just been published. Download the report Anticipating the future of education and training EU policy focus in the area of education has resulted in a large number of strategies and initiatives, notably the plans for European cooperation in education and training (ET 2010 work programme and ET 2020 strategic framework) and the ‘New skills for new jobs’ initiative. A recent Eurofound research project has examined how changes in the education and training sector in the EU influence the present and future job prospects, skills and working conditions of those employed in the sector as teachers and trainers. The research has produced six detailed case studies, a broad mapping of trends and drivers, and a study that highlights the key challenges facing the sector. While the findings show that demand for education and training will secure a healthy labour market for teachers and trainers, they will have to develop their skills continually and adapt to new target groups, training environments and changes in their role. The report also foresees that the future shape of the sector will be strongly influenced by the extent to which private providers enter the market.

Eurofound strengthens bonds with the FRA The Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), based in Vienna, and Eurofound are exploring areas where they can work together and create synergies. As part of the process of establishing its new four-year work programme, Eurofound has invited representatives of the FRA to a meeting in Dublin on 20 April to look at areas where both agencies can benefit from each other’s expertise. At the meeting, Eurofound research managers will present data on access to public services and workplace violence from its Quality of Life and Working Conditions Surveys, while Ioannis Dimitrakopoulos, Head of Department for Equality and Citizens’ Rights, and his colleagues will present findings from the FRA’s surveys into violence against women and the situation of the Roma in Europe (see also article on back page). Active inclusion of people with disabilities is an area where there is already good cooperation, with the FRA’s work on constructing indicators to measure inclusion and Eurofound’s case study research on good practice. The meeting should result in the updating of the collaboration agreement between the two agencies.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-april-2012-1

The network of correspondents gathered in Dublin on 6–7 March for the annual meeting with Eurofound staff to review work already done and to plan for the future. The meeting is a rare opportunity to meet face to face – the network is dispersed across Europe and most communication is electronic. The exchange of views ranged from operational issues, such as subjects to be chosen for comparative studies to ideas for new ways of working, closer integration of work on industrial relations and working conditions, and relations between correspondents and their national representatives on Eurofound’s Governing Board. Carers in the European Year of Active Ageing A joint meeting of the European Parliament’s Interest Group on Carers and the Intergroup on Ageing taking place on 27 March will explore how carers and their interests feature in the European Year of Active Ageing and Solidarity between the Generations. More specifically, the meeting aims to ensure that the European Year will pay sufficient attention to the role of carers in ensuring solidarity between the generations in today’s society as well as to the important contribution made by carers to the economy. Marian Harkin MEP and Lambert van Nistelrooij MEP will co-chair the meeting. Eurofound’s Rob Anderson, in his role as President of Eurocarers, will address the meeting on ‘Carers: An example of solidarity between the generations’, drawing on results of a recent Eurofound study Company initiatives for workers with care responsibilities. Download the publications Boosting young people's access to employment On 20 March, Eurofound Director Juan Menéndez-Valdés and Research Manager Massimiliano Mascherini are taking part in two events at the European Parliament on the participation of young people in the labour market. The first event, a round table organised by SOLIDAR and hosted by Emilie Turunen MEP, will focus on the difficulties young people experience in finding a job and the tools and models available to support their entry into the labour market. The second event, organised by Jan Kozlowski MEP and with Lázló Andor, Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, as keynote speaker, will highlight employment opportunities for young people. Both events provide an occasion for Eurofound to showcase its recent research into NEETs – young people not in education, employment or training. Read the resumé Overworked and underpaid - Horeca workers Low pay and inferior working conditions are putting at risk the sustainability of the hotels, restaurants and catering (Horeca) industry in Europe – a sector that has a major role to play in achieving the EU goal of maintaining Europe as the world’s top tourist destination. The industry, already suffering the effects of the economic crisis, is struggling to recruit new workers to replace its ageing workforce. The low level of unionisation has been a barrier to achieving better working conditions. Yet social dialogue has certainly resulted in improvements in terms of work–life balance, health and safety, and training and lifelong learning opportunities. The contribution of social partners to better quality of work and working conditions in the sector is examined in the Eurofound report Employment and industrial relations in the hotels and restaurants sector. The study highlights several interesting examples of joint action by the social partners in the area of training, including cooperation at EU level on the ‘European Qualification and Skills Passport’.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-march-2012-2

EUROFOUND_UNK_0638	2012-03-20	UNK	Press release, 20 March 2012	"Eurofound publishes new research on flexicurity during the economic downturn: Flexicurity in times of crisis (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Research shows that flexicurity policy initiatives and company measures continue to be applied during the crisis. Even if not designed as a deliberate flexicurity strategy - the concept of balancing flexibility, as sought mainly by employers, with security - these initiatives by governments, social partners and companies contribute to enhancing labour market flexibility and security. There is no evidence that flexicurity is a ‘remedy’ for the crisis, but the examples show a set of practices at national, sectoral and company level that can be helpful in improving the functioning of European labour markets, especially for certain groups of workers – also under difficult economic circumstances. As a consequence of the global financial and economic crisis, EU governments and social partners have put in place measures to counteract the negative impact of the crisis on employment, like short-time working arrangements, underlining the importance of flexicurity measures aimed at job security and internal flexibility within companies as a way to face the current challenges. The public and policy discussion on flexicurity has gained momentum again, with the debate centring on whether flexicurity remains a useful labour market strategy for Europe, feasible in economically difficult times or even a way out of the downturn. Eurofound wants to contribute to the flexicurity debate by sharing the results from two new studies which identify and analyse flexicurity initiatives stemming from two different levels: policies adopted by governments and social partners at the national, regional or sectoral level, as well as measures put forward by companies for vulnerable groups of workers, namely, young people, older workers and women. Compared to other developed economies fewer people are employed in Europe. This is mainly due to comparatively lower employment rates for women and, in particular, young and older workers. These groups of workers are typically overrepresented in more atypical forms of employment. This has resulted in cases of high labour market segmentation in some countries, which the flexicurity strategy tries to address. Eurofound’s case study research, based on more than 230 public and social partner-based instruments that can be considered to constitute flexicurity practices, shows that company measures targeted at young workers typically focus on increasing their job and especially employment security, while offering mainly external numerical flexibility to the company. In this respect, the most common measures for young workers are special contractual arrangements and training measures, which in combination provide the core element of flexicurity. Older workers face important challenges in the labour market. There is a general perception that they are less adaptable and qualified than younger workers, which may result in poor skills development for older workers, potentially due to both companies offering less training to them and older workers being less willing to participate. According to Eurofound’s European Working Conditions Survey 2010 data, those aged over 50 receive less training (29.7%) paid by the employer than those aged 30–49 (36%) or under 30 (33.1%). In the past, policies and company measures related to older workers have strongly focused on early exit arrangements, offering external numerical flexibility for companies (limited to one-way transitions towards exit) and income security for older workers. Over the last decades, such practices started to be withdrawn in several Member States. Flexibility in job content and work organisation increases functional flexibility by allowing older workers to perform different tasks and functions within the organisation. Teamwork, job rotation, multitasking, more autonomy and greater challenges at work and training can improve the position of older workers within organisations and increase their satisfaction by enriching their jobs. For instance, setting up mixed-aged teams, within which older workers may act as mentors, channels a transfer of knowledge between generations while opening new opportunities to older workers within the company. Job rotation, by allowing changes of job within organisations, can be used to increase employment options for older workers where they learn new skills. A particular case may arise when the company faces restructuring: instead of downsizing by offering them early retirement, older workers could receive training and support before being redeployed to different tasks within the company.

EU ambassadors visit Eurofound On Monday 5 March, Eurofound played host to a visit from Dublin-based ambassadors and representatives from 23 EU Member States, together with David Cooney, Secretary General, and David Donoghue, Political Director, Irish Department of Foreign Affairs. Eurofound Director Juan Menéndez-Valdés, and Deputy Director Erika Mezger presented Eurofound’s activities and the draft four-year programme. Also on the agenda, and a starting point for discussions, were Eurofound’s comparative research findings, data and policy pointers, and their impact at national level. Senior research managers outlined current research projects aimed at highlighting topical issues and contributing to the political debates on employment and change, working conditions and industrial relations, and living conditions and quality of life, across all EU Member States. The occasion, which formed part of Eurofound’s outreach activities in Ireland, was also an opportunity to look at Ireland’s upcoming EU Presidency during the first half of 2013. Next year’s term will constitute Ireland’s seventh EU Presidency, an event that also coincides with the 40th Anniversary of Ireland’s accession to the EU.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-march-2012-1

Flexicurity under the spotlight Flexicurity, the concept of balancing flexibility – as sought mainly by employers – with security – as demanded mainly by employees – became a popular policy approach during periods of growth in the EU pre-recession. Recent Eurofound research has been examining how flexicurity is faring in economically difficult times, where it has become much more difficult to provide security and where all the flexibility in the world will not help companies if there is no demand for their products. Interestingly, the findings reveal that, the current economic climate notwithstanding, there are many public support instruments in use across Europe that support flexicurity. They may not be explicitly labelled flexicurity measures, but they do attempt to balance the twin aspects of flexibility and security. Eurofound’s research report, The second phase of flexicurity, will be launched in Brussels on 20 March, at a specially convened social partners’ lunch debate on the subject of flexicurity. At the same event, Eurofound will also present its latest edition of Foundation Findings, on the same subject, which draws on upcoming research on flexicurity at the company level.

Looking ahead - priorities for 2013-2016 Improving the living conditions and working conditions of European citizens - what are the main challenges? How can Eurofound best contribute to meet these challenges? These are questions to which Eurofound's next four-year programme needs to provide clear answers. Eurofound's four-year programme provides the framework for the projects and activities featuring in its annual plans. Given that recovery from the economic crisis is of immediate concern for the EU, the key research themes to be developed should reflect this policy emphasis. Discussions on the next multiannual programme, which will cover the period 2013 to 2016, kicked off last year. A first draft was submitted to Eurofound's Governing Board and Bureau in January 2012, and extensive consultations with Eurofound's stakeholders will follow. Meetings with members of the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee, Social Affairs Attaches, and relevant NGOs will take place in Brussels in February and March. Eurofound's tripartite stakeholders will have a chance to exchange ideas with experts and staff in a one-day seminar to take place on 15 March next. It is planned to adopt the approved new four-year programme at the end of June.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-february-2012-0

News in brief Eurofound at EYAA launch in Copenhagen Robert Anderson, Head of Eurofound's Living Conditions and Quality of Life research team, fielding questions from journalists at the launch of the European Year of Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations, in Copenhagen on 18 January 2012.   AFP photo / Andreas Hillergren   Work on third EQLS gathers pace Around Europe, fieldwork for Eurofound's third European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS), begun September last, is nearing completion. Carried out every four years, this unique, pan-European survey explores a range of topics that directly concern the lives of European citizens: employment, income, education, housing, family, health and work-life balance. It also looks at how people view the quality of their life and whether they are satisfied with their situation. Over the years, the European Quality of Life surveys have developed a valuable set of indicators which complement traditional indicators of economic growth and living standards such as GDP or income. This time around, the survey will interview more than 43,000 people and also includes Iceland, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Turkey, as well as Kosovo and Serbia. It is planned to publish the overview report on the survey's findings at the end of the year. Read about the survey Eurofound Director plays host to EESC ‘Research-based policymaking is essential to create a fair, coherent and responsible Europe,' said Staffan Nilsson, President of the European Economic and Social Committee, when visiting Eurofound on 9 January 2012. ‘Eurofound plays an important role in providing social policymakers with relevant data, research findings and policy-pointers.' Juan Menéndez-Valdés, Eurofound's Director, welcomed Staffan Nilsson to a special briefing session on Eurofound's most recent research findings. The session also included an overview of research activities planned for 2012 and the new four-year work programme 2013-2016. Mr Nilsson was accompanied by Rolf Eriksson, Chef de Cabinet, and Vasco Oliveira, Head of Unit responsible for Relations with the Institutions and the National ESCs. The three-hour visit included presentations on the latest research charting the structural and demographic impact of Europe's economic crisis and the challenges and opportunities of an ageing Europe. Banking hit hard by economic downturn The banking sector, the main source of the financial crisis and recession in 2008, has also been heavily affected by the outcome, as the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) describes in its latest quarterly. Due to ongoing efforts by national governments and companies to reduce debt burdens and cut expenditures, many banks have had to retrench and even give up certain business areas, such as investment banking. This has led to a significant fall in jobs, as banks try to manage their cost base and deal with the ongoing challenges of euro-zone turmoil, uncertainty in the global economy, budgetary austerity, declining household incomes, greater competition, and regulatory change. The future still looks uncertain, with several surveys predicting that the European austerity measures will lead to further job losses. Read more in the report Policies in support of active inclusion The Commission's 2008 Recommendation on the active inclusion of people excluded from the labour market encourages Member States to implement policies in order to prevent the marginalisation of vulnerable groups. The current crisis has created new categories of people at risk of poverty, such as children, young people and lone parents. Therefore the provision of active inclusion policies and adequate and affordable social services is one of the key priorities for the Commission in 2012. This year, drawing on its three years of research into the active inclusion of young people with health problems or disabilities, Eurofound will contribute to a Commission report on strategies in place across the Member States to support active inclusion.

Working time during the recession In light of the current economic crisis and the Commission's ongoing review of the Working Time Directive, the issue of working time continues to hold a pivotal position in policy discussions across Europe. The organisation of working time has far-reaching consequences for employment and competitiveness, as well as impacting significantly on gender equality. At present, many companies across the EU are seeking ways to cope with a decline in demand for their products and still hold onto jobs. Recent developments include the introduction of publicly financed short-time working and temporary layoff schemes in response to decreased production. Short-time working is increasingly becoming a realistic option for companies as an alternative to redundancies: a cut in working hours and an associated cut in wages enables people to keep their jobs, albeit at lower pay. Other approaches that are used include production stops, working time accounts, compulsory annual leave, leave rotation and sabbaticals. These are some of the findings in Eurofound's latest report in the Foundation Findings series, Working time in the EU, which draws on research from the latest European Company Survey and the European Working Conditions Survey to explore aspects of working time such as flexitime, part-time work, overtime, working long hours and achieving a satisfactory work-life balance.

Launch of European Year for Active Ageing From 2012 onwards, the working-age population in Europe will start to shrink while the 60+ age group will increase by about two million people a year. Denmark opens the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations 2012 with a conference in Copenhagen on 18-19 January. Taking innovation as its main theme, the conference will present good practice examples from different European countries, showing how innovative solutions can assist older workers to play an active role in society and the labour market. Donald Storrie, Head of the Employment and Change unit in Eurofound, will participate in the opening session with a presentation on ‘Senior citizens in the labour market - the need for and potential of reforms'. The second and third sessions will deal with key aspects of active ageing - in the labour market and after retirement - and how to facilitate new ways of delivering social and health services to the elderly.

News in brief Eurofound at Restructuring Forum in Brussels Eurofound Research Manager Irene Mandl presenting the ERM annual report, Public instruments to support restructuring in Europe, at the Restructuring Forum which took place in Brussels on 5–6 December last (see article below).     Promoting ethnic entrepreneurship Around Europe, it is increasingly recognised that businesses owned and run by members of immigrant communities lead to better integration, job creation, revitalisation of neglected neighbourhoods, and economic growth overall. According to a Eurofound report just published, more could be done to promote migrant businesses, which account for one-third of businesses in some European cities. However, there are many barriers faced by ethnic entrepreneurs: difficulties accessing finance, lack of business skills and lack of competence in the local language. The report advises policymakers from European to local level to put more emphasis on nurturing ethnic entrepreneurship in the interests of economic prosperity and social cohesion. Download the report Socially responsible restructuring Anticipating and managing industrial change, with the goal of matching skills with future jobs, is vital for growth. This was the overall conclusion of the Restructuring Forum ‘Socially responsible restructuring worldwide’ that took place in Brussels on 5–6 December 2011. The event, coorganised by the European Commission and the ILO, provided an ideal opportunity for Eurofound to launch its annual ERM report – Public instruments to support restructuring in Europe – to the 200+ audience, madeup of representatives of governments, social partners and practitioners from the EU and 11 economies outside the EU. The conference also provided the occasion for Eurofound to present its new online ERM database on support instruments. Read the ERM annual report 2011 and consult the new database Debating the issue of youth unemployment Eurofound participated in a high-level conference on youth employment which took place in Paris on 13–14 December last. Organised jointly by the OECD, the European Youth Forum and the Youth Employment Consortium, the event provided an opportunity for youth organisations around Europe to engage in a dialogue with experts and policymakers on the best practices for integrating young people into the labour market during the current economic crisis. Eurofound Director Juan Menendez took part in the plenary debate on the economic impact of youth unemployment, including policy measures to counteract the negative effects of the crisis, while research manager Massimiliano Mascherini presented Eurofound’s latest findings related to NEETs (young people not in employment or training). An audience of around 150 people attended the event, mainly policymakers, social partners and NGOs.

Taking stock of east-west migration Eurofound played an active role at the EU Presidency conference on the social and economic impact of migration, which took place in Warsaw on 17-18 November last. Organised jointly by the Polish Ministry of Labour and Social Policy and Eurofound, the focus of the event was the effects of migration from the perspectives of the central and eastern European countries. The event attracted over 130 participants from across Europe - policymakers, representatives of national governments, civil society and international organisations such as the ILO and the IOM - and the debates centred around the impact of migration on families and children, labour shortages and integration issues. In his opening address, delivered via video link, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion László Andor commended Eurofound for focusing on the aspects of migration that have so far been neglected in the wider policy debate and stressed that the Commission will look forward to the results and follow-up issues from the conference. Presentations and debates from the event will inform Eurofound discussions on the next four-year programme 2013-2016 in this area.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0651	2012-01-17	UNK	Press release, 17 January 2012	Eurofound at the Opening Conference of the 2012 European Year of Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations EYAA2012: Active inclusion policies are only answer to employment impact of ageing workers (DUBLIN, IRELAND) The labour market shortfall caused by the decline in Europe's population and workforce will not be offset by increasing immigration levels nor by higher fertility and productivity rates, delegates will be told at the Opening Conference of the 2012 European Year of Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations in Copenhagen on 18 January. The only way forward, according to Eurofound, the EU-agency charged with providing European social policymakers with comparative socio-economic research data and findings, is more active and inclusive employment policies - as well as a change to the general mind-set - to extend working life. Europeans are living longer than ever before, on average ten years more than in 1960. The increased life span is great news, particularly if accompanied by more years in good health. But it also poses many questions for individuals, their families and social security; How long do I need to work? Can I afford to retire? Does society recognise my contribution in providing care and volunteering? If current levels of productivity and pensions are to be maintained, more people will have to work for longer. When workers grow older, the positive elements of work often retain their importance, but for many it becomes more difficult to do their jobs. Research from Eurofound provides some good news: the proportion of workers in the EU27 who think they will be able to do their current job at the age of 60 has risen marginally from 57% in 2000 to 59% in 2010. Also, over the past five years, work beyond retirement has become more common in almost all Member States. Currently, around 10% of 65- 69-year-olds are employed in the EU27, compared to 8.7% five years ago. The continual decline in physically demanding work, as well as improvement in health, will contribute to increasing employment rates for older workers in the future. There is no macro-level evidence that older workers sacrificing jobs would benefit the young. There are, however, a number of issues to overcome in relation to the retention and re-employment of older workers, among which updated skills inflexibility versus experience is one, and the short payback time for the human capital investment is another. To tackle these challenges, European policymakers are increasingly recognising the role of older people in society, both as economic and social providers of resources and users of services. On 18 January 2012 in Copenhagen, at the launch event of the 2012 under the current Danish Presidency of the European Union, Eurofound will present its latest research which explores the impact of an ageing society and workforce. During the course of 2012, Eurofound will bring you more data, research findings and policy-pointers on demographic change, older workers, working conditions, care responsibilities and youth employment, providing you with insights into developments at EU, national and company levels.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0653	2011-11-24	UNK	Press release, 24 November 2011	Eurofound publishes its ERM Annual Report 2011 on public instruments to support restructuring in Europe: EU labour markets: a hesitant recovery (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Announced job losses continued to outnumber job gains in each quarter in 2011 - as they have done since the first quarter of 2008 - though levels of restructuring activity are much reduced from those of the peak crisis quarters 2008-2009, according to the 2011 annual report from Eurofound's European Restructuring Monitor (ERM). The ERM annual report provides an overview of restructuring activities in the European Union, and this edition also launches a database on public and social partner based support measures to anticipate and manage restructuring in the EU27 and Norway. The extraordinary public spending cuts and general austerity measures over the past year have impacted heavily on employment in central and local government, most notably in some of the most recession affected countries such as Latvia but also in larger Member States such as the UK and France. Job losses during the recession were otherwise concentrated in manufacturing and construction but there is some evidence of a recovery in certain manufacturing sub-sectors in the year to mid-2011. Construction employment continued to decline, falling over 2% in the most recent twelve-month period, as the weak recovery has failed to offer much of a boost to this cyclically sensitive sector. Job growth was just over 1.3 million jobs in the EU27 between the first quarter of 2010 and 2011, which is only slightly better than a jobless recovery, given the destruction of five million jobs in the preceding two years. And there are good reasons to be cautious concerning prospects for employment in Europe for the coming twelve months. The ERM 2011 Report launches a database on public and social partner based support measures to anticipate and manage restructuring in the EU27 and Norway. While restructuring economic and human resources towards more productive and profitable activities is fundamental to the dynamism of the European economy, it can entail difficulties for employees. It is therefore essential that institutions and policies not only facilitate necessary structural change but also serve to mitigate the negative effects that the ensuing labour market adjustment may have for both companies and employees. The new ERM database on support instruments for restructuring provides information on about 400 measures across Europe, for the first time systematically compiled, categorised and made accessible in a user-friendly online database. National governments, employers' organisations and trade unions are among the bodies providing support for companies that need to restructure and the affected employees. The support instruments are described in terms of their characteristics, involved actors, funding sources, strengths, weaknesses and outcomes. Due to the substantial number and heterogeneity of relevant instruments, the database is does not able to provide a comprehensive list of each and every measure available. Rather, it aims to provide an overview of different examples of what is done and what can be done, also considering instruments that are not explicitly labelled ‘restructuring' but could be beneficial in this context. The aim is to inform governments, social partners and others involved about what kinds of support can be offered, thereby acting as a pool of ideas for public and private decision-makers confronted with restructuring. The ERM Report 2011 is available from http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1165.htm The database on support instruments for restructuring is available at http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emcc/erm/supportinstruments/ For further information, contact Måns Mårtensson, media manager, on email: mma@eurofound.europa.eu, telephone: +353-1-2043124, or mobile: +353-876-593 507.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0654	2011-11-24	UNK	Press release, 26 October 2011	"Eurofound co-organises a conference under the Polish EU Presidency on the links between working conditions and employee and company performances, in Warsaw, Poland on 26 October 2011: Improvement of working conditions can boost overall productivity (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Changes in workplace practices can positively impact and improve the overall performance of employees and productivity of a company, according to new research from Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU agency. European and Polish social policymakers will hear at an EU Presidency event in Warsaw, Poland, today that combining training, autonomous team work, flexible time arrangements, profit and ownership sharing schemes, and well functioning social dialogue as part of a strategic approach will enhance the economic performance. The event is organised jointly by the Polish Confederation of Private Employers Lewiatan and Eurofound, under the patronage of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister. The global economic crisis has made it abundantly clear that emerging economies can outperform many European countries in their production of low-value-added goods and services, but equally that there is growing demand for upmarket exports from emerging economies. To exploit its competitive potential, European firms need to be prepared to move up the value chain, but to do so is likely to require approaches to people management and conditions at the workplace that provide workers with higher levels of skills and the ability to unlock their discretionary effort. Eurofound has looked into the relationship between working conditions and both, employee and company performance, using a three-pronged research approach, reviewing academic literature of the past two decades on workplace practices, an analysis of Eurofound's second European Company Survey of over 27,000 European workplaces, and in-depth studies of practices in six countries. It found that while many companies introduce bundles of measures aimed at improving working conditions and enhancing economic performance, many do not have appropriate mechanisms in place to benefit from such measures. ‘We found that there is a serious potential for employee and company gains if working conditions and work organisation measures are appropriately implemented and managed"", says Radosław Owczarzak, research manager at Eurofound. ‘Our research also found that especially companies that are not doing so well can profit from these measures.' Eurofound's in-depth company case study research shows clear links between certain measures and increased performance. Systematic reviews of staff training needs, and giving staff training for new tasks and time off for training, are associated with good employee performance, and seem to have the greatest impact. Some practices, however, require critical mass to be successful. Eurofound's research show that at least 20% of staff much experience autonomous team work and flexible time arrangements for the schemes to have any impact. Eurofound research on job quality also shows that workers are more satisfied and motivated when they have a say in their workplace, can organise work autonomously, work in a flexible manner, increase wages as a result of harder work, improve their skills, and have a secure job and a career perspective. Performance pay schemes, as well as team and autonomous team working practices, for at least 25% of the employees, are all considered good organisational solutions which contribute to a good work climate and economic situation. Unfortunately, as Eurofound research shows the awareness among companies about these possible sources of improved performance is very limited, a determined joint effort from all key stake-holders, including employers and employee representatives, is required.

News in brief 84th Governing Board meets in Dublin Eurofound’s Director Juan Menéndez-Valdés and Deputy Director Erika Mezger (centre) welcomed members to the 84th meeting of the Governing Board, which took place in Dublin on 21 October. The new board was appointed in December 2010 for a term of three years.   Danes at the helm of EU Presidency In January 2012, Denmark will take over the reins of the EU Presidency for the next six months. Eurofound will bring its expertise to contribute to such issues as older workers and the demographic challenge, youth unemployment and training initiatives, and the impact of the economic crisis on living and working conditions. Eurofound’s input will feed into a range of conferences and events, starting with the European conference on active ageing in January. With many technical meetings during the Presidency scheduled to take place in Brussels, Belgium, the high profile conferences and events in the socioeconomic field at which Eurofound will participate will be held in the Danish capital Copenhagen during the first three months, and in Horsens on Jutland during the second three months. The social priorities of Danish EU Presidency are in line with the programme established by the Presidency Trio of Poland, Cyprus and Denmark. Multinationals rethink employee work-life balance Eurofound’s latest findings on work-life balance will contribute to a conference hosted by Eurofound in conjunction with the Global Employment Institute (GEI) of the International Bar Association. Taking place at Eurofound on 28 November, the event will explore trends in multinationals’ policies regarding work–life balance, and the implications for HR legislation. Set up in 2010 as a think-tank on global human resources matters, the GEI aims to tackle the key legal issues in HR and human capital for multinationals. Presentations from Eurofound’s survey findings regarding company measures to enhance the work-life balance of employees will feed into the roundtable debate. For further information, contact Manuel Ortigao (mor@eurofound.europa.eu). Understanding the needs of working carers The links between employment and caring are becoming more pertinent in Europe, with the rise in the number of older people needing care, as well as children and adults with disabilities or long-term illness in receipt of informal care. Recent Eurofound research explored various company initiatives that have been put in place in the Member States for workers who have informal care responsibilities. Around 50 case studies from across 11 participating countries were prepared, showing that employers that introduced measures to address the work–family needs of carers reaped benefits in terms of staff retention, employee motivation and productivity. Download the report Preparing workers for the economic upswing In the midst of the economic crisis, employers and trade unions are unanimous in their view that training is a vital tool, both for preserving existing employment and for preparing for economic recovery. In its thematic section, Eurofound’s annual review on industrial relations and working conditions explores the variety of training initiatives provided or supported by enterprises for their employees during the recession. Elsewhere, the report highlights the main developments in working conditions and industrial relations in the EU Member States and Norway in 2010, both at national and EU level. At European level, it reviews the year’s main events and trends in employment legislation and policy as well as in the European social dialogue at cross-sectoral, sectoral and company levels. At national level, it examines issues covered by collective bargaining (pay and working time) and looks in particular at company restructuring, the impact of the crisis and and pension reform in light of demographic change.

Taking the sting out of restructuring Structural change is an inevitable part of economic development. To adapt to changes in demand, technology or society, companies undergo restructuring to maintain or improve their competitiveness. While restructuring is an essential part of the dynamics of the European economy, it can have painful consequences for individual employees, companies and regions. The 2011 annual report of the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) looks at the range of instruments available across the EU to mitigate the negative effects of restructuring on both companies and employees. The report also presents an overview and analysis of restructuring activities in Europe over the past year as captured by the ERM. Eurofound has also created a comprehensive database of currently available instruments in the Member States, which can serve as a pool of ideas for public and private decision-makers confronted with restructuring.

Crisis management on the agenda in 2012 The social impact of the economic crisis in Europe and the way to recovery and job creation will remain at the heart of Eurofound research during 2012. The work programme for the coming year – the last of the current four-year programme – was adopted by Eurofound’s Governing Board on 21 October. As policymakers struggle to get public finances back into shape while trying to ensure growth and job creation, Eurofound aims to provide reliable, up-to-date data from the Member States, drawing on its monitoring tools to describe trends and offering case study research to show what works. Research projects planned for 2012 will also address the continued challenge of demographic change and feed into the related debate on a sustainable public sector. The overall objective is to finish work associated with the current four-year programme while developing a new framework for the period 2013–2016. The first results of the 3rd European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) are expected to be available by the end of 2012 and a number of reports based on detailed analysis of data collected in 2010 during the fifth wave of the European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) will also be published.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0660	2011-10-25	UNK	Press release, 11 October 2011	Eurofound publishes its Shifts in the job structure in Europe during the Great Recession report: The shrinking middle: where jobs were lost during the recession The first report of the European Jobs Monitor finds that despite a net loss of over five million jobs between 2008 and 2010, employment continued to grow in top-paying jobs, largely in knowledge-intensive services and business services. Meanwhile, sharp losses in medium-paying jobs in construction and manufacturing led to a shrinking of employment in the middle of the wage spectrum. More jobs were lost to men than to women and employment levels of older workers grew while those of younger workers declined. The new Shifts in the job structure in Europe during the Great Recession report describes the impact of the recession on the structure of employment in terms of occupations and sectors in the EU27, both at the aggregate and national level, during the 2008-2010 period. The report identified three main patterns of employment shifts at Member State level during the recession: upgrading, in which job growth was skewed to the top of the wage distribution; polarization, identified as growth in employment at the lower and upper ends of the wage spectrum, but contraction in the middle; and downgrading, in which job destruction was greater in higher-paid jobs while lower-paid employment either grew or suffered only relatively small declines. The report offers detailed comparative data on developments on the labour market at national level during the period. Women fared better on the labour market than did men during the recession, the report found, both in qualitative and quantitative terms. During the crisis, four ‘male’ jobs were lost for every one ‘female’ job. In fact, almost all the employment growth in the top quintile in the EU27 has gone to women. This was a result of the continued expansion of professional-grade jobs in the health and education sectors. Meanwhile, net female job losses have been exclusively in middle- and low-paid jobs: employment losses for females were highest in four bottom-quintile jobs, including retail salespersons, blue-collar workers in textiles/clothing manufacture and in agriculture. Job losses were particularly concentrated in male-dominated sectors such as construction and manufacturing in the middle of the wage spectrum. During the recession, there was a significant increase in employment among those aged between 50 and 64 years – 1.7 million new jobs. This employment growth took place across the wage spectrum, but was skewed towards top-paying jobs. For younger workers, those aged under 30 years, jobs were lost across the wage spectrum. There was a mixed picture in terms of employment status. There were marked losses in temporary jobs in the early phase of the recession; however, the greater part of employment growth from 2009 onwards took place in temporary jobs, though this growth has tended to be in lower-paying jobs. Part-time work has expanded across the wage spectrum, with gains more or less equally distributed between men and women.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0661	2011-10-25	UNK	Press release, 25 October 2011	Eurofound publishes the autumn edition of the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) quarterly, which provides an overview of restructuring activities in Europe: Restructuring activities slow down in 3rd quarter (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Announced job losses due to company restructuring activity declined in the third quarter, according to the latest edition of the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) quarterly. Job losses did, however, continue to outnumber job gains as they have done in every quarter since the onset of the 2008-9 recession. During the previous quarter, companies undergoing large-scale restructuring in the European Union announced nearly 60.000 job losses. The economic backdrop continues to be dominated by sovereign debt problems in the eurozone countries. Austerity programmes, which have begun to negatively impact public employment, especially in local and central government administrations, have not thus far been accompanied by the hoped-for handover from public to private demand. Within the EU, there are a number of different labour market stories reflecting very different trajectories during and after the 2008-9 crisis. Unemployment in Spain and Ireland continues to rise while other countries severely affected by the crisis - notably the Baltic states - show signs of a strong recovery. The German unemployment rate is at its lowest level in nearly twenty years (6%) despite a recent easing of growth while the UK unemployment rates is at an eighteen-year high (8.1%). Meanwhile in Greece unemployment has risen by 4 percentage points in the last twelve months. At EU27 aggregate level, these differences cancel each other out. Employment has remained stubbornly around the 10% level for 18 months. The recovery remains not quite but nearly jobless. A net increase of one million persons in employment between mid-2010 and mid-2011 compares meekly with the five million net decline in employment during the recession. The ERM recorded a total of 254 cases of restructuring during the third quarter of 2011, between 1 July 2011 and 31 September, up from 245 cases during the second quarter. Of these, 152 were cases of announced restructuring involving job loss, and 101 were cases involving announced job creation. Over the period, a total of 59,000 announced job losses (down from 93,500 in the previous quarter) and 31,000 announced job gains (down from 40,000 in the previous quarter) were recorded. Internal restructuring accounted for 70% of the announced job losses. Compared to the previous two quarters of 2011, the ERM recorded an increase in the restructuring job losses attributable to bankruptcies (20%) and closures (11%), while mergers and acquisition remained stable (2%). In terms of geographic distribution, the United Kingdom (9,256 jobs) and Netherlands (8,024 jobs), followed by Romania (6,575 jobs), Italy (4,525 jobs) and Poland (4,002 jobs) recorded the greatest number of announced job losses. The United Kingdom and Romania also featured on top of the countries with the highest job creation (5,597 and 4,456, respectively) without, however, job gains outnumbering total job loss. A comparatively high number of new jobs were also announced in France (4,005) and the Czech Republic (3,268). The ERM quarterly also features a special focus on Nokia Romania, following its announcement in September 2011 of its intention to close its factory in Jucu (Cluj, Romania), dismissing all 2,200 employees. The announcement comes three years after the Finnish multinational transferred activities from Germany to the then newly constructed Romanian plant.

NOTES TO THE EDITORThe European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) is a tripartite EU body that provides European social policymakers with comparative data, research and recommendations. The European Restructuring Monitor quarterly (ERM quarterly) offers an overview of the main findings and an interpretation of the data collected over the past three months for the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM). It provides statistics comparing restructuring activities across the 27 EU Member States and Norway, identifying the countries and sectors most affected. Each issue of the ERM quarterly will highlight developments in a specific country or sector, pointing to key facts behind the statistical data. In addition, background information on two major, recent restructuring cases will be presented.The data for this report was extracted on 7 October 2011. As the ERM continually updates cases in light of new information on recent cases, data reported here may not correspond exactly to later extractions. For previous editions of the quarterly as well as other ERM-related publications, visit the ERM website.

News in brief Collectively agreed wage increases lower in 2010 in Europe Eurofound's annual analysis of pay trends for 2010 finds that average collectively agreed nominal wage increases were lower than in 2009 in almost all countries studied. Moreover, real pay fell in some countries - such as the UK, Belgium and Austria. Source: Pay developments - 2010 Job structure changing in face of recession The ‘Great Recession’ resulted in the net loss of over five million jobs between 2008–2010. Despite this, however, employment continued to grow in top-paying jobs, largely in knowledge-intensive services and business services, according to a newly published report from Eurofound – Shifts in the job structure in Europe during the Great Recession. The report also finds that substantial losses in medium-paying jobs in construction and manufacturing led to a shrinking of employment in the middle of the wage spectrum. In part due to these changes in male-dominated sectors, more jobs were lost among men than women. In addition, employment levels for older workers grew while those of other sections of the workforce – in particular, younger workers – declined. Part-time work expanded across the wage spectrum while levels of temporary employment began to recover quickly from 2009 onwards, after having borne the brunt of the earlier job losses. This latest output of the European Jobs Monitor will be followed in the comings months by regular updates. Read more in the report Eurofound publishes latest Yearbook Eurofound’s second Yearbook looks at living and working in Europe in 2010 – a bird’s-eye view of the organisation’s policy-oriented research findings over the course of the year. The Yearbook outlines the main findings from a range of Eurofound’s key currents of research – in particular, results and analysis from its three pan-European surveys on company practices, working conditions and quality of life. All the surveys now enable Eurofound to draw some trends over time, crucial for understanding how Europe is developing and the challenges it is encountering. As detailed in last year’s publication, European governments and social partners are still dealing with the effects of the economic crisis; in many countries, short-time working schemes were extended or introduced as one response. Yearbook 2010 – Living and working in Europe outlines how such responses to the crisis may also provide an opportunity, highlighting ways of adapting such schemes to combine both greater flexibility and greater security. Such adaptation can only take place with the cooperation of the social partners: the Yearbook looks at what both trade unions and employer organisations are doing to meet the challenges of changing times. Download the Yearbook Supporting parents and children Good parenting is crucial for the wellbeing of children and its effects can accompany children through their schooling and into adulthood. By contrast, poor parenting has been identified as one of the factors that can contribute to maintaining disadvantage down the generations. On 26 October in Brussels, Eurofound will hold an expert workshop looking at parenting support, focusing on measures that seek to help parents boost the physical, intellectual and emotional development of their pre-school age children. The workshop will bring together experts in the fields of family support, parenting and childhood well-being to discuss the preliminary results of Eurofound’s research project; the discussion will feed into a report to be published in 2012. Gender pay gap persists Despite decades of legislation devoted to ensuring equal pay for men and women, the gender pay gap still stood at just over 17% in the EU27 in 2009, according to Eurostat data analysed by Eurofound in its annual update on pay. However, this average figure varies hugely across Europe, from 5% in Italy to more than 25% in the Czech Republic. And an analysis of the over 180 agreements that formed the background for Pay developments – 2010 shows that only a very limited number of collective agreements in a limited number of countries explicitly or implicitly contained some aspects that could have an impact on reducing the gap.

Active ageing - Europe's future Demographic change is one of the key challenges facing Europe. With people living longer than ever before and fewer children being born, an ever-smaller workforce will have to maintain a growing population of older people. This ageing of the population threatens Europe's economic performance and competitiveness, and the sustainability of social protection systems. However, improving the working conditions of older workers could help people remain in work longer, and so at least ease this dilemma. Tackling the impact of demographic ageing has for some years been a key element of Eurofound's research brief. The eighth session of the Foundation Seminar Series (FSS), taking place at Eurofound's Dublin premises from 7-9 November, will explore strategies, such as increasing training opportunities and health initiatives, that encourage people to remain in the workforce as they grow older. Findings from the seminar will be fed into the forthcoming European Year of Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations 2012, which aims to help older people play an active role in society.

Boosting performance in Europe’s companies Can changes in workplace practices improve the overall productivity of a company? So-called ‘high-performance work practices’ (HPWPs) have been discussed as a tool for boosting the competitiveness of European companies in the face of global competition. Eurofound research, using data from the 2009 European Company Survey, has looked at how such workplace practices as training, performance-related pay, social dialogue, team work and working time are associated with companies’ financial performance. The good news: using HPWPs is clearly related with improved performance. However, causality is difficult to prove. Meanwhile, some practices require a certain critical mass to be successful: for flexible working, for instance, to be seen to have an impact, at least 20% of the workforce must be engaged in it. And finally, companies that are already performing well might profit less from these measures than those that are not so successful. The findings are being presented at a seminar in Warsaw on 26 October, looking at the links between working conditions and company performance, jointly hosted by Eurofound, the Polish Confederation of Private Employers Leviathan and the Prime Minister’s Office.

Striking differences in annual leave across EU Substantial differences exist between EU Member States in terms of time off from work: when agreed annual leave and public holidays are added together, workers in Germany and Denmark have 40 days off per year. By contrast, workers in Romania have only 27 days; this difference equates to roughly two-and-a-half working weeks. Eurofound's recently published annual update on working time for 2010 looks at some key aspects of working time, including - in addition to annual leave and holidays - collectively agreed working hours, statutory rules for the length of working weeks and days, and gender differences in working time. Across Europe, men work more hours in their paid job than do women. In the EU15, men work 2.3 hours more per week than their female counterparts and in the new Member States, 1.5 hours more. And in Estonia, Greece and Sweden, men work at least three hours more per week. The report also finds that, in nearly all Member States, Europeans work somewhat longer in reality than their average collectively agreed hours would indicate.

News in brief France still has shortest collectively agreed working week in EU27 France still had the shortest average collectively agreed working week in 2010, at 35.6 hours. Collective bargaining plays an important role in determining working time in most of the EU, though to a lesser extent in some of the new Member States that joined in 2004 and 2007. Source: Working time developments – 2010 Spotlight on ethnically diverse neighbourhoods People who live in neighbourhoods that are ethnically more diverse are more dissatisfied with their immediate environment – in particular, with the perceived higher levels of crime and worse litter problems. Residents of such neighbourhoods are also more likely to live in overcrowded, poorer-quality housing and to suffer material deprivation. A recently published report from Eurofound looks in detail at the quality of life of residents of such neighbourhoods in the EU15. Importantly, most of those reporting such unfavourable circumstances are themselves native citizens of the countries in question (as are their parents), rather than individuals from ethnic minorities. Given the role that interethnic tensions play in eroding social cohesion, the report points to the examples of good practice from across Europe highlighted by the European network of cities for local integration policies for migrants (CLIP), as ways to promote cohesion and improve residents’ lives. Download Quality of life in ethnically diverse neighbourhoods and learn more about CLIP Workers from foreign backgrounds face disadvantage People from another country or from another ethnic group can face disadvantage in the labour market. In some countries, nationals who have a foreign background, or who are from another ethnic group, are more likely to work part time, or hold only temporary employment contracts. In addition, in some countries, such workers are more likely to work in the evening, at night or at weekends. A recently published report from Eurofound looks at the employment and working conditions of nationals with a foreign background and those with a different ethnic affiliation. It concludes that in many Member States, much remains to be learned about tackling work-related discrimination.

However, by contrast, the banking sectors in China, Brazil and Japan have so far escaped relatively unscathed, employment in the sector actually rising in those countries. A new report from Eurofound, Recession and social dialogue in the banking sector: a global perspective, looks at the impact of the crisis upon the sector, social partners' responses, and the role played by public authorities. It finds that, although the crisis has challenged European industrial relations systems, social partners have cooperated in dealing with the negative impacts on the labour markets. Collective bargaining has become more difficult but has intensified in Europe, being used to implement change in the sector. Download the full report Eurofound working with Polish Presidency Eurofound's contribution to the Polish EU Presidency - fostering discussion and disseminating research findings - continues. A number of Eurofound reports, addressing the themes of the gender pay gap, and how European citizens manage the reconciliation of family life and work, have been translated into Polish, to be disseminated at the Third European Congress of Women in Warsaw on 17 September. On 26 October at an event in Warsaw, Eurofound - in association with the Polish Prime Minister's office - will present the results of its research into the links between working conditions and company performance. And preparations continue for a joint conference on the integration of migrants and the social costs of labour migration, to be held in Warsaw on 17-18 November.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-september-2011-2

On 9 July, the Foundation’s Administrative Board approved the new four-year work programme 2005-8. The Foundation’s new four-year work programme takes account of the opportunities and challenges presented by the enlarged European Union. The programme underlines the importance of a comprehensive and integrated approach to these policy issues, allied with an effective communication strategy aimed at the Foundation’s key audiences across Europe. The aim is to channel knowledge from the monitoring activities and other research into understanding the challenges, supporting change in society and the economy, and providing its stakeholders with the information necessary for managing change. Looking ahead to the new Europe This work programme, the eighth four-year programme since the Foundation’s inception in 1975, is rooted in the challenges and objectives of the Lisbon strategy. The drive to make Europe the most competitive, knowledge-based economy in the world, to increase employment rates and improve the quality of employment, to stimulate innovation and entrepreneurship, while promoting social cohesion and inclusion – in short, realising the objectives of the Lisbon strategy – is the leitmotif of the programme. ‘There is an urgent need to move forward on all fronts – employment, competitiveness, good quality living and working conditions – at the same time,’ says Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s acting Director. Issues high on the European Social Agenda Over the last decade, the Foundation has provided its stakeholders and the general public with an extensive knowledge base of comparative data on industrial relations, working conditions and related aspects of living conditions. Many of the issues the Foundation has examined in recent years – like ageing, working time, and the information society – are now high on the European social agenda. The Foundation’s detailed work programme is approved on an annual basis by the Foundation’s Administrative Board.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-4-2004-4
EUROFOUND_UNK_0672	2011-09-02	UNK	Communiqué, issue 6, 2002	"Articles Work programme 2003 Quality of life central to the Foundation's work The Challenges of Enlargement Barriers remain for chronically ill and disabled people EMCC Web Portal is open for business Research in figures Brussels Liaison Office one year on Work programme 2003 A company survey on time, an Observatory on Working Conditions, a network of National Liaison Centres and a monitoring tool for the quality of life for Europeans will dominate the third year of the current four-year work programme of the Foundation. The Administrative Board of the Foundation unanimously approved the work programme for 2003 on 25 October last. The work programme acts as a guide for what will be produced and achieved at the Foundation in the coming year. 'In 2003 we will see the results of the reorganisation of our organisation,' announced Raymond-Pierre Bodin, Director of the Foundation. 'Despite budgetary constraints and limited human resources, we stay focused on achieving our goals. Quality of life for Europeans With the conceptual framework on living conditions and quality of life in place, the next step in implementing the strategy will go ahead in 2003. The statistical data already collected will be analysed as well as greatly enhanced with new information from an interview-based questionnaires on living conditions and the quality of life in the EU Member States and the candidate countries. 'The living conditions monitoring strategy will cover all 28 countries,' says Robert Anderson, research coordinator of the Living Conditions team. 'We are looking forward to results from the survey becoming available and beginning analysis of the data which will be the main focus in 2003.' The data collected through the monitoring activities will also be used to support strategic research activities of the Living Conditions area. Strategic research Studies will be conducted on the supply of quality jobs in care of children and older people living and home, and strategies to combat social exclusion and unemployment in disadvantaged groups. Results from the illness and inclusion project will be disseminated, hence contributing to the 2003 Year of People with Disabilities. The project on a new organisation of time over working life will be further developed and linked to the Foundation's new transversal project on the company-based survey of time. The Observatory on Working Conditions The establishment of an Observatory on Working Conditions - which it is envisaged will operate as an online monitoring tool to evaluate the quality of work and employment - is the focus for work of the Working Conditions section in 2003. 'The aim of the observatory,' affirms Pascal Paoli, research coordinator of the section, 'is to make information from the working conditions surveys and other research in the area of quality of work and employment over the past twelve years both more available and more visual to the Foundation's audiences.' In addition, data emanating from the sectoral surveys on working conditions in the road transport and hotels and restaurants sectors, which were completed in 2002, will contribute to conferences and other debates during 2003. 'Negotiating the conditions of flexibility', 'Review on the working poor' and 'Review on harassment/violence in the workplace' comprise strategic research projects and literature reviews which will be further developed and debated during the coming year. Expanding EIRO Coinciding with record levels of user sessions for the web-based European Industrial Relations Observatory - showing an increase of over 200% between 2001 and 2002 - the EIRO network will be expanded to cover all the candidate countries in 2003. 'The EIRO cross-country comparisons will be further developed to cover topics on the EU political agenda,' declared Stavroula Demetriades, research coordinator of the Industrial Relations section. 'These include topics such as collective bargaining on occupational pensions and on childcare and parental leave, and the regulation of employee Internet use. The strategic research project on financial participation will focus on new forms of financial participation, including SMEs. Company survey on time Time issues are in focus after recent developments such as working time reductions and increased working time flexibility. Previous research in the area will be extended by investigation through a company-based survey in 2003, involving all areas of the Foundation. 'Our intention is to facilitate analysis of time arrangements in relation to policies at sectoral, national and European level,' says David Foden, research manager of the Industrial Relations team. 'The survey should provide a representative overview of corporate time policies and their implementation, drawing on the perspectives of both company management and worker representatives.' European monitoring centre on change (EMCC) In the wake of the launch of the EMCC portal on the Internet in November 2002, the EMCC team will analyse material specially developed for the portal in 2003. Two specific projects will look at the role of the consumer in driving industrial change in the automotive sector, and the impact of globalisation on the textiles sector. 'The networking part of EMCC, which intends to bring together people to share good practice experience of change management,' says Jacques Terrenoire, EMCC project manager, 'will get a boost through our two workshops on financial markets and information and communication technology which were held in December 2002. Transversal themes Following the publication in 2002 of three Foundation papers, on Quality of work and employment, Access to employment for vulnerable groups and Quality of women's work and employment in 2002 (Dec 20), a further three papers are in the pipeline for 2003. These will cover topics around three of the Foundation's transversal themes: 'managing diversity', 'supporting social inclusion' and 'examining the changing use of time'. Developmental activities To match expected future demand, this part of the Foundation work programme is intended to identify and explore important issues which could contribute to the core areas of work. The aim is that these projects will assist in the preparation of the Foundation's next four-year work programme 2005-2008. For 2003, the results of the first phase of the developmental project on 'Working conditions, living conditions and industrial relations in the knowledge society' will feed into the core working areas and the EMCC to see in what ways these could be developed further. A workshop to explore the issues identified during the initial phase of the developmental activity on 'Mobility and migration into the EU: social and employment impacts' will be held during the first half of the year. Information and communication The information and communication team will be reinforced in 2003 with the establishment of a network of national liaison centres, whose task is to identify issues in the national debates which are important to the work of the Foundation. 'Following the success of the first Foundation Forum in August 2002,' declared Elisabeth Lagerlöf, head of information and communication, 'debates in selected Member States will be organised to siphon the most current social issues, which will form the subject of discussion at the second Foundation Forum in 2004. The Foundation's work programme 2003 is available for download from the Foundation website at www.eurofound.europa.eu/about/work/index.htm. Quality of life central to the Foundation's work The concept of quality of life is wider than living conditions, focusing on the scope individuals have to achieve better quality in life towards their own ends. The Foundation will focus on employment, economic resources, family life, community life, health and educational attainment in a survey on the 'quality of life of Europeans' covering 28 countries in 2003. The Foundation's four-year programme emphasises the need to link the Foundation's assessment of living conditions to the changing nature of employment, work organisation, and working conditions, and to the modernisation of social protection and social welfare services. ' ""Living conditions"" clearly embraces a very wide area of policy interest, with a particular need to map and understand disparities associated with age, gender, health, ethnicity and region,' asserts Raymond-Pierre Bodin, Director of the Foundation. 'Quality of life for Europe's population will be at the centre of the Foundation's work.' Defining 'quality of life' The concept report identifies the core issues around which the monitoring should focus and examines existing sources of information. It proposes that the conceptual framework should focus broadly on quality of life rather than narrowly on living conditions - quality of life viewed primarily in terms of the scope individuals have to achieve their own ends. It should seek to document resources as well as living conditions, and where possible key contextual characteristics of the various arenas in which people operate. 'An important task is to measure resources and living conditions through objective and descriptive indicators,' says Robert Anderson, research coordinator of the Living Conditions section. 'Another aim is to incorporate subjective information, and focus on the relationship between attitudes or assessments and resources and conditions, and seek to cover societal as well as individual well-being.' Multi-dimensional monitoring The report proposes that tracking change over time is at the core of monitoring, but in the case of multi-dimensional entities such as living conditions and quality of life, it is also necessary to probe the relationships between the dimensions, and between them and external factors. This is a more complex task than the regular measurement of trends in key indicators, but an analytical rather than descriptive approach adds value and provides an essential foundation for evidence-based policy. To that end, a limited number of core areas have been selected according to their centrality to the quality of life theme, their position on the EU policy agenda, and the feasibility of monitoring. These are the domains of employment, economic resources, family life, community life, health, educational attainment, housing, local environment and amenities, transport, public safety and crime, recreation and leisure activities, and cultural identity. The core focus will be on the first six domains. The second step: a 28 country survey Based on the framework, a searchable database of statistical indicators, specifically from comparable EU-wide data sources, has been developed. These and other existing data will inform analysis of the situation in both the EU and candidate countries. However, there is also a need for new information and this will be met in part by a 28 country survey on the quality of life of Europeans which will start in 2003. A questionnaire is currently being developed with specialists from across the EU and candidate countries. 'To assist in developing this work and in the interpretation of results, a network of experts, including representatives from each of the candidate countries, will be consulted,' says Robert Anderson. The Challenges of Enlargement Marjaana Valkonen, elected chair of the Foundation's Administrative Board on 25 October 2002, considers that the Foundation is well prepared to meet the challenges in its day-to-day work following enlargement. But she acknowledges that it will not be easy, at a time when there is a growing gap between the Foundation's already stretched resources and growing demand from stakeholders and the public. The work of the Foundation has become more visible during the past couple of years, which is of benefit to all of the Foundation's stakeholders, according to Marjaana Valkonen. She singles out as being especially valuable the working conditions surveys and information from the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). She also points to the great expectations arising from the newly established European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC). Ms Valkonen claims that the Foundation's research and results are deemed very useful, not only in shedding light in general on developments regarding living and working conditions, and industrial relations, but also in providing a solid, objective base of knowledge and advice for policy-makers in the socio-economic field at EU-level. According to her, the Foundation's Brussels Liaison Office has an important role to play in this process. 'The European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) continually refers to the Foundation in its work, and it remains highly committed to the future development of the Foundation, as does the Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe (UNICE),' affirms Ms Valkonen, who is head of the international department at SAK, Finland's largest trade union with 1.1 million members. 'However, the work of the Foundation is not particularly known nor used at national level, which is something I personally wish to change. To this end, I hope that the proposed National Liaison Centres (NLCs) will play an important role, as information facilitators.' Ms Valkonen would like to see the roles of the social partners in the candidate countries being put on a formal basis in order to facilitate the social dialogue, most importantly at EU-level. She also expressed the opinion that the European Commission proposal to further engage representatives of the civil society to improve representativeness in the candidate countries would not be of direct relevance to the Foundation. 'The civil society might be able to add value to the Living Conditions, perhaps,' she stated. 'However, only the social partners should be involved in the Foundation's work on working conditions and industrial relations.' Maintaining the tripartite structure Marjaana Valkonen is taking on the mantle of chair of the Foundation's Administrative Board for the second time. At the age of 50, Ms Valkonen is keen to be involved in the development of social Europe at this exceptional time. 'Enlargement is very important for us in Finland,' she says, 'and I want to contribute to making it work.' Regarding the current debate on the future governance of the Foundation, Ms Valkonen says she is keen to see the current tripartite structure maintained. 'Tripartism is the strength of the Foundation and what makes it unique among EU bodies,' she declared. 'While enlargement will increase the size of an Administrative Board to a level which might prove difficult to handle, I will not deviate from maintaining the tripartite structure.' INFOBOX New Chair: Marjaana Valkonen, representing the trade unions. Former Chair, Marc Boisnel, is re-elected vice-chair, representing the governments and flanked by fellow board member Kees Vos. Also elected as vice-chairs are Jan Willem van den Braak, representing the employers, and Bernard Jansen, representing the European Commission. Barriers remain for chronically ill and disabled people Despite measures taken by private and public actors, barriers preventing chronically ill and disabled people entering employment and allowing their full participation in society still exist, hindering the realisation of the Lisbon European Council's ambitions of high levels of employment and social inclusion. The Foundation is active in researching and promoting social inclusion measures and contributed recently to the first European Round Table Conference on Poverty and Social Exclusion on World Poverty Day on 17 October in Aarhus, Denmark organised by the Danish Presidency and the Commission. 'Foundation research shows that despite measures already taken by private and public actors in regard to chronically ill and disabled people, many barriers remain to be removed and policies need to be reassessed,' says Philippe Bronchain, research manager in the Living Conditions team who participated at the event. 'The inclusion of this group in society and in employment brings us one step closer to reaching the objectives of the Lisbon summit of improved levels of employment and social inclusion.' Common objectives on poverty and social exclusion were agreed by the EU at Nice in December 2000, followed by the adoption of national actions plans in June 2001. Further information is available from Teresa Renehan, Information Liaison Officer, e-mail: ter@eurofound.europa.eu EMCC Web Portal is open for business The Foundation's European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) has just launched an Internet portal which aims to provide European institutions, public authorities, social partners and companies with the data and information they need to anticipate and manage change. The European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) was established in 2001 with the support of the European Parliament, the EU Council of Ministers, the European Commission and the social partners at European level. The EMCC is a place for exchanging practice, information and ideas on the management and anticipation of change. The Internet portal aims to provide reliable information on change and change processes, and encourage and support knowledge sharing and learning. 'Change is often described and discussed in the abstract, but its impact is all too practical. It affects companies' performances and development, as well as the careers and family lives of employees,' affirms Janet Smith, research manager in the EMCC unit, at the launch of the Internet portal in Brussels on 21 November 2002. 'For this reason, anticipating change, identifying the risks and opportunities it presents and knowing how to make best use of both risks and opportunities are important elements in the successful management of change.' The EMCC is a place for exchanging practice, information and ideas on the management and anticipation of change. The Internet portal aims to provide reliable information on change and change processes, and encourage and support knowledge sharing and learning. The EMCC community EMCC will identify business strategies and policies that support the process of change in socially acceptable ways, through data collection, analysis, investigation and networking. To achieve this, the EMCC team is building an EMCC community involving management and workforce of companies, the social partners and local authorities. 'Managing change requires solid partnerships and commitment,' emphasised Barbara Gerstenberger of the EMCC team. 'It is built on dialogue and a common understanding of the challenges and the opportunities change brings.' The European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) was established in 2001 with the support of the European Parliament, the EU Council of Ministers, the European Commission and the social partners at European level.

Research in figures Enlargement and collective bargaining coverage Despite lower levels of collective bargaining coverage in the candidate countries, an enlarged European Union will still outperform the levels of coverage in Japan and USA. The coverage of collective bargaining - the proportion of workers who have their pay and conditions set, at least to some extent, by collective agreements - varies greatly between the European Union, Japan and USA. In the EU, the coverage of collective bargaining is generally high, with differences between countries shown in the systems of proper sectoral agreements, of extension of sectoral collective agreements and intersectoral agreements. Direct bargaining coverage is relatively low in the enterprise-dominated systems of Japan and the USA. The USA is very much divided between the 'union sector', where collective bargaining determines pay and conditions, and the 'non-union sector', where management decisions govern pay and conditions. In the candidate countries there is generally a lower level of bargaining coverage than in the current Member States, with an average rate of around 40%. The exceptions to this are Slovenia, Cyprus and Malta (and to a lesser extent Slovakia and Hungary). Direct collective bargaining coverage Country Coverage Belgium c.100% Austria 98% Sweden 94% Finland 90% France 90% Denmark 85% Spain 81% Netherlands 78% Average of 12 EU Member States 78% Germany 67% Portugal 62% Luxembourg 60% Average of 9 candidate countries c.40% UK 36% Japan 21% USA 15% Sources: figures for EU Member States and candidate countries - referring to various years from 1999-2002 and in some cases estimates - are as calculated by EIRO for the EIRO/ILO report 'Industrial relations in the candidate countries' (July 2002); the figure for Japan (2001) is from the Japanese Information Network; the figure for the USA is from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Inside the Foundation The Brussels Liaison Office one year on The Foundation's Brussels Liaison Office has got off to a flying start by establishing cooperation frameworks with the European Economic and Social Committee and the European Parliament, whereby the Foundation contributes its expertise at the beginning of the legislative work. As part of its new information and communication strategy aimed at strengthening relations with the EU institutions, social partners, and representatives from the civil society, the Foundation set up a liaison office in Brussels in early 2002. The underlying aim is to facilitate and improve communication with the Foundation's EU-level target audiences. The day-to-day business of the office involves participating at relevant conferences, group and committee meetings, and initiating briefings and meetings with various EU decision makers. The office is headed by Sylvie Jacquet, a native of France and a committed European. 'The attitude towards the Foundation has changed a lot in Brussels,' says Sylvie Jacquet at the end of her first year in the job. 'The image of the Foundation as a ""grand old lady"" has been replaced by that of a professional and dynamic organisation with a high level of expertise on issues that are essential for EU citizens.' Tapping in to the legislative process The liaison office established two cooperation agreements with the European Economic and Social Committee and the European Parliament in 2002. The agreements aim to establish a process whereby the Foundation contributes its expertise at the beginning of the legislative work processes in both institutions. The cooperation may take various forms, ranging from specific meetings with rapporteurs to presentations of Foundation results at seminars and study groups. In 2002, the protection of temporary workers and the representation of women among the social partners of the EU were some of the issues to which the Foundation brought its expertise, and which resulted in the Foundation's work being quoted in the final opinions and reports. On the cards for 2003 In 2003, the Brussels Liaison office will play an increasing role in advising the experts at the Foundation on emerging issues of importance at EU level. In 2002 the Foundation's monitoring tools were expanded to include the candidate countries. During the coming year, the Brussels Liaison Office will set about developing specific activities directed at the future new Member States. The office also envisages a closer and possibly more formal cooperation with the Directorate-General for Enlargement of the European Union. Finally, the Liaison Office plans to extend cooperation agreements to the European Commission and to the Council, which should ensure that the Foundation's input to the EU legislative process is a rule rather than an exception.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0673	2011-07-27	UNK	Press release, 27 July 2011	 Eurofound publishes its annual update on working time developments in the European Union 2010: European workers spend more time at work (DUBLIN, IRELAND) The actual working week of full-time employees was longer than the average normal collectively agreed working week in almost all EU Member States in 2010, according to Eurofound's latest annual update of working time developments. This effectively reverses the trend, visible since 2006, of a narrowing gap between actual and collectively agreed working hours. The report also finds that average annual leave entitlements combined with public holidays add up to an EU average of 35 days; however, the difference between countries at the two ends of the leave spectrum is huge - almost two-and-a-half working weeks. Working time developments 2010 looks at a number of aspects of working time in the European Union and Norway in 2010, and it provides a general overview of the present state of play and recent developments. Collective agreements set the working time conditions for an average of three quarters of all workers across the European Union, with large differences between countries. ‘Collective bargaining remains an important role in determining the duration of working time in most of the countries, though to a lesser or sometimes negligible extent in some of the new Member States that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007,' says Juan Menéndez-Valdés, Eurofound's Director.   Across the EU27, the average agreed working week was 38 hours long in 2010, an increase of 0.1 hours in relation to the 37.9 recorded in 2009, and 38.6 hours in 2008 and 2007. In the 12 new Member States (NMS), the working week remained at 39.7 hours, which means that the gap between older and newer Member States was slightly reduced from 2.2 to 2.1 hours in 2010. The average collectively agreed working week in the EU15 was 37.6 hours, an increase of 0.1 hours in relation to 2009.   The manufacturing sector together with the local government sector recorded the longest average agreed normal weekly working hours with 37.8 hours, followed by the banking sector with 37.4 hours. The agreed weekly working hours are higher in all three sectors in the 12 new EU Member States than in the former EU15 Member States. The largest gap is in the banking sector, in which the normal agreed working week in the NMS is 3.1 hours longer than in the EU15. In the local government and metalworking sectors, the gap is 2.7 hours and 2.4 hours respectively.   In the EU27, the actual working week was 39.7 hours in 2010, 1.7 hours longer than the agreed working week. In the EU15 it was 39.4 hours, 1.8 hours more than the agreed hours. Meanwhile in the NMS, it was 39.9 hours, 0.2 hours longer than the agreed working week for that group of countries. The longest actual working weeks, for full-time employees in their main jobs in 2010, were in Romania (41.3 hours), followed by Luxembourg, the UK, Poland, Germany, Bulgaria, Estonia and the Czech Republic. The shortest actual working week was in Finland (37.8 hours). This was 3.5 hours more than in Romania, giving Romanians a working week that was longer by 9.24%. And in 2010, the actual weekly hours of male employees working full time in their main jobs continued to exceed those of their female counterparts in all countries considered. An important factor in the overall duration of working time is the amount of paid annual leave to which workers are entitled. Across all the countries of the EU27 (and Norway) for which data are available, the average collectively agreed entitlement is 25.4 days. Agreed annual leave entitlement in the EU15 varies from 30 days in Denmark and Germany to 25 days in Finland, France, the Netherlands (and Norway) to 24.6 days in the UK and 24 in Ireland. In the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Slovakia and Romania, the average collectively agreed paid annual leave is 24.1 days.   The number of public holidays (excluding those falling on Sundays) varied across the EU in 2010, from 14 in Spain to five in the Netherlands. The average figure for the EU27 was 9.6 public holidays, with the NMS having, on average, fewer (8.7 days) than the EU15 (9.9). The combined total of agreed annual leave and public holidays varied in the EU from 40 days in Germany and Denmark to 27 days in Romania - a difference of around 48% or two-and-a-half Romanian working weeks. The average figure for the EU27 was 34.4 days - 35.7 days in the EU15 and 29.6 days in the NMS.

NOTES TO THE EDITOR The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) is a tripartite EU body that provides European social policymakers with comparative data, research and recommendations. Working time developments 2010 looks at a number of aspects of the duration of working time in the European Union and Norway in 2010, based mainly on contributions from the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) national centres. It considers a number of topics: the average weekly working hours as set by collective agreements, both economy-wide and for three specific sectors; the statutory limits on weekly and daily working time; the average actual weekly working hours; the annual leave entitlement, as set by collective agreements and law, and the estimates of average collectively agreed annual working time.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0674	2011-07-26	UNK	Press release, 1 July 2011	"Helping Europe's next generation to work (Brussels, Belgium)  The unemployment rate for young people aged between 16 and 24 years in the EU27 is twice as high as the overall rate of unemployment, participants at the conference ‘Working Together for Youth Employment: A Global Challenge’ on 30 June 2011 in Brussels, Belgium, were told. The event, co-organised by four EU Agencies Cedefop, EU-OSHA, ETF, Eurofound and hosted by the Employment Committee of the European Parliament, gathered policy-makers and experts from European social partners, European institutions, and representatives from the civil society, to discuss findings and formulate options on what policies could put the Europe’s next generation to work.  Across Europe, specific initiatives by governments or social partners have been implemented such as developing work opportunities or policies aimed at increasing young people’s employability and entry to the labour markets. ‘The 4 million young people unemployed in the European Union is huge challenge for Europe,’ said László Andor, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, in his keynote address. ‘Our ""Youth on Move"" initiative provides an agenda with action to develop jobs for young people.’ The panel debate focused on the need invest in young people, to create jobs and opportunities, and not succumb to the notion of a lost generation. ‘Young people want to work and contribute. It is key for Europe to invest in jobs for the young generation,’ said Emilie Turunen, MEP (DK-Greens). ‘We need to eliminate obstacles for young people to get a job,’ said Steven D´Haeseleer from Business Europe.  The number of young people not in education, employment or training (NEET) has increased over the last few years, the conference heard. New research from Eurofound show that the cost of NEETs is EUR100bn/annum, spread over resource costs and public finance costs. ‘Youth unemployment is an excessive cost to society, and we cannot afford this, not in terms of money nor in terms of human lives,’ said Pervenche Berès, MEP (F-PS) and Chair of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee.  Many contributors regarded education and training is key to unlock the potential of the young on the labour market. However, the approaches are different across the EU. ‘Some countries, the “clever” ones, have not cut education budgets and this is a key message of the European Commission,’ said Pierre Mairesse, Director for Lifelong learning, horizontal policy issues and EU 2020 strategy in the European Commission. MEP Marian Harkin (IRL-ALDE) echoed the same opinion: ‘Ireland has become again a country of emigration, with austerity measures focused on cutting back rather than investing. This mindset has to change,’ she said. Matching skills with jobs, at university level as well as occupational training level, were also discussed. Luca Scarpiello of the European Youth Forum pointed out that it's not just the low skilled that are finding it hard to find work. ‘We need more quality in internships to help young people getting working experience,’ he said. This was echoed by Christian Lettmayr, Acting Director of Cedefop, who pointed out that those who hold vocational qualifications are more likely than general education graduates to have a job. The conference also heard special addresses by Saïd Aïdi, Minister of Vocational Training and Employment in Tunisia, and Ahmed Hassan El Borai, Minister of Manpower and Migration, Egypt, both focusing on the right to organise labour the labour market. ‘180.000 young graduates in Tunisia are looking for a job,’ said Minister Saïd Aïdi. ‘We are passionate about creating a better future for young people in Tunisia.’   The conference on Youth Employment provided an open and frank exchange of policies, research findings and good practice examples. ‘The EU Agencies have today demonstrated the complementarity and importance of their work on youth employment’, said Pervenche Berès, MEP and Chair of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee.

Fieldwork for third EQLS begin Fieldwork for Eurofound's third European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) is starting in September. Carried out every four years, this unique, pan-European survey examines both the objective conditions of European citizens' lives, and how they feel about those circumstances, and their lives in general. The EQLS looks at a range of issues, such as employment, income, education, housing, family, health and work-life balance. It also looks at how satisfied people are with different aspects of their lives, their levels of overall happiness and how they perceive the quality of their societies. In its first iteration in 2003, the survey then covered 28 countries. This third wave will cover the 27 Member States of the EU, Norway, and the EU candidate countries and potential candidate countries of Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey. Interviews are expected to be completed by the end of November and in the case of larger countries (with larger sample sizes) by the end of the year.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0676	2011-07-26	UNK	Press release, 20 July 2011	 Eurofound publishes the summer edition of the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) quarterly, which provides an overview of restructuring activities in Europe during the second quarter of 2011: Sharp differences in how EU Member States recover from the economic recession (DUBLIN, IRELAND) The EU economy continued to grow over the last quarter with more positive data in particular from core economies, according to the latest edition of the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) Quarterly. However, problems of sovereign debt management persist in several eurozone Member States, leaving them stagnant or recessionary. The public sector is experiencing the largest number of job losses, while the greatest number of new jobs are found in the manufacturing sector, mainly since Europe’s the car makers are recruiting again.  The EU economy continued to grow over the last quarter with more positive data in particular from core economies. Within the EU, sharp contrasts remain between a fast-recovering, fiscally less-challenged core group of Member States and a more stagnant or recessionary periphery. Yearly growth rates within the single currency zone range from -4.8% for Greece to +4.8% to Germany. Differences in overall economic performance are reflected in the labour market where the key indicator ranges from near full employment in the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Austria to over 20% unemployment in Spain. Compared with March 2011, the number of persons unemployed fell by 165 000 in the EU27 and by 115 000 in the euro area. Compared with April 2010, unemployment decreased by 702 000 in the EU27 and by 457 000 in the euro area.  The ERM recorded a total of 245 cases of restructuring during the second quarter of 2011, between 1 April 2011 and 31 June, down from 358 cases during the first quarter. Of these, 145 were cases of announced restructuring involving job loss, and 100 were cases involving announced job creation. Over the period, a total of 93,440 announced job losses and 40,183 announced job gains were recorded. Internal restructuring accounted for 78% of the announced job losses. Closures (6%) and bankruptcies (3%) remained stable compared to the first quarter of 2011. Outsourcing, offshoring and relocation accounted for 7% of announced job losses. In terms of geographic distribution, United Kingdom (21,231 jobs) and the Netherlands (19,700 jobs) recorded the greatest number of announced job losses, followed by Italy (12,969 jobs) and Spain (8,532 jobs). France was by some margin the country with the most announced job gains (12,220 jobs). Further new jobs in the quarter have been announced by Poland (7,059 jobs), Slovakia (3,680 jobs), the Czech Republic (3,490 jobs) and Germany (3,350 jobs). During the quarter, the public administration sector reported the largest number of announced job losses (33,222 jobs) followed by financial intermediation (18,559 jobs), manufacturing (18,119 jobs) and transport and communications (6,513 jobs).  Also during the quarter, the manufacturing sector recorded the highest number of announced new jobs (14,660). This represents over 36% of the total job creation in this quarter. As noted in recent quarterly periods, also in this last quarter, job creation in manufacturing tended to be concentrated in auto manufacturing with 9,200 announced new jobs.

Download the new ERM quarterly NOTE TO THE EDITOR The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) is a tripartite EU body that provides European social policymakers with comparative data, research and recommendations.  The European Restructuring Monitor quarterly (ERM quarterly) offers an overview of the main findings and an interpretation of the data collected over the past three months for the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM). It will provide statistics comparing restructuring activities across the 27 EU Member States and Norway, identifying the countries and sectors most affected. Each issue of the ERM quarterly will highlight developments in a specific country or sector, pointing to key facts behind the statistical data. In addition, background information on two major, recent restructuring cases will be presented. The data for this report was extracted on 5 July 2011. As the ERM continually updates cases in light of new information on recent cases, data reported here may not correspond exactly to later extractions.

The issue of young people (aged between 16 and 24 years) who are not in education, employment or training (the so-called ‘NEETs’) has been extensively debated. However, recent Eurofound calculations, looking just at the costs of social welfare payments and the contributions to gross national product (GNP) that these young people are unable to make, puts a preliminary figure of the cost to society of €14,000 per NEET, of which €11,000 represents unpaid contributions and €3,000 represents benefits payments. The findings were presented at a seminar (co-organised with the EP Committee on Employment and Social Affairs) on 30 June. Eurofound, in collaboration with three other EU agencies, presented findings on the theme ‘Working together for youth employment – From education to the workplace: a global challenge’.

The impact of the crisis on SMEs Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play a vital role in national economies in the EU and account for a significant proportion of employment in all Member States. However, in some countries, such as Hungary and Ireland, the crisis has had a severe impact on them, causing many to cease operations and resulting in a fall in employment in this segment of the economy. A new report from Eurofound examines how governments and social partners have sought to help SMEs weather the crisis, how local partnerships have helped SMEs maintain employment during this turbulent time, and presents the views of the social partners on the situation of such companies. It also looks at the extent of social dialogue in these smaller enterprises. The report finds that – in many countries – working conditions and working hours are more flexible and informally arranged than in larger companies, as is the manner in which work is organised. Moreover, the crisis seems to have made companies seek to become more flexible, as they try to cope with shifting external circumstances and demands.

I am happy that my work here is characterised by much freedom and responsibility.’ Maarten Koomen, from the Netherlands, is one of Eurofound’s current trainees, interviewed for a series of short articles in which trainees share their experience and encourage other potential candidates who may be considering applying for the scheme. Underlining its reputation for excellence in socioeconomic research, Eurofound received over 1,100 applications for places in its 2011 paid traineeship programme. Traineeships provide young university graduates with hands-on, professional experience of working in an EU body – in functions as diverse as research, human resources, finance and media. Towards the end of 2011, Eurofound will begin its recruitment campaign for traineeships for 2012. For more information, see the traineeships page.  Avoiding hardship in old age With the percentage of older people in Europe’s population rising ever higher, concern is growing about the adequacy of pensions to meet people’s needs after they retire. State pensions have come under pressure due to cuts in public spending; turmoil in stock markets has reduced the value of many occupational pensions; unemployment and reduced savings have left many people vulnerable. Meanwhile, retirees may face higher costs – especially for healthcare. In the face of such obstacles, earning at least some income after retirement can help people better meet their own needs (others, of course, may work because they want to). To learn more about the issue of post-retirement employment, on 26 July Eurofound is holding an invitation-only expert workshop on the theme of income after retirement. Topics for discussion will include the prevalence of such employment, how employers facilitate or discourage older workers from re-entering the workplace, and preliminary results from studies in three countries. The results of the workshop and country studies will feed into a report, contributing to the European Year of Active Ageing in 2012. Social partners seek to green economy In the face of climate change and increasing resource constraints, social partners across Europe have come together in the effort to ‘green’ the economy, as outlined in a report from Eurofound launched in the European Parliament on 30 June – Industrial relations and sustainability: the role of social partners in the transition towards a green economy. Greening the economy – producing products and services with less energy, fewer material resources and reduced carbon emissions – is becoming increasingly important in EU policymaking. The report outlines five cases of social partner initiatives to create workplaces and production processes that have less of an impact upon the environment. They include a training system for the use of green technologies in the French construction sector, jointly managed by the social partners; worker–management cooperation in UK workplaces to reduce energy use; and social dialogue in the German aluminium industry that seeks to boost resource efficiency. Contributing to the Polish Presidency As Poland takes up its Presidency of the EU, Eurofound is planning its contributions to the programme of events. On 6–8 July, the 19th European Social Services Conference was held in Warsaw under the auspices of the Polish Presidency. As part of the event, Eurofound organised a workshop on ‘Measures to promote volunteering by older people’. Meanwhile, planning is underway for a major joint conference in November in Warsaw on migration and mobility.

Highlighting benefits of better quality of work Employers can put in place a number of workplace measures that both boost the quality of work and benefit company performance – most significantly, by providing training. Better-trained workers are better able to use technology and to meet customer demands; it is also less expensive for employers to train existing staff rather than to hire new recruits, and more beneficial for the employees, who enjoy internal career development and greater employability. A new report from Eurofound examines the links between quality of work and employee and company performance. While measuring the actual impact of interventions on working conditions can be difficult, in-depth company case study research has indicated clear links between certain measures and increased performance. Apart from the example of training, clearly defined career paths (as well as employment security) boost employee loyalty and sense of ownership, which in turn benefits performance. And better health and workplace safety reduce absenteeism and increase employee satisfaction.

IN BRIEF News in pictures Planting the seeds of future success On 1 June, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, László Andor (right), visited Eurofound and discussed such key policy issues as flexicurity. Also pictured (left to right) are Barbara Nolan, Head of the European Commission’s Representation in Ireland, Juan Menéndez-Valdés, Director of Eurofound and Erika Mezger, Eurofound’s Deputy Director. News in brief Social dialogue improving working conditions The EU labour market has changed considerably over the past few decades, becoming more flexible both in terms of working time and work organisation. On top of that, the proportion of women in the workforce has increased sharply. However, women still are underrepresented in the workforce and tend to leave when they have the responsibility of looking after children or elderly relatives. Reconciling work and family is a core issue for EU policy – in terms of employment and of health and well-being. A recently published report from Eurofound uses data from Eurostat’s Labour Force Survey, as well as Eurofound’s European Company Survey of 2009, to examine a number of issues. These include employment rates for men and women, the impact that having children has on labour market participation, how flexible forms of working can help workers balance the demands of the work and the household, and how satisfied Europeans are with their work–life balance. Reconciliation of work, private and family life in the European Union is available for download Older people making a difference As part of its contribution to the European Year of Volunteering 2011, Eurofound has just published a new report, Volunteering by older people in the EU, which examines the contribution that older European citizens make as volunteers in their community. Research findings, and experience on the ground, make it clear that volunteering in old age can help promote older people’s social inclusion, boost their sense of well-being and strengthen their self-esteem. Based on data from 30 case studies in 11 Member States, the report is being launched at the 19th European Social Services Conference in Warsaw on 6–8 July in cooperation with the Polish Presidency of the EU. Strategies to promote active ageing are becoming ever-more important policy priorities as Europe undergoes an historically unprecedented ageing of its population. The report also highlights how Member States that lack a cultural history of volunteering can benefit from the exchange of good practice. Download the report Ethnic entrepreneurs key part of European business In Frankfurt, at least every fifth business is run by a foreign national. In 2005 in Vienna, a detailed analysis counted nearly 80,000 ethnic businesses. Entrepreneurs from ethnic backgrounds are becoming increasingly important in Europe’s economic life; two new case studies from Eurofound detail the progress made by the cities of Frankfurt and Vienna in assisting entrepreneurs develop their businesses and enter into the city’s economic fabric. The case studies are part of the fourth and final research module of the European network of cities for local integration policies for migrants (CLIP), which provides an overview of policies and programmes for promoting of ethnic entrepreneurship as part of a local economic development and integration strategy for migrants.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0686	2011-05-17	UNK	Eurofound News May 2011 - Fostering solidarity between young and old	Important notice! If you would like to receive Eurofound News by email (10 issues a year), please sign up now. Fostering solidarity between young and old Reconciling the different needs of younger and older people, and aligning them with those of society overall is a considerable challenge for policy makers. Europe is facing a demographic challenge in terms of its ageing population; European policy seeks to encourage more older people to enter and remain in the workplace. At the same time, youth unemployment and its accompanying risk of social exclusion and alienation is a real issue in many Member States. As part of its contribution to informing the policy debate on these issues, Eurofound marked the recent European Day of Solidarity between Generations on 29 April, highlighting on its website a range of its research that has looked at different aspects of age, work and quality of life. The featured reports and articles address such themes as the role that volunteering can play in fostering the inclusion of older people in society, the ongoing debate over the raising of the retirement age in Member States, age discrimination, and how social partners and public authorities have sought to help younger workers over the course of the crisis.

IN BRIEF News in pictures Eurofound plans 2012 work programme On 3 May, Eurofound held its annual seminar to develop the first draft of its 2012 annual work programme, which will mark the end of its current four-year programme for 2009-2012, Europe at work: Better life and opportunities for all. Pictured at one of the breakout sessions to discuss research proposals for next year are (left to right) Eurofound staff Maija Lyly-Yrjänäinen, Jan Vandamme, Peter Kerckhofs, Branislav Mikulić, and Eurofound's Deputy Director Erika Mezger.  News in brief Investigating interfirm relationships Companies operating in the private sector do not operate in a vacuum: clearly, they are entirely reliant upon their markets. Moreover, companies exist in an often complex web of relationships with suppliers, partners and companies in business clusters. In recent decades, new forms of interfirm relationship have emerged - largely in response to the pressures of competition - such as joint ventures, clusters, public-private partnerships, strategic alliances and virtual company networks. Drawing on case studies of 20 companies, a new report from Eurofound, Impact of interfirm relationships - employment and working conditions, investigates a number of these different forms of relationship and how their emergence has affected employment practices, human resource management and working conditions in the companies concerned. One of the study's findings is that different types of relationship appear to have different impacts on work intensity and the stress levels experienced by employees. For instance, in relationships in which one large partner dominates and is able to dictate conditions, greater work intensification was reported.  Entrepreneurship among Europe's ethnic minorities When members of Europe's ethnic minority communities decide to take the step of becoming entrepreneurs it brings a range of benefits for themselves, their communities and the wider society. Ethnic entrepreneurship boosts employment, creates a new network of social and economic relations and the injection of new commercial activity can help renew urban environments. A forthcoming report and series of case studies from Eurofound looks at the extent of entrepreneurship among minority communities in Europe's cities. Initially, the case studies looking at the particular experience of Frankfurt and Vienna will be published on 24 May and presented at a meeting of the European network of cities for local integration policies for migrants (CLIP) in Frankfurt. Read more on ethnic entrepreneurship Social dialogue improving working conditions A key factor in ensuring that social dialogue in the workplace can contribute to better working conditions is to have established a structure for identifying problematic working conditions in the first place. Such a structure can incorporate formal sub-committees, the input of outside experts, or such supplementary information channels as employee surveys. This is one example of what has been learned from the experience of social partner cooperation in 23 company cases, explored in a new report from Eurofound, Social dialogue and working conditions. The research explored, in particular, the role of social dialogue in tackling three of the most topical themes in terms of working conditions - work-related stress, musculoskeletal disorders and policies for older workers.

Boosting employment in face of restructuring An innovative approach to restructuring could boost employment levels in the Termini Imerese region of Sicily, Italy, despite the imminent closure of the local Fiat Lancia production plant, as the latest issue of Eurofound’s European restructuring monitor quarterly outlines. At the start of next year, the closure of the plant will mean the loss of 1,500 jobs at the plant and 600 jobs in supplier companies. However, a planned reconversion of the plant – involving seven automotive and non-automotive projects – has the potential to boost employment by 50% more than its present level. Among the planned projects are luxury car manufacturing, the production of small electric cars, solar energy development, horticultural projects and television production. In addition to presenting regular updates on job gains and job losses from the European Restructuring Monitor’s (ERM) network of correspondents across Europe, each issue of the ERM quarterly highlights developments in a specific country or sector and looks in detail at major, recent cases of restructuring.

IN BRIEF News in pictures Following Eurofound on Facebook   To keep track of Eurofound's latest findings and its ongoing research on Facebook, click on the Facebook logo: News in brief Preparing for the upswing? In times of economic crisis, when skills development becomes even more necessary, European companies' efforts to promote training would seem to have diminished. And where training is conducted, businesses focus on their core competencies rather than on more transversal skills, which are also essential for competitiveness. For these reasons, according to a new comparative report from Eurofound, it is vital that public financial support put in place to assist companies in providing training to their employees during the crisis be maintained so that workers and enterprises are better equipped to take part in economic recovery. Preparing for the upswing: training and qualification during the crisis, examines training initiatives provided by enterprises for their employees across the Member States, looks at the effectiveness of training as a way of dealing with the effects of the crisis on enterprises and describes a range of crisis-related policy measures for supporting training. Download the report Boosting employment through local partnerships Local employment initiatives that comprise public-private partnerships are a promising route for developing employment and growth in the face of the economic crisis; however, scope remains to make more effective use of this resource. This is according to a new report from Eurofound, which focuses on how such local public-private partnerships (LPPPs) are being used across Europe to counteract the impact of the crisis on labour markets. Local employment development (LED) initiatives typically involve a range of actors, including public authorities, public employment services, local employers, chambers of commerce and social partners. Gaining momentum since the 1990s, LED policies are recognised at European level as an important tool for boosting employment prospects. Many LPPPs for employment are financed by the European Social Fund, and this recognition and funding has helped catalyse their development; the report notes that this EU project-based funding has played an important countercyclical role. Read Joint public-private local partnerships for employment to cope with the recession Sectoral industrial relations converging The sectoral level has been promoted as an important level of European social dialogue, with 40 European sectoral social dialogue (ESSD) committees having been created since 1998. Does this mean that industrial relations in sectors have become more comparable across Member States? A new report by Eurofound - From national to sectoral industrial relations: Developments in sectoral industrial relations in the EU - examines industrial relations in nine sectors and concludes that the differences between sectors within a country tend to be larger than those between countries within the same sector. This is especially true for sectors that are exposed to international competition: the telecommunications sector, for example, shows very similar characteristics with regard to industrial relations across borders, but is not necessarily typical of the industrial relations regime prevalent in a given Member State. Other sectors, like hairdressing and beauty treatment, continue to follow national patterns. Download the report Preparation underway on third EQLS Eurofound is busy preparing for the third wave of its European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS). Starting in September, Significant GfK (Belgium) will interview over 40,000 European citizens in more than 30 European countries. In the meantime, pretesting of the survey questionnaire is currently being conducted in both French (in Belgium) and in English (in the UK). As part of the pretesting, questions that are being introduced for the first time in the survey will also be examined in greater detail to ensure their clarity and viability. Further technical testing of the survey tools will be carried out prior to their rollout in September.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0693	2011-05-06	UNK	Press release, 5 May 2011	Eurofound  launches the spring edition of the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) quarterly, which provides an overview of restructuring activities in Europe in the first quarter of 2011: Announced EU job losses and job gains almost level (DUBLIN, IRELAND) The recovery across the EU are taking two divergent patterns, according to the latest edition of the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) Quarterly, with Germany, central Europe, and the Baltic countries enjoying strong growth and improving labour markets while the debt-laden ‘periphery’ countries stagnate amidst serial announcements of retrenchment. The narrowing gap between announced job losses and job gains on the ERM over the last number of quarters provides further evidence of economic recovery and the resumption of employment growth. The EU economy has had positive growth for five consecutive quarters but the picture of economic performance across the region is anything but uniform, with an upswing in Germany, Poland, Baltic and Scandinavian economies and stagnation in ‘the periphery’. The contrasts are especially apparent in the labour market where the key indicator ranges from near full employment in the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Austria (all below 5% unemployment) to over 20% unemployment in Spain. The ERM recorded a total of 358 cases of restructuring during the first quarter of 2011, between 1 January 2011 and 31 March. These cases involved 98,448 announced job losses and 69,025 announced job gains. Internal restructuring accounted for nearly 90% of the announced job losses. The decline in closures and bankruptcies recorded in the first quarter of 2010 lends support to hopes of recovery. While the extent of merger and acquisition remains marginal, the ERM reports a marginal increase in offshoring in this quarter (2.5%) compared to the previous three-month period (1%). In terms of geographic spread, the UK (37,772 jobs) recorded the greatest number of announced job losses, ahead of Poland and France with respectively 17,574 and 13,826 announced job losses. These same countries are also those recording the highest number of job gains, though job losses continue to outnumber job gains. The highest number of job gains was announced in France (21,137 jobs) followed by the UK (11,919 jobs) and Poland (11,481 jobs). The manufacturing sector reported the largest number of announced job gains (23,165) in the first quarter of 2011. This represents over 33% of the total job creation in this quarter. The second-ranking sector was retail with 15,770 job gains, followed by the real estate and business activity sector (13,715 new jobs) and transport and communications (6,840 new jobs). Over half of the job creation recorded in the manufacturing sector in this quarter is concentrated in auto manufacturing which shows encouraging signs of recovery. Public administration reported the largest number of announced job losses (32,210 jobs), followed by transport and communications (29,673 jobs), manufacturing (16,728 jobs) and mining (7,202 jobs). The narrowing gap between announced job losses and job gains on the ERM over the last number of quarters provides further evidence of economic recovery and the resumption of employment growth. Some private sector job creation will, it is hoped, go some way towards mitigating the large public sector job losses announced recently in many Member States. The IT sector is one of the few sectors that has continued expanding its recruitment over the past decade but interest from students and recent graduates appears to be relatively low. This is thought to be due to fewer people taking IT courses, a rise in the number of graduates choosing not to work in IT over the past five years, and pay for IT roles lagging behind that for positions in other sectors.

NOTE TO THE EDITOR The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) is a tripartite EU body, whose role is to provide key actors in social policymaking with findings, knowledge and advice drawn from comparative research. Eurofound was established by Council Regulation EEC No 1365/75 of 26 May 1975 and is located in Dublin, Ireland. The European Restructuring Monitor quarterly (ERM quarterly) offers an overview of the main findings and an interpretation of the data collected over the past three months for the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM). It will provide statistics comparing restructuring activities across the 27 EU Member States and Norway, identifying the countries and sectors most affected. Each issue of the ERM quarterly will highlight developments in a specific country or sector, pointing to key facts behind the statistical data. In addition, background information on two major, recent restructuring cases will be presented. The data for this report was extracted on 5 April 2011. As the ERM continually updates cases in light of new information on recent cases, data reported here may not correspond exactly to later extractions.

Contributing to debate on Pact for the Euro At the end of March, the European Council adopted the Pact for the Euro as part of the EU's response to the sovereign debt crisis. Designed to guarantee the stability of the euro area, the Pact emphasises the importance of increasing competitiveness and promoting employment, along with strengthening and stabilising public finances. One of its proposals - that competitiveness could be improved by adjusting wage-setting arrangements or wage indexation mechanisms (which are 'automatic' procedures for adjusting wages) - has sparked considerable debate, with wage indexation having been held responsible by some for fuelling inflationary pressures. To contribute to the debate, Eurofound has brought together a series of its findings on the issue. The situation remains complex: where inflation levels are low, wage indexation systems can be sustainable and profitable; its supporters also argue that it can in fact foster wage moderation; and it is seen by some as a way to minimise wage-related industrial conflict.

Youth unemployment - closing the gap Youth unemployment has long been a problem for most EU Member States. The recession has exacerbated the situation, as those young people who have jobs are often the first to lose them and those seeking employment are struggling to find it; even if they do find jobs, it is often under precarious, non-standard working conditions. A new report from Eurofound looks at efforts to improve the situation. It finds that national governments have taken the lead in many countries in this regard - for example, by providing more apprenticeships and vocational training, particularly for low-skilled youth and young immigrants and establishing second-chance learning opportunities for school drop-outs. However, during times of reduced state spending and economic decline, this can lead to tensions around the aim of keeping older people in work for longer.

IN BRIEF Research in brief Nordic countries show highest rates of volunteering The levels of volunteering differ markedly across the EU, with the highest rates of participation seen in the Nordic countries, as Eurofound's new resource pack outl­­ines.       Source: European Quality of Life Survey 2007 News in brief Social dialogue bringing gains in the health care sector Social dialogue in Europe's health care sector has brought a number of gains, contributing in many countries to improved wages, better terms and conditions, improved health and safety measures, and greater equality of opportunity, according to a new report from Eurofound. In addition, social dialogue has contributed to a better awareness of stress, violence and occupational health risks, while improving access to training. In light of the sector's key role in ensuring the health of the European population, particularly given the growing numbers of older people, encouraging more workers to enter and enabling them to remain in the sector is of vital importance - a goal that social dialogue has the potential to further. However, as the report also points out, tightening budgetary constraints have - in a number of countries - made many of the above improvements impossible. Download the report Employment and industrial relations in the health care sector Green economies - the next big trend? The transition to a more sustainable, 'green' economy is expected to be the next big development in restructuring, according to opinion at a trilateral round table meeting of Canada, the European Commission and the US hosted by the US Department of Labor, on February 3-4 in Washington, DC. Recent Eurofound findings on the role of social partners in assisting this transition to a green economy were presented at the meeting; they outlined cases in a number of EU Member States where social partners have created projects and campaigns to enable and support a more sustainable society. They include such initiatives as training programmes for energy efficiency in the construction sector, and workplace cooperation in undertaking energy saving measures. The findings will form part of a report to be published later this year. Boosting skills levels across the Union Eurofound's latest Foundation Seminar Series, dealing with the challenge of developing skills across Europe, concludes with its second session on 7-9 March, in Madrid. The first session, in December, outlined an overview of employment and training in Europe. In addition, participants presented training initiatives that have been developed across Europe to address skills needs against the backdrop of the crisis and recession. In this second session, national delegations at the invitation-only event outlined how each of their countries is meeting the challenge of boosting skills levels. Discussions also focused on incentives for training and lifelong learning, skills recognition systems and the future demand for skills. Read more  European agencies outline their work Eurofound is one of the longest-established European agencies, having been created in 1975. Many more have been set up since then and today the agencies form an important part of the EU's institutional landscape. Responding to needs identified by the EU and its Member States, they perform a variety of legal, technical and scientific tasks across a broad range of policy areas. From 31 January to 3 February, Eurofound played a key role in hosting - with its sister agencies - a joint exhibition in the European Parliament's premises in Brussels. The exhibition presented the work of the agencies in four thematic clusters: transport and satellite infrastucture; education, business and innovation (in which Eurofound's work was displayed); freedom, justice and security; and health, safety and environment.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0701	2011-03-16	UNK	Press release, 15 March 2011	Eurofound publishes its new Foundation Focus ‘Work and health: a difficult relationship?’: Working longer requires better working The improvement of working conditions throughout a worker’s career is a necessary condition to enable workers to continue to work for as long as possible. But what constitutes good working conditions, and what is required to allow older workers to remain in work? The new Foundation Focus explores the complex relationship between work and health, and asks European social policymakers what they will do to tackle the challenges of work and health, and an ageing society.   The new Foundation Focus provides insights and new research data and findings on the increasing levels of stress and work intensity. It finds that work-related stress is on the increase as a result of complex organisational decision-making, and it explores the effects of high work demands on health, especially in relation to cardiovascular diseases and mental health problems. It argues that stress is not caused by work alone, but by conflicting demands on people, both in their working and non-working lives.  For Europeans, work intensity has increased over the past 20 years – more workers work at high speed, work to tight deadlines, or have their pace of work driven by more demands. In the EU27, nearly 60% of workers say that that they have to work at very high speed for at least a quarter of their working time. By reducing the physical strain of work as well as the stress caused by the intensity of work, workers are more likely to stay in their jobs longer.  The Foundation Focus also offers a snapshot of workers’ attitudes towards ageing and training in the workplace, taken from the latest edition of the European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS 2010). They show that the percentage of workers in the EU27 that think they will be able to do their current job at the age of 60 has risen marginally from 57% in 2000 to 59% in 2010. There are, however, big differences between countries: over 70% of workers in the Netherlands and Germany feel able to do their job at 60, compared to only 26% of workers in Slovenia. This percentage of workers thinking they will be able to do their job at age 60 closely corresponds to the actual percentage of older workers in the respective workforce. Out of the ten Member States with the lowest percentage of  workers expecting to be able to do their job at age 60, seven Member States are also in the bottom ten in terms of the proportion of workers aged 50 and older in the workforce. Several good practice examples of how companies and organisation deal with work and health, and an ageing work force, form part of the publication. Among them are MOL, the Hungarian oil and gas group, which has integrated employee health as part of the company’s management philosophy, the NHS and their programme to deal with mental health issues of their workforce and the Belgian Federation for Hospital Institutions and their innovative efforts to retain older workers in the health care sector.  Download Foundation Focus   For further information, contact Måns Mårtensson, media manager, on email or telephone: +353-1-204 3124, and mobile: +353-876-593 507.

Spotlight on volunteering in Europe Data from across Europe present a mixed picture in terms of the level of volunteering in this, the European Year of Voluntary Activities Promoting Active Citizenship. There are substantial differences between countries in terms of their traditions of volunteering, differences associated with levels of economic development and expenditure on social services. Moreover, people who are more satisfied with their lives overall are more likely to engage in voluntary activities than those who are not. Eurofound's latest resource pack - Volunteering: a force for change - uses data from both its European Quality of Life Survey of 2007, and from Eurostat's Standard Eurobarometer 2010 to shed light on the phenomenon of volunteering and its role in promoting social inclusion, aiding skills development and strengthening community ties. It also raises pointers for policy debate - not least the fact that people with lower levels of educational attainment tend to volunteer less, which may indicate relatively high thresholds in terms of skills levels being sought of volunteers.

These are some of the examples of initiatives being taken to boost the health of European workers, outlined in the latest edition of Eurofound's biannual magazine, Foundation Focus, which looks at the myriad dimensions of health and working life. The Focus also reports on the conference Eurofound co-hosted with the EU Belgian Presidency - ‘Working longer through better working conditions, new modes of work and career organisation' - in November of last year. Topics covered in the Focus include the impact of job loss on health, working time and work intensity, stress at work and steps that companies can take to assist employees who are caring for disabled or elderly relatives.

IN BRIEF Research in brief Internal restructuring chief source of job loss Eurofound's European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) recorded 88,449 announcements of job losses and 46,861 announced job gains between 1 October 2010 and 31 December 2010, in 305 separate cases of restructuring. Internal restructuring accounted for close to 80% of the announced job losses, closure for over 8% and bankruptcy for over 7%.    News in brief Information and consultation practices across Europe Introduced in March 2002, Directive 2002/14/EC gave employees the right to information and consultation on a range of business, employment and restructuring issues; Member States were given a deadline for implementation of the directive by March 2005. More than five years on, a new report from Eurofound looks at information and consultation practices across the EU and in Norway. It finds that the directive required extensive legislative reform in those countries that lacked a well-established employee representation system. Overall, the incidence and coverage of information and consultation arrangements varies significantly between countries, with larger enterprises more likely to have a system in place. In most countries, guaranteeing employee rights to information and consultation depends on either employee or union efforts to establish appropriate arrangements. Management attitudes towards information and consultation and a lack of active promotion of it by the social partners in a number of countries influence its impact. Download the report Information and consultation practice across Europe five years after the EU Directive Public sector restructuring initiatives on the rise Restructuring measures appear increasingly to be affecting public sector employment as a result of widespread public spending cuts, as the latest European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) quarterly from Eurofound shows. Out of a total of around 88,000 announced job losses in the final quarter of 2010, by far the greatest numbers were announced in public administration - 23,000. Next were health and social work, auto manufacturing and construction (with around 6,000 announced job losses in each), and financial intermediation (with over 5,000 jobs announced lost). The largest case of restructuring-related job losses was the announcement in November of an early retirement scheme and redundancy package designed to cut 5,000 jobs in Ireland's public-sector Health Service Executive (HSE) by the end of 2010. Read the latest ERM quarterly Eurofound work on financial services Eurofound's work on the financial services sector continues with the publication of a series of case studies - The impact of investment funds on restructuring practices and employment levels. A companion publication to a report published last year, this looks at 24 cases of company restructuring in seven Member States. Meanwhile, new findings from Eurofound examine in detail the impact of recession upon the banking sector, and social partner responses. Due to be launched at the third UNI Finance conference in Lisbon, Portugal on 16-17 March, the findings arise from a Eurofound seminar held in Rome in November last, which took a global perspective on the theme.

Decentralisation of wage bargaining Everywhere, companies are being forced to adapt to the pressures arising from the economic crisis. Collective agreements acknowledge this need for adaptation: though often negotiated with the aim of covering an entire sector, they can contain so-called ‘opening clauses'. The clauses allow negotiations to take place at company level, these negotiations taking account of the specific competitive needs and problems of the enterprise. In a new report, Eurofound looks at the specific case of company-level wage agreements that deviate from pay norms set under sectoral agreements. The report provides detailed information on regulations and practices for seven EU countries - Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Spain. It concludes that - in most of these countries - opening clauses have not had a major effect on the collective bargaining systems, which have been remarkably stable. However, they have played a key role in Germany, triggering a process of decentralisation and changing the basic structure of collective bargaining.

Part-time work - a career dead-end? Part-time work has been on the increase over the last two decades, with nearly one in five Europeans now working on some form of part-time arrangement. Largely, it is women who work part time - 32% of women in the EU worked part time in 2009, compared with fewer than 9% of men. But what are the implications of this rising trend for individuals and companies? A new report, Part-time work in Europe, combines data from two Eurofound surveys, the European Company Survey and the European Working Conditions Survey, to see how part-time work is distributed - across sectors, across countries and according to gender. It highlights the multifaceted issues surrounding part-time work and finds that, for the moment, while part-time workers may enjoy a better work-life balance, they earn less and lose out on access to training and career advancement. Part-time jobs in high-skilled management positions do exist, but they are still very much an exception.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0709	2011-02-17	UNK	Press release, 16 February 2011	Eurofound launches a resource pack on ‘Volunteering – a force for change’: Is volunteering for everyone? More than one in five are involved in volunteering, according to new analysis from Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU Agency. The findings show that a person involved in volunteering is most likely a middle-aged, well-educated male with a higher income – and is most likely to volunteer in sport activities. The resource pack entitled ‘Volunteering – a force for change’, out today, looks at the phenomenon of volunteering across the European Union, and provides insights into differences between countries, how companies encourage volunteering, and makes a case for using volunteering as a measure to include elderly people in society. The European Year of Volunteering emphasises the relevance of volunteering for all nationalities and social groups. But the popular conception of volunteering is of a primarily middle-class activity, which doesn’t engage older people. In addition, in some Member States there has traditionally been little involvement in volunteering, reflecting a lack of trust in civil society organisations. Data from both Eurostat’s Standard Eurobarometer 2010 and Eurofound’s European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) cast more light on the phenomenon of volunteering. The EQLS data indicate that, in general, people with higher incomes are more likely to volunteer, as are those with higher levels of education and better health. There is no strong association with gender overall, but men in the EU15 tend to participate more than women. While age is not a major factor, it does appear that people aged between 35 and 64 are more likely to volunteer than those who are younger or older. The Eurobarometer study looks at the areas in which people volunteer. Its data underline the importance of volunteers in supporting sports activities: some 80% or more of those who provide services in the field of sports are volunteers. The other major areas in which volunteers are active are education and culture, social welfare and religious or church organisations. The formerly communist countries of central and eastern Europe provide a good example of how strongly volunteering is influenced by political and social traditions. These countries’ communist legacy did not favour a culture of volunteering. However, nowadays, participation in voluntary and charitable activities in some of the new Member States (NMS) is above the EU average, as indicated by data from the EQLS; albeit with large cross-country variations. For instance, in Estonia more than 30% of citizens participate, as against slightly fewer than 10% in Poland.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0710	2011-01-24	UNK	Press release, 24 January 2011	Eurofound launches the winter edition of the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) quarterly, which provides an overview of restructuring activities in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2010: Public sector restructuring initiatives on the rise While the EU technically emerged from the recession eighteen months ago, growth continues to be sluggish, hesitant and unequally spread, the latest edition of Eurofound’s European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) quarterly shows. Restructuring measures appear increasingly to be affecting public sector employment as a result of widespread public spending restrictions and cuts. Unemployment in the European Union has been stable at 9.6% over the last six months but labour market performance -  continues to vary widely across EU member states. Some countries are experiencing robust growth, notably Sweden, Poland and Germany, while others have stagnant or contracting economies, even when not technically in recession – such as Greece, Ireland and Spain. Over the last quarter (1 October to 31 December 2010), the ERM reported 304 cases of restructuring of which 172 were cases of restructuring involving job loss.  Total announced job losses were approximately 88,0000 in the quarter as against announced job creation of just over 47,000. The public administration sector reported by far the largest number of announced job losses (23,000) followed by health and social work (6,126), construction (6,045) auto manufacturing (6,018) and financial intermediation (5,282 jobs). As in the previous quarter, the second-ranking sector was computer and related activities with 7,121 job gains, just ahead of the retail sector recording another 6,306 new jobs. Fewer, albeit significant, job gains were also announced in other business activities (4,375 jobs) and financial intermediation (3,050). The largest case of restructuring-related job losses in the ERM relates to the announcement in November of an early retirement scheme and redundancy package designed to cut 5,000 jobs at Ireland's Health Service Executive (HSE) by the end of 2010, followed by Birmingham city council reducing its workforce by one third over the next four years, and car manufacturer Renault which plans to shed 3,000 jobs in France over the next three years. One of the largest cases of job creation was announced in Ireland where British supermarket chain Iceland aims to create over 2,000 new jobs over the next four years. The merger between French company Atos Origin and Siemens IT Solutions and Services will lead to a large recruitment drive aimed at filling between 7,000 and 8,000 new positions globally of which 1,600 will be in France. Also, BNL-BNP Paribas, one of the main banking groups operating in Italy, plans to recruit 1,500 people by the end of 2012. The report also provides a sector focus on the European postal sector. It has undergone considerable restructuring in recent years, driven by EU directives fixing deadlines to remove legal monopolies on all postal services. The postal sector is important to the EU economy, as it is estimated to generate around 1% of EU GDP and employs some 1.7 million workers. The special report on Austrian Post AG provides an insight into the pressures on established incumbent postal service providers throughout the EU while also showing some innovative paths to restructuring in former state monopolies via the transfer of workers to other functions within the public sector. The new ERM quarterly is available here. For further information, contact Måns Mårtensson, media manager, on email or telephone: +353-1-204 3124, and mobile: +353-876-593 507.

Eurofound was established by Council Regulation EEC No 1365/75 of 26 May 1975 and is located in Dublin, Ireland. The European Restructuring Monitor quarterly (ERM quarterly) offers an overview of the main findings and an interpretation of the data collected over the past three months for the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM). It will provide statistics comparing restructuring activities across the 27 EU Member States and Norway, identifying the countries and sectors most affected. Each issue of the ERM quarterly will highlight developments in a specific country or sector, pointing to key facts behind the statistical data. In addition, background information on two major, recent restructuring cases will be presented. The data for this report was extracted on 6 January 2011.

News in brief Coping with stress at work Work-related stress is a growing concern for both employees and employers. Associated with such medical conditions as cardiovascular disease and musculoskeletal disorders, it is also a significant cause of absence from work - a major cost for companies. A recent report from Eurofound uses data from across Europe to build a comprehensive picture of the origins and impacts of work-related stress. Not surprisingly, it finds that workload, the intensity of work, long working hours and high levels of demands contribute to stress; notably, however, it also finds that more autonomy and control over one's work helps workers in dealing with high levels of demands. Organisational change is also a source of stress - one UK survey finding it the third most-cited factor, and - in the face of recession - greater job insecurity, greater work demands and more reorganisation and restructuring has increased stress levels. However, where change is communicated clearly and employees are involved this reduces uncertainty and hence stress. Download the report Spotlight on European industrial relations The Eurofound website is a key source of information on industrial relations at both European and national level. Eurofound's easy to use online reference tool, the European Industrial Relations Dictionary, is undergoing its annual update to keep abreast of - for this year - changes in European legislation following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. The dictionary contains almost 300 alphabetically listed entries, features concise definitions and relevant contextual information on such uniquely European concepts as ‘posted workers' and ‘direct effect', and provides hyperlinks to EU legislation and case law. Since its launch in 2005, it has become one of the most popular Eurofound products. Visit the dictionary at www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/index.htm. Tackling the challenge of skills development On 6-8 December, Eurofound held the first session of its latest Foundation Seminar Series at its premises in Dublin. This series, the seventh since the programme began in 2004, looks at how best to raise skills levels across Europe and hence boost the workforce's employability. Key topics for both sessions are developing incentives for lifelong learning for employees and companies, and matching demand for skills. The December session presented an overall picture of employment and training in Europe, highlighting the impacts that labour market trends may have on skills, competence needs and lifelong learning. In addition, participants present the training initiatives that have been developed across Europe to address skills needs against the background of the economic crisis. For the second session - to be held in spring of this year - national delegations will outline how each of their countries is meeting the challenge of boosting skills levels. Read more about this event Flexibility comes as a package Working time is one area where most companies try to be flexible. But flexibility can also be achieved through using temporary agency workers, fixed-term contracts, variable pay and teamwork. A recent Eurofound report, using information from the European Company Survey (ECS), shows that different flexibility measures are not used in isolation but rather are combined in packages, with different goals in mind when introducing the measures. In some cases, the type of flexibility introduced is dictated by the nature of the product or the product market. In other cases, attracting and motivating employees is the main objective. The type of flexibility that a company employs is associated with the sector of economic activity as well as the country it is operating in.

Eurofound's new Director takes office On 1 December, Mr Juan Menéndez-Valdés took up the position of Director at Eurofound. He sees the agency as having a wide range of key strengths: ‘Eurofound has a good reputation in terms of the quality of its data and a good number of experts in a wide range of fields, who can provide information vital to the whole process of policy making to improve living and working conditions across Europe'. Challenges and goals He is also aware of the challenges facing Eurofound: ‘The key challenge is to be visible, and to be different. On the one hand you have this kind of 'competition' among the growing number of agencies, which are dealing with an ever-increasing range of issues, so the first challenge is for Eurofound to be known, and for us to position it clearly as a European body contributing to the European agenda. On the other hand, there is also the challenge of ensuring that Eurofound is different, that it does not overlap or duplicate the work of other agencies dealing with similar issues, albeit from different perspectives - EU-OSHA in Bilbao, Cedefop, or the new Institute for Gender Equality. The challenge here is to have a distinctive added value in comparison with different bodies and agencies. Apart from that, we have two main objectives, which are established in our work programme: to be a reliable source of quality information and to strengthen our tripartite character.' Working through social dialogue Mr Menéndez-Valdés can draw upon his professional experience when discussing the situation of Europe's agencies, having been Chair of the Governing Board of Cedefop between 2007 and 2009; he also draws attention to the differences between the two agencies: ‘There are a lot of common issues. The governance of the two agencies is more or less the same: they are the same size, their Governing Boards have the same composition, and the dynamics among the stakeholders are very similar. However, it is maybe easier to find consensus among different parties when the subject matter is vocational education and training, than in, say, working conditions or industrial relations; nevertheless, this is the story of social dialogue and social partnership - the work gets done to find common ground.' Future directions for Eurofound Looking ahead, Mr Menéndez-Valdés sees where Eurofound needs to go: ‘We need to focus more on linking with the key political issues; we are dealing with a wide range of issues at the same time. And I think that at times it is difficult to have real impact with that approach. So we may need to look at focusing on a smaller number of issues, but going into greater depth, and that way add value.'

Director's diary This issue of Eurofound News marks a profound transition in the organisation's history. Jorma Karppinen leaves the organisation on 30 November at the end of his five-year mandate, to be replaced by Juan Menéndez-Valdés. Mr Karppinen sought to boost Eurofound's efficacy in meeting its goals, by driving the organisation-wide implementation of a one-stop-shop project management tool and the development of a comprehensive system of indicators to evaluate Eurofound's corporate performance. During Mr Karppinen's tenure, Eurofound's research capacity was greatly boosted by an intensive recruitment drive for research expertise and the research work itself underwent profound changes, having had to quickly adapt to the altered social and economic circumstances of the financial crisis and recession; another transition reflected in its work is the ending of the 10-year scope of the Lisbon Strategy, and its replacement by the new Europe 2020 strategy, which it will fall to Mr Menéndez-Valdés to implement in the body of Eurofound's work. Mr Menéndez-Valdés takes up the post of Director on 1 December; prior to this, he was responsible for education and training, and employment and migration issues at the Spanish Confederation of Employers' Organisations. Furthermore, since 1999, he has been a member of the Governing Board of Cedefop, Eurofound's sister agency (which deals with vocational training), serving as chair of the Board from 2007 to 2009. Eurofound wishes Mr Karppinen well in his next ventures, and welcomes Mr Menéndez-Valdés to a new chapter in the agency's history.  	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-novemberdecember-2010

Working conditions slow to improve The working conditions of Europeans have not - overall - dramatically changed over the last decade, according to the first findings from Eurofound's fifth European Working Conditions Survey, released at a joint conference with the Belgian EU Presidency on 16-17 November. For instance, work intensity remains at a high level for many, the extent to which workers can make their own decisions about how they do their job has not improved (leaving a large number of workers ill-equipped to deal with work's demands) and European workers remain as exposed to physical hazards as they did 20 years ago. However, in 2010 in the EU15, training paid for by employers was at its highest level since 1995 for the EU15, with 34% of workers receiving training in the last 12 months. And around 60% of workers feel that they would be able to do their current job at the age of 60, a marginal increase since 2000.

Of all European workers, 14% are employed in the commerce sector, which links manufacturers with around 493 million consumers in the EU every day. Change is expected to remain a constant feature in the sector, even when the overall economic situation stabilises. However, the social dialogue needed to manage this change is poorly developed: experience to date of social dialogue in the sector has, in most countries, not been very positive. Moreover, data from Eurofound's European Company Survey indicates that collective bargaining coverage and the degree of employee representation in the sector is generally low. Given this deficit, improving and extending social dialogue is a prerequisite for managing change. Read more about this event Presidency draws on Eurofound experience In searching for measures to promote the social inclusion of older people, EU policies give special attention to encouraging volunteering. In a conference in Brussels on 6-7 December, ‘Volunteering as a means of empowerment and social inclusion - a bridge between the European years 2010 and 2011', Eurofound is running a workshop examining the potential for this. The conference, organised in Brussels by the European Volunteer Centre, bridges the European Year of Social Exclusion (2010) and that of Volunteering (2011). Previous Eurofound research on the subject has been recently published in a working paper that looks at experiences in five Member States. The paper draws a number of conclusions from these experiences - for instance, that it is important that flexible ways of participation be possible for older people (through, for example, short-term projects or clearly defined, manageable tasks). A key factor for success is the opportunity to gain new skills. Download the report Public sector loses most jobs In light of huge national debts resulting from the financial crisis, cost-cutting in the public sector has had a marked impact on job losses, as recorded by Eurofound's European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) over the third quarter of 2010. Of all sectors, public administration had by far the greatest number of job losses (as announced in the media in the last quarter), with nearly 70,000 jobs gone. This was followed by auto manufacturing (with more than 7,000 jobs lost), finance-related services (6,000 jobs) and health and social work (over 5,000 jobs). Despite the extensive job losses in the automotive sector, however, there are also signs of recovery: some companies that had dismissed employees due to the recession are now rehiring. In fact, the sector announced the most new jobs (nearly 7,000) in the last quarter. Download the latest ERM quarterly Social dialogue in the banking sector - the global view Recent Eurofound research has looked in detail at the impact of the financial crisis and recession upon the banking sector; most recently, on 22-23 November, Eurofound held a conference ‘Social dialogue and recession in the banking sector' in Rome, which looked at industrial relations in the sector from a global perspective, comparing the challenges faced by the banking sector in the EU with those in Japan, the US, Brazil, China and India, and seeking to develop a better understanding of how social dialogue can play a role in coping with recession. Participants included professionals working in banking services, as well as representatives of governments, NGOs, trade unions and employer organisations.

Short-time working and flexicurity Short-time working and temporary layoff schemes have the potential to act as a concrete implementation of flexicurity, according to the annual report for 2010 from Eurofound's European Restructuring Monitor (ERM), presented at the European Employment Forum in Brussels on 24 November. In the face of falling demand and slumps in production, short-time working and temporary layoff schemes are being used to reduce working time while - often using public funds - protecting workers' incomes and company solvency; frequently, the time spent not working is used for training instead. The report examines these schemes in detail: it finds that they offer internal numerical flexibility for the employer, and job and income security for the employee; where training is conducted, this contributes to employment security. The report also proposes that the genuine consensus that has been achieved among social partners in formulating these schemes could be harnessed to develop reduced working time schemes in a more active policy direction.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0720	2010-11-23	UNK	Press release, 24 November 2010	Eurofound launches the 2010 Annual Report of its European Restructuring Monitor (ERM), ‘Extending flexicurity – the potential of short-time working schemes’: Europe’s short-time working schemes good example of how labour market adjustment costs are shared (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Costs of labour market adjustment can be more widely shared in publicly subsidised short-time working schemes, according to the 2010 Annual Report from the European Restructuring Monitor, presented at the European Employment Forum in Brussels today. Just as the last two decades saw a reorientation from passive to active labour market policy, so should a flexicurity-aligned system of short-time working adopt a more active stance, Eurofound argues in its report. Never before have short-time working schemes been so prominent as in the last two years. Many Member States expanded their existing schemes and others introduced them for the first time. Such schemes have been widely seen as successful in alleviating the worst effects of this very serious recession. Working time reduction was particularly prevalent in Germany, Belgium, Italy, France, the United Kingdom (UK) and Sweden. This contrasts with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Portugal, Slovenia, Hungary, Spain and Lithuania, where most of the net adjustment was due to job losses. All in all, the number of economic short-time workers, not necessarily on publicly subsidised schemes, tripled to almost two million between 2008 and 2009, according to the report. This year’s annual report from the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) includes an analysis of Economic Short Time Working across the European Union. It also examines the potential of short-time working and temporary layoff measures to serve as a concrete implementation of the EU’s ‘common principles of flexicurity’. The report illustrates the extent to which genuine consensus has been achieved among social partners at national level in many countries, building trust and common understanding among the parties involved. ‘This report shows that this consensus could be harnessed to develop these schemes further towards a more active policy orientation, an extension of the flexicurity concept and, more concretely, the generation of new skills for the jobs needed to put Europe on the path to recovery and towards the vision of the Europe 2020 strategy,’ says Donald Storrie of Eurofound’s Employment and Competitiveness Unit. The report also shows that five million fewer people were in employment in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the onset of the crisis in mid-2008. Construction and manufacturing alone account for a net decline in employment of five million people. Significant decline has also been observed in the transport and retail sectors. Sectors in which employment is growing include health and education, computer programming and consultancy, and other professional and scientific activities.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0721	2010-10-28	UNK	Press release, 20 October 2010	Eurofound publishes a new report on ‘The impact of investment funds on restructuring practices and employment levels': Alternative investment funds have limited negative impact on labour outcomes in the long term (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Although private equity and hedge fund investments in companies often lead to turbulence in employment and job transfers in the short term, there is little evidence of negative effects on employment in the long term, Eurofound's European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) has found in a new report. One feature of the global economy in recent years has been the increasing number and importance of new investment funds, such as private equity, hedge funds, and sovereign wealth funds, which are sometimes referred to as alternative investment funds. This increase has paralleled fundamental changes in financial markets and has generated heated debates on the impact of these funds on restructuring practices, employment levels and industrial relations. Eurofound set out to clarify the nature of three relatively new forms of investment funds, and to consider the possible relationship between these investment funds and various labour and social outcomes, including employment levels, work organisation, and employee voice systems within the firms in which funds invests. It found that labour outcomes as a result of investment fund activity vary widely from case to case due to the potential of both positive and negative impacts on labour, as well as the differences in the strategies pursued by the different funds. Overall, the balance of evidence suggests that private equity has had more effect on firms and their employees. Although activist hedge funds overall tend to have less effect, in some cases successful hedge fund activism can trigger major changes. In the case of sovereign wealth funds, minority investment and passive ownership has had least effect, but where a sovereign wealth fund acquires a large block of shares, or acquires a firm outright, this has the potential to have a major effect on corporate strategy.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0722	2010-11-16	UNK	Press release, 16 November 2010	Eurofound launches the first findings of its 5th European Working Condition Survey: Workers say working conditions are slowly improving (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Work intensity among European workers is still high, although it has not increased over the past five years, according to the first findings of the 5th European Working Conditions Survey, out today. The survey also found that for most workers (67%), the pace of work is set by direct demands from people and working at high speeds remains high. The extent to which workers can make their own decisions about how they do their job has not changed, leaving a large number of workers ill-equipped to deal with work’s demands. Furthermore, workers in the EU27 remain as exposed to physical hazards as EU12 workers did 20 years ago. However, in 2010, training paid for by employers was at its highest level since 1995 (for the EU15), with 34% of workers receiving training in the last 12 months. This is a break in a 15-year trend in which employer-provided training had not increased. And around 60% of workers feel that they would be able to do their current job at the age of 60, a marginal increase since 2000. Ensuring quality of work and employment is a core element in achieving an economically dynamic and socially cohesive European Union. Examining how working conditions have changed, or remained the same, can shed light on what progress is being made towards this goal. The European Working Conditions Survey is the only survey available at European level that looks at work in many dimensions. This time, the survey was carried out to see how quality of work and employment is faring during the economic crisis. ‘It is important that we know what is really happening in the workplace, so that we can help policymakers design policies that are relevant and that are tackling the real issues,’ says Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director. For most indicators of working time stability, the figures have remained the same since 2000, with 67% of workers working the same numbers of hours per week, and 58% working the same number of hours every day. Furthermore, the proportion of European workers who work the same number of days per week has increased somewhat, rising from 74% of the workforce in 2005 to 77% in 2010. Slightly fewer workers in 2010 than in 2000 start and finish work at the same time every day, 61% in 2010 as against 65% in 2000. The launch of the first findings of Eurofound's 5th European Working Conditions Survey takes place at a conference entitled ‘Working longer through better working conditions, new modes of work and career organisation’, on 16-17 November 2010, in the Palais des Académies in Brussels, Belgium. This high-profile event is a joint conference, co-organised by the Belgian Ministry of Employment, Labour and Social Dialogue, the European Commission and Eurofound, under the auspices of the Belgian Presidency.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0723	2010-10-22	UNK	Private provision of employment and training services in the UK	Until the 1970s, delivery of most public services across Europe was almost exclusively the responsibility of the state. Since then, many Member States have extended the role of the private sector in delivering public services in pursuit of improved choice, quality and efficiency. Formerly, the UK public sector directly supported unemployed people with benefits advice, training, job searches and referrals to other agencies through local job centre offices. Now, Job Centre Plus, part of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), acts only as the first point of contact and referral for the first three months of unemployment. The rest is outsourced under a programme known as the Work Programme under which, training, job search and brokerage are managed entirely by large private-sector companies (‘prime contractors’). The majority of prime contractors’ income is derived from a payment-by-results system, designed to incentivise the achievement of sustainable work outcomes for clients. Nearly 1.5 million people have joined the Work Programme over the past two and a half years; around 18% of these have found sustained employment. Contractors’ perspective A contractor interviewed for the UK case study in a new Eurofound report on private-sector delivery of public services stated that the payment-by-results system was effective, as payments for new referrals had decreased over time, and the contractor’s income was now primarily determined by clients’ achieving sustained work outcomes (the payments to the contractor being increased after three months of the client’s employment, and again after six). However, the recent upturn in the labour market has meant a decline in the number of new referrals from the job centre (as clients with minimal support needs are finding work more quickly than they had been before). In turn, this has meant an increase in the proportion of clients whose need for support is greater. Policy expert's perspective In the view of a policy expert interviewed for the case study, the private sector copes reasonably well with routine job searches and support packages for clients who are ‘work ready’, as it is termed. But resources are not adequate to support job-seekers whose needs are more demanding – those in recovery from drug and alcohol addiction, for instance, dealing with mental health problems, or presenting with offending behaviour (situations that job centres are better equipped to deal with). Improvements in the aggregate number of successful job outcomes have taken place, but generally in groups closer to the labour market; moreover, the proportion of clients securing sustained work within 12 months of entering the programme is now falling. It was the expert's view that the payment-by-results system for the Work Programme encouraged contractors to prioritise ‘work-ready’ clients for acceptance onto the programme, thereby inflating successful outcomes and filtering out those whose needs were more complex. Perspective of jobs club Job clubs in the UK are independent, non-profit organisations that seek to provide a network of contacts and support for unemployed people. Staff and volunteers at a job club interviewed for this case study felt that their job-seeking clients were being channelled towards low-paid and temporary work with limited prospects, irrespective of their work history or skills. For clients themselves, the pressure to apply for and obtain work was an ever-present concern. The ‘work first’ approach meant that clients’ main focus had be on conducting job searches, completing applications and engaging with employers. Clients reported significant pressures to apply for all the job notices that were published. This resulted in a lack of time to engage in training, development and confidence-building, which they felt could make employment more sustainable in the long term. Commentary Although some improvement can be seen in the aggregate number of successful job outcomes, this is the case only for groups closer to the labour market. At the same time, however, there is a general misalignment of incentives in the payment-by-results system, as the ‘work first’ model places great emphasis on job searches and not enough on the quality and sustainability of employment outcomes. These could be better secured through tailored, intensive programmes of skills training and confidence-building. Generally speaking, it is not the involvement of the private sector that is gives rise to many of the problems reported here. Rather, a combination of policy, market management and funding pressures create issues with cost, accessibility and quality. Large-scale privatisation policies such as the Work Programme, formulated at ministerial level and effectively imposed on state agencies, appear to create the greatest rigidities in respect of implementing, running and monitoring services. High-volume contracts – combined with weak management of the performance of large private-sector providers – are in danger of effectively replacing one form of producer-driven monopoly with another. In contrast, where funding and quality control is devolved to a local-authority level (as is the case in childcare and adult care, and detailed in the report), there appears to be greater scope for public servants to innovate and manage standards effectively using local knowledge of both supply and demand. Further information The report Delivering public services: A greater role for the private sector? is an exploratory study, which examines how the role of the private sector has grown in the provision of public services in Lithuania, Spain, Sweden and the UK. It focuses on three areas of services: early childhood education and care, employment services and training, and social care for adults.  	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/private-provision-of-employment-and-training-services-in-the-uk
EUROFOUND_UNK_0724	2010-11-02	UNK	Press release, 28 October 2010	Eurofound publishes a a report on the financing and operation of active labour market programmes (ALMP) in Europe: Limited effectiveness of active labour market programmes on public job creation in Europe (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Active labour market programmes – such as job matching, labour market training, employment subsidies – have had a limited impact on public job creation in all EU Member States, according to a new report from Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU agency providing European social policymakers with comparative data, research and recommendations. Training and subsidised employment in private firms have, on the other hand, had a positive effect on job creation. Active labour market policies (ALMPs) remain key policies in promoting change and increasing employment in Europe. The principal objective of labour market or employment policy at European and national level has been the maximisation of employment rates. However, an ageing population, current and future job shortages and harsh financial conditions all call for new ways to move forward. The methods European social policymakers choose today will determine labour market dynamics in 2020 and beyond. The new report from Eurofound, based on a request from the European Economic and Social Committee’s Labour Market Observatory (LMO), presents data, research and findings on the financing and operation of active labour market programmes during and after the crisis (2008 to date). The data is based on input from Eurofound’s network of correspondents in all 27 EU Member States in June and July 2010. Measures targeted at the young unemployed have had limited success, the report states. This finding reinforces the case of those who contend that funding would be better allocated to early education, i.e. with preventative rather than remedial objectives and greater potential for enhancing human capital. The report is presented at a Belgian EU Presidency conference on Active labour market policies for the Europe 2020 strategy, held in Antwerp, Belgium, on 28-29 October 2010.

Short-time schemes reduce working hours The widespread use of government supported short-time working schemes, introduced primarily in manufacturing to cut company costs and save jobs, has reduced the gap between agreed and actual working time in the EU, according to Eurofound's latest annual round-up of working time developments. Short-time working schemes have been extended over the last two years in a number of countries in response to falling demand in the face of recession. Under these schemes, the working hours and pay of employees is cut, with national governments usually making up most of the loss in income: as a result, employers' costs are reduced while worker's jobs and incomes are preserved. Eurofound's previous updates in the series have found that actual working time, in most Member States, is longer than collectively agreed hours; however, the fall in working time resulting from these short-time schemes has meant that actual working time, on average across Europe, has fallen.

IN BRIEF News in pictures Romanians work longest weekly hours In the fourth quarter of 2009, the longest actual weekly hours, worked by full-time employees in their main job, were in Romania (41.2 hours per week); the shortest were in Finland (37.3 hours). News in brief Meeting the challenges of diversity The growing ethnic, cultural and religious diversity of Europe's cities means that managing relations between people of different cultures has become a major challenge for policymakers. Looking at what has worked in other cities and countries can help decision-makers better ensure that the divides between citizens of different cultures can be successfully bridged. A new report from Eurofound, Intercultural policies in European cities (published together with the Council of Europe), examines the steps that have been taken in 31 European cities to improve the attitudes of and relations between majority and minority groups. It focuses in particular on the experiences of Muslim communities, Islam being the largest ‘new' religion in European cities. An accompanying résumé sets out a range of recommendations to assist policymakers at municipal, national and EU level. Read more Pay is leading cause of industrial action A new Eurofound report finds that between 2005 and 2009, demands for wage increases were the leading cause of industrial action in most European countries. Over the period, industrial action resulted in more than 60 working days being lost per year for every 1,000 workers in a number of countries - Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France and Spain; by contrast, fewer than 20 working days were lost in most of the countries of central and eastern Europe. Seeking to provide a broad indication of trends in industrial action over the period 2005-2009, the report also finds that - in any given year - one sector may dominate the industrial action statistics. For example, half or more of all working days lost in Belgium between 2005 and 2007 were in manufacturing, while in Denmark in 2006 and 2008, it was the public sector that saw most days lost. Download the report Tackling undeclared work Eurofound research on the topic of undeclared work - work that, while not illegal, is not declared to the authorities for tax, social security or labour law purposes - has sought to provide policymakers with findings and data to better tackle the phenomenon, which is an issue for all 27 Member States. As part of this initiative, Eurofound will be jointly hosting a conference on the issue, together with the Bulgarian government, on 30 September in Sofia, Bulgaria. Eurofound research has identified two broad policy approaches: a focus on deterrence (by improving detection or increasing penalties), and encouraging compliance by, for instance, enabling the legitimisation of previously undeclared work. At the conference, Eurofound will present its findings in greater detail, along with concrete examples of measures at the national level to tackle undeclared work, from its knowledge base of case studies. Achieving better quality of life Eurofound research points to a decline - in a number of measures - in the quality of life of European citizens in the wake of the economic downturn. A growing body of thought questions the automatic assumption that growth alone will result in a better quality of life. Other factors contribute to overall wellbeing. But to what extent and how can their contribution be properly measured? To debate these questions, and seek appropriate policy measures to ensure a good quality of life for all European citizens, Eurofound, together with the European Commission's DG for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities and the European Policy Centre, is hosting a conference ‘Economic Growth for Better Quality of Life in Europe' on 14 September in Brussels.

On 14 September, Eurofound co-hosts a conference in Brussels looking at the relationship between economic growth and quality of life, presenting data that highlight the impact of the economic downturn on the quality of life of citizens across Europe. At the end of the month, at a conference jointly organised with the Bulgarian government in Sofia, Bulgaria, Eurofound will outline approaches taken across the Union to tackle the ongoing issue of undeclared work. In October, at a breakfast meeting for Members of the European Parliament, a number of publications will be launched: these look at the impact of investment funds on restructuring practices and employment levels, and investigate the state of the European financial services sector. Due to be published shortly after, this year's ERM annual report will describe in detail how short-time working schemes in a number of Member States have been used successfully to keep companies alive and limit the impact of the economic downturn on employment levels. In November, the first findings of Eurofound's fifth European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) will be launched in Brussels. And in early December, at Eurofound's premises in Dublin, the first session in the seventh year of the Foundation Seminar Series will look at action being taken across Europe to raise the skills level - and hence employability - of the European workforce.

Two jobs lost for every one created In the second quarter of 2010, Eurofound's European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) recorded announcements of restructuring that look set to result in around 50,000 job losses. By contrast, only 25,000 new jobs were announced. Reviewing the broader employment situation, the ERM quarterly also notes that - as in the first quarter of the year - most job loss was reported in car manufacturing, with the loss of over 5,000 jobs announced. In contrast, the retail trade continues to lead in job creation, announcing 5,000 new jobs. The UK features strongly both in terms of job loss and job creation: the loss of over 10,000 jobs was announced, while nearly 3,800 new jobs were expected to be created, second only to Romania (4,900 new jobs), the leader in job creation in the quarter. The ERM quarterly also points out that fiscal tightening is likely to introduce new constraints on growth and may lead to extensive restructuring in public-sector employment.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0731	2010-10-12	UNK	Press release, 12 October 2010	Eurofound publishes a new report on 'Financial services: challenges and prospects': Spelling out scenarios for Europe's financial services sector (DUBLIN, IRELAND) If European policymakers, big financial institutions and social partners cannot agree on the full extent of reform, then Europe's financial services sector runs the risk of being plunged back into the unsustainable situation of chasing short-term profit with high risks, Eurofound's European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) warns in a new report. The new report outlines potential adaptation scenarios for the European financial sector in the aftermath of the financial crisis.The global debate on new regulatory rules for the financial sector in the aftermath of the current economic crisis is producing a flood of arguments, suggestions and proposals. Different restructuring and adaptation approaches are competing and it remains unclear which one will be the future for European financial services. New research launched by Eurofound's European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) shows that the financial services sector is dominated by companies that have re-focused on their core business in an effort to return to profitability, albeit at the expense of considerable job cuts. In 2009, roughly 10% of jobs in the state-owned banks examined were cut, compared to around 5% in the surveyed private banks following a liberal business model. One part of the European financial sector is in state ownership, and some institutions will remain under this control for a longer period of time, the report found. A second part of the sector, which is building up a sustainable business model, performed with minor job losses. A third group continues to deal in liberal capital markets with a strong profit orientation. The report examines a number of company cases and classifies Europe's leading banks and financial institutions according to their new business models and approach: the profit-oriented ‘liberal' bank pressing for minor regulatory change; the ‘state-owned bank' which undergo massive reorientation of business strategies and restructuring under public scrutiny; and the ‘sustainable' bank with its stronger customer orientation, less leverage and less ambitious profit targets. The report suggests three potential adaptation scenarios for the European financial sector. The ‘high risk status quo scenario' assumes that the big players are strong enough to ensure that no major reform of the financial system takes place, and allows the high-risk/high-profit trading activities of the past to continue. The ‘new world order for financial markets' scenario sees the G20 governments agreeing a fundamental reform of the world financial system in December 2010. Implementing these rules will terminate the ‘golden age' of financial business and improve the chances of creating sustainable business models for companies in the financial services sector, benefiting customers, people working in the sector, and the market as a whole. The ‘divided economies' is the worst case scenario, in which the international regulation of financial markets fail, resulting in rising default rates and overburdened public budgets, forcing some governments in the euro zone to large-scale liability cut and the liquidation of a series of banks. All scenarios are expected to cause further job reductions, albeit at different levels. Eurofound's report on the challenges and prospects on the European financial services sector will be presented to the European Parliament on Wednesday 13 October 2010. A press briefing will be held in Press Room of the European Commission in Brussels, Belgium, the Berlaymont Building, room Aquarium 4, at 10:30 on Wednesday. Participating at the event are Radoslaw Owczarzak, Research Manager, Eurofound, and expert Kurt Vogler-Ludwig, Managing Director, Economix.

The future for financial services Without broad-based agreement on reform, Europe's financial services sector may once again pursue profit with a short-term perspective, despite the consequent risks, warns a new series of reports and case studies from Eurofound. The financial crisis and economic turmoil of the past two years have reshaped the sector, as the reports make clear: formerly private banks have been taken into public ownership, considerable numbers of jobs have been cut, and calls have been made for tighter regulation of the activities of financial institutions. A series of scenarios outlined in the reports, however, cautions that big financial organisations with a strong profit and growth orientation could, by virtue of their political strength, ensure that only minimal reform of the regulatory infrastructure takes place. By contrast, were agreement on fundamental reform to be reached by the governments of the G20, the scenarios foresee the creation of sustainable business models - benefiting customers, employees, and the wider market. The reports are being launched at a meeting of the European Parliament on 13 October, in Brussels.

Spotlight on workplace violence Violence in European workplaces is disturbingly common: when asked, around one European worker in ten said that they had experienced some form of workplace violence - either physical or psychological - in the previous 12 months. Workers employed in sectors where frequent contact with the public is part of the job are most at risk - especially in the education and health sectors, and in public administration. And, perhaps not surprisingly, women (especially younger women) are most likely to experience psychological violence. A new publication in Eurofound's Foundation Findings series looks at the extent of forms of violence in the workplace, assesses the health impacts of being on the receiving end of violence, and examines which aspects of the working environment are associated with suffering exposure.

Bringing these two needs together - matching older people with voluntary work for which they are qualified and in which they are interested - can simultaneously meet a number of challenges. For elderly people who face isolation, the greater activity and sense of belonging generated by volunteering can boost self-esteem, promote social inclusion and improve overall levels of health. For more, see the new study by Eurofound - Measures for social inclusion of the elderly: The case of volunteering Posted workers' debate lacks reliable data A substantial lack of data regarding the overall number and characteristics of posted workers throughout the EU makes it almost impossible to know how many workers currently fall into this category. In a recently published report, Eurofound maps the available sources that can provide information about the occurrence of postings, and provides figures for those countries where data is available. The report also looks at the roles played both by European and national-level regulation in determining the employment and working conditions of posted workers. In addition, the possible implications of a number of high-profile decisions recently taken by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in cases of posting of workers are discussed. The report recommends strengthening the role of the social partners at national and European level, with a view to establishing a monitoring system and providing some scope for regulating the employment and working conditions of posted workers through collective agreements. Download the comparative report Helping Europeans back into employment The economic downturn has had a crippling effect on employment in Europe: around 7.8 million citizens became unemployed between 2008 and 2010, making effective active labour market policies (ALMP) more necessary than ever. On 28 October, in Antwerp, Eurofound will present new findings on ALMP at an event organised by the Flemish Government, as part of the programme for the Belgian EU Presidency: ‘Pro-active labour market policies for Europe 2020 - Finding what works'. The findings are contained in a soon-to-be published report from Eurofound, Financing and operation of active labour market programmes during the crisis, which was commissioned by the European Economic and Social Committee's Labour Market Observatory (LMO). The report analyses the impact of ALMP in 10 Member States, with a particular focus on how such measures have been funded, their effectiveness, and recent trends in operation. Eurofound goes from strength to strength Eurofound continues to strengthen its impact on key policymakers, as a review of its organisational performance makes clear. An analysis of Eurofound's performance from January to August 2010 shows that Eurofound is on course to meet many of its targets for the year. One measure in particular, the number of documents at EU level that reference Eurofound and its work, shows a clear rise in the number of quotations for the first half of 2010 in comparison with 2009; moreover, Eurofound's expertise is increasingly being taken up or requested without any promotion on the part of the organisation. Eurofound also continues to strengthen its tripartite and stakeholder relationships, the number of contacts by Eurofound staff with members of key target groups at European level jumping for the first seven months of 2010 compared with the same period in both 2008 and 2009. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-october-2010-2
EUROFOUND_UNK_0736	2010-10-01	UNK	Press release, 1 October 2010	Eurofound publishes a working paper on ‘Measures for social inclusion of the elderly: The case of volunteering' on the International Day of Older Persons 1 October 2010: Be active, stay young - go volunteering Demographic ageing is accelerating in the European Union, and with it the pressure on policymakers to promote the social inclusion of the older population. On the International Day of Older Persons on 1 October 2010, Eurofound puts forward arguments for encouraging volunteering by older people as a way for the elderly to stay young while promoting a more inclusive society. According to Eurofound’s working paper on social inclusion and the elderly, the active population in the European Union will start to shrink from 2013, and the number of elderly people aged 65–79 years will increase by more than a third (37.4%) by 2030. With life expectancy increasing all the time, European Member States are witnessing an ever-rising number of those aged 80 years or above: an increase of 57.1% between 2010 and 2030. There are, however, large differences in how the elderly – those aged 55 and above – are excluded from society. The elderly in the Nordic countries and in the Netherlands are the least excluded from society, according to Eurofound’s research. Continental Europe and Anglo-Saxon countries follow, and then the Mediterranean countries. In Eastern Europe, the social exclusion of older people is most pronounced, especially in the Baltic States and Poland. The Czech Republic and Slovenia, on the other hand, have similar figures to Spain and Italy. In searching for measures to promote the social inclusion of the older population, EU policies give special attention to encouraging volunteering. In the context of the European Year of Volunteering in 2011, the EU wants to ‘create the conditions for civil society conducive to volunteering in the EU and to increase the visibility of voluntary activities’. Analysing the relationship between social inclusion and volunteering among older people, Eurofound’s working paper shows that volunteering can in fact be a suitable measure to reduce the risk of or prevent social exclusion. For older people exposed to the main risk factors such as old age, health restrictions or isolation, volunteering can lead not only to involvement in activities but also to a better integration and inclusion into society.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0737	2010-09-10	UNK	Press release, 10 September 2010	Eurofound organises a conference on ‘Economic Growth for Better Quality of Life in Europe’ in Brussels, Belgium on 14 September 2010 with the European Commission and the European Policy Centre: Beyond the GDP debate: making sense of research-based policy-making Good public policy should create a sustainable high-level quality of life and well-being for all members of society. However, with the attention of policy makers focused on fostering economic growth and the creation of more jobs, will this be enough to achieve a better quality of life and more well-being in the longer run? Eurofound is organising a conference to discuss the topic. Economic indicators such as GDP were never designed to be comprehensive measures of well-being, the European Commission has argued. In 2009 it set Europe on a course to better monitor progress by complementing GDP with subjective indicators that reflect wider public concerns, for example regarding access to public services and how secure citizens feel in their immediate surroundings. This would better link EU policy with citizens’ genuine concerns. Time has now come to expand this initiative and push the debate further. Eurofound argues that there is an urgent need among researchers and policy-makers to better understand differences between countries and between social groups in order to identify the right policy levers to enhance quality of life. Surveys, such as the European Quality of Life Surveys conducted by Eurofound since 2003, provide valuable evidence and trends that can contribute to better policy design. ‘If we can no longer assume that growth alone will automatically lead to better quality of life and more well-being, then we need to develop a better understanding of the determinants of quality of life as perceived by citizens,’ says Robert Anderson, coordinator of Eurofound’s research into living conditions and quality of life. Eurofound also hopes to widen the debate of the quality of life concept. While the multidimensional character of quality of life is well recognised, most attention – and most research – has focused on quality of life from the individual’s perspective. ‘We need also to consider other aspects of quality of life and what matters for assessments at the individual, family or societal levels,’ says Robert Anderson. The conference participants will examine this evidence and discuss how it can help design better policies. The event is organised by Eurofound together with the European Commission/ DG Employment, and the European Policy Centre as part of its Well-Being 2030 initiative. More information about the event is available here For further information, contact Måns Mårtensson, media manager, on email or telephone: +353-1-204 3124, and mobile: +353-876-593 507.

Launching its comprehensive report on Working conditions in the acceding and candidate countries on 23 October, the Foundation provides a benchmark for working conditions in the 13 countries. Social dialogue and EMU in the acceding countries, published at the same time, focuses on the role of social dialogue in preparing for Economic and Monetary Union. A conference on social dialogue involving the 10 acceding countries will be held in March 2004. The presentation of the Foundation’s much-anticipated pan-European Quality of Life survey will take place in May 2004. Benchmarking working conditions According to the report, workers in the ACC work longer hours in less service-related industries than in the current EU Member States. They also suffer higher exposure to various physical risk factors such as dangerous substances, fumes and noise. ""The survey provides a first comprehensive overview of working conditions in the 13 acceding and candidate countries, using the same methodology as in the previous European working condition surveys carried out by the Foundation in 1990, 1995 and 2000,"" says Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s Acting Director. ""The results provide a solid benchmark on the situation in these countries as ten of them move towards membership in May next year."" Living conditions and quality of life Before enlargement, and in collaboration with Eurostat, the Foundation will also provide wide-ranging data and analysis on living conditions in the acceding and candidate countries. The living conditions survey will focus on quality of life and personal satisfaction, social exclusion, income, deprivation and economic strain, as well as work and quality of work, healthcare and access to services, family aspects, and fertility and migration trends. In May, the Foundation aims to publish its much-anticipated Quality of Life in Europe monitoring initiative. It will focus on employment, economic resources, family life, community life, health and education. In short, it measures the quality of life in the 15 Member States and 13 acceding and candidate countries. "	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-5-2003-4
EUROFOUND_UNK_0740	2010-08-27	UNK	Communiqué February 2005	Important notice! If you would like to receive Communiqué by email (10 issues a year), please sign up now. Articles Director's diary A positive year for working conditions in Europe 2004 Health, social services and education sectors most at risk from stress Research and news in brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Health, social services and education sectors most at risk from stress As these sectors employ a significant majority of women and are large-scale employers, stress tends to affect a disproportionate number of female workers, according to the new topic report from the Foundation’s European Working Conditions Observatory (EWCO). Nonetheless, where trend information is present in the northern European countries, the data indicate an increase in stress-related outcomes both for men and women. The report, which presents trends in characteristics of work-related stress, and how these can be prevented, also reveals that burnout, fatigue, and back problems are still on the increase while work intensification may be levelling off. Its focus is within the European Working Conditions Observatory (EWCO) network of seven European countries in its initial phase: Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden. The analysis is based on national surveys and research information available in the EU, as well as on recent research findings. Increasingly ‘lean’ organisations? The freedom to use one’s skills and learning opportunities in the workplace seems to have been somewhat curtailed, according to the report. Also, the percentage of workers reporting that they did not ‘receive assistance from colleagues when required’ has increased, perhaps due to the increased intensification of their own work. This seems to indicate the emergence of increasingly ‘lean’ organisations. More importantly, however, is that the main increase in work intensification occurred, however, in the first half of the 1990s. Up until 1995, work intensification seemed to be increasing fast, but then slowed down towards 2000 and levelled off until now. Work autonomy has had a similar development trend: increasingly fewer workers reported on low autonomy over their jobs up until 1995, which since then has slowed down and levelled off. Putting a price on work-related stress In 2001, the Dutch Ministry for Social Affairs estimated the cost of work-related stress problems at EUR12 billion. In the same year, Germany allocated EUR3 billion to deal with the problem of psychological disorders, an increasingly common reason for high levels of absenteeism. The report has identified attempts to quantify the cost of work-related stress, but it highlights the need for a common model that takes into consideration the effects of bad working conditions, and that measures costs for preventive efforts. Infobox: What is stress? Work-related stress is a pattern of reactions that occurs when workers are presented with work demands that are not matched to their knowledge, skills or abilities, and which challenge their ability to cope. These demands may be related to: time pressure or the amount of work (quantitative demands); the difficulty of the work (cognitive demands); the empathy required (emotional demands); the inability to show one’s emotions at work; physical strengths, i.e. high demands in the area of dynamic and static loads. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-february-2005

This research project looked at the operation of EWCs with headquarters in France, Germany, Italy, Sweden and the UK. In-depth interviews with representatives of both management and workforce in parent and subsidiary companies took place to provide insight into the functioning of EWCs in enterprise and their impact on industrial relations and human resource management. Several case studies gave evidence of an attempt at harmonisation of industrial relations in the group. This is important in terms of the expansion strategies of the majority of companies. The EWC, or employee-side members, support management as they endeavour to integrate newly acquired subsidiaries. EWCs can have varying impacts on industrial relations. They can contribute to: a harmonisation of industrial relations in the group, an ‘export’ or transfer of industrial relations cultures from the home country to other countries, an integration and mediation between or within countries, establish a transnational interaction in the architecture of company industrial relations, establish or improve industrial relations in subsidiaries, and improve industrial relations in the parent company. The EWC, or employee side members, support management endeavours of integrating the newly acquired subsidiaries.

The Foundation has recently explored new ways of resolving industrial conflict involving the social partners and governments in the new EU Member States. In an effort to transfer know-how and experience from the former EU15, ‘Social dialogue and tripartite consultation have proven crucial tools for industrial peace, while still ensuring economic growth in harmony with employment and social protection,’ Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s Acting Director argued at a recent conference on developments in European industrial relations, co-organised by the Dutch EU Presidency and the Foundation on 7–8 October last. ‘While the legal basis for industrial relations has been unified in all EU25 countries, with the process of enlargement, mediation is still the dominant conflict resolution mechanism in the new Member States.’ Stable industrial relations in Europe despite differences Foundation research has found that levels of trade union membership across the enlarged European Union are still low (average 25%, ranging from 15%–40%) but there are signs that this is improving. When comparing levels of collective bargaining coverage, these remain high, covering almost four out of every five workers. The gender pay gap remains wide however, averaging 20% across the EU and Norway despite efforts in Belgium and Finland to address the issue by establishing a legal framework for equal pay.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-5-2004-6

This will represent the final chapter of the current four-year work programme. ‘In 2004, Europe will pass the half-way mark to achieving the Lisbon goals. I want the Foundation to continue to play a part in meeting these objectives,’ announced Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s Acting Director, at a recent meeting outlining the work programme for the coming year. ‘The need to re-define the European Social Model, the socio-economic perspective of a new European constitution, and the increased necessity to compare socio-economic indicators between the EU, USA and Asia, will all provide huge challenges and opportunities for the Foundation in 2004 and beyond.’ The work programme acts as a guide for what will be achieved by the Foundation in the coming year. The Foundation’s Administrative Board unanimously approved the 2004 work programme on 24 October. Upgrading Eurofound During 2004, it is planned to carry out a general overhaul of Eurofound, the Foundation’s website, to better suit the users’ information needs. This follows findings from the 2003 web user survey which highlighted the need for the Foundation to improve access to its information sources and provide improved search facilities. The web user survey represents the final stage in evaluating how the Foundation and its work is perceived by its stakeholders and target audiences, a process which began with an external evaluation carried out by management consultant Deloitte & Touche in October 2002. ‘Many people still do not know about the Foundation and its work, at least not as many as we want,’ commented Willy Buschak on the preliminary findings of the survey. ‘More worrying is the fact that when they do know about us, they do not use our information in the way we would like them to.’ Strategic information campaigns One approach to tackling this information gap is to promote Foundation publications and events as part of focused information campaigns throughout the year. Aimed at increasing knowledge, data and analysis on topics pertinent to the European political social agenda, the campaigns should provide a coherent and streamlined perspective to the myriad of Foundation research on issues of social concern. ‘On 23 October 2003, the Foundation published the Working conditions in the acceding and candidate countries (ACC) report, kicking off the information campaign on living and working conditions in the new enlarged Europe,’ explains Elisabeth Lagerlöf, Head of Information and Communication. In February 2004, a comprehensive report based on the Eurobarometer survey of living conditions in the ACC will be published. In March, the Foundation will host a conference to promote social dialogue as a tool for conflict resolution in the ACC. In May 2004, the results of the 28-country pan-European quality of life monitoring initiative will be made available, marking the start of the quality of life theme to continue for the rest of 2004. Updating European Works Councils While the European Industrial Relations Observatory(EIRO) will be expanded to include the new Member States plus Norway and Switzerland, the Foundation will also update its work on European Works Councils (EWCs) during 2004. A report will be published in the first half of the year, looking at recent new practices and changes in the regulation, and including information about EWCs in the acceding countries. ‘Two current topics for EIRO comparative reports include industrial relations in SMEs and in the public sector, with a particular focus on public utilities,’ says Stavroula Demetriades, research coordinator of the Industrial Relations team. ‘Theme-based reports for 2004 will tackle undeclared work, unskilled work and industrial relations indicators.’ Pay, working time and trade union membership are the topics for 2004’s three EIRO annual updates. The EU volume of the glossary on industrial relation terms will be launched during the second part of the year, while a report on the quality of industrial relations as well as a series of country profiles will be published in 2004. Launching the European Working Conditions Observatory Having established a network of correspondents, integrated existing research on working conditions and started pan-European news reporting online, the Foundation’s new working conditions monitoring tool, the European Working Conditions Observatory, will be officially launched in early 2004 (more information). The strategic research of the working conditions team during 2004 will focus on the working poor, wages and work organisation and the corresponding impact on companies’ performance and quality of employment. The Foundation will also carry out in-depth studies on time and gender in working conditions in the acceding and candidate countries. Preparations for the next pan-European working conditions survey, covering all 28 EU Member States in 2005, will be completed during 2004. First EMCC annual conference The Foundation’s European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) will extend its reach to include Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 2004. During its second full year of operation, the EMCC team will also expand the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) to ensure a follow-up to restructuring announcements at regular intervals. ‘In order to showcase new products, primarily in the sectoral dimension, and to further develop our networks, we will hold our first EMCC annual conference in Brussels next year,’ says Jacques Terrenoire, EMCC’s project coordinator. With events planned in Austria in March, the Netherlands in June and Lisbon in October, the EMCC Company Network Seminars will continue to examine how businesses across Europe manage diverse factors of change. Enhanced visibility at EU-level Consistent efforts to ensure good management and budgetary control have raised the Foundation’s visibility at EU-level over the past couple of years, in particular in the European Parliament and its budgetary committee. ‘The Foundation’s Brussels Liaison Office continues its work of bringing the Foundation’s findings and knowledge to its stakeholders and target audiences,’ says Sylvie Jacquet, head of the Foundation’s Brussels Liaison Office. ‘In 2004, the BLO will focus on its core of strategic-, contact- and content-oriented activities.’ 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-6-2003-4

Shortly after graduating with a law degree 30 years ago, he joined the Dutch employer organisation, VNO, now known as VNO-NCW, where he has been Social Affairs Manager since 2000. What are the Dutch EU Presidency’s social affairs goals and how can the VNO-NCW contribute to these?The Dutch EU Presidency’s main social affairs objective is to lay the foundations for the new social policy agenda 2006–2010 in a way that reflects the Lisbon Agenda, the recommendations of the Employment Taskforce and Europe’s ageing working population. Revising the Working Time Directive – and in particular finding common ground around the issue of temporary agency work – will be an important part of this. The VNO-NCW, which fully supports the Dutch Presidency’s aims, believes that temporary agency work is vital to create a more dynamic labour market and more jobs. Unless the proposed Directive on temporary agency work is revised, we will not achieve this. Is it in Europe’s interests to regulate and coordinate social issues at an EU level? Over the last decade there has been a disturbing tendency towards over-regulation at EU level: EU social legislation should primarily be used to realise the internal market and to create a level playing field. In terms of coordination, the open method has proved to be a useful instrument. However, there is a danger that its main strength, notably the flexibility it gives countries to design measures around their individual circumstances, could be undermined by excessive bureaucratic detail. What are the risks of Europe not hitting the Lisbon Agenda targets? If we don’t achieve these targets by 2010, civil society will lose faith in the benefits of a united Europe and we will not have the competitive businesses needed to support our welfare states. It’s of the utmost importance to succeed. This year a high-level group chaired by Wim Kok recommended concrete steps to accelerate progress towards these objectives. How do you see the Foundation moving forward? I see it developing as a centre of knowledge for a wide range of social issues, supporting policy-makers at both EU and national level. At national level, though, the Foundation needs to make more people aware of the data it has at its disposal. It also needs to strengthen the quality and policy-relevance of its data by intensively monitoring EU policies in order to identify areas where additional information and analyses are required.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-5-2004

There are two exceptions to this rule: the Czech Republic and Latvia.

Willy Buschak, the Foundation's Acting Director, with Külvar Mand, Estonian Deputy Minister for Social Affairs. Discussions with experts from neighbouring Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Latvia and Lithuania, focused on the high percentage of real house ownership in the new Member States. More than two-thirds of Estonians (66%) own their home without a mortgage, almost twice as many as in the former EU15 (38%). However, Estonia scores highest on the index of poor housing quality, quoting shortage of space, rotting windows, doors or floors, damp or leaks, and lack of indoor flushing toilets, (36% in Estonia, compared to 22% for all 10 new Member States and 9% for the former EU15). First of four international seminars across Europe The event in Tallinn, which brought together some 60 government experts, trade unions, employer organisations, civil and statistical bodies, was the first in a series of four similar events across Europe. The aim is to present the initial findings of the European Quality of Life survey and discuss the implications of cultural or other differences.

A total of 56,170 job losses were announced as a result of 158 company restructuring cases during the summer months, from 1 July to 30 September, according to the quarterly report from the Foundation’s European Restructuring Monitor (ERM). During the same period, 8,130 new jobs were created. While this number represents significantly less jobs created than during the last quarter, it confirms the trend of an increased number of job creations in the new Member States. Significant effects of restructuring The Irish economy had the highest number of redundancies during the past quarter with 16.4 job losses per 10,000 people, following the announcement of a three-year plan involving 1,325 job cuts at Aer Lingus, the state airline. After Ireland, the United Kingdom and Slovakia were worst hit with redundancies. In the same period, no job losses were reported in the Czech Republic, Greece and Luxembourg. Monitoring industrial restructuring in the media The European Restructuring Monitor records industrial restructuring cases as reported in the press. All announcements involving the reduction or creation of at least 100 jobs or affecting 10% of the workforce in sites employing 250 people or more are taken into account. Cases are identified through a review of daily papers and the financial press in the Member States.

However, where collective agreements exist, they play a significant role and can, in some cases, even act as a springboard for improving parental leave opportunities, according to the recent comparative study ‘Family-related leave and industrial relations’ from the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). Often perceived as more of a family issue than a work-related one, parental and family-related leave issues are not central to industrial relations across Europe, reveals this study, which is an update of the 1997 analysis on the impact of the 1996 EU parental leave Directive on collective bargaining and other developments in the former EU15 and Norway. The current study goes further than examining only the provisions of the Directive and parental leave, but also deals with all other categories of family-related leave available to employees and examines the role of collective bargaining in developing these types of leave. The report also looks at the positions of the social partners, who tend to focus on problems relating to organisation of work and promote changes to employment conditions and the reduction of working time. Trade unions advocate shared parental leave Trade unions frequently stress the importance of a balanced family policy, fostering gender equality both in the home and at work. In many countries, such as France, Germany, Hungary and Sweden, they tend to focus on problems faced by women trying to return to work after a long period of parental leave and subsequent gender equality implications for the labour market. They advocate parental leave schemes that could be shared, to a greater extent, by both parents and that do not cut them off totally from their jobs. Unions tend to focus their demands on return to work entitlements, the option of part-time work for parents, and compensation for maternity, paternity and parental leave, as well as childcare infrastructure. Employer organisations content with current legislation While many employer organisations express support for an improved work-life balance, some consider that family and parental leave-related issues are not their responsibility and that legislation hampers their ability to do business. Consequently, they are often opposed to improvements to paid leave, which they perceive as creating new costs for companies.

Cultures, political traditions, and living conditions vary throughout the 25 countries and there are large differences in terms of quality of life. However, while material living conditions, employment situations, working conditions, health and subjective well-being reveal wide variations, social support networks and educational levels are broadly similar across the new EU according to the recent findings of the Foundation’s European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS). The survey represents an ambitious attempt to explore quality of life issues in a wide range of countries, providing a synthesis of information on the main aspects, both objective and subjective. It was carried out in the EU25 and three candidate countries (Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey) in May–August 2003. Although differences in living conditions are considerable, values and priorities determining quality of life are not very different across the European Union – there is no underlying reason for a division of us and them, the west and the east,’ says Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s acting Director. ‘However, in order to foster cohesion in a larger and more diversified European Union and to close the gaps in unequal economic development and living standards, policymakers and civil society actors need to know, not only how people live, but also how they perceive their situation and how individual quality of life is assessed. We believe our report can provide this knowledge.’ The next steps The initial findings of the survey are currently being presented to representatives from governments, social partners, civil society and experts, in country visits and international seminars. At the same time, more detailed analysis is underway to examine the data on specific themes and to improve understanding of the results. Four in-depth reports, based on the survey – Quality of life, subjective well-being and perception of society, Households and family, social networks and community life, Living standards and resources, income and employment, subsistence economy, deprivation and exclusion, and Housing and local environment – will be available in early 2005.

The Foundation has recorded a 30% increase in the number of visitors compared to the same period last year, with 165 visitors in May 2004 as against 130 in May 2003. The increase is generally viewed as a result of the Irish Presidency as well as an affirmation of efforts to make the Foundation a meeting place for open and frank discussion. The largest contingent of visitors is from academic institutions, representing 40% of the total number of visitors or 66 out of 165. Government representatives, from Denmark, Italy and Sweden, are the second largest group of visitors: 49 persons belonging to this category came to the Foundation’s premises in Loughlinstown, south County Dublin. ‘The increased number of visitors confirms that our open-door policy works,’ comments Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s acting Director.

The research covers the multi-dimensional concept of quality of life, ranging from households and family, care and community and housing, to local environment and public services. These core domains were selected according to their relevance to quality of life and their position on the EU policy agenda. The findings are based on the Foundation’s own survey of 26,000 people across 28 countries: the 25 EU Member States and the three candidate countries Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey. Putting it into context The quality of life information campaign in 2004 consists of twelve bilateral country visits and four international seminars. During the national events, representatives from governments, social partners, civil society and experts will be invited to debate the findings. ‘We believe improved living and working conditions are essential for the successful completion of the enlargement process,’ says Robert Anderson, research coordinator of the Living Conditions team. ‘Together, these reports constitute a unique and comprehensive source of information and a vital input to policymaking in the fields that affect living and working conditions in an enlarged Europe.’ A quality of life exhibition will be on display in each of the new Member States, presenting other areas of the Foundation’s work in addition to the quality of life focus. Provisional timetable for visits The EMCC’s efforts to identify and examine the impact of drivers of industrial change at the sectoral level have proven beneficial to its users and stakeholders. There is, however, a clear demand on the part of the social partners for EMCC to expand its coverage to include more sectors and begin analysing trends at sub-sectoral level. At present, the EMCC collects information and provides analysis on drivers of change in 26 sectors. 29 June - 2 July 2004 Visit to Poland and Germany 22-24 September 2004 International seminar and visit to Estonia, with invited participants from Denmark, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Sweden 25-27 October 2004 International seminar and visit to Cyprus, with invited participants from Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Malta, Romania and Turkey 9-11 November 2004 International seminar and visit to Slovakia, with invited participants from Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany and Poland 22-24 November 2004 International seminar and visit to France, with invited participants from Belgium, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom 8-10 December 2004 Visit to Latvia and Lithuania (postponed) 2005 Visit to Austria and Slovenia 2005 Visit to Malta 2005 Visit to The Netherlands 2005 Visit to Hungary 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-3-2004-5

This is one of the findings of Financial participation: The role of government and social partners, a recently published report which forms part of the Foundation’s on-going research in the field. While trade unions still remain cautious about the merits of such measures for workers, the report shows that governments and employer organisations have radically changed their attitudes since 1996, when these were last recorded at EU level by the second ‘PEPPER’ report from the European Commission. The report argues that recent changes in some countries, most notably Belgium, appear to have been stimulated by debates at EU level, taking on board many principles developed there.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-3-2004

The report looks at how current trends such as the growing demand for transport services, deregulation and industry reforms, enlargement, funding and innovation all impact on the railway equipment industry in Europe. The outlook for the market seems positive with an expected annual growth rate of 3% to 5%. This should offer opportunities for well-adapted companies to increase their output and create employment, according to industry representatives. To support further growth in the sector, industry is currently calling on policymakers to proceed with further liberalisation of national railways and to support the interoperability of European networks as well as to harmonise acceptance, testing and safety rules for equipment. The report also outlines the consequences for employment in the sector. To illustrate these, the analysis provides company profiles of two major players in the European market – Alstom S.A. of France and Bombardier Inc. of Canada. Despite positive results in their transport business divisions and favourable industry forecasts, both companies are in the process of implementing large-scale restructurings leading to substantial workforce reductions in Europe. The company profiles also set out a brief description of all manufacturing plants affected by these restructuring plans as announced in the European Restructuring Monitor.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-3-2004-0

The event brought together the EMCC’s stakeholders with the aim of reviewing the centre’s achievements over the past two and a half years and plotting its course for the future. More anticipation and monitoring of good practice The EMCC’s main mission is to help social partners, SMEs and businesses, and governments identify and anticipate trends of industrial change. Over the past couple of years, the EMCC has scored points with its stakeholders by identifying and analysing the effects of drivers of change like information technology and financial markets on businesses and sectors. With its Company Network in place and extensive contacts with experts and researchers, the EMCC is well positioned to identify what works in managing change and to disseminate this message to companies throughout Europe. European social partners get involved As an acknowledgement of its efficiency and effectiveness, the European social partners are keen to help marketing the EMCC to users at national level. ‘We are poised to bring our knowledge to a wider audience, and naturally welcome any help in marketing our products and tools,’ says Barbara Gerstenberger, research coordinator of the EMCC team. ‘Since 2002, our efforts have borne fruit: about 300 people have participated in EMCC exchange events across Europe, the EMCC portal has recorded almost 100,000 user sessions and over 50 seminar reports, case examples and sector analysis have been published.’ Sticking to the sectoral approach The EMCC’s efforts to identify and examine the impact of drivers of industrial change at the sectoral level have proven beneficial to its users and stakeholders. There is, however, a clear demand on the part of the social partners for EMCC to expand its coverage to include more sectors and begin analysing trends at sub-sectoral level.

Europeans are very satisfied with the quality of their family life, according to findings from two recent Foundation surveys on quality of life and family issues in the enlarged EU of 25. Having family support is a key element in a multi-dimensional concept of quality of life across the EU25, ranked third behind ‘good health’ and ‘sufficient income’ in terms of the most important factors. Family still the cornerstone of European society Family policy in Europe faces key challenges resulting from rapid economic, social, cultural and political change. The family – its structure, domestic arrangements, and sources of support – is a crucial component in a successful economic and social policy, argues the Foundation in its report on Fertility and family issues in an enlarged Europe. The report puts the spotlight on the importance of family support for quality of life, as perceived by Europeans across 25 Member States. Care for the elderly a family matter With today’s increased life expectancy and lower fertility rates, there is a growing gap between the increasing numbers of elderly people who need care and the declining number of family members available to provide it. The research shows that at present around 25% of adults in the new EU Member States are involved in regular but informal care of others, compared with around 21% of people in the former EU15. However, given the ageing of the population, the number of persons in need of care is expected to grow in the near future. The report shows that 80% of people in the new EU Member States advocate extended family care in the future, with a corresponding figure of 59% in the EU15. When asked who should pay for the care of elderly parents, people in the new EU Member States are divided between state financing and sharing costs with families, while half the people in the former EU15 favour state financing. Good sense of inter-generational solidarity Solidarity between generations is found to be quite strong, counteracting often-repeated claims in the public arena of a ‘war between the generations’. Some 85% of people in the new EU Member States and the former EU15 claim that deep conflicts between the generations do not exist. Almost half of the citizens of the former EU15 declare racial and ethnic tensions to be the most important societal dimensions, whereas more than half of the population in the new EU Member States identify tensions between rich and poor as the main dividing line in society. Different perceptions of family policy According to the findings, people in the former EU15 consider that social policy directed at families with children should focus on reducing unemployment and raising employment rates. They also feel that flexible working hours and available childcare provisions are important aspects of social policy. Citizens in the new Member States, however, have different priorities: they indicate that government initiatives aimed at increasing child-related income and reducing child-related costs are of paramount importance in family policies.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-3-2004-4

The manufacturing sector in Belgium was worst hit, with massive redundancies following the closure of Ford’s plant in Genk, followed by Luxembourg, Denmark and Finland. This confirms the trend that Europe’s small economies are suffering most in the current economic climate.

However, part-time workers also experience fewer opportunities for training and career progression, less job tenure, lower salary levels and reduced access to supplementary payments and social protection benefits, according to the first topic report on the new European Working Conditions Observatory (EWCO). One of the most important changes in Europe’s employment structure over the past 10 years concerns the increasing diversification of working-time schedules. The most evident of this is the rise in the rate of part-time work relative to full-time employment. Part-time work has expanded in the EU, currently affecting around 18.1% of the total EU working population. ‘Part-time employment has been publicly praised as a tool for promoting market flexibility and reorganising working time, for family policy and for redistributing existing employment - and therefore for reducing unemployment,’ says Agnès Parent-Thirion, research coordinator for the working conditions team. ‘For employers, part-time work can permit greater flexibility in responding to market requirements, for example by increasing capacity utilisation or extending opening hours.’	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-1-2004-7

This figure amounts to around 220,000 people per year under the conditions of freedom of movement. Nevertheless, a real risk of a 'brain drain' from the new Member States remains, argues the Foundation in a new study on Migration trends in an enlarged Europe. The study recommends that the appropriate regional and structural policy measures to stimulate growth and encourage young and highly qualified employees to remain in their countries need to be put in place. This is necessary if enhanced labour mobility in an enlarged European Union is to be beneficial for both sides. Risk of 'youth and brain drain' The study, based on survey findings, reveals a serious risk of a 'youth and brain drain' from the acceding countries, with about 2-3% of the 15-24 age group indicating a 'firm intention' to move. One third of potential migrants declaring a firm intention to migrate are students and a quarter are well-qualified with a third-level standard of education. 'The dilemma of migration as a policy challenge to the EU, is that while labour mobility may be good for economic growth and cohesion across the EU as a whole, it may put pressure on social cohesion at local level, if not accompanied by a coherent approach to integration', comments Hubert Krieger, research manager in the Living Conditions team. Unemployment has an influence on migration, but to a much lesser extent than was previously thought and only in a limited number of countries. Overall, only 2% of unemployed people indicated a firm intention to move.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-1-2004-2

The European Restructuring Monitoring (ERM), the monitoring tool of the Foundation’s European Monitoring Centre of Change (EMCC), has reported on more than 260,000 redundancies resulting from some 600 restructuring cases across all sectors in Europe in 2003. Laying the groundwork The Foundation was invited to set up the EMCC two and a half years ago, in response to a proposal by the High Level Group on Industrial Change, following the massive disruptions and layoffs which resulted from the sudden closing down of the Renault plant in Vilvoorde, Belgium, in 1997. The initiative received the support of the European Parliament, the European Council, the European Commission and the Social Partners at European level. EMCC’s mission is to cast a spotlight on the economic and social changes resulting from developments and shifts in technologies, work organisation, production and business models, legislation, working practices and the labour market that drive change in the European economy. During the preparatory phase, the EMCC has devised and put into place several valuable monitoring instruments. The European Restructuring Monitor provides regular data on restructuring cases in Europe, while the EMCC Sector Futures is a series of forward-looking articles describing the changing dynamics of a selected sector, as well as presenting future scenarios and outlining relevant policy issues. Finally, the EMCC Company Network Seminars provide a forum where all the actors involved in change, in particular those at company level, can focus on selected issues such as how to integrate older workers and how gender balance can help companies gain a competitive edge. Towards a sectoral approach Barbara Gerstenberger believes that in future the EMCC will focus on a smaller number of issues and approaches. 'Today we are covering too many subjects, and cater to too wide an audience,’ she says. ‘But that is because we are still experimenting. We are concentrating our present efforts on monitoring, debating, researching and applying the foresight methodology to develop future scenarios in selected sector. In five years' time, I believe we will be contributing to sectoral social dialogue'. Outlining the future challenges for European competitiveness The first EMCC annual conference will take place in Brussels on 28-29 April 2004. It will bring together around 100 representatives from companies, social partner organisations, EU institutions and regional authorities. The conference will include a round table at which invited experts will take a critical look at the European quest for flexible companies and an adaptable workforce. The event will also provide the Foundation with an opportunity to showcase the contribution EMCC has made over the past two and a half years to the understanding, anticipation and management of industrial change.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-1-2004-5

The report examines a small number of these in terms of their focus on working conditions, multi-sectoral approach, and frequency. 'Over the past four years, the Foundation’s working conditions surveys have been among the most popular documents downloaded from the Eurofound website. There are a number of reasons for this, not least the current policy focus across Europe and sound research and analysis by the working conditions team. The approach and methods used in the Foundation’s working conditions survey are currently emulated by government agencies in Italy and Spain, and as far afield as Australia, Canada, and USA, as well as by the International Labour Organisation (ILO).	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-1-2004-1

As the Foundation’s third European working conditions survey revealed, both of these sectors are undergoing significant upheaval, triggered by the introduction of new technology, more intense international competition and new work practices. The studies provide a detailed analysis of these developments, based on qualitative and quantitative data from all 15 Member States, as well as literature reviews. The topics covered range from the quality of employees’ health and working conditions to the regulatory environment and trends. There are also recommendations for solutions to various problems, supported by case studies. EU road freight transport sector According to the road freight transport report , drivers in this sector are experiencing an increasing lack of control over their jobs. Demands from customers for faster 'just in time' (JIT) deliveries, coupled with the introduction of new 'Big Brother' technologies in vehicles, such as GPS satellite systems, are just two of the recent developments that have contributed to this problem. To add to these challenges, staff face mounting pressure to take on a wider range of tasks as companies strive to reduce costs in this highly competitive and cyclical industry. Drivers are frequently expected to load and unload vehicles, as well as perform warehouse duties. This exposes them to additional risks. Increasingly, they are also the company’s sole point of contact with customers, requiring new communication skills, including foreign languages as the sector spreads its wings across national boundaries. Many drivers, however, lack these skills: the typical employee is male, about 40 and with a relatively low level of education. Despite these additional responsibilities and obstacles, training is limited, largely due to the fact that over 65% of road freight businesses employ fewer than 10 staff and lack the necessary resources. Regulatory compliance is also low. The picture is not all bleak, however. Technological advances have reduced employees’ exposure to fumes and vapours, while more ergonomic truck designs have reduced the risk of musculoskeletal disorders. Even some of the new on-board devices, have had positive spin-offs, including improved road safety. EU hotel and restaurant sector The hospitality industry must 're-think its business models and ways of attracting and keeping employees' if it is to satisfy consumers' demands for higher and more flexible levels of service, according to the Foundation's report on the sector. In particular, hotels and restaurants will have to treat staff more like investments, rather than costs, with a stronger emphasis on training and more secure employment contracts. At present, the sector is characterised by low wages, anti-social hours and a predominantly young, under-educated workforce, most operating on temporary or short-term employment contracts due to the industry’s highly seasonal nature. In some countries, there is even a trend towards hiring staff on an 'on-call' basis. As a result, employee turnover tends to be high and level of experience low. However, a number of trends within the hospitality sector are likely to induce change. For example, consumers are increasingly switching from 'sun' holidays to more specialist, 'up-market' holidays involving cultural and environmental attractions and activities, each requiring particular employee skills. Generally, the market is becoming more fragmented. The need for greater computer and technical literacy among staff is also intensifying as technology becomes more deeply ingrained in the sector. Moreover, the ageing of Europe’s population raises questions about the commercial wisdom of the industry’s strong slant towards young employees, particularly female staff. Inevitably, these challenges are not universal. The larger hotels and restaurant chains appear to be addressing these issues. The problem is that the vast majority of businesses in the sector are small- to medium-sized enterprises, still cocooned in the past.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-1-2004-6

This is according to the Foundation’s new report, A new organisation of time throughout working life, to be presented at an Italian Presidency EU seminar in Bologna on ageing and pensions on 18 September 2003. The report says public policy and the social partners should support a dynamic life-course policy. This would involve creating time arrangements which provide more employee-friendly working time flexibility without reducing competitiveness, and allow individual employees and families to accumulate time over the life course (long term working time accounts) and through later retirement (abolish early retirement schemes). These ‘time accounts’ could then be used in a flexible way in relevant phases of a person’s life for the purposes of care, lifelong learning and leisure. The report argues that being able to offset the availability of substantial fully paid time blocks in early life phases against a substantial increase in effective retirement age should ensure winners all round.

His legacy is the working conditions survey, a unique monitoring tool which has inspired similar surveys around the world. The Foundation’s method of monitoring working conditions in the European Union and the acceding and candidate countries is now used by government agencies in the European Union (notably Italy and Spain), Australia, Canada, and USA, as well as by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). ‘We established the monitoring tool to map the current situation and keep an eye on developments in working conditions in Europe,’ says Pascal Paoli. ‘It is a unique source of information which we regularly use for primary and secondary analysis in our work.’ Changing face of working conditions While working conditions in general and quality of work and employment in particular is high on today’s social policy agenda in the EU, this has not always been the case. During the 1980s and well into the 1990s, with the increasing use of technology and job creation in the fast-growing services industries, European socio-economic policymakers focused on other issues as they perceived the problem of poor working conditions as solved. However, the Lisbon Summit with its employment goals for Europe by 2010 has put the emphasis firmly back on this area again. ‘We have worked steadily since the early 1990s to put quality of work and employment back on the agenda,’ says Pascal Paoli. Popular information source A combination of current political focus across Europe and sound research and analysis over the past three years meant that reports originating from the working conditions team have been among the most downloaded publications on the Foundation’s website EuroFound. ‘I like to believe it shows that we produce reports on issues that are current and important to policymakers,’ comments Pascal Paoli. Pastures new Pascal Paoli leaves the Foundation to take up the post of programme manager for the Working Environment unit at the Foundation’s sister organisation, the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) in Bilbao, Spain. ‘Working in the Foundation and living in Ireland has been a pleasurable challenge,’ says Pascal Paoli. ‘The Foundation has come a long way since I joined in 1985, with its four research managers, nine translators, and very small administration.

The annual overview Industrial relations in the EU, Japan and USA shows that some two-thirds of the workforce in the new enlarged European Union is covered by collective bargaining. Although collective bargaining coverage is lower in the acceding countries than in the current EU Member States, workers' pay and working conditions across Europe of 25 are agreed collectively to a much greater extent than in Japan and USA. This reflects the sharp differences in the industrial relations systems between the three economies. 'This is the single most striking difference between industrial relations in the EU on the one hand, and in the USA and Japan on the other,' says Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s Acting Director. Europe leads the way in employee involvement Research shows that 13 of the current 15 EU Member States have widespread statutory or agreed systems of indirect or direct employee representation at company or workplace levels, with the exception of the United Kingdom and Ireland - and a 2002 EU Directive on national information and consultation rules is likely to spread such arrangements even to these two countries. Across the EU, some 700 European works councils have been established in multinational companies, following the 1994 European Commission’s directive on the issue. Also, a majority of current EU countries have a statutory system of employee representation on company boards. The new EU Member States will also be required to transpose the information and consultation directive into their own legislation. In contrast, neither Japan nor USA has any legislation providing for work councils-type structures or board-level employee representation, although forms of own-initiatives do exist, especially in Japan. Steady decline in union membership A common feature of Europe, Japan and the USA is that union membership has generally been falling in recent decades. However, average trade union membership levels in the EU are still significantly higher than those in Japan and USA. It is predicted that the EU 25 will have average levels of trade union density of 29%, while Japan stands at 20% and USA at 13%. In terms of union density, this is generally lower in the acceding countries than in the current EU Member States.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-1-2004-3

These are among the main conclusions from a joint study on living conditions and quality of life by the European Commission and the Foundation, providing a social picture of the current European Union (EU 15) and the acceding and candidate countries (ACC 13) on the eve of enlargement. 'The results of the survey support an integrated employment policy, focusing on higher employment rates to achieve better quality jobs,' said Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s Acting Director. 'With this report , we have for the first time an analysis of social conditions across the ""new Europe"". It also represents the launching pad for the Foundation’s monitoring initiative on quality of life in Europe, complementing the industrial relations and working conditions monitoring tools.' The good life The survey finds that good health, sufficient income and having a family are the three main factors contributing to a good life for the majority of Europeans. When other less important factors are analysed, some differences appear between the EU 15 and the ACC 13: a good job, good relationship with a partner, having children, and adequate accommodation are mentioned more frequently in the ACC 13 than in the EU 15. Having enough leisure time to enjoy life is also relatively more important in the EU 15. Money matters The next wave of enlargement will widen the range of economic inequality across the EU - from 2.8 times higher GDP per capita in the current EU 15 to 6.5 times in the EU 25, thus shifting the north-south divide in economic development and living standards to an east-west bias. Overall, the report found that life satisfaction in the 28 countries is strongly linked to income level and GDP per capita. Deficits within the ACC 13 on traditional economic indicators are matched by poor life satisfaction scores. Bulgaria, Romania and Latvia reported the lowest levels of satisfaction with life ever recorded in EU surveys. The focus of EU policy on economic convergence is therefore justified as a means to improve quality of life in acceding countries, argues the report. GDP growth and economic catch-up will over time result in improved life satisfaction on the ACC 13. Having a good job most important The majority of Europeans agree that having a job provides not only income but also social contacts, self-esteem and a better quality of life. Those who have been unemployed for at least two years over the previous five years report lower satisfaction with life in general, with family life, with social life, and with health than those who have been in continuous employment. The complete report and the seven comparative studies on quality of life are available."	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-1-2004-4

The report, The future of IT – now it’s getting personal, is the first in a series of forward-looking features from the European Monitoring Centre on Change, the Foundation’s information and exchange resource on anticipating and managing change. The report looks at trends and drivers that will affect the future of the ICT industry and could consequently impact on the lives and work of European citizens. Sector Futures The Sector Futures series is based on collecting information from existing European foresight studies, scenario work, innovative studies and reliable data sources. Six sectors have been chosen and three articles will be published under each sector. The first will give a broad picture of the changing dynamic of the sector under discussion, the second will present future scenarios for the sector and the third will elaborate on key issues for European policymakers. Sector Futures is the newest initiative in the EMCC’s monitoring activities. The aim is to identify socio-economic trends and put them in perspective, hence facilitating their use by company managers and workers, social partners and policymakers, researchers and local authorities. Monitoring industrial change at European level The EMCC has been fully operational for almost a year. While still in its developmental phase, the Foundation project has gained increasing support from policy and opinion makers at EU-level. In a recent draft of their joint statement outlining a European framework for managing change, the European social partners identified the EMCC as a ‘valuable tool for monitoring and organising exchanges’ . The European Parliament called on the EMCC to co-organise the public hearing on industrial restructuring in its Economic and Social Affairs Committee on 17 June 2003. The social partners and the European Commission, part of the broad coalition of organisations and institutions that originally called for the establishment of EMCC in 2001, are active in the management of the EMCC as members of its Steering Committee. The EMCC team consists of Gregorio De Castro, Janet Smith, Jacques Terrenoire, Barbara Gerstenberger, Nicole Romain and Catherine Cerf (absent). Web portal focus The EMCC portal is the cornerstone of the project. Its structure reflects the different areas of activity of EMCC. The EMCC Exchange section disseminates information related to the company network seminars and the sector workshops organised by EMCC, while the EMCC Monitor section opens the door to all monitoring tools. The browse function provides access to a regularly updated matrix of research findings, company cases, legal framework documents, collective agreements, scenarios, statistics, policies and organisations relevant to anticipating and monitoring industrial change in Europe. The European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) Although by no means the only phenomenon related to industrial change, company restructuring is one of its most visible and talked-about outcomes. Between April and June 2003, companies across Europe announced the loss of almost 61,500 jobs as a result of their restructuring initiatives, according to recent data from the European Restructuring Monitor. The ERM is a new tool for monitoring restructuring on the EMCC web portal. It records restructuring cases and their effects on employment in all EU Member States as announced in the financial press. ‘ ERM was established to illustrate the magnitude of company restructuring in Europe – to help quantify the problem while showing which sectors and countries are particularly affected,’ says Barbara Gerstenberger, research manager at the EMCC Company network seminars A central task of EMCC is to stimulate the exchange of experience and debate between those who deal with managing change on a day-to-day basis. During 2003, managers and workers’ representatives were invited to a series of company network seminars, examining how businesses are coping with change brought about by international-isation, mergers and acquisitions or restructuring. ‘While each company network seminar has examined a specific change situation, five common factors for dealing with change successfully can be identified,’ says Jacques Terrenoire, project manager of the EMCC. ‘Communication between workers, management and stakeholders is essential to bring about successful change, as well as planning every step of the change procedure well in advance, involving the right people. The allocation of a sufficient amount of time was another key success factor we identified, as well as the importance of creating a culture of change in the company, where all people involved are expecting and preparing for continuous change. The final ingredient is trust.’ The last company network seminar in the 2003 series is entitled Transforming organisations – the importance of leadership and culture in managing change and will take place in Madrid, Spain on 23-24 September 2003. Research on drivers of change EMCC research activities focus on the identification of drivers of change in a particular sector. The aim is to provide an overview of recent developments in the sector and illustrate the findings through case studies. An outlook on the future is provided through scenarios developed for the sector under discussion. To date, research has been completed on the graphics and media industry and the fisheries sector, with research projects for the automotive industry and the textiles and leather sector to be completed by the end of this year. ‘ We try to present our research findings in a form that allows us to use them as input for our exchange events: for example, last year’s research results form the basis for this year’s events,’ comments Janet Smith, research manager at the EMCC. ‘This way, we make sure people read our products, think about them, and exchange views on the findings in the sector workshops.’ Log on to the EMCC For further information contact Gregorio De Castro 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-4-2003-3

This raises numerous issues for employers, employees and their representatives, especially in terms of the relationship between workers’ privacy and employers’ need to control and monitor the use of ICT. The August 2003 comparative study from the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) focuses on an important issue resulting from the growth of ICT: the relationship between internet/email use at work and respect for workers’ privacy. It highlights the need for clear regulation at European level by mapping and comparing the differences in existing European and national law on workplace privacy, and it offers the views of the social partners. The matter is especially topical at present, with the European Commission expected to propose a Directive on workplace data protection in 2004 or 2005. While the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and other national data protection legislation clearly spell out the privacy rights of the individual, the rules and regulations governing privacy at the workplace are based on a complex web of guidelines and individual agreements at company level, often compromising either the individual worker’s or the employer’s rights. Against the backdrop of increasing use of new technology, and particularly of email and the internet in the employment context, the frontier between private life and work life is becoming increasingly blurred. The EIRO study concludes that the use of new technology at the workplace must be examined as part of a broader context incorporating respect for privacy and the protection of personal data in a work setting. The risks of conflicting interests on either side of the employment relationship have grown sharply over the last few years, given the increased use of ICT at the workplace and in all aspects of enterprises’ activities. The EIRO study asks such pertinent questions as: ‘To what extent may a worker use ICT equipment for private reasons given that a general ban on the use of the internet for other than professional reasons does not appear realistic in an information/ communication society?’ and ‘How far can employers’ actions aimed at preventing potential dangers be extended without undermining workers’ fundamental rights?’ The EIRO comparative study, New technology and the respect for privacy at the workplace, is available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/2003/07/study/TN0307101S.html 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-4-2003-2

Hailed as one of Europe’s ‘top experts in the field of employment and labour relations policy’ (Le Monde), he had devoted himself during the past three years to developing the Foundation’s role in promoting the European social debate. A wide-ranging career Raymond-Pierre Bodin was born in France in 1948. A doctor in sociology, his career spanned the different worlds of civil service, university, private enterprise and, finally, a European Union organisation. He began his career at the French Ministry of Labour, and then followed a period of academic life as professor of social psychology and labour sociology at the Pierre Mendès-France University in Grenoble, France. In 1989 he became managing director of Eurotec Manducher (Klöckner Group), then human resources director of Klöckner Automotive. In 1996 he was appointed senior vice-president of human resources at Aventis Pharma, formerly Rhône-Poulenc Rorer. The acceding country observers were introduced to the work of the Foundation in detail during a day-long induction seminar, prior to the Administrative Board meeting. It was Raymond-Pierre Bodin’s abiding passion for better living and working conditions for all citizens which led him to seek the challenging position of Director of the Foundation, a post he took up in May 2000. Enhancing the role of the Foundation Raymond-Pierre Bodin believed the Foundation has a vital role to play in achieving better life and better work in Europe. During his three years at the Foundation, he threw himself into the task of re-shaping the work programme, concentrating the Foundation’s activities around fewer and more substantial research projects and establishing monitoring tools for each core research area. A direct result of these efforts is a greater visibility for the Foundation among policy- and decision-makers at European and national level. New direction ahead The Foundation’s Deputy Director Willy Buschak will take charge during the interim period, while the recruitment process for a new director takes place. ‘We intend to honour the commitments Pierre has made, and to work hard at the task of putting a new four-year work programme 2005-2008 in place,’ says Willy Buschak. ‘We will endeavour to maintain his vision of achieving a better life and better work for all.’ 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-4-2003-4

EUROFOUND_UNK_0778	2010-08-11	UNK	Communiqué, issue 5, 2003	"Articles Approaching enlargement Changes in Europe's financial services market Foundation seminar: living and working conditions in 2010 EIRO expands to cover ten enlargement countries Promoting employee financial participation Enlargement: longer working hours in the acceding and candidate countries European Restructuring Monitor Observers from the acceding countries join the Administrative Board Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Workers in the acceding and candidate countries work longer and report a higher level of risk to their health and safety than their counterparts in the EU. These are among the findings of the Foundation’s survey (summary available) of working conditions in acceding and candidate countries, published on 23 October. The average working week in the future Member States is over six hours longer than in the current Member States (44.4 hours per week compared to 38.2 hours). The proportion of workers working very long weeks (over 45 hours) is nearly twice as high in the ACC as in the current EU. These findings based on survey data may go some way to explain the high levels of work-related fatigue reported by workers in the applicant countries (41% compared to 23% in the EU). Scope of the survey The Foundation extended its European working conditions survey to cover the then applicant Member States in 2001. The survey for Turkey was carried out in 2002. Over ten thousand workers were interviewed with the same questionnaire used in the Third European working conditions survey (2000). Their responses provide an interesting snapshot of working conditions in the future Member States and offer a basis of comparison with the existing fifteen Member States following the Foundation’s three EU working conditions surveys in 1990, 1995 and 2000. Despite convergence in recent years, one of the principal conclusions of the report, Working conditions in acceding and candidate countries, is that there exist significant differences in terms of workforce structure and working conditions between the old and new EU Member States. Structural and gender differences One in five of the workforce in the acceding and candidate countries works in the agricultural sector compared to only one in twenty in the EU. In terms of work organisation, work tends to be less decentralised, less service-oriented and more hierarchical in the new states. But the gender differences that characterise the EU workplace are less marked in the acceding and candidate countries where the survey data reveals a more even distribution of women in different job categories and sectors as well as at different hierarchical levels within their organisations. Positive input to enlargement According to Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s Acting Director, ""these survey findings will provide a positive input to the socio-economic policies for the new enlarged European Union and serve as a basis for monitoring future trends in working conditions."" The fourth European working conditions survey, planned for early 2005, will cover workers in the 25 EU Member States as well as applicant states and selected third countries. RESEARCH IN FIGURES Levels of overall fatigue significantly higher in the acceding and candidate countries Workers exposed to work-related health problems The perception that health and safety are at risk because of work is more widespread in the acceding and candidate countries (ACC) than in the current EU Member States. The most frequent complaints are overall fatigue, backache, stress, and muscular pains, together with other problems usually found in heavy industrial work, which characterises the work environment in the acceding and candidate countries. While stress and muscular pain are as common in the current 15 EU Member States as in the ACC, overall fatigue is significantly higher in the acceding and candidate countries.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0779	2010-08-11	UNK	Communiqué, issue 5, 2003	"Articles Approaching enlargement Changes in Europe's financial services market Foundation seminar: living and working conditions in 2010 EIRO expands to cover ten enlargement countries Promoting employee financial participation Enlargement: longer working hours in the acceding and candidate countries European Restructuring Monitor Observers from the acceding countries join the Administrative Board Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing The Foundation is preparing to draw up a new set of indicators to benchmark measures promoting employee financial participation schemes in the EU Member States. Financial participation has become more widespread throughout the EU during the 1990s, following new and extensive legislative measures and tax concessions in all EU Member States. However, still only one third (31%) of Europe’s companies with more than 200 employees have an employee share ownership scheme in place, raising concerns that costs and administration hinder the large-scale introduction of such schemes. A share in the profits Financial participation is when employees participate in the financial results of the activity of the firm. This may take the form of a share in the profits, over and above the remuneration normally paid to employees, or a share in the ownership of the firm. New products from EIRO In 1999, the Foundation began a major research project on the nature and extent of financial participation in the EU. The results, published in the report Recent trends in employee financial participation in the EU, illustrated large differences in the levels of use and types of financial participation schemes. More importantly, the report revealed a strong relationship between broad-based financial participation and team-based work structures, and between financial participation and representative participation. It also showed that financial participation does not weaken the role of trade unions or works councils. France and the UK lead the way Employee financial participation schemes are fairly evenly distributed between those that are broad-based – covering all employees (52% of cases) – and those that are narrow-based – targeting management and higher-level staff (48% of cases). Profit-sharing schemes are more common, being found in more than 45% of companies, and a higher proportion of such schemes tend to be broad-based. France has the highest number of profit-sharing schemes, supported by mandatory regulations and promotional activities, while the United Kingdom, with its established tradition of financial participation, has the highest number of share ownership plans in the EU. Benchmarking to measure success The second phase of the Foundation’s financial participation project, which was launched in May of this year, will see the establishment of a set of indicators aimed at measuring the success of national policies and practices of financial participation arrangements in EU Member States. ""We also hope to explore and explain what barriers European small and medium-sized companies have to overcome in introducing financial participation schemes,"" says Christian Welz, research manager at the Foundation. Social partners warm to the idea Although Foundation research suggests that employer organisations and trade unions at confederate level are increasingly in favour of financial participation, employers associations and trade unions tend to be largely absent in the detailed regulation of financial participation schemes at corporate levels.

Electronic banking, cross-border mergers and acquisitions, the arrival of the euro, and supermarket credit cards and loans are just a few of the changes that have transformed traditional banking over the past two decades. The spread of information and communication technologies (ICT) is identified as the main driver of change, spurred on by European integration and the proposal to create a single market in financial services. The Foundation’s European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) also looks at restructuring and social trends affecting the sector in this second Sector Futures article. A decade of intense change During the past decade, the number of credit institutions in Europe has been almost halved, due to mergers and acquisitions and ‘cooperations’. There have also been huge job cuts in the financial industry. However, the EMCC Sector Futures feature on the financial services market reveals that to date most mergers have taken place in Member States rather than across borders. New initiatives and services The move from state-financed to private pension systems, one possible means of offsetting the explosion of the so-called pension time bomb, will provide a major boost to the savings and capital markets. Today, the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands hold over 50% of the private pension funds assets in the EU, a figure that is expected to rise significantly should EU governments allow individuals to take greater responsibility for their own financial futures.The article argues that this kind of privatisation of welfare across the EU could spawn new services such as private health care and unemployment insurance, resulting in greater flexibility in the financial market. While the article acknowledges that there is a risk that some groups of people will be left behind as a result of these changes, it also asserts that new openings for non-traditional providers – including community or trade union based initiatives and credit unions – will offer new solutions not open to commercial lending and credit institutions. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-5-2003-3
EUROFOUND_UNK_0782	2010-08-11	UNK	Communiqué Issue 1, 2003	"Articles More women at work, still with less pay MEP calls for greater visibility for the Foundation Focusing on CSR as a process, not a product Challenges and opportunities for social dialogue in an enlarged EU Violence and harassment in the workplace on the increase News in brief Research in figures Inside the Foundation More women at work, still with less pay Public authorities and social partners should implement strategies aimed at tackling gender segregation and pay differentials in labour markets across the European Union, the Foundation argues in its third Foundation paper, Quality of women's work and employment: tools for change. Employment rates for women rose from 50.6% to 54.9% over the period 1997-2001 according to European Commission figures, highlighting how much women have benefited from the creation of new jobs throughout the EU. With important in-roads into the higher-status professional and managerial positions, women's participation rates are moving closer to the Lisbon European Council goal of a female employment rate of 60% by 2010. But despite this progress, there are still problems in terms of job quality and working conditions for women in the EU labour market. 'Despite a growing rate of employment for women, gender participation and pay gaps remain a persistent feature of the European labour market,' says Raymond-Pierre Bodin, the Foundation's Director. 'The third Foundation paper identifies the need to improve the gender division of paid and unpaid work as well as the potential advantages, for men and women alike, of a better work–life balance.' Better but still not good enough Both Foundation research and other EU sources confirm that a gender participation gap of on average 20% exists across the European Union. The Foundation figures, based on 30,556 interviews with economically active and inactive men and women across the EU and Norway in 1998, reveal that women are less likely to be in paid work during each age-band. The differences are most marked in the 20-40 age-band. This implies that women's participation in paid work is curtailed by the mismatch between existing social arrangements for childcare and work organisation. The research also shows that women continue to be paid less for doing the same, or similar, work as men. 'Women are still under-represented in some jobs and over-represented in others, relative to their percentage share of total employment,' says Sabrina Tesoka, research manager in the Foundation. 'Gender differences are also evident in the ""second shift"" of household work.' A high priority issue Raising employment rates has become one of the EU’s top priorities. The European Employment Strategy, which came in the wake of the 1997 Luxembourg Jobs Summit, took several steps towards tackling the issues and there is a growing awareness of the importance of women in shaping the future EU labour market. EU legislation in the field of equal opportunities has also received much attention in recent years, probably most evident in the policies of gender mainstreaming following the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty in the Member States. The tools for change The Foundation paper suggests a series of tools and strategies that could improve the quality of women’s work and employment. Foundation research has repeatedly shown that public authorities and social partners have an essential role to play in redefining a new welfare structure which improves the work and family–life balance. Using collective bargaining as a strategy on the one hand, and corporate initiatives on the other, Foundation research shows that it is possible to raise EU employment rates by supporting women entering or re-entering the labour market. The most determining factor in this process, however, is the quality of women’s jobs. The new Foundation paper, Quality of womens work and employment: tools for change, is available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/EF02110.htm MEP calls for greater visibility for the Foundation The European taxpayer should be aware of just how well their money is being spent, said Danish MEP Freddy Blak, following a visit to the Foundation. The Foundation should have a 'far greater influence' on the social policy debate, asserted Freddy Blak, during his visit to the Foundation on 20 January 2003. 'More people should know about the important work being carried out here,' he said, arguing for a greater visibility for the Foundation throughout the European Union. Mr Blak, a member of the Parliament’s budgetary control committee, was on a two-day visit to Ireland to assess the Foundation's activities. Raymond-Pierre Bodin (left) and Eric Verborgh (right)with Freddy Blak, MEP, and assistants Marina Buch Kristensen and Tea Tramontanta Spotlight on the Living Conditions research Following briefings with each of the research team coordinators at the Foundation, Freddy Blak acknowledged the particular importance of the work of the Living Conditions research team. Information on unemployment strategies, programmes for labour market integration and other such information is, in his view, 'extremely important'. Moreover, MEP Blak would whole-heartedly recommend the work of the Foundation, its website and research reports to his local municipality on his return to Denmark. Need for more openness and transparency Previously the Foundation's work was 'hidden': there was little understanding or awareness of what was actually done here, according to Mr Blak. While this situation has improved in recent times, there is still a need for greater promotion of its work, of increased visibility. 'During the current four-year work programme, information and communication has been given an unprecedented pole position, precisely aimed at improving the visibility of the Foundation,' commented Raymond-Pierre Bodin, the Foundation's Director. 'We have increased the number of visitors to the Foundation, the number of user sessions on our websites, and the number of people accessing our research results. This strategy has already begun to show results, and Mr Blak's comments indicate we are heading in the right direction.' Mr Blak suggested increasing access to the Foundation by opening its doors to student groups and other potential users. 'There is great work being done but the focus should now be on ensuring that people know about it,' he concluded. Focusing on CSR as a process, not a product The Foundation enters the debate on corporate social responsibility with the publication of a new report, which looks at the issue from an innovative perspective where environmental and social issues overlap. The report is a synthesis of two Foundation projects which have examined corporate social responsibility from a working conditions perspective, involving restructuring and subcontracting, and from a living conditions perspective, looking at the effects on living conditions of corporate involvement in the local community and environment. The research is based on case studies of European companies which have voluntarily implemented good practice examples of employment and working conditions, or which are involved in the local community or the promotion of environmentally acceptable practices. The report will be published at the end of February, and will be available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/EF0317.htm. For further information, contact Teresa Renehan, Information Liaison Officer, at e-mail: ter@eurofound.europa.eu Challenges and opportunities for social dialogue in an enlarged EU Governments and social partners are challenged to further develop tripartite structures and the social dialogue in order to foster economic and social progress, especially in the candidate countries. An uneven level of participation in social dialogue and tripartism might undermine the effectiveness of the economic and social policy objectives set throughout the European Union. This was the conclusion of the conference on 'Tripartism in an enlarged EU', co-organised by the Danish Ministry of Employment and the Foundation on 29-30 October 2002. Concrete experiences in the EU Member States show that tripartite cooperation has delivered progress on economic and social goals, sometimes in the framework of employment pacts at national, regional or local level. In candidate countries, tripartism has supported the transition process and the restoration of democracy. However, the actors now face important organisational challenges, and industrial relations structures are still in the process of development. In these countries, collective bargaining coverage and the membership of organisations representing both workers and employers are below the EU average. 'It is clear that we have to mobilise the resources and commitment of all the actors concerned,' comments Eric Verborgh, Deputy Director of the Foundation. 'It will be necessary to build strong partnerships between governments, social partners and other civil society actors.' The conference report is available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/EF0305.htm For further information, contact Marina Patriarka, Information Liaison Officer, at e-mail: mpa@eurofound.europa.eu Violence and harassment in the workplace on the increase By addressing the growing victimisation and bullying in workplaces across Europe, a reduction of up to 2% in the costs of high absenteeism rates, ill–health and early retirement, high staff turnover and increased insurance premiums can be achieved. About 10% of the EU's working population claim to be victimised in the workplace through bullying or harassment. Similarly, up to 10% have been exposed to physical violence (or the threat of it) in the workplace in the last year, according to a recent report by the Foundation. The report, which also highlights the financial benefits to be gained by reducing violence and harassment in the workplace, reveals the problem to be on the increase throughout all EU Member States. Faced with a persistent lack of data, as well as continued disparity between awareness and recognition of all forms of violence and harassment at work, the report makes a distinction between physical and psychological aspects of violence, rather than attempting to define and describe the many forms and aspects of violence and harassment. Women at work The report shows that both men and women experience violence at work, but women remain more vulnerable than men, with women often concentrated in 'high–risk' jobs such as nursing, social work and teaching. Women are also most often victims of intimidation and psychological abuse while men are more frequently exposed to physical violence and assaults. Results also show that sexual harassment at work, particularly against women, is commonplace in all European countries but often still goes unreported due to fear of being ostracised, job loss and other factors. Who carries the cost? Worker productivity can be reduced by about 2% as a result of psychological violence alone, according to the statistics available. There are growing signs of negative financial and productivity implications of violence and harassment at work, with higher absenteeism rates, ill–health and early retirement, high staff turnover and increased insurance premiums. The evidence shows that both physical and psychological violence has serious implications for health and well–being, causing stress disorders and suicidal tendencies, while the effects can negatively impact on relationships with family and friends. Overall cost estimates suggest there are considerable financial gains in reducing workplace violence. Since the regulatory framework for preventing violence and harassment at work is extremely varied across EU Member States, EU bodies are playing an important role in providing possible solutions in terms of policy documents, recommendations and directives.

Topics chosen for the four seminars focus on the responsible management of change. The first seminar will take place in Brussels, Belgium on 12 and 13 March. Entitled 'Managing business internationalisation', it will deal with the challenges of internationalisation, examining how companies have dealt with, and profited from, cultural diversity when they have transferred operations across different countries. A further three seminars will look at responsible management as a general approach, restructuring for growth and job creation, and successful management and leadership styles in business transformation.

The project, which is aimed at monitoring living conditions and quality of life, is expected to feed into the work of the social and demography analysis of the European Commission's Directorate-General for Employment. A first meeting of the network of experts working with the Foundation’s Living Conditions research unit on 'monitoring living conditions and quality of life in candidate countries' was held in Budapest on 26-27 November 2002. The experts will assist with the analysis and interpretation of survey results, covering areas such as housing and living environment; health and health services; education; employment and working conditions; family and social networks; time use; social capital and public services and economic resources.

The EIROnline website also saw its user figures soar with a 156% rise in 2002, indicating that the Foundation’s focus on the Internet as a channel for communication is paying off. The EIROnline website (www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro), recorded a total of over one million user sessions in 2002, and the Eurofound website (www.eurofound.europa.eu) recorded just over 800,000. The number of user sessions for the recently launched portal of the Foundation's European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) (www.eurofound.europa.eu/emcc) is also growing steadily. The increased number of users can be explained in part by the regular updating of keywords by which the Foundation's information can be found in the major search engines on the Internet. In December 2001, 10,570 user sessions originated from search engines, about 19% of total user sessions for that month. In December 2002, 18,681 user sessions originated from a search engine, about 25% of total user sessions. Regular users, i.e. users visiting any of the Foundation websites more than once during a period of one month, have also grown in number. A formal web user survey will be carried out by the Foundation in May and June of this year. 'We decided to focus on the Internet as a tool to disseminate our research information more efficiently and better communicate with our stakeholders and target audiences,' said Fiona Murray, web manager. 'Judging by these statistics, our strategy has paid off.' Gearing up for 2003 The EIRO network gathered in Dublin on 13-14 January 2003, including the new EIRO National Centres for Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. On the agenda were comparative studies on industrial relations and migration, collective bargaining on occupational pensions, and regulation of Internet use by employees, to be published during the year.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0784	2010-08-11	UNK	Communiqué Issue 3, 2003	Articles Better quality jobs will boost EU competitiveness Social dialogue a vital tool for acceding countries in preparation for EMU Industrial restructuring for economic and social growth Understanding the knowledge society Improving labour protection for economically dependent workers Changes to the European industrial relations landscapeImproving labour protection for economically dependent workers News in brief Inside the Foundation Better quality jobs will boost EU competitiveness Increasing focus on the quality of the labour market as a whole is necessary if Europe is to meet its target of creating the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy by 2010, according to the recent high-level EU conference on ‘Better Work and Life’. Co-organised by the Foundation and the current Greek EU Presidency, the conference on 12-13 May in Alexandroupolis, concluded that creating more and better jobs will ensure sustainable economic growth and greater social cohesion. While acknowledging the significance of the quantitative targets set by EU governments in recent years, it has become increasingly important to also examine the quality aspects that affect the work and life of EU citizens. The modern workplace needs to respond to increasing productivity and competitiveness at the same time as offering greater employment protection, better social security and improved pension rights. The conference was thus organised in an effort to encourage European social policymakers to explore how quality can contribute to achieving better jobs in an enlarged European economy, and how quality can be promoted through strong partnerships. ‘Quality that affects the work and life of EU citizens is an issue firmly embedded in the business culture,’ says Raymond-Pierre Bodin, the Foundation’s Director. ‘The challenge today is to introduce it into both the economic and social fields.’ In the same context, the conference concluded that labour markets, employment relations, and working and living conditions in candidate countries differ significantly from the EU Member States and quality matters are important in their modernisation process in order to ensure a smooth accession to the EU and a normal functioning after accession. Promoting social partnerships Concrete experiences in the EU Member States show that strong partnerships have delivered progress on economic and social goals. The conference provided an important forum for the exchange of experiences and views, and contributed to the main issues of the Greek EU Presidency agenda: implementation of the social policy agenda; promotion of employment and modernisation of work organisation; modernisation of social protection and social inclusion; gender equality; social dialogue. Debate focused on better quality of work, employment and life and looked into various experiences and positive examples, revolving around employment status, work and non-work time management, and modernisation of work organisation. Conflicting evidence The discussion indicated clearly that there is conflicting evidence, data, research and experiences in our quest to achieve the desirable and appropriate balance in reconciling these two objectives: better work and life. It was agreed that more effort is necessary to develop additional labour market measures to promote, encourage and sustain labour market flexibility. They should equally help to underpin the quality and value, socially as well as economically, of the very diverse range of experiences in European countries and in those outside Europe as well. Most participants and speakers also agreed that a more strategic, integrated and nuanced policy was needed to look at the overall labour market. This would also tackle the measures necessary to balance the need to create employment with the reality of providing workplace reform, flexibility, social protection, pension reform and lifelong education and training. The challenge remains as to what strategies should be adopted to tackle the issues of low pay, income inequalities, flexible working arrangements, childcare and parental responsibilities as well as the issues facing an ageing population and an ageing workforce. Further information on the event can be downloaded at www.eurofound.europa.eu/industrial/better_work-life.htm Social dialogue a vital tool for acceding countries in preparation for EMU The role of social dialogue for the acceding countries is very important in their preparations for European Monetary Union (EMU), just as it was for the current Eurozone countries decades ago. This was the conclusion of the social partners and government representatives from EU and acceding countries gathered in Vienna, Austria, on 26-28 May. The aim of the workshop was to produce national development plans aimed at aligning economic growth with high levels of employment and social protection in Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia. ‘Social dialogue played an important role in bridging differences among the current Euro-zone countries preparing for Economic and Monetary Union,’ says Christian Welz, of the Foundation. ‘By focusing on producing concrete national development plans, we believe we can transfer these experiences to the acceding countries. And this despite the limitations of their fragile industrial relations systems suffering from declining trade union membership, decentralised collective bargaining systems and assymetrical tripartite structures with strong governments and weak social partners.’ The second phase The initiative is the second phase of the ‘Promotion of social dialogue in central and eastern European candidate countries’ project, a collaborative effort between the Foundation and the Swedish Work Life and EU Enlargement initiative. In 2002, development programmes were established within the framework of the project for Estonia, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovenia, tackling youth unemployment through social dialogue and improving social convergence with the social partners. Using the Maastricht criteria The economic development plans will be submitted to the national Ministries of Labour in the respective candidate countries as well as to national tripartite bodies in order to prepare for eventual implementation and mechanisms. ‘Each national programme includes an analysis of the country’s economic development in the perspective of the Maastricht convergence criteria,’ says Timo Kauppinen, of the Foundation. ‘The national reports primarily deal with the national systems of industrial relations and their potential, but also cover their capacity to support the Maastricht convergence process by means of social dialogue.’ Further information about the workshop is available on http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/industrial/social-dialogue/prog_03.htm Industrial restructuring for economic and social growth The anticipation and management of industrial change in an enlarged European Union is the focus of a high-level hearing co-organised by the Foundation and the Employment and Social Affairs Committee of the European Parliament in Brussels on 17 June, 2003. High-level policymakers, experts, enterprise and trade unions representatives and regional actors will come together to debate the vexed issue of industrial restructuring across Europe. Patterns vary from one country to another and equally across sectors. ‘Two concrete restructuring cases will highlight innovative practices and approaches to tackling restructuring situations,’ says Jacques Terrenoire of the Foundation’s European Monitoring Centre of Change (EMCC), the Parliament’s partner in this event. ‘The first case study is Swedish telecom TeliaSonera whose redeployment and re-education concept allowed for downsizing without redundancies. The second is Italian steel company Falck and the Region Nord-Milano local partnership for job creation and new enterprise structures.’ The event will also hear Members of the European Parliament address European social partners and representatives of the European Commission on the matter. Further information about the workshop is available on www.eurofound.europa.eu/newsroom/archive_news/news_030611.htm Understanding the knowledge society The challenges facing Ireland in advancing the innovation-driven stage of socio-economic development was explored at the first Irish Knowledge Society Foresight meeting in Dublin on 11 June 2003. This gathering set out to evaluate the country’s performance across a range of newly-devised knowledge society advancement indicators. ‘We want to increase understanding of the ‘drivers’ of the knowledge society and to anticipate the potential impacts on living conditions, working conditions and industrial relations,’ says Timo Kauppinen, leader of the Foundation project. ‘Using the foresight methodology, we hope to inform and facilitate policymaking by outlining strategic visions that can be related to present-day decisions.’ Pierre Bodin, the Foundation’s Director, with Helena Acheson, Forfás (Irish Enterprise and Technology Board) and Dermot McCarthy, Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach. Ireland, Greece, Germany and Finland have piloted the establishment of national foresight points. A report comparing the progress of all EU Member States towards fully fledged knowledge society economies will be published towards the end of 2003.The Foundation is currently preparing a comprehensive Handbook on Knowledge Society Foresight which will soon be made available on www.eurofound.europa.eu Improving labour protection for economically dependent workers Industrial restructuring, outsourcing and temporary work arrangements have led to an increased number of economically dependent workers in recent years. This is the focus of the European Parliament public hearing to take place on 19 June in Brussels. The emergence of economically dependent workers – those who are officially self-employed but depend on one single employer for their income – challenges the existing regulatory framework and the current system of labour protection available. ‘Labour legislation should be improved and we need to encourage social dialogue to take up the issue to better reflect the reality of this evolving employment relationship,’ says Stavroula Demetriades, research coordinator of the industrial relations section. ‘There is also a need for representation for economically dependent workers and trade unions could consider providing incentives for recruitment.’ A growing feature of the European labour market Economically dependent workers represent on average 1% of the European workforce. However, the growth of ‘free service contracts’ or the equivalent type of contracts increased in Austria by over 60% between 1998 and 2000, by almost 40% in Greece between 1999 and 2000, and by some 14% in Portugal between 2000 and 2001. The Foundation report, Economically dependent workers, employment law and industrial relations, suggests that labour legislation should be adapted in response to this rising trend and underlines the importance of including social dialogue in any attempts to tackle this issue of concern. The comparative report is available on www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/2002/05/study/TN0205101S.html Changes to the European industrial relations landscape A continued decline in trade union membership, increasing pressures on employer organisations, as well as several major mergers across the European Union, resulted in significant changes to the structure of European social partner organisations during 2002. A first joint effort The report Industrial relations developments in Europe 2002 is the first joint publication between the Foundation and the European Commission in the field of industrial relations. ‘It examines a wide range of key issues covered by collective bargaining. These include pay, working time, job security and equal opportunities and diversity issues,’ says Stavroula Demetriades, research coordinator of the industrial relations team at the Foundation. It also looks at legislative developments and the organisation and role of the social partners, industrial action, employee participation, new forms of work (especially telework) and vocational training. The Commission’s contribution focuses on social dialogue developments throughout Europe while the Foundation provides wide-ranging information on industrial relations shifts as well as the thematic chapter on migration trends. Job security in times of restructuring At the labour market level, job security remained a key concern for trade unions in many countries, as waves of enterprise restructuring and downsizing continued to sweep across Europe. Some countries, notably Spain, Greece, Italy and Finland, saw some innovative agreements to maintain job security. The gender pay gap remains wide, averaging 20% across the EU and Norway despite efforts by Belgium and Finland to address the issue by establishing a legal framework for equal pay. Mapping migration across Europe Migration has reached record levels in recent years with 19 million non-nationals currently living in EU Member States, accounting for 5.1% of the EU’s total population. In most countries, migrants are concentrated at the top and the bottom ends of the labour market. The average migrant worker – especially from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) – is in a disadvantaged position when compared to nationals in terms of working and living conditions. As EU governments address the issues of controlled immigration and labour shortages, and social partners focus on migrants’ employment rates and pay conditions, the report analyses the labour market and employment situation for migrant workers across Europe and outlines the key elements of government policy and legislation in this area. The report can be downloaded at www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/annualreports.html News in brief Evaluating the Foundation’s role and influence on time issues A new publication on time and time-related issues, drawing on the vast body of work the Foundation has carried out since its inception in 1975, outlines to what extent these issues have been addressed at European and national levels. The report represents a new departure from other Foundation publications since it includes a public evaluation of the Foundation’s role and influence in the domain, critically assessing both the management of research and the dissemination of findings. The report will be available shortly on www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/EF0309.htm Making Europe a better place to live and work ‘The Foundation’s work has contributed more efficiently to the EU social policy agenda in 2002, in particular to equal opportunities for men and women, financial participation and temporary agency work,’ says Raymond-Pierre Bodin, the Foundation’s Director, on the publication of the Foundation’s Annual report 2002. ‘We still, however, see a strong need to link the Foundation’s analysis of living conditions to both the changing nature of employment, work organisation, and working conditions and to the modernisation of social protection and social welfare services.’ In 2002, monitoring activities have been incorporated into each core area of the Foundation’s work, marking a shift in the balance between monitoring activities and strategic research. Also, 2002 saw concerted efforts to consolidate and present Foundation research on specific topics in a user-friendly format, drawing on existing Foundation research and providing an overview of work on themes linked to the EU social policy agenda. The Annual report 2002 is available on http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/EF0318.htm ‘Open door’ policy for Foundation’s information centre The Foundation’s information centre is currently being upgraded to improve access to information for Foundation staff, visitors and external research collaborators. The first phase saw an architectural overhaul of the library, making way for modern workplaces. The second phase involves improving online research tools, access to current information and databases. ‘We are opening the door for collaboration and the exchange of information with research institutes across Europe in an effort to promote and improve the work of the Foundation,’ says Foundation librarian Jan Vandamme.

These were some of the findings to emerge during the lively debate at the Foundation seminar, Working and living conditions in Europe in 2010, held in Ljubljana on 9-10 October. The seminar brought together about 50 participants representing the social partners and public authorities at EU and national level, as well as the research community, from all over Europe. The need to refocus on the workplace as a crucial factor influencing quality of life as a whole was also stressed. Naturally, the impact of the forthcoming enlargement of the EU underpinned much of the debate. Issues such as the movement of labour and capital and increasing disparities between countries and social groups were also addressed during the seminar. The findings will provide an important input to the ongoing debate about the future development of the Foundation’s work. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-5-2003-2

The average visitor to the Eurofound website is over 40 years old and most likely to be a professional researcher involved in policy development and implementation, the recent survey reveals. The results of the survey, which ran between September and October 2003 and was open to all visitors to the website, will form the basis for the architectural overhaul of all the Foundation’s websites planned for 2004. Looking for specific information The majority of users (91%) said they were looking for specific information when coming to Eurofound, indicating that the search function is the most important feature on the website. Only one in two respondents browse for new information, according to the results. A large proportion of users (72%) look for research results while a considerable number (63%) are interested in comparative data and statistics. Putting the user in the driving seat Almost three-quarters of respondents ranked Eurofound above average in terms of relevance, usefulness and objectivity and over 80% claimed they found what they wanted on the site. A healthy 88% of users reported being ‘satisfied’ or ‘very satisfied’ with the overall quality of Eurofound, with 85% of respondents using the English site exclusively. The survey has, however, revealed a demand for a more consistent structure, using expanded menus, and improvements to the search engine, adding a search box on each page. Finally, there is also a need to link the information with the Foundation’s EIRO and EMCC subsites, consolidating the corporate image. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-6-2003

At EU-level, the automotive industry represents some 8% of total employment in the manufacturing industry. Union membership in the sector is well above the European national average, in particular in the UK, where unionisation levels in general tend to be lower.

The Foundation argued that change is essential, but restructuring must be carried out in a socially acceptable manner and take due account of the needs and concerns of those affected. This requires the involvement of both employers and employees and a coordinated approach to the development of skills and training. The two-day event, organised jointly by the Foundation and the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), took place in Brussels on 20-21 November 2003. It brought together EU-level policymakers, social partners, national and regional authorities, enterprises, researchers and other experts. The aim was to pool knowledge, exchange information on best practices, identify prospects for development and review the roles and responsibilities of the various players concerned by industrial change. Managing change with confidence At the conference, Viscount Etienne Davignon, Deputy Chairman of the Société Générale de Belgique and former EU-Commissioner, called for a global framework of business to assist companies in coping with industrial change ‘in a managed and stable way’. He went on to argue that regional support and benefits are unfair and suggested that these initiatives should only be put in place for a transitional period. Once the economy reverts to its original situation, such benefits should then be replaced by public-private partnerships: ‘Public-private partnerships are essential in creating the best possible circumstances for companies to thrive,’ said Etienne Davignon. Emphasis on heavy industry The coal and steel sector will continue to be Europe’s major source of energy and electricity until 2030, according to recent forecasts from the European Commission. ‘We want Europe to become strong and therefore we have to take account of the adaptation of heavy industry,’ said Josly Piette, Chairman of the Consultative Commission on Industrial Change (CCMI) of the EESC. Lifelong learning The conference concluded that Europe does not need an EU-wide programme or regulation for lifelong learning. This, it was argued, would be counterproductive in Europe’s varied cultural and social climate. On the contrary, more effort is required to encourage a culture of lifelong learning, entrepreneurship, acceptance of change and updating of skills. ‘70% of workers in Europe think their job involves learning new things according to the Foundation’s third European survey on working conditions’, said the Foundation’s Acting Director Willy Buschak, in his address to the conference. ‘However, in reality, the same research shows that just a third is actually trained.’ Focusing on sectoral change in the future EU Member States, the conference examined how industrial change in Europe impacts on the business environment as well as on the economic and social development of the regions. It also highlighted the development of partnerships towards a regional approach to industrial change, and the importance of skills management for anticipating labour market requirements. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-6-2003-5

The social model in a future Europe Opening the door to a civil society The following quotes are taken from speeches and discussions which took place during the Foundation Forum. To hear the full version of the speeches, go to: www.eurofound.europa.eu/about/forum_material.htm. 'The European Union is outstripping the much vaunted productivity gains of the US economy due to interdependence and the linking of public and private institutions. I'd argue the key to good productivity is high-performance organisations and Europe has plenty of these.' Will Hutton, Executive Director, The Work Foundation 'Europe created 8 million jobs in the last ten years. The US created 23 million jobs in the same period.' Peter Sutherland, Chair, Goldman Sachs international and British Petroleum 'Europe is not an island: we have to strike the right balance between social protection and a flexible labour market. All regulation has a cost.' John Bruton, former Prime Minister of Ireland 'Will enlargement be a threat to the core of the social model?' Raymond-Pierre Bodin, Director, European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions 'The European social model is an asset. It has served us well in the past and should do so in the future. Emilio Gabaglio, Secretary-General, ETUC 'Social policy is not against modern capitalism: it is part of modern capitalism.' João Cravinho, President, CEEP 'You don't create employment through legislation.' Thérèse de Liedekerke, Director of social affairs, UNICE Making Europe a better place to live and work Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern TD, European Employment and Social Affairs Commissioner Anna Diamantopoulou, and Foundation Director Raymond-Pierre Bodin at the opening of the Foundation Forum The first Foundation Forum brought together some 200 participants, among them fourteen Ministers of Labour and Social Affairs, from the 28 EU Member States and candidate countries. The major two-day event held on 29 and 30 August 2002 was kicked off by speeches by Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, European Employment and Social Affairs Commissioner Anna Diamantopoulou, and Foundation Director Raymond-Pierre Bodin. Mr Ahern emphasised that flexibility was 'absolutely essential' to the development of a European social model. He asserted that effectiveness and pragmatism should be key considerations when developing social policies. (listen to the speech: MP3 sound file) Mrs Diamantopoulou pointed to the huge differences still existing between Europe and the US: 'It is a choice between a more, or less, uneven distribution of income, opportunities and life chances.' (listen to the speech: MP3 sound file) Mr Bodin highlighted the importance of having a common understanding of how to value the way we live and the way we work as the basis for the creation of a common European social model. (listen to the speech: MP3 sound file) Some 200 participants, representing all segments of society including governments, trade union and employer organisations and NGOs, and a small group representative of 'the voice of youth', from all 28 EU Member States and candidate countries gathered in Dublin for the Foundation Forum 2002. Social policy still subordinate to monetary policy Flexible labour markets, an active society for all, social rights and social standards, and EU governance are four policy areas which challenge the European social model. During the Forum, discussions among participants were concentrated around these four challenges. Also identified was the need for social indicators that are as stringent as those used to define financial measurements. 'The supremacy of the economy still seems to reign,' was the conclusion of Marie-Hélène Gillig, MEP and Vice-Chair of the European Parliament Employment Committee, summing up the features and challenges of the European social model. 'Social policies are still considered to be subordinate to economic policies.' (listen to the speech: MP3 sound file) But Will Hutton, Executive Director of the UK Work Foundation, argued that even if the starting point is an economic one, Europe is in a good position to develop the social model since the EU economy is currently outstripping the much vaunted productivity gains of the US economy. Mr Hutton claimed the reason for this was the interlinking of many public and private institutions in Europe, in contrast to the American notion of independence in terms of individualism, unilateralism, and privacy. 'The European social model is superior to the American one,' declared Will Hutton during the course of his captivating address. (listen to the speech: MP3 sound file) Peter Sutherland, Chairman of Goldman Sachs International and former EU-Commissioner, argued that although there is no single European social model, countries in Europe - Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands in particular - have benefited economically and socially from the introduction of a EU-wide competition policy. 'Competition policy is absolutely crucial to European efficiency,' proclaimed Peter Sutherland with fervour. 'The distribution of wealth in the well-functioning economies of Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands - in comparison to what it seems to me to be the less successful models in Germany, France and Italy - works since they all embrace liberalisation and have introduced elements of flexibility in their workforces.' (listen to the speech: MP3 sound file) An efficient and effective European social model The social partners and governments share the view that the European social model must stimulate economic and social progress through high levels of employment. It is patently clear that people will judge the success of a European social model on the capacity to deliver. The debate around the European social model did not start from scratch, argued Thésèse de Liedekerke, Social Affairs Director of UNICE, during her address to the Forum. According to de Liedekerke, there are some 230 legally binding texts at EU-level, and these are implemented at national level, forming a web of national protection systems, which is in fact the European social model. Emilio Gabaglio, ETUC While the current set of models have produced some 10 million additional jobs in the last 10 years, de Liedekerke conceded that reform has been slow. In her view, the almost 8% unemployed across Europe, coupled with unacceptably low employment rates and the large numbers of the population living at poverty level, are all indications that reform is badly needed. The bottom line, asserted de Liedekerke, is that the growth of social protection expenditure during the 1990s was lower than the growth in GDP, creating more favourable conditions to invest in the social well-being of people. Socio-economic balance João Cravinho, CEEP President, echoed the private employers' call for a reform linking economic and social performances. While Cravinho favoured the inclusion of universally affordable and high-quality social services as an important component in social policy, he also argued for the establishment of indicators that not only take into consideration the cost side but also benefits, in order to create an overall balance between social policy and competitiveness. Recognising the role of the social partners Representing the government point of view, Tiziano Treu, Italian Senator and former Minister of Labour, affirmed the important role of the social partners in consensus building, which is a prerequisite for social policy reform. Emilio Gabaglio, ETUC Secretary general, agreed with this viewpoint, declaring that 'the European social model must be reformed via a process of consensus-building'. His recipe for success was to use social dialogue and social consultation, since in his opinion 'social dialogue is as vital for the advancement of Europe as the EU institutions are vital in the direction of the European model.' 'The governments believe', added Mr Gabaglio, 'that they can dictate social dialogue and social consultation - at the expense of the workers - while it's a common fact that you cannot change if the people concerned are not involved.' Flexibility perceived differently across the EU The notion of flexible labour markets is perceived differently across the EU due to differing social security systems in each Member State. While flexibility can result in less security for workers, it can also lead to benefits such as more family-friendly work practices. Des Geraghty, Irish trade union SIPTU President, argued that workers often regarded flexibility as a 'dirty word', associated with long hours, poor conditions, and abuse of labour. 'We must continue to treat the idea of absolute flexibility with caution, and rightly so,' said Mr Geraghty during the debate on flexible labour markets. This was 'simplistic', retorted Susan Anderson, the Confederation of British Industry's Human Resources Policy Director. On the 'flexibility versus security' issue, she believed that flexibility can lead to long-term security, citing, as an example, workers' skills as the basis of their employability. She argued that many employees choose to work part-time or opt for teleworking because it contributes to a better work-life balance. She felt that security within jobs was often achieved at the expense of outsiders. On the role of the EU, she observed that 'one size doesn't fit all': in the UK, skills flexibility is an issue given the 20 per cent of the population who are functionally illiterate, whereas in Italy, for example, geographical flexibility might be the most pressing deficit. Differing social systems can create inflexible labour The inflexibility of labour markets between EU Member States, resulting from the inability to reconcile the different social security systems, was an obstacle to the free movement of labour. For instance, workers from Member States like Germany and France, which have higher taxes but more comprehensive social security systems, are reluctant to work in countries like Ireland or the UK, which have lower taxes but less adequate social protection. Ms Gradin calls for recognition of the experience of old workers Anita Gradin, Ambassador of Sweden and former EU Commissioner, declared: 'We need a flexible labour market but it must be combined with security and it must be employee-friendly, family-friendly, health-friendly and diversity-friendly.' Ms Gradin also called for a more flexible labour market exit and for the recognition of the skills and experience of older workers. The voice of young people Europe must involve the 'new' Europeans, young men and women, and the responsibility for this must lie with the decision-makers forming the future Europe, not with the young. There is a distinct difference between involved and uninvolved young people, between those who want to contribute to the improvement of society and those who simply want to benefit from it. This was one conclusion from a parallel session with students sharing their vision of tomorrow's Europe during the Foundation Forum. Some 100 high school students from local Dublin schools and university students from around Europe participated at the event under the guidance of Professor Theodore Zeldin of Oxford University. Involving the young Professor Zeldin argued that involvement is the key to curbing the growing disenchantment of youngsters with the political system. According to Zeldin, the responsibility for this effort lies with the decision-makers forming the future Europe, not with the young. 'Europe must involve the new Europeans, who are educated and know what they want,' Mr Zeldin said and then went on to argue that the challenge for the future is to offer equal opportunities for men and women. 'To have the female section of the population integrated into today's Europe is the most important revolution that has happened, much bigger than the Russian Revolution, the fall of the Berlin wall, and even the founding of the EU.' Rethinking priorities? EU policy makers were urged to consider the needs of young children during the Foundation Forum. 'A good pension strategy begins with babies,' said Professor Gøsta Esping-Andersen of the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Spain during a keynote speech on features and challenges of the European social model. Professor Esping-Andersen made the point that policy-makers should concentrate on the needs of the young rather than the old during his address on the need for a new welfare state in Europe. 'Increasingly fragile family structures and intensifying inequalities represent two important changes in society,' said Mr. Esping-Andersen. 'As a result, research estimates that 15-25% of young people have low inherent abilities and will have difficulties in a future labour market, given the arising needs of inherent abilities.' Professor Esping-Andersen Lack of social skills at the root of the problem Professor Esping-Andersen claimed that lack of social skills is directly related to the poor academic performance of economically disadvantaged children. He went on to say that government policy should concentrate on supporting young families, with good 'pedagogic' childcare and spending on education to offset the effects of an ageing population in Europe. 'We have to rethink priorities and focus on early childhood, and probably the most important is that social inheritance in poorer families has to cease. If we don't do this, we will continue to have 20-30% of youth with inadequate human capital to face the future Falling birth rates He also pointed out that birth rates were falling throughout Europe and particularly in the countries of southern Europe, despite claims from Europeans in opinion polls that they wanted their families to have on average 2.3 children. (listen to the speech: MP3 sound file) The social model in a future Europe Striking the right balance between the need to create a welfare system that looks after the people of Europe and the ability to pay for it is the main issue for the future of the European social model. 'The best form of social protection is paid employment,' argued Malcolm Wicks, UK Parliamentary Under Secretary in the Department for Work and Pensions. In order to pay for the social system it is necessary, according to Wicks, to get as near to full employment as possible. He also felt that employment should be the number one priority in European social policy. 'Make work possible, make work pay, make work skilled and make work family-friendly,' was his prescription for European policy-makers. (listen to the speech: MP3 sound file) Friedrich Buttler, ILO Regional Director, observed that 'global market governance has grown quicker than global social governance': the question was, to what extent is this lag tolerable. Economic prosperity does not automatically bring social harmony and the objective for Europe should be to avoid economist John Kenneth Galbraith's characterisation of US society: 'Private affluence, public squalor.' Bernhard Jansen, European Commission Director of Employment and Social Affairs, advocated a good social policy and an 'open method of co-ordination' that allows member states to compare their performance with others. He also reminded the audience that the Nice Council said there was an indissoluble link between economic performance and social progress. Theo Bouwman, MEP and chair of the European Parliament's employment committee, pointed out that employment, social and environment guidelines must be integrated when considering social policy. Giampiero Alhadeff, President of the Platform of European Social NGOs, declared that while there had been many successes, he was interested in strengthening the social dialogue aspect of decision-making still further. Opening the door to the civil society Reform of governance is a political issue and ultimately must be decided by politicians. But it is also an issue in which the social partners have a significant role to play. Transparency and legitimacy are two current public policy preoccupations. Both are furthered by the notion of empowering the citizen in the political process. This can be encouraged through education, on the one hand, and greater reforming governance on the other. During the Forum discussion on 'EU governance and the European social model', the potential of civil society organisations for integration in existing decision-making structures was explored and challenged. 'Social dialogue is one area of growing importance in the EU decision-making system but is still under-utilised,' argued Jérôme Vignon of the European Commission. 'It fails to live up to its potential for a variety of reasons, amongst them the failure of social partner groupings to coordinate effectively at EU level, as opposed to national level.' Support of all social actors Jan Olsson, President of the employment and social affairs section of the European Economic and Social Committee (ECOSOC), made the case for the broadest possible participation in policy-making. 'Support of all social actors, and not just 'the usual suspects', is essential to the formulation of social policy,' said Mr Olsson. 'Voluntary social service providers as well as the full range of social NGOs need to be involved.' Olsson also asserted that the Community's open method of coordination - the European employment strategy and associated national employment action plans - tends to be too top-down in approach. It is in effect, he said, an instrument involving only the EU and the Member State governments with little or no participation from all the other social actors. The importance of representativeness Bartho Pronk MEP, pointed to the differences between social dialogue and civil dialogue, and to the discussion in the European Parliament on the issue of the representativeness of social partner groups. Pronk argued in favour of integrating other civil society organisations in the structures of the main trade union and employer groupings, in accordance with clear criteria. Theo Bouwman MEP, intervening from the floor, commented that decisions should be taken at the lowest possible level, following the principle of subsidiary. In Bouwman's opinion, many of the policy areas in which the EU is active should be decided at national level. Some speakers, however, were quick to warn against opening the consultation net too wide. They claimed that certain civil society organisations were merely single-issue interest groups with limited claims to represent any specific constituency and that having a mosaic of opinions did not necessarily promote the cause of participative democracy. Avoiding short-term gains The sole American on the panel, Professor Nicholas Ashford of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, outlined some of the socio-economic divergences between the EU and the US. He issued a warning to European policymakers to avoid replicating the symptoms of what he called the 'US disease': the over-emphasis on short-term and static economic efficiencies at the expense of long-term, dynamic efficiencies. 'Don't catch the American disease,' was his parting injunction to delegates.   COMMUNIQUÉ Communiqué is published by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, Wyattville Road, Loughlinstown, Dublin 18, Ireland.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0792	2010-08-11	UNK	"Communiqué 
        Issue 5, 2002"	"Articles Gender differences persist across EU labour markets The Foundation and Enlargement Industrial Relations in the EU and the candidate countries Five years of EIRO Quality of work and EU enlargement Longest working week in Turkey Wider inclusion of marginalised groups Research in figures Most popular downloads Number of web users still growing Recent staff changes Gender differences persist across EU labour markets New research from the Foundation confirms that the 'glass ceiling' still exists, despite increased legislation addressing equal rights and greater numbers of women in work. Women continue to be paid less and have lower levels of control over their working time and job content than men. The rising proportion of women in employment in recent decades has been one of the major changes affecting European labour markets. However, the increased 'weight of numbers' has not resulted in any reduction in gender segregation, which remains a persistent feature of European society. A recently published report based on analysing data from the Foundation's Third European working conditions survey examines the gender pattern of differences and similarities in working conditions in Europe. The gender, jobs and working conditions in the EU report also identifies some of the reasons for the persistence of gender segregation in the labour market. 'While the report concludes that continuity is the norm and change is the exception in working conditions in the EU, it does identify important differences between male and female workers,' says Sabrina Tesoka, research manager at the Foundation. 'For instance, work intensity - measured by the perceived speed of work - has increased more for women than for men over the period 1991-1995. Also, the gender gap regarding Sunday working is closing, mainly due to the increasing involvement of women in this working pattern.' Room for improvement The aspect of working conditions that most undermines the work-family compatibility of jobs is long and unsociable hours, for both men and women. Women, however, are particularly concerned, since they tend to bear the overall responsibility for running the home and looking after children, even when they are employed full time. The report shows that women continue to be less well paid than men. Part-time work in particular is less well paid relative to full-time work, as expressed in hourly rates. Women are also more likely to be working directly with customers and to have experienced intimidation and discrimination at the work place. They tend to be less responsible for planning and personnel and to have a lower level of work autonomy. But, in contrast, they are less exposed than men to physical hazards in their work. Need for gender-sensitive indicators Although progress to reduce obstacles has been made in the development of equal treatment legislation, the Foundation analysis points to the need to further tackle the subtle organisational practices and cultures that prevent women from advancing up the hierarchical ladder. More to the point, the report considers whether the established indicators of working conditions need to be revised to make them more 'gender-sensitive' to particular issues associated with women's jobs, women's experience in the workplace, or workload concerns within households. 'Continuity is the norm and change is the exception in working conditions in the EU' The report can be downloaded at www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/EF0249.htm. The Foundation and Enlargement The Foundation has completed its programme of visits to the candidate countries in advance of future enlargement of the European Union. The Foundation concluded its round of official visits to the thirteen candidate countries with visits to Cyprus and Turkey in mid-September. With EU enlargement pending, the Foundation is now well placed to hit the ground running in an extended Union. 'We have met with the governments and social partners in all the candidate countries during our official visits starting in January this year,' remarks Foundation Director Raymond-Pierre Bodin. 'The effort by all candidate countries to enforce EU legislation in the area of social rights and standards is commendable, but the question remains as to how these changes are going to be implemented.' Three-pronged approach The Foundation's administrative board decided in 2001 to adopt a three-step approach in preparing for enlargement, the series of visits being one part. The other two parts are to expand the scope and geographical reach of the Foundation monitoring tools and to involve relevant persons from the candidate countries in the work of the Foundation. To date, it is estimated that well over 400 policy-makers, social partner experts and civil servants from the socio-economic field in the candidate countries have already either visited or participated in Foundation debates and events in 2002. Expanding the scope of the Foundation's work During the visits to each country, the Foundation presented the findings of the first survey of working conditions in the candidate countries in conjunction with the social partners and governments. A resumé of the findings has just been published in English and eleven candidate country languages. The final report will be produced towards the end of 2002. Also during 2002, the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) expanded its network with four new national correspondent centres (NCs) in Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. By end of 2003, the expansion of the network to all candidate countries will be completed. The new Foundation living conditions monitoring tool, 'Quality of life in the EU', will involve the candidate countries from the start and cover 28 countries. Foundation governance in an enlarged Europe Discussions have started at administrative board level concerning the future governance of the Foundation. This process is mirrored at the other two EU agencies with a tripartite governing structure, CEDEFOP and the European Agency for Health and Safety at Work. Although no decisions have been taken at this stage, the discussions so far have revealed that present board members would be in favour of retaining the current tripartite setup. Industrial Relations in the EU and the candidate countries When the candidate countries enter the European Union, they will bring with them very diverse systems of industrial relations in regard to their labour markets, pay levels, and employment and working conditions. According to recent research from the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) which is the first comprehensive and comparative study on industrial relations in the EU Member States and the candidate countries. It focuses on the social partners, collective bargaining and employee participation. The report that compares industrial relations and labour market aspects in the EU Member States and the candidate countries, shows that there is a wide divergence between the two groups of countries. It will be presented at a conference on ""Tripartism in an enlarged European Union"" in Elsinore on 29-30 October 2002, an event coorganised by the Foundation and the Danish Ministry of Employment as part of the Danish Presidency of the European Union. 'Collective bargaining is much more centralised in the EU than in the 10 candidate countries considered in the EIRO study,' says Stavroula Demetriades, research coordinator of the Foundation's Industrial Relations team. 'Our report highlights the role and importance of tripartite dialogue as an indispensable instrument in realising political visions.' Strengthened tripartite dialogue While there is a need to strengthen the tripartite dialogue in the candidate countries, the EIRO report maintains that collective bargaining structures should be better articulated ensuring greater coherence in the system. That would require clarification on the roles of all actors, ensuing that institutional, legal conditions are in place, building the institutional capacity and improving representativeness of the social partners. The role of tripartism The aim of the conference, 'Tripartism in an enlarged European Union', is to demonstrate the importance of tripartite social dialogue in relation to economic and social development, and especially in relation to employment and social inclusion. While the term 'tripartism' is widely used, in the perspective of the Danish Presidency conference it refers to consultations and negotiations between representatives of workers and employers and public authorities at national and EU level. The conference will provide an important forum for the exchange of experiences and views on tripartism, with the intention of contributing to a strengthened tripartite dialogue in an enlarged EU. Five years of EIRO In 2002 the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) completed its fifth year of recording and analysing trends and key developments in industrial relations across the European Union and Norway. The anniversary is marked with a publication, Towards a qualitative dialogue in industrial relations, which highlights by best practice examples of those areas in industrial relations where innovative progress has been made. The publication will be presented at the conference on 'Tripartism in an enlarged European Union' in Elsinore on 29-30 October 2002. The booklet highlights reporting by EIRO on the processes and outcomes of collective bargaining and dialogue between social partners, rather than on labour law or government initiatives. But swift and radical change is rare in industrial relations. The report reveals that using collective bargaining to bring about innovative measures in other areas is not common. In most countries, collective bargaining still concentrates on setting pay increases or modifying working time. EIRO can, however, point out several important innovations over the past five years in the areas of industrial relations and lifelong learning; equality, diversity and non-discrimination; health and safety at work; flexibility and the work-life balance, and social dialogue and worker involvement. Just like the progress made in health and safety at work, and equality, diversity and non-discrimination, which have found their way to the negotiating tables of the social partners, EIRO firmly believes that quality in European industrial relations can be improved by bringing together the social partners at European and national levels, and showing examples of successful practices and innovation in bargaining across national boundaries.

Quality of work and EU enlargement The theme of more and better jobs remains high on the agenda of EU governments. One year after the Brussels conference, 'For a better quality of work', organised by the Foundation in conjunction with the Belgian government during their EU Presidency, indicators on the quality of work form an integral part of the European employment strategy. To broaden the debate on the quality of work to cover enlargement, the Belgian Ministry of Employment is organising a conference, 'Quality in employment and enlargement of the European Union', to be held in Brussels on 18-19 October 2002. The conference is organised by the Foundation in conjunction with the Observatoire social européen and the International Labour Organisation (ILO). 'We shall highlight the Foundation's work on quality of work since the beginning, as well as our recent development on quality of work indicators,' says Pascal Paoli, research coordinator for the Working Conditions team at the Foundation. 'We shall also show the results of the first survey on working conditions in the candidate countries, which we have just completed.' The conference will bring together policy-makers and senior civil servants from EU Member States and candidate countries to the Palais d'Egmont in Brussels. You can download the first Foundation paper, Quality of work and employment in Europe: issues and challenges, at www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/EF0212.htm.

For more information, contact John Hurley, Information Liaison Officer, e-mail: joh@eurofound.europa.eu. Longest working week in Turkey Working hours may be growing shorter in the EU Member States but the working week remains significantly longer in most of the candidate countries and longest of all in Turkey. More than 80% of the working population in Turkey spend over 45 hours per week at work, according to recent data from the Foundation's first survey on working conditions in Turkey. These long working hours in Turkey are in comparison to an average working week of 38.3 hours in the EU as a whole. The average length of the working week for the other twelve candidate countries taken together is 44.4 hours. The Turkish survey was carried out in June 2001 and is based on 1000 face-to-face interviews with persons in employment. The survey found high levels of self-employment and of employment in the agricultural sector, compared to the European Union, and these features will be taken into account when further analysing the data, to allow for better comparison of working conditions in Turkey, the other candidate countries and the EU Member States. Despite their long working hours, 78% of workers questioned reported satisfaction with their working conditions.

Wider inclusion of marginalised groups The need to include marginalised groups in employment was emphasised by Claus Hjort Frederiksen, Danish Minister for Employment and current chair of the EU Council, at a major conference in Skagen, Denmark, on 4-6 September 2002. The argument has been put forward by the Foundation for some time, most recently at the conference 'Employment and labour market insertion strategies as a tool for social inclusion', which the Foundation co-organised with the Spanish Ministry for Social Affairs in Toledo, Spain, on 17-18 June 2002. Improving social inclusion through social dialogue and partnership is one of the goals of the current Danish Presidency of the European Union. The Foundation contributes to the debate with the thesis that 'inclusiveness' engages the social partners as well as civil organisations and public actors. 'At the heart of the European social model is the idea that all citizens - or at least as many as possible - can participate fully in society and share the wealth created,' says Robert Anderson, research coordinator for the Living Conditions unit at the Foundation, who made a presentation at the event. 'Having a job is a prerequisite for most citizens to wider social participation. Not having one is a key factor determining whether or not a person lives in poverty.' The conclusions of the conference will contribute to a proposal for a Council resolution on social inclusion at the European Council summit in Copenhagen on 12-13 December 2002.

Unsocial working hours, such as shift and night work, are more prevalent. A higher proportion of workers in the candidate countries are self-employed and working in agriculture.

There is ongoing debate at European and national level on the role of non-governmental organisation and civil society at large. The draft treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe specifically refers to how participative democracy can be strengthened through stronger dialogue with civil society. As the European Union moves towards enlargement to 10 new countries in May 2004, the experience of current Member States in exploiting the benefits of local partnerships to ensure greater social inclusion will prove significant. The Foundation paper outlines the strategic and practical importance of civil society in supporting social inclusion and looks at the role of partnerships at local and regional level. Drawing on a wide range of Foundation research in this domain, it suggests guidelines to assist policymakers in strengthening the role of civil society in an enlarged EU. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-6-2003-2
EUROFOUND_UNK_0794	2010-08-11	UNK	Communiqué, issue 6, 2003	Articles 2004 programme presents challenges and opportunities Spotlight on social policy for Irish EU Presidency Local partnerships can boost social inclusion Reaping the gains of industrial change Use of IT in publishing and media Cross-border coordination in the EU motor sector Better employment prospects for ill, disabled Web user survey results New working conditions observatory takes shape Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing More and better jobs, as well as greater social cohesion, are some of the foremost social policy goals of the Irish government during its six-month EU Presidency, which starts on 1 January 2004. The Presidency will draw on the Foundation’s knowledge and expertise in the social policy arena during this period. Adequate levels of social protection and work incentive policies are essential to achieve the criteria set out in the Lisbon Agenda. One of the thematic strands to be tackled by the Irish Presidency is shaping the workplace of the future. Less hierarchical work, ‘flexicurity’, improving skills, lifelong learning, participation and different work preferences. These are all practical examples of how best to support workplace change and adapt to the future. But how are companies across the European Union facing up to the future? The Irish Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, and the Foundation are coorganising a conference entitled ‘Adaptability and adjustment to change’ in Dublin on 26-27 February 2004. The key focus of this conference is on the organisational features that enhance innovations and how they are nurtured and sustained.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0795	2010-08-11	UNK	Communiqué, issue 2, 2003	Articles Open dialogue a prerequisite for successful CSR End of an era – an ode to Eric Verborgh Taking up the reins Responding to new needs for social statistics Better balancing of private and working lives Illness and inclusion News in brief Research in figures Inside the Foundation Open dialogue a prerequisite for successful CSR Successful corporate social responsibility (CSR) is the result of open dialogue involving all stakeholders and incorporating their different expectations, according to a new report marking the Foundation’s first contribution to the CSR debate. The report looks at restructuring and subcontracting and the effects of corporate involvement in local community and economic regeneration, as well as the promotion of environmentally acceptable practices, and reveals that the inclusion of CSR on the agenda of in-house social dialogue remains limited. The report is the result of two research projects, looking at CSR from the perspectives of living and working conditions, including a series of EU company case studies, examining socially responsible practices. It is based on the notion that the Foundation is in a unique position, due to its tripartite structure, to contribute to the CSR debate where social, economic and environmental issues overlap. Promoting a 'CSR-friendly' dialogue The report shows that it is not easy for the traditional players in social dialogue to practise CSR. It suggests that the social dialogue faces different options: first, the social dialogue remains based on a binary model and excludes any other parties. Second, a dialogue with other stakeholders is developed in parallel to the social dialogue and bridges are built between them. Third, the social dialogue could be opened up to a wide range of stakeholders but runs the risk of reducing employees and their representatives to one stakeholder among many. Foundation's contribution in context At a European level as far back as 1993, Commission President Jacques Delors called on businesses to take up the fight against social exclusion. More recently, at the Lisbon Summit in March 2000, the European Council made a special appeal to companies' sense of social responsibility. In 2001, the Commission's Green Paper launched a debate on the concept itself and 2002 saw the Commission publish a Communication on Corporate social responsibility: a business contribution to sustainable development (COM (2002) 347 final. The report is the Foundation’s contribution to the current debate as the new Multistakeholder Forum on CSR, established by the Commission in October 2002, begins its work. The full report is available on http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/EF0317.htm For further information contact Teresa Renehan at e-mail ter@eurofound.europa.eu or John Hurley at e-mail joh@eurofound.europa.eu End of an era – an ode to Eric Verborgh 'The last two decades have seen the Foundation become a professional and relevant contributor to EU social policymaking,' says Eric Verborgh, who retired as the Foundation's deputy director on 31 March. The Foundation salutes Eric Verborgh on his retirement after 18 years of loyal and committed service and wishes him well in his new life. During his 18-year tenure as deputy director, Eric Verborgh has overseen the growth of the Foundation from 36 permanent staff to about 100 and has guided the Foundation through two enlargement waves, in 1989 and 1995, expanding the geographical reach of the Foundation from ten to 15 countries. 'The fascinating part of working at EU level is the opportunity to discover and bridge the differences between European cultures,' says Eric Verborgh. 'It is a liberating feeling and an exciting challenge to find working solutions to these differences.' A life devoted to improving living and working conditions Eric Verborgh has worked on living and working conditions issues throughout his professional career. Starting as a junior researcher at the Free University of Brussels, and moving onto a senior research post at the Belgian Institute for the Improvement of Working Conditions, his knowledge of the field earned him a nomination for the post of deputy director in 1985. 'I came to the Foundation proposed by the workers' unions, but my role was not to defend workers' positions. It does not work that way,' he says firmly. 'My background has never coloured my role. I think it would be fair to say that all people at the Foundation consider their colleagues first and foremost as professionals and Europeans.' At the helm On the departure of the former director Clive Purkiss in 1999, Eric Verborgh took on the role of acting director in the interim period of finding a successor. 'That was an exciting period of my career at the Foundation,' he says. 'As part of a collaborative effort, I spearheaded the work behind the current four-year work programme and that is a proud testimony to my work here.' Pursuing an active retirement Having shared his life between Dublin and Brussels for the past 18 years, he will go on doing so in this new phase of active retirement. ‘There have been good times and some hard times, there have been compromises and sacrifices,' finishes Eric Verborgh, 'but if I was offered the opportunity to do it all over again, I most certainly would. Let me take this opportunity to wish my successor, Willy Buschak, all the very best in his new position.’ Taking up the reins Meet the Foundation's new deputy director - Willy Buschak. 'The Foundation fulfils the needs of its target audiences more effectively and efficiently now than in the past,' comments Willy Buschak on taking up the post of deputy director on 1 April 2003. 'To a large extent, this is Eric's achievement and I commend him for the solid and unstinting work he has done to bring the Foundation to where it is today.' No newcomer to Foundation affairs Former Confederal Secretary of the European Trade Union Congress (ETUC), 51-year-old German Willy Buschak is no newcomer to the Foundation and its work. He has played an important part in the Foundation’s progress through his role as coordinator of the Administrative Board over an eight-year period until 2000. He therefore brings with him a deep knowledge and understanding of the Foundation's key areas of work. 'Enlargement is going to be a big challenge for the Foundation, as for all other EU bodies, but the Foundation is in a strong position to meet this challenge. My role will be to support the director in building on the successes of the past as we move to tackle this new future,' says Willy Buschak. Responding to new needs for social statistics Eurostat wants to work with the Foundation to satisfy the growing demand for a broad range of statistics in the social field. The statistical office of the European Communities (Eurostat) intends to strengthen its activities in the field of social statistics, reflecting a growing demand from social policymakers in Europe. During a visit to the Foundation on 25 March 2003, Gabrielle Clotuche, Director for Social Statistics at Eurostat, identified a range of opportunities for closer collaboration with the Foundation. Werner Grünewald (left) with Gabrielle Clotuche from Eurostat and Robert Anderson, Foundation research coordinator, in the sun outside Loughlinstown House. 'We want to better serve the needs of users of our data, covering labour statistics, but also health statistics, social security, demographic data and migration and mobility,' said Gabrielle Clotuche, following discussions with the Foundation's research coordinators. 'There are also common interests for Eurostat and the Foundation, as producers of data, to improve both quality and accessibility. Eurostat and the Foundation share the challenges created from enlarging the European Union, in exploiting existing data, expanding data collection and developing new ways for making databases accessible and user-friendly,' she continued. Better balancing of private and working lives A growing number of people are choosing to move away from the traditional pattern of education–work–retirement and are seeking flexible solutions to balance their working and private life and improve their quality of life Faced with a rapidly ageing population, changing family patterns, and increased emphasis on competitiveness due to globalisation, European social policymakers are forced to come up with solutions to optimise the labour market and at the same time improve the quality of life for individuals. As an appropriate response to these pressing political challenges, the Foundation’s project, A new organisation of time throughout working life, looks at how employees can improve their quality of life by better combining their working and private lives. This long term perspective, which takes into account the fact that choices made at one stage in life have a direct impact on opportunities later in life, differentiates from previous Foundation reports on time issues. 'While the project aims to highlight and promote best practice in modernising the organisation of working time in companies,' comments Hubert Krieger, research manager in the Foundation's Living Conditions unit, 'the ultimate goal of the Foundation's work is to formulate concrete policy recommendations for such a change.' For further information, please contact Teresa Renehan on e-mail ter@eurofound.europa.eu Illness and inclusion There is increasing focus on developing policies and services to promote the social inclusion of people with chronic illness or disabilities. About 17% of Europe's general population and 15% of those of working age have a chronic illness or disability and these groups are often dogged by persistent poverty, according to a new Foundation report on Illness, disability and social inclusion to be published in May. The report highlights the fact that many physical, legal and administrative barriers for these groups remain and that segregation starts at an early stage, with children often pushed into parallel education networks or otherwise excluded from mainstream society. Promoting social inclusion focus of increasing attention National Action Plans for both employment and social inclusion have, in the past, emphasised disadvantages associated with illness and disability. A Council Directive in November 2000 established a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation and prohibits any discrimination based on disability. The development of policies and the delivery of services to promote the social inclusion of people with chronic illness (physical or mental) or disabilities, are the focus of increasing attention. The social inclusion of people with disabilities or illness is essential to achieving the objectives of the Lisbon summit of high levels of employment and promoting a more inclusive society. Higher unemployment and lower wages The Foundation's new report is intended to give an overview of key issues to fuel the debate and increase the attention dedicated to people with disabilities and chronic illness, particularly those of working age. It reveals that income, education levels and unemployment status are all linked, to some degree, to chronic illness and/or disability. Moreover, disabled people have twice the rate of non-participation in the labour force as non-disabled people of working age and the unemployment rate of persons with a severe illness or disability is about three times the level of non-disabled persons. People with chronic illness or disability also receive lower wages than non-disabled. The report recommends improving current policies in several ways including: increasing dialogue at local level and with social partners increasing input from disabled groups into planning and policymaking ensuring 'universal design' agreement to improve access to facilities integrating disabled children into mainstream education mainstreaming the disability perspective into all policy spheres The full report will be available on the Foundation's website Eurofound in May.

The report also shows average collectively-agreed weekly working hours throughout the EU and Norway remain stable at around 38.2 hours, with no major reduction in working time over the last four years. However, working-time reduction is still a central demand for the trade union movement, according to the new report. The full report is available on www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/2003/03/Update/TN0303103U.html 'Better work and life' conference The Foundation is co-organising a conference with the Ministry of Labour & Social Affairs in Greece Greek government, currently holding the EU presidency, in the northern city of Alexandroupolis on 12-13 May 2003. The conference will gather 180 decision makers from Europe and beyond. 'We want to highlight quality aspects of work, employment and life of citizens in an enlarged Europe,' says Stavroula Demetriades, research coordinator of the Foundation’s industrial relations team. For further information, please contact Marina Patriarka on e-mail mpa@eurofound.europa.eu Irish labour minister calls for cooperation with the Foundation The Foundation should have a ‘direct and significant input’ into the forthcoming Irish EU Presidency, according to Ireland’s Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with special responsibility for Labour Affairs Frank Fahey visiting the Foundation on 25 February. Minister Fahey said he hoped the Foundation would contribute to work over the next twelve months on issues such as access to employment for people with special needs and women’s access to the labour market. What is your quality of life? This is the question that will be answered by citizens of 28 European countries in a Foundation survey to take place in May and June of this year. The survey on living conditions and quality of life in the 15 Member States and 13 candidate countries, focuses on employment, economic resources, family life, community life, health and education looking at the views and experiences of Europe’s citizens. The survey will allow the Foundation to map and understand differences across Europe associated with factors such as age, gender, health and income. For further information, please contact Teresa Renehan on e-mail ter@eurofound.europa.eu Research in figures End to upward trend in agreed pay Average nominal pay increases declined in 2002 for the first time in three years. This 0.3 per cent downturn to only a 3.5 per cent rise last year, marks an end to the upward trend in pay increases since 1999 and is a direct result of calls for wage moderation at EU and national levels.

'I have been working with the Foundation for the past 17 years,' said Jean Lapeyre in his parting remarks to his colleagues on the Administrative Board gathered in Dublin, 'and now it is time for me to let in the next generation of people who will continue to build this European body into something more extraordinary than it is today.' Eurofound web survey underway The Foundation's web team will launch a user survey on the Eurofound website. The initiative is two-pronged. The first focuses on accumulating user feedback through a wide-scale survey to take place during June 2003. The second involves expert assessment of Eurofound against the general technical standards and accepted good practice of web design and communication. The results will form the basis for developing the Foundation's web future strategy.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0796	2010-07-28	UNK	Press release, 28 July 2010	Eurofound publishes its annual analysis of working time development and trends across the European Union: Widespread use of short-time work reduces gap between agreed and actual working time in the EU (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Across the 27 EU Member States, the average agreed weekly hours rose very slightly from 38.6 in 2008 to 38.7 in 2009, according to the annual report on working time developments and trends from Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). While agreed working time remains stable, and has done so since almost a decade, the widespread use of short-time work across EU in 2009 has caused a downward tendency of actual working hours. Working time differences between all EU Member States remain large. The annual report on working time developments shows that collective bargaining still plays an important role in determining the duration of working time in most EU countries, though to a lesser or sometimes negligible extent in some of the new Member States. The most prominent working time issue in 2009 was the use of short-time work as a means of responding to falling demand during the recession and preventing redundancies. Short-time work was used extensively in most countries, and was an issue for collective bargaining in many cases. In 2009, actual weekly hours worked by full-time employees were higher than the average normal collectively agreed working week in 20 of the 28 countries. In the EU27, average actual weekly hours stood at 39.3 in 2009, compared with the average collectively agreed weekly working time of 38.7 hours. The average in the EU15 stood at 37.9 hours in 2009 - the same as in 2008 - while the average in the NMS rose very slightly from 39.5 hours in 2008 to 39.6 hours in 2009. The gap between the EU15 and the NMS thus widened a little to 1.7 hours, or 4.5%. Still, actual working time averages across each of the EU27, EU15 and NMS groups of countries all fell by 0.3 hours. Average actual hours fell in 21 of the 28 countries, most steeply in Ireland and Austria. This downward tendency meant that the average gap between agreed and actual hours narrowed between 2008 and 2009, which the research attributes to the widespread use of short-time working in many countries. Actual weekly hours worked by male full-time employees in their main jobs exceeded those of their female counterparts in all countries considered. Overall, the EU’s longest hours are in Hungary, Bulgaria, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania, while the shortest are in France, Denmark, Sweden, Germany and Italy. Average annual hours in Hungary are 261 hours higher, or nearly 17% more, than those in France – the equivalent of around 6.5 working weeks in Hungary. An important factor in the overall duration of working time is the amount of paid annual leave to which workers are entitled. The combined total of agreed annual leave and public holidays varied in the EU from 40.5 days in Germany to 28 days in Hungary – a difference of around 45% or two and a half working weeks. Workers in Denmark, Italy and Austria also enjoy generous paid leave entitlements, while the situation is quite the opposite for workers in Bulgaria, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania. The average duration for paid leave in the EU 27 was 33.7 days – 35.3 days in the EU 15 and 31.6 days in the NMS. The number of public holidays (excluding those falling on Sundays) varied in 2009 from 14 in Cyprus and Spain to six in the Netherlands. The average figure for the EU 27 was 10.5 public holidays, with the NMS having slightly more on average (10.7) than the EU 15 (10.3).

EUROFOUND_UNK_0797	2010-07-27	UNK	Press release, 26 July 2010	Eurofound publishes its European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) quarterly for the 2nd quarter 2010: Two jobs lost for every one created in Europe (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Global economic growth is picking up but Europe is trailing behind the other major advanced economic areas (Asia, US) in terms of the strength of its recovery, according to the latest quarterly report from Eurofound’s European Restructuring Monitor (ERM). Fiscal tightening is likely to introduce new constraints on growth and may lead to extensive restructuring of public employment. Between 1 April 2010 and 30 June 2010 the ERM recorded a total of 214 restructuring cases, of which 141 were cases of restructuring involving job loss. Total announced job losses totalled approximately 50,000 in the quarter as against announced job creation of just under 25,000 new jobs. The European economy continues to show signs of stabilisation and a gradual return to more normal patterns of growth after the extreme turbulence of 2008–9. Unemployment in the EU has stabilised at 9.6% (May 2010) but is nearly three percentage points higher than at its most recent pre-crisis trough in early 2008. There were over nine million people fewer in work in the EU27 in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the recent peak in employment in the third quarter of 2008, approximately 210 million compared to 219.5 million. As in the previous quarter, auto manufacture is the sector reporting the greatest job loss (5,167 jobs). The second ranking sector is financial intermediation with 4,789 quarterly job losses, followed by public administration / defence (4,755 jobs) and insurance and pensions (3,760 jobs). The report also shows that the UK was on top of the list with 10,318 announced job losses, followed by Italy (7,245 jobs), France (5,948 jobs) and Poland (4,754 jobs). In the same period, the country with the highest number of announced job gains was Romania (4,895 jobs) ahead of the UK (3,785 jobs). Ireland and Slovakia follow with 2,930 and 2,890 announced job gains, respectively.The retail trade continues to lead in job creation with 5,022 new jobs announced in the second quarter of 2010. The second ranking sector in job creation is auto manufacturing with 4,562 job gains, followed by other business activities (2,060 new jobs) and computer and related activities (1,850 new jobs). In its latest edition, the quarterly also provides a sector focus on car manufacturing and a feature on developments in the media and broadcasting sector.

        issue 4, 2002"	"Articles Foundation Forum 2002 More supportive policies for social inclusion Balancing demand and supply in home care service Better governance through clearer social dialogue Research in figures Promoting financial participation for employees Inside the Foundation Foundation Forum 2002 The Foundation is organising an annual forum in which high-level actors and thinkers can debate socio-economic issues related to the development of European social policy. The first Foundation Forum will take place in Dublin on 29-30 August next. The European Social Model faces important challenges in the coming years. Issues such as globalisation, enlargement, and technological change will affect the relationship between employees, employers and the state. In addition, the ageing of the population and the workforce, as well as changing employment and family patterns, will demand an active response by policymakers. The Foundation has created an annual stage to bring together high-level politicians, social partners, researchers and experts in the socio-economic policy field. The Foundation Forum 2002, entitled 'Europe makes a difference - Challenges for the European Social Model', will be held at Dublin Castle. Some 200 people, among them Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, EU Commissioner Anna Diamantopoulou and ministers from EU Member States and candidate countries, will be present. Voice of the young 'The European Union has to cope with enlargement at the same time as trying to achieve the goal of being the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world,' says Foundation Director Raymond-Pierre Bodin. 'We have created the Foundation Forum as a platform for an open and frank debate on how these challenges affect the future of the European Social Model, letting the voice of the young be heard alongside high-level policy-makers and experts.' The Forum will also present the vision of today's young people about tomorrow's Europe. Professor Theodore Zeldin of Oxford University will chair a parallel debate with young Irish students in Dublin Castle. Selected European students will also participate in this event. Challenges and choices The Forum will examine and discuss what characterises the European Social Model, and how it has developed across Europe. The debates will focus on flexible labour markets, an active society for all, social rights and social standards, and the governance of an enlarged European Union. The balance between social and economic interests in both the short and long term will be specially emphasised. At the opening of the conference, key speakers will present the European Social Model and its significance in the social policy context. The first day's panel debate will consider what makes an efficient and effective European social model. In four parallel debates during the afternoon, potential policy dilemmas and challenges will be identified, and the future choices of social, economic and employment policies will be discussed in more detail. On the second day, the topic of the European Social Model in a competitive world will be presented, followed by a concluding debate on the role of the Social Model in a future Europe. A bulletin board has been posted on the Foundation's website. This will allow a wider audience to formulate questions which can be taken up for discussion at the Forum. For more information, please consult: http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/about/foundation_forum.htm To submit questions for discussion at the Forum, go to the bulletin board at: http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/about/forumbb.htm For detailed information on the Forum, contact Ola Persson, responsible for programme development, e-mail: olp@eurofound.europa.eu More supportive policies for social inclusion Insertion to employment is a key issue for the 'inactive' population and not only for unemployed people, according to a new Foundation study into the problems facing vulnerable groups. The report, Integrated approaches to active welfare and employment policies, was presented at the conference 'Employment and labour market insertion strategies as a tool for social inclusion', an event organised under the auspices of the Spanish EU Presidency, in Toledo, Spain on 17-18 June 2002. ´The availability and accessibility of ""quality services"" is the key to the development of good support to vulnerable groups,' said Robert Anderson, research coordinator of the living conditions unit at the Foundation. 'This means attention to training, working conditions and work organisation in order to get and retain the front-line staff necessary to deliver good quality services.' The interrelationship between social protection and labour market strategies has been an important research topic for the Foundation over the last ten years. The Foundation has specifically looked at guidelines to improve the effectiveness of the strategies behind integration measures, such as public/private partnerships, coordination, user involvement and equal opportunities. The second Foundation paper, Access to employment for vulnerable groups, also launched at the conference, gives an overview of the Foundation's research in this area. Access online http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/EF0204.htm For further information, contact Teresa Renehan, e-mail: ter@eurofound.europa.eu The Foundation paper is available at: www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/EF0244.htm Balancing demand and supply in home care services The need to recruit to the household services sector across Europe has become more pressing as the labour market tightens and the population gets older. Lack of career opportunities, poorly defined routes to skills training and accredited qualifications are some of the reasons that prevent household services from gaining the acceptance this sector needs across Europe, according to Foundation research on employment in household services. At a recent European conference, 'Care Workers-matching supply and demand: employment issues in the care of children and older people living at home', held in Sheffield, England, on 20-21 June, labour supply problems in the care sector were specifically under scope. The conference was organised jointly by the Foundation and the Centre for Regional Economic and Social Research at Sheffield Hallam University. Demand for care As female participation rates in Europe have risen, all countries have seen rapid growth in the services and jobs needed to provide childcare. At the same time, the informal care of Europe's growing numbers of older people by their grown-up children is increasingly being supplemented or even replaced by domiciliary care services, delivered in the homes of those who need support. Research carried out by the Foundation and others show that care is provided by families, as well as by paid workers, in both formal and informal economies. The problems encontered in home care are very different in the Nordic and Mediterranean and Central European countries. Quality of employment In childcare as in eldercare, there are also widespread concerns about the quality of employment and about the relatively poor prospects for the recruitment of skilled workers. Although upgrading of the skills of the existing workforce is important, there needs to be a progressive approach, as the workforce encompasses workers with different levels of skill requirements. However, the main tension is between demand for better quality and accessibility of services in an environment of cost containment. Balancing demand and supply There is a need to develop services that support and recognise the contribution of family care. However, there is also a need for citizens and users to recognise the value of work done in the care sector, and for workers to receive recognition in terms of wages and training. Furthermore, public authorities have a role to play in the development of both the quality and accessibility of care services.

The Foundation has been asked to play an active role in establishing the new 'European social dialogue, a force of innovation and change.' The European Commission has come to the conclusion that a collaborative effort, involving social partners and political decision makers, is required to achieve the goals set out at the European Summit in Lisbon, as well as ensuring good governance in an enlarged European Union. In a communication adopted in Brussels on 26 June, the Commission put forward a series of concrete measures aimed at strengthening the different levels and forms of social dialogue, to bring about the necessary environment of innovation and change. Strengthened role for the Foundation The Foundation currently publishes regular reports, background information and reviews on developments in industrial relations across Europe. It also continuously establishes new analysis and research to improve understanding of industrial relations. The Commission, which advocates continued and closer collaboration with the Foundation in the future, has commended this effort. On a practical level, the Commission has requested the Foundation to organise joint training sessions to create partnerships on subjects relevant to the guidelines defined in Lisbon, open to representatives from the social partners, and local and regional authorities. Focus on EIRO and the EMCC The Commission stresses that it is in the interests of the European social partners to take full advantage of existing tools and monitoring when defining their own targets for social and economic reform. It highlights the importance of two Foundation monitoring tools, the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) and the recently established European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC). In its communication, the Commission envisages reviewing the technical and logistic facilities available to the social partners. At a time when the European Industrial Relations Observatory has expanded its current network of national industrial relations centres from the 15 EU Member States to include the first new centres (Slovenia, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary) for the provision of information on industrial relations in the candidate countries, the Commission sees an increasingly important role for EIRO. A tripartite social summit for growth The European Commission Communication contains a proposal for a Council decision on establishing a tripartite social summit for growth, a suggestion prompted by the social partners' contribution to the Laeken European Council and by the reflections of the High-Level Group on Industrial Relations To consult the industrial relations pages on the Foundation's website, see: www.eurofound.europa.eu/industrial/industrial.htm For more information, contact Camilla Galli da Bino, Information Liaison Officer, email: gdb@eurofound.europa.eu Research in figures Gap between real and desired working hours in Europe There is a mismatch between how long those in employment want to work and how long they have to work, according to a Foundation survey into working time preferences. It found that many are tied to a working rhythm that diminishes the ability to integrate non-work activities, for instance family or caring responsibilities, into their working life. Source: Working time preferences in sixteen European countries, s2002 Promoting financial participation for employees Employee share ownership and profit-sharing are set to increase following the European Commission's recent decision to address current obstacles and introduce cross-border financial participation schemes for company employees in the European Union. Financial participation schemes are believed to benefit employees and at the same time increase the competitiveness of European companies. The European Commission argues that improved financial participation could play an important role in achieving the objectives of the Lisbon summit, that of making Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010. The European Commission has identified a number of barriers that inhibit the introduction of financial participation schemes across the European Union. On 5 July, it adopted a plan to promote financial participation through the framework of Community actions and through a set of principles which identifies actions to be taken a national level. The Commission communication is the result on an extensive consultation process, launched in July 2001 and has involved - among others - the social partners and the Foundation. Room for improvement A Foundation study on financial participation published in 2001 shows that only 28% of European companies had any financial participation schemes at all in 1997. The study found that it was primarily large companies, those with more than 200 employees, which had introduced financial participation schemes. Share ownership structures were reported to be particularly rare, existing in only 9% of companies. Companies in France and the United Kingdom tended, however, to stand out from the rest, with more than half of these offering financial participation schemes to their employees. France has the highest incidence of profit-sharing, supported by mandatory regulations and promotional activities, while the United Kingdom, with its established tradition of financial participation, has the highest incidence of share ownership schemes in the EU. Profit-sharing and employee share ownership There are two categories of financial participation schemes, both linked to how well the company is performing. In profit-sharing plans, employees are given a variable income which is directly linked to profit or any other measure of the company's performance. In share ownership plans, employees are paid dividends on their company shares. Employees involved in financial participation schemes are not sufficiently informed about the risks involved, according to the European Commission. As with any other investment venture, employees in these schemes are at risk since their company can be affected by adverse economic developments. Also, a clear distinction should be made between a salary and a benefit from financial participation schemes, to avoid the possible substitution of profit-sharing and employee share ownership for regular wages and salaries. Good practice The Commission communication outlines a set of general principles which characterise most financial participation schemes in the EU Member States, to be used as a reference for good practice. Among them are requests that financial participation schemes should be open to all employees and should be voluntary for both companies and employees. They should be based on transparent formulas which facilitate the comprehension of all involved. Later this year, the European Commission plans to set up a group of experts to come up with solutions to facilitate the introduction of cross- border financial participation schemes, despite current differences between the Member States regarding taxation and social security systems as well as national laws governing employee contracts, including severance pay.

IN BRIEF News in pictures Social Europe campaign in Ireland On 3 July, the European Commission’s ‘Circus’ campaign, highlighting the benefits that Social Europe delivers to the citizen, opened in Ireland. Eurofound contributed information and findings to the travelling campaign, organised in Ireland by the European Commission Representation Office. The campaign has already appeared in 30 European cities, attracting over 450,000 visitors. Over the course of 2010, it will travel to another 20 venues across the EU.     News in brief Eurofound and MEPs debate public services Europeans' ratings of a number of key aspects of their quality of life have declined in the face of economic crisis, as Eurofound research makes clear. In the light of economic downturn, cuts in social services due to budgetary constraints and ongoing debates over deregulation and privatisation, the role of public services in supporting a good quality of life for citizens is increasingly recognised by policymakers. At a lunch in Brussels on 23 June for a group of invited MEPs, co-hosted by Eurofound and Proinsias de Rossa MEP, Eurofound experts presented new analysis and findings of people's perception of their public services - education, transport and healthcare, as well as neighbourhood services such as water, waste management, pollution and crime. Debate among the MEPs present - including Stephen Hughes, Jean Lambert, Heide Rühle, Elisabeth Schroedter, and Bernadette Vergnaud - centred on such issues as the crucial role of local public services, the challenges of guaranteeing good quality public services, and the extent to which income shapes access to them. Social partners cooperating in the face of recession Eurofound's European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) recorded more than 3,000 cases of restructuring between October 2008 and March 2010, a 53% rise on the previous 18-month period, indicating both that many more companies launched restructuring programmes in the face of recession, and that media attention on restructuring also increased in response to economic turbulence. A new information sheet from Eurofound outlines a number of high-profile cases of restructuring over the course of the economic downturn to date, and how social partners have worked together in an effort to mitigate the impact of job loss. Companies across the EU have overwhelmingly tended to realise that their future interests are best served by retaining as many workers as possible and ensuring that the needs of departing workers are provided for. The cases also highlight that - despite predictions of substantial industrial action in the face of recession and job loss - overall it would seem that working days lost from industrial action in the EU declined between 2007 and 2009. Read the info sheet Annual review of industrial relations launched At the recent European congress of the International Industrial Relations Association (IIRA) in Copenhagen on 28 June-1 July, Eurofound contributed findings from a number of its research areas: data from the 2009 European Company Survey; results from its examination of new forms of governance in European industrial relations; and the launching of its latest annual review of industrial relations, for 2009. The review looks at levels of coverage of collective bargaining, and trends in bargaining regarding pay and working time across Europe. It also outlines the year's main developments in employment legislation, social dialogue, industrial action and company restructuring, and explores the impact of the global economic crisis. A specific thematic chapter examines recent developments in social partner organisations in Europe. Read more about this event Counting the cost of absence from work According to estimates in a new comparative report from Eurofound, 2.5% of European GDP is lost every year due to absence from work, while employers in Germany, for instance, put the cost of absence at €34 billion annually. Absence from work looks at patterns of absence in the EU27 and Norway and, in particular, examines what approaches are being taken to manage attendance at work. In a number of countries efforts have been made at both national and company level to boost the health of workers and so reduce the amount of sick leave taken, rather than simply a narrow emphasis on the financial costs of absenteeism.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0801	2010-06-25	UNK	Press release, 25 June 2010	Eurofound publishes the annual analysis of pay trends from its European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO): Negotiated pay outstrips prices in 2009 (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Despite moderate collectively agreed nominal pay increases across the European Union in 2009, the dramatic drop in the annual inflation resulted in significant pay increases, according to new data from Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO).  The annual update on pay developments in Europe found that differences in pay and price trends between the former EU15 countries and the 12 new EU Member States remained large, with average pay rises in the new Member States 1.9 times higher than in the former EU15 Member States.  For the EU as a whole, despite the general decline in nominal pay increases in 2009, continuing a trend of wage moderation since 2008, the steep fall in inflation resulted in real pay increases in all countries bar Malta. While the inflation rate fell sharply, from 3,7% in 2008 to 1% in 2009, average real pay rose by 2,9%, compared to 0,5% in 2008. The economic downturn affected the whole of Europe in 2009, though the depth, length and timing of its effects varied considerably. It was undoubtedly a factor in the drop in collectively agreed nominal pay levels in both 2008 and 2009. The (unweighted) average of collectively agreed nominal pay increases fell from 5,0% in 2008 to 4,2% in 2009. In 2008, the increases ranged from 15,8% in Romania to 1,8% in Malta, while in 2009 the range was between 17,6% in Romania and 1,8% in Malta. Increases in collectively agreed nominal pay in the former EU15 countries were at considerably lower levels than in the EU as a whole, with an average increase of 3,8% in 2008 and 3,1% in 2009. In the ten new Member States the average rate of nominal increase was 7,1% in 2008 and 5,9% in 2009. The report also found that out of the 28 countries covered, 20 have a national minimum wage, either by law or by national intersectoral agreements. The overall average rate of increase in the EU fell sharply from 9,8% in 2008 to 4,7% in 2009, falling in 15 of the 20 countries. Across the EU, the average increase in minimum wages was higher than the average increase in collectively agreed wages in both 2008 and 2009. The report also provides a comparison of increases in adult and youth minimum wage rates across the EU, in their local currencies, between 2008 and 2009. In terms of actual rates, Luxembourg has the highest minimum monthly wage at EUR 1,609, followed by Belgium at EUR 1,387 and the Netherlands at EUR 1,356. At the other end of the scale, Bulgaria is at the bottom with EUR 112 per month, followed by Romania at EUR 146 and Latvia at EUR 227. The report also found that the gender pay gap averaged 18% across the EU27.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0803	2010-06-29	UNK	Press release, 29 June 2010	Eurofound publishes the annual review of industrial relation developments in Europe from its European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO): Social partners show strong willingness to adapt to the changing social and economic climate (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Given the economic circumstances in the European Union during 2009, maintaining jobs and avoiding redundancies were to the fore in social partner discussions and actions across Europe in 2009, according to the new annual review of industrial relations developments in the EU from Eurofound's European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). The ‘Industrial relations developments in Europe 2009', which will be presented at the 9th European Congress of the International Industrial Relations Association (IIRA) in Copenhagen today, highlights the most significant developments that took place in industrial relations in the EU Member States and Norway in 2009, both at national and EU level. For the EU as a whole, despite the general decline in nominal pay increases in 2009, continuing a trend of wage moderation since 2008, the steep fall in inflation resulted in real pay increases in all countries bar Malta. While the inflation rate fell sharply, from 3,7% in 2008 to 1% in 2009, average real pay rose by 2,9%, compared to 0,5% in 2008. The economic crisis that took hold across much of Europe from mid-2008 has multiple direct and more subtle effects in 2009 on employment, labour markets and industrial features. One key feature in 2009 has been that many governments faced with deteriorating public finances, cut or froze public expenses. These cuts had dramatic effects on employment in public services, central administrations and public agencies; moreover while the number of industrial actions seriously declined, the main actions dealt with pay cuts in the public sector. The main collective agreements on pay having been negotiated before the downturn began, little effect were expected on collectively agreed nominal pay increases during that year. However, the recession started to have a marked effect on wage increases in most countries in 2009. The (unweighted) average of collectively agreed nominal pay increases fell from 5,0% in 2008 to 4,2% in 2009. Since the inflation rate fell sharply, from 3,7% in 2008 to 1% in 2009, average real pay rose by 2,9%, compared to 0,5% in 2008. The impact of the crisis on industrial relations processes and collective bargaining is substantial. Some countries, as diverse in terms of their industrial relations systems as France, the Netherlands and Poland, negotiated some responses to the crisis, as per pay increase, working time... On the other hand, traditional collective bargaining at intersectoral level failed in 2009 in Ireland and in Spain. Finally, in a number of countries, opportunities have been open for companies to derogate to sectoral or national collectively agreed working conditions as pay increase for example, increasing the ‘decentralisation trend' in collective bargaining. One main feature during 2009, has been the development of ‘Short working time' schemes (SWT) as a response to the economic downturn. These schemes include some or all of the following elements: negotiation on reduction of working time, pay reduction correlated, training during the time freed and governments' support, both for compensation of earning losses and for financing training schemes.

Living and working in Europe 2009 Throughout 2009, findings from Eurofound’s research reflected both the impact of the financial crisis and recession, and the efforts made by EU policymakers, Member State governments, and social partners to mitigate the recession’s impact upon European citizens, workers, and families. Eurofound’s first yearbook – Living and Working in Europe: 2009 Yearbook – distils the key findings it published in 2009. Large-scale restructuring resulting in substantial job loss, growing industrial conflict and difficulties faced by ordinary citizens in making ends meet, all underline the impact that the recession has wrought. At the same time, however, the yearbook highlights the degree of cooperation in numerous instances between employers, trade unions and governments, who have sought to work together to save jobs, boost skills and maintain purchasing power. Designed to be a comprehensive, accessible and attractive overview of Eurofound’s work over 2009, the yearbook was launched at the European Commission’s Social Europe ‘Circus’ campaign in Ireland, in early July.

Negotiated pay outstrips prices in 2009 Despite only moderate nominal pay increases across the European Union in 2009, a dramatic drop in the annual rate of inflation resulted in significant real pay increases, according to Eurofound’s latest annual update on pay in Europe. Pay developments 2009 finds that while the average collectively agreed nominal wage increase across the EU fell from 5% in 2008 to 4.2% in 2009, falling inflation meant that the rate of real increase rose sharply, from 0.5% in 2008 to 2.9% in 2009. The report notes that differences in pay and price trends between the former EU15 countries and the 12 new EU Member States remained substantial, with average nominal pay rises in the new Member States being nearly twice as high. It also finds that the average increase in minimum wages was higher than the average increase in collectively agreed wages in both 2008 and 2009. In addition, the report examines collectively agreed pay increases in the chemicals sector, the retail sector and the civil service, and looks at developments in the gender pay gap.

IN BRIEF News in pictures Restructuring on the wane, but job loss continues in Europe Restructuring continues its recent trend of decline, although job losses still outnumber job gains, with around 80,000 jobs lost, as against just over 30,000 new jobs in the first quarter of 2010. The European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) recorded 244 cases of restructuring in the quarter, 160 of which entailed job losses. News in brief Focusing on disadvantaged workers Investigating the world of employment reveals striking disparities: around 8% of those in employment across Europe live at or below the poverty level. Meanwhile, people who are not working on standard, full-time, permanent employment contracts tend to be paid less, have greater difficulty reconciling their work with their personal lives and are more likely to perform monotonous tasks. Over the past month, Eurofound has been contributing its findings regarding more marginalised workers to the policy debate, at both EU and Member State level: it organised a lunch debate in Brussels on atypical work, on 15 April, for the European social partners, and another on in-work poverty on 29 April, for the Member States’ social affairs attachés. Eurofound will also present findings from its most recent report on undeclared work, as well as examples from its database of case studies, at a conference on the issue on 13–14 May in Sofia, Bulgaria. The debates draw on the Eurofound report Working poor in Europe, on a report and a background paper on atypical work, and the report and database of case studies on undeclared work Fostering cultural diversity Friday 21 May marks the UNESCO World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development. To mark the day, Eurofound is publishing its latest findings from the work of the European Network of Cities for Local Integration Policies for Migrants (CLIP), a collaborative venture that seeks to share best practice on how to integrate migrants into Europe’s cities. The new report looks at how Europe’s cities have responded to their increasing multiethnicity. While this newfound diversity can be a source of creativity and competitiveness, it also challenges cities to foster productive and harmonious relations between groups whose cultures, priorities and values may differ profoundly.  Intercultural policies in European cities: Good practice guide will be available shortly ERM quarterly maps decline in restructuring As Europe slowly emerges from recession, restructuring activity continues to decline. However, job losses still outnumber job gains. Over the first quarter of the year, the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) recorded announcements of the loss of 80,156 jobs; by contrast, only 31,725 new jobs were announced in the same period. Internal restructuring accounted for over 70% of the announced job losses and bankruptcy/closure for nearly a quarter. Notably, the countries with the greatest number of announced job losses were also the countries in which most job gains were reported – the UK, Romania and Germany. In addition to its regular round up of restructuring news and figures, the latest issue of the quarterly has a feature on the significant job losses that have been taking place in the European airlines sector, and are likely to increase in the wake of the financial damage wrought by the closure of European airspace in mid-April in response to the volcanic ash cloud.

Pictured (from left) are moderator Jacki Davis, Senior Advisor, European Policy Center, Jorma Karppinen, Director of Eurofound, and James K. Halter, one of Gallup’s Chief Scientists.   News in brief Promoting intercultural dialogue Significant migration to Ireland is a relatively new phenomenon, having only started during the 1990s, with many immigrants choosing to settle in Dublin (and other cities) as a result of the country’s rapid economic growth and increasing prosperity. With regard to integrating migrants – both socially and culturally – Ireland, and more particularly the city of Dublin, can usefully learn from the successes and mistakes of its neighbouring EU cities, many of which have a long tradition of integrating migrants. The Eurofound-supported Network of Cities for Local Integration Policies for Migrants (CLIP) initiative will be presenting the latest findings from the network at an event organised by the Immigrant Council of Ireland in Dublin on 14 June – a ‘think-in’ on intercultural and interfaith dialogue. CLIP’s latest research module looked specifically at the policies that municipalities across Europe have implemented to better foster intercultural cohesion, with a particular focus on the experience of Muslim communities. This is clearly a priority, given that Eurofound research has highlighted the fact that the most acute tensions across European societies are those between different racial and ethnic groups. Read more about European cities’ work in improving intercultural relations Comparative restructuring data – just a click away In order to attract new jobs in the wake of major redundancies, the German federal states are promoting initiatives involving local, cross-sectoral collaboration. In Bulgaria, special regulations have been introduced, which encourage municipalities to support business development programmes that create new jobs. In Estonia, by contrast, local municipalities have focused on creating jobs in public enterprises, and supporting new (social) jobs in private enterprises, with wage subsidies for employers. Users of Eurofound’s European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) website can now access the information they want from the ERM’s comparative data on restructuring across Europe – in relation to such aspects as the legal framework, support measures for workers who have lost their jobs, job creation initiatives and the role of government and social partners. The results of the comparisons are displayed in tabular form and can also be downloaded in full as an Excel table. All data are available here Eurofound monitors information at Member State level Correspondents for Eurofound's Network of European Observatories (NEO) are now operational across Europe, following a large-scale tendering process, which took place at the start of this year. Providing input to the European Industrial Relations Observatory, the European Working Conditions Observatory and the European Restructuring Monitor, the correspondents cover a broad range of activities, which feed into Eurofound's work and give a unique insight into the situation at national level. In order to ensure the coherence of this work at national level and its transparency, Eurofound is embarking on a series of meetings, which will bring together the NEO correspondents and Eurofound's Governing Board members in that country. The first such meeting will take place in June in Germany. Eurofound Observer brings the news to you In May, Eurofound’s observatories examined the Europe-wide restructuring plans announced by General Motors, the raising of the retirement age in Estonia, and the extent of sickness-related absence in companies in the UK. Now, Eurofound’s latest web initiative allows you to receive highlights from the observatories’ work every month in your inbox, compiled in the form of a new electronic publication, Eurofound Observer.

A challenging year in industrial relations Eurofound is set to launch its annual review of industrial relations for 2009 at the ninth European Congress of the International Industrial Relations Association (IIRA) in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 28 June–1 July. As well as looking at trends and developments in industrial developments at European level, the annual review also compares developments across the EU Member States, and analyses the situation in social partner organisations. During the IIRA congress, Eurofound will also present research data, findings and recommendations at two seminars. The first one, entitled ‘What can we learn from the European Company Survey?’, will discuss the results of Eurofound’s second survey of European companies, and look at ways of improving the methodology and use of future surveys. The second will examine the topic ‘New forms of governance in European industrial relations’, looking at new forms, structures and processes, at sectoral and company level.

Combining work and family While having sufficient time to fulfil both professional and personal goals is a crucial element in a good quality of life, findings from Eurofound’s Quality of Life Survey indicate that work–life balance remains an elusive goal for many working Europeans. However, despite the difficulties that can arise in balancing work and family life, a new in-depth analysis of the original survey data – Family life and work – indicates that people in employment who are part of a couple with children are the happiest group of all, especially if the work–family conflict they experience is not too acute. Moreover, even those who face a great deal of pressure in juggling their job and their home life are more satisfied with life than someone who is unemployed. The findings from this analysis, and Eurofound’s other analyses of the survey, will be discussed at a high-level conference looking at the trends in, and the challenges for, quality of life in Europe, which Eurofound is organising in conjunction with the European Commission and the European Policy Centre in Brussels on 24 June.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-may-2010-1

Public services and quality of life ‘Cutting public services will not help the recovery, but rather risks creating a broader gap in society instead of building social cohesion’ says European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion László Andor in the latest issue of Foundation Focus, which looks at the current state of quality of life in Europe. The Focus highlights the role that good-quality public services can play in delivering a better quality of life for citizens across Europe, and stresses the harmful impact of social exclusion. In addition, it outlines the impact of the recession upon quality of life: the gains made, in particular by the new Member States following their accession to the EU, have in many countries been substantially eroded since the economic downturn began in 2008. The question over maintaining or scaling back public services, highlighted by the Commissioner, is likely to occupy political debate across the Union as a number of Member States strive to reduce their budget deficits.

Findings in figures In 2009, Eurofound’s work became substantially more visible, targeting a greater number of key decision makers across Europe, as data from the Eurofound Performance Management System (EPMS), soon to be officially published, makes clear. 803 exchanges and briefing meetings took place with key policymakers at EU level, up from 555 in 2008 49% – the percentage increase in European Commission policy documents that cite Eurofound research 1.6 million people accessed information from the Eurofound website 152,443 print publications were disseminated, with many more being disseminated electronically 135,276 documents were downloaded from the Eurofound website (an increase of nearly 28,000 over the total for 2008) 114 million European citizens learned about Eurofound’s work through its media outreach programme 700 academic articles cited Eurofound research over the course of 2008–2009, 100 more than in the period 2007–2008 98 presentations were made by Eurofound staff, by invitation, to key stakeholders across the 27 EU Member States.  The three most popular reports for download from the Eurofound website in 2009 were: Second European Quality of Life Survey: Overview (4,320 downloads) Fourth European Working Conditions Survey (3,872 downloads) Annual review of working conditions in the EU 2008–2009 (1,484 downloads) 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-may-2010
EUROFOUND_UNK_0814	2010-05-19	UNK	Press release, 19 May 2010	 Eurofound presents new trend data on the perception of quality of life and subjective well-being in Europe between 2003 and 2009: Level of trust in government and national parliament plummets across Europe (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Satisfaction with life in general in Europe has fallen by about 4% between the last quarter of 2007 and September 2009, according to trends on the subjective well-being in the 27 EU Member States. The most marked change over the same period of recessionary climate was the 12% decline in people’s levels of trust in political institutions. The data from Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU agency providing European social policymakers with comparative data, research and recommendations to improve living and working conditions, will be presented at the Gallup European Summit on Wellbeing in Brussels, Belgium, on 19-20 May 2010. The decline in levels of life satisfaction was more marked in the 10 new EU Member States (NMS10), among which global life satisfaction had been increasing since joining the European Union in 2004. The average score among the 10 NMS fell from 6.47 to 6.05, representing a decline of 6% or twice as great as the fall in life satisfaction in the EU15 countries. The biggest falls were in Bulgaria and Romania, Estonia and Latvia, but also in France where the average life satisfaction rating fell from 7.32 in 2007 to 6.73 in 2009. There was no difference between men and women in change scores between 2007 and 2009, but among younger people, aged 18-34 years, the life satisfaction rating fell by only 1% compared with a 5% decline for older people. ‘It’s clear that people’s perception of quality of life have been influenced by the economic crisis over the past two years,’ says Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director, commenting on the findings. ‘It is, however, important to document and interpret the extent of any changes in satisfaction with different aspects of life and to identify groups on which the financial crisis has had most impact.’ Among the most marked changes between 2007 and 2009 was a decline in many Member States in reported levels of trust in government and national parliament. Questions about trust in their national parliament and government were asked for the first time in 2007. The average score of 4.62 (out of 10) was not high, but it was only 4.08 in 2009, a decline of 12%. The average was 4.31 in the EU15 and 3.25 in the NMS12; it ranged from 6.16 in Luxembourg and 5.28 in Cyprus to 3.22 in Greece and 2.25 in Latvia. The biggest falls between 2007 and 2009 were in Estonia and Latvia, Spain and Greece, Ireland and Romania – tending to reflect countries whose economic situation deteriorated most in the financial crisis. Social relations have been examined by Eurofound by asking people to rate the level of tension between a range of social groups. Although there is much discussion of ‘gender’ and ‘intergenerational’ conflict, relatively few people in the EU actually register these as major sources of tension in their country. Between 2003 and 2007, reporting of ‘a lot of tension’ had declined by between 4% and 6% for the three social groups investigated here. However, between the 2007 and 2009 surveys the proportions reporting ‘a lot of tension’ have increased by 2%-3%. The increased reporting of tensions between ‘poor and rich’ was most marked in Malta and Slovenia, and also Slovakia, but otherwise mainly in northern Europe – UK and Ireland, Finland and Sweden, Latvia and Estonia – all had proportions reporting ‘a lot of tension’ that was 5% or more higher in 2009 than in 2007. While indicators of both global life satisfaction and satisfaction with standard of living had improved between 2003 and 2007 particularly in the new Member States, they have fallen between 2007 and 2009. However, the countries experiencing the deepest recession are not always those reporting the greatest changes in quality of life – but it does appear that Latvia and Estonia, as well as Bulgaria and Romania have been slowed in their paths towards improved well-being. The results are drawn from Eurofound’s 2007 pan-European Quality of life survey and the Eurobarometer survey module in 2009.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0815	2010-05-13	UNK	Press release, 13 May 2010	 Eurofound presents recent trends and future developments in working conditions in Germany and Europe in Berlin on 17 May 2010: Germany bucks the overall trend in working conditions in Europe The number of people on temporary employment contracts in Germany has remained stable at one in seven workers (14.6%) over the past five years, while Europe has experienced a trend of overall decline of almost two percent during the same period. This spells bad news for German workers and their opportunities to train, develop and grow in their workplaces, according to research from Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU agency providing European social policy-makers with comparative data, research and recommendations on improving living and working conditions.  Recent findings charting the major trends and developments in working conditions in Germany will be Eurofound’s contribution to the 10 Years of Enterprise for Health conference in Berlin on 17 May 2010, co-organised by the Federal Association of Company Health Insurance Funds (BKK BV GbR) and the Bertelsmann Foundation. This European cross-company networking event, aimed at exchanging knowledge and ideas on successful company HR and health policies, highlights corporate strategies which seek to create healthy workplaces and empower employees.  Eurofound’s Deputy Director Erika Mezger will illustrate how the present situation regarding job security and working conditions in Germany is radically different to the one workers enjoyed five years ago. In 2005, just one in eight (12.7%) German workers were afraid of losing their job and one quarter of all workers (25.3%) benefited from training paid for by their employer, according to Eurofound’s fourth European Working Conditions Survey. However, in light of the economic recession and widespread labour market contraction over the past couple of years, these findings are likely to be radically different in the latest survey.  The fifth European Working Conditions Survey – a comparative survey of 43,000 workers in 34 European countries – is due to be published in November 2010. A key concern highlighted by Eurofound is the precariousness or vulnerability of workers in the German labour market today and in the future, as well as the changing work organisation and its impact on health, trust, involvement and empowerment between employers and employees, and the role of social partners.  For further information about Eurofound’s research data, analysis and recommendations on living and working conditions in Germany in comparison to other countries in Europe, go to Eurofound's European Working Conditions Observatory (EWCO).

EUROFOUND_UNK_0816	2010-04-21	UNK	Press release, 15 April 2010	 Eurofound presents trends in industrial relations and working conditions of self-employed workers in the European Union: Spain leads the way in supporting self-employed workers and creating more jobs Spain is singled out as a good example of how the government and social partners can work together to improve the working conditions of the self-employed and thus contribute to job creation and economic growth, according to a report from Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU Agency. The findings from the recent report on the industrial relations and working conditions of self-employed workers in the European Union and Norway will be presented at a major conference on self-employment and quality of employment, organised under the Spanish EU Presidency programme, in Seville, Spain, on 15-16 April 2010. Self-employment is a highly topical issue in most EU Member States. There have been many reforms in employment law in recent years, aimed at ensuring that workers under other kinds of employment contracts receive the same protection as employees. Despite progress in this area, there are still difficulties in coming up with a standard definition of self-employed workers, due to the different national contexts and legal frameworks. The proportion of self-employed workers varies widely from country to country. While most countries in southern Europe record a relatively high proportion – from one in three workers in Greece (35%) to one in four in Italy (26%), Portugal (25%) and Cyprus (20%) – in Spain just one in ten workers (11%) is self-employed. This is close to the EU average (10.5%), according to the report. The research found that as well as having to contend with low earnings, discontinuous work, long and non-standard working hours, self-employed workers are also prone to a relatively high incidence of industrial accidents and work-related health problems. The report argues that wide-ranging measures and solutions at national and EU levels are needed to tackle these issues. On the positive side, recent market deregulation has enabled more people to find work as self-employed workers, thus contributing to labour market expansion and economic growth. Findings from the report will be presented at the European Conference on Self-Employment, Entrepreneurship and Employment Quality, which takes place under the Spanish EU Presidency in Seville on 15-16 April 2010.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0818	2010-04-28	UNK	Press release, 28 April 2010	 Eurofound publishes its European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) quarterly for the 1st quarter 2010: Restructuring activity in Europe declines but job losses still outweigh job gains Large-scale restructuring activity in Europe continues its recent trend of decline, albeit one where job losses continue to predominate over job gains, according to the latest quarterly report from Eurofound’s European Restructuring Monitor (ERM). Unemployment continued to worsen during the same period, although the pace of decline has slowed. Between 1 January 2010 and 30 March 2010, the ERM recorded a total of 244 restructuring cases, of which 160 were cases of restructuring involving job loss. The number of announced job losses totalled approximately 80,000 in the quarter as against announced job creation of just over 30,000 new jobs. The global economic recovery appears to be on a firmer footing in early 2010, although the strength of the recovery in the EU lags somewhat behind developments elsewhere. The rate of increase in unemployment in the EU has moderated somewhat but is still rising: it reached 9.6% in February 2010, nearly three percentage points higher than at its most recent trough in early 2008. The lowest unemployment rates were reported in the Netherlands (4%) and Austria (5%), followed by Luxembourg (5.5%). The highest levels were again recorded in the Baltic countries of Latvia (21.7%), Estonia (15.5%) and Lithuania (15.8%) as well as in Spain (19%). There has been a disproportionate unemployment impact on younger, male, private sector and unskilled/semi-skilled workers, reflecting the fact that the majority of jobs lost have been in manufacturing and construction. The ERM shows that internal restructuring accounted for over 70% of the 80,156 announced job losses in large-scale restructurings during the first quarter of 2010, with bankruptcy / closure accounting for 24%. The greatest number of announced job losses were observed in the UK, with 18,504 jobs due to be lost, followed by Romania (14,129 jobs) and Germany (12,040 jobs). The report also shows that out of the 31,725 announced job gains some 9,810 jobs were announced in the UK, 4,208 jobs in Germany and 4,150 jobs in Romania. The retail trade is the sector reporting the greatest job creation (10,170 jobs), followed by hotels and restaurants (4,200 jobs), other business activities (2,170 jobs), auto manufacturing (1,859 jobs) and computer and related activities (1,853 jobs). In its latest edition, the quarterly also provides a timely sector focus on restructuring in European airlines and a feature on recent developments at GM Europe.

Director's diary Positive evaluation of Eurofound The results of two external and independent evaluations of the activities of Eurofound were released in February. Both show a positive picture of the effectiveness of Eurofound's work and the quality of its processes. The first, commissioned by Eurofound, covers the period 2005-2008. The second, commissioned jointly by the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council, is part of a general assessment of the performance of all the agencies across Europe. Both evaluations conclude that Eurofound's work and outputs are relevant for its target audiences. The organisation's efficiency and professionalism is judged to have improved substantially and the added value that it provides has grown. The Eurofound-commissioned evaluation praises in particular the quality of the organisation's research and information products. It notes that Eurofound has successfully integrated the newest Member States into the scope of its research, despite no corresponding increase in budget, and has usefully focused on further developing its relationships with key stakeholders and target audiences. In terms of its key tasks, it has adopted a more professional and outputorientated approach - including an improved responsiveness to requests for information - and has improved its performance measurement systems. The evaluation does also suggest that Eurofound has been less successful in reaching audiences at the Member State level, and questions some practices of the Governing Board. Overall, however, it notes that Eurofound has reached the objectives of the 2005-2008 work programme, and successfully aligned the work programme with the EU policy framework. Eurofound is reflecting on the results and is developing an action plan for further improvements.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-april-2010

IN BRIEF News in pictures Commissioner Andor addresses launch of ECS On 3 March, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, László Andor (centre) gave the closing speech at Eurofound's formal launch of its second European Company Survey (ECS). Also pictured are (left) Jorma Karppinen, Director of Eurofound and (right) Alejandro Cercas MEP, joint organiser of the event with Eurofound. News in brief Workers on the brink of poverty While being in employment is a key safeguard against poverty, it does not necessarily guarantee that poverty is no longer a risk. Across Europe, it is estimated that 8% of those in employment are at or below the poverty level (earning less than 60% of median income). A new report from Eurofound finds that policymakers rarely seem to tackle this complex and little-recognised phenomenon directly, dealing with it rather as part of more general anti-poverty measures. Some national governments have, however, set out to address it explicitly. In the UK, for instance, the Income Support scheme is designed to boost the incomes of low-income workers, while in Norway, tax reductions have been proposed for such workers. However, rising unemployment, wage cuts and cuts in working time in response to recession - as well as reductions in social benefits - are likely to have pushed many workers close to the brink of in-work poverty. Read the study Eurofound and the Spanish Presidency Eurofound will be delivering its research findings and insights to European policymakers at a number of high-level events as part of Spain's EU Presidency over the month of April. Eurofound's contribution aims to support the policy priorities of the Presidency - which include consolidating Europe's social agenda - with evidence and data from its research. The programme includes a conference on self-employment, entrepreneurship and employment quality in Seville on 15-16 April, one on mental health in older people in Madrid on 19-20 April, a ministerial meeting looking at the role that social security systems can play in contributing to social inclusion, in Burgos on 22-23 April, and a conference on active and healthy ageing starting in La Rioja on 29 April - the European Day of Solidarity between Generations. Linking wages to inflation While in most Member States wages are determined by wage bargaining, in Belgium, Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta, a system of 'automated' wage adjustment - or wage indexation - based on currency inflation seeks to maintain purchasing power in the face of a rising cost of living. A new background paper from Eurofound explains the workings of wage indexation, looks at the legislation and levels of bargaining involved, and outlines the views and positions of the social partners and the role of the state. It presents the main argument against such a system - that wage indexation can trigger inflationary pressure - which led several countries to abandon the system during the 1980s and 1990s; on the other hand, in some countries it has encouraged wage moderation and curbed inflation levels, even - the paper notes - serving as a tool to maintain industrial peace. Download the paper Steps to fight social exclusion As part of its ongoing contribution to the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, Eurofound has just published Opening the door - the role of social partners in fostering social inclusion, the latest in its series of 'Foundation Findings', which looks at the steps that Europe's social partners are taking to create a more inclusive society and workplace. While the topic may at first glance appear to be a matter for governments and local administrations, social exclusion has been both directly and indirectly tackled by the social partners, who are well equipped to address it in the context of employment. Minimum wages, despite bringing some controversy, are a key way in which trade unions in particular have sought to ensure that all those in employment earn enough to escape poverty. Other measures include training schemes and initiatives to boost employability, dealing proactively with the consequences of restructuring, addressing the gender pay gap and finding new approaches to preserving jobs in times of crisis.

Restructuring in the public sector The huge pressure on public finances as a result of the recession has had repercussions for public sector pay, staffing and working patterns, as highlighted by a new background paper from Eurofound, Current restructuring developments in local government. Pay freezes have come into force in many Member States, along with effective pay cuts in some of the countries worst affected by the recession - such as Ireland and the Baltic States. While employment levels in the public sector have been more resilient than in the private, the report does stress that - given that its data extend only up to the third quarter of 2009 - it is plausible that public sector employment may have experienced subsequent declines, and may even fall further as state revenues shrink in several Member States. Even in those countries that have pursued fiscal expansion to counter the effects of the downturn, the positive impact on public-sector employment levels may be short lived.

Assessing the quality of public services European policymakers and citizens share a common concern regarding the quality of Europe's society and public services: the actions of policymakers should, clearly, contribute to improving the quality of citizens' lives. To find out whether this is happening, it is necessary to go beyond objective measures of material wealth, such as gross domestic product, and see how citizens assess the condition of their own society. Further analysis of the findings of the second European Quality of Life Survey, just published, focuses on the quality of society and public services, underlining how both factors are fundamental to people's quality of life. Drawing on the findings of the survey, it establishes a number of innovative indexes to measure how people evaluate such aspects as key public services, the local environment, the degree of tensions present in their neighbourhood and the level of trust they have in their country's institutions. The analysis highlights the link between low income, levels of corruption and negative ratings of a society and its services.

IN BRIEF News in pictures EU agencies work towards greater efficiencies On 17 February, the heads of the EU agencies met in Brussels to discuss the governance of the agencies. Pictured from left to right are José Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission, with Jukka Takala, Director of the European Agency for Health and Safety at Work, and Jorma Karppinen, Director of Eurofound. Eurofound is well placed to meet the challenge of better performance required of all EU agencies, according to a forthcoming evaluation commissioned by the EU institutions. News in brief Focus on ‘very atypical work’ Those who do not work on standard, full-time, permanent employment contracts are less satisfied with their working conditions than their counterparts in standard employment, are less likely to receive training paid for by their employer and are more likely to perform monotonous tasks. Two new publications from Eurofound address the complex issue of so-called ‘atypical work’. A comparative report, Flexible forms of work: ‘very atypical’ contractual arrangements, highlights the increase in the use of work arrangements without a written contract, of part-time work of fewer than 10 hours a week and of contracts of less than six months. At the same time, a background paper, Very atypical work: Exploratory analysis of the fourth European Working Conditions Survey, complements the findings of the report with analysis of Eurofound’s survey findings. Download the report and the background paper Enabling Europe’s young disabled citizens Rather than focusing on what young people with disabilities or health problems cannot do, agencies involved in labour market policy, employment services and social protection need to find ways to help these young people to realise their potential in working life. This could involve changing the attitudes of social partners, removing barriers in public life and infrastructure and adapting workplaces to facilitate the entry of disabled young people. A recent Eurofound background paper looks at measures aimed at promoting the labour market integration of young people with disabilities or health problems and examines the role of social, health and employment services, as well as educational systems and the social partners. It identifies the following key factors for economic and social integration: access to high-quality vocational education and training, customised employment counselling, and incentives for both employers and young jobseekers. Read the report Subjective well-being and happiness A new report, analysing data from Eurofound’s second European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS), finds that deprivation is the single most important factor negatively impacting on the subjective well-being of individuals across Europe. However, once basic needs are met, it appears that income becomes less important in shaping people’s sense of well-being. The report also finds that good-quality public services can act as a buffer and mediate the impact of difficult economic circumstances: the life satisfaction of the poorest citizens is boosted if they perceive the quality of public services to be high. Download the report Settling workplace disputes Conciliation, mediation and arbitration are increasingly being used to settle individual workplace disputes across Europe. According to a recent report from Eurofound, Individual disputes at the workplace: Alternative disputes resolution, such measures of alternative disputes resolution (ADR) seem to work best in ambiguous and complex cases – for instance, claims of unfair dismissal, discrimination and bullying. Moreover, the earlier the matter is dealt with, the easier and less costly it appears to be to resolve. Over the past decade, initiatives using some form of ADR have been introduced in 15 countries. Trade unions are generally in favour of ADR, employer organisations in most countries now support it and governments increasingly view it as a cost-effective and speedy alternative to court proceedings, all of which suggests that its use is likely to continue to increase.

Launch of findings on gender pay gap Although on average across Europe women earn around 17% less than men, the issue of the gender pay gap is not universally a priority for all parties, according to a new report from Eurofound. The report, Addressing the gender pay gap: Government and social partner actions, will be available at a conference and meeting of ministers hosted by the Spanish EU Presidency in Valencia on 25 March – ‘Equality between women and men as basis of growth and employment’. The report finds that, while Member State governments have introduced numerous initiatives to address gender equality, legislation promoting equal pay for equal work is still lacking in many countries. Most employer organisations see the pay gap as being the result of factors external to the enterprise, although some have taken steps to help create a better work–life balance and hence less gender segregation. Trade unions have been the most vigorous in attempting to combat the gender pay gap, with awareness campaigns and initiatives to introduce the issue into collective bargaining.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0829	2010-03-02	UNK	Press release, 1 March 2010	 Eurofound launches the overview report of Second European Company Survey: Workplace social dialogue essential in bringing European companies out of the recession Six out of ten employees (63%) are covered by a recognised institution of employee representation, according to Eurofound's Second European Company Survey of 27,000 public and private companies across Europe. The survey paints a positive picture of robust practices of workplace social dialogue, but also point to limitations and to important differences across Europe. The findings of the European-wide establishment survey, which also sheds light on working time and flexibility strategies, variable pay and financial participation schemes, as well as human resource practices in European companies, will be presented at a seminar organised with the Spanish MEP Alejandro Cercas in the European Parliament in Brussels on 3 March 2010. Members of the European Parliament and representatives from European social partner organisations are among the participants, and László Andor, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, is a keynote speaker. The recent recession has been a painful reminder of the need for managing business and employment change successfully. Social dialogue central to the European social model forward and is vital for managing business and employment change. The company survey shows that, on the whole, there is a framework for social dialogue in European companies. Almost four out of ten companies (37%) in the survey reported an institutional form of employee representation. With more than 60% of the employees covered by either trade unions or works councils, and more than two out of three workers (69%) covered by collective wage agreements at either at company or higher level, the scene is set for a collaborative effort between workers and employers to help companies become more dynamic and competitive to tackle the challenges of current economic down-turn. The survey reveals that employee representatives in Europe seem to be generally satisfied with the cooperative culture of interaction that exists with management. Between 60% and 65% of the employee representatives in European companies are already involved in setting the rules/procedures on working time issues. In the companies with an institutional employee representation, most managers (70%) are generally positive about the effect of social dialogue and employee representation at the workplace, in particularly in the UK, Romania and Ireland. Although these results point to the strength of traditional workplace social dialogue in Europe, a number of limitations exist. A third of representatives receive infrequent information on the economic and financial condition of the organisation, at most once a year, and in a great number establishment, employee representation is limited to health and safety control or is organised in an informal way. One in six employee representatives (17%) are not entitled to take any paid time off to carry out their duties. There are also big differences between countries in northern and southern Europe. The survey also mapped work practices considered to be important elements of contractual and functional flexibility in an organisation. More than half (56%) of companies in Europe offer some kind of flexitime arrangements, and over-time work is used to handle workload peaks in more than two thirds of (68%) companies, in particularly in Germany, the Netherlands, the Nordic countries, Ireland, France and the UK. Fixed-term employment contracts are widely used, with more than half (54%) of all establishments having at least one employee on a fixed-term contract in the last 12 months. Three out of four establishments indicate that the need for further training is periodically checked in a systematic way. However, training is not equally distributed among all workers. While almost two out of three establishments (64%) check the need for further training in a systematic way for permanent employees in skilled or high-skilled positions, only about every second enterprise (52%) does this for permanent employees in low-skilled or unskilled positions. In other words, permanent staff have much better access to training than temporary staff.

Holding onto jobs in times of crisis Social partners and governments have sought to minimise the damage to employment caused by the current recession with a range of measures – for example, short-time working, which cuts working hours in line with reduced demand but keeps workers in employment. On 8–10 March, representatives of trade unions, employer organisations and Member State governments and national experts come together in Bonn for the second session of Eurofound’s 2009–2010 Foundation seminar series: ‘Preparing for the future: maintaining employment in times of crisis’. The series provides a forum for the exchange of experience and opinion among key actors; the current seminar looks at concrete examples of how a joint approach can contribute to maintaining employment levels and developing workers’ skills and employability, even during a recession.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0831	2010-02-22	UNK	Press release, 14 December 2009	 Eurofound launches the first findings from the Second European Company Survey 2009 European-wide survey shows how companies are managing in the recession Improving labour market flexibility is one of the key elements of the Lisbon strategy to make Europe more dynamic and competitive. The political goals are clear, but how well equipped are European companies to meet these challenges? How can workplace social dialogue, working time and flexibility strategies, as well as human resource practices help companies become more dynamic and competitive, especially in the current economic climate? Eurofound's second European Company Survey is designed to provide answers to these questions. Working time flexibility is the most common type of flexibility in European companies, the survey of 27,000 public and private establishments found. More than half (56%) of all establishments with 10 or more employees in the EU27 use some type of flexi-time arrangement. This reflects a substantial increase compared to four years ago as measured in the previous European Company Survey, undertaken in 21 countries. The European Company survey also looked at the views and experiences of workplace social dialogue. The survey found that six out of ten employees (63%) in Europe are covered by a recognised institution of employee representation. The survey findings paint a picture of robust practices of workplace social dialogue in Europe, and also point to limitations and to important differences across Europe. The survey mapped work practices considered to be important elements of contractual and functional flexibility in an organisation. About two thirds of surveyed establishments (67%) indicated that they use some form of temporary work arrangement like temporary agency workers, fixed-term contracts and freelancers. Three out of four establishments indicate that the need for further training is periodically checked in a systematic way. However, training is not equally distributed among all workers. The 'European Company Survey 2009 - Flexibility practices and social dialogue' is the second European-wide establishment survey carried out by Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU agency. The first findings of the survey will be launched in Stockholm on 15 December 2009, at a high-profile event under the Swedish EU Presidency. Both human resource managers and employer representatives in 27,000 establishments across the 27 EU Member States as well as Croatia, Turkey and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) were interviewed simultaneously during spring 2009. Eurofound's first company survey - the Establishment Survey on Working Time and Work-Life Balance (ESWT) - was carried out in 2004/5 in 21 countries. The main results of the second European Company Survey will be published in spring 2010. This will be followed by some more detailed reports which include more in-depth analysis.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0832	2010-02-26	UNK	Press release, 1 February 2010	 Eurofound publishes its European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) quarterly for the 4th quarter 2009: Levels of restructuring job loss continue to decline but so does job creation across Europe The European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) recorded a total of 285 cases of restructuring in the European Union between 1 October and 31 December 2009, involving some 100,000 announced job losses and 20,000 announced job gains. Restructuring activity as captured by the ERM has continued to reflect more normal levels of activity in the recent quarter. Levels of restructuring job loss continue to decline from the peak levels of the fourth quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2009. So too did levels of job creation, which fell to their lowest level since the ERM started systematically recording such cases in 2004. The European Union emerged from recession in the third quarter of 2009 but growth remains weak at +0.3% across all EU27 Member States. All Member States continue to suffer the effects and aftershocks of the recent severe recession. Unemployment notably continues to rise and its pace of increase has accelerated in the most recent quarter to reach the highest levels in over a decade. All countries have experienced increasing levels of unemployment during 2009. There is, however, a wide variation among Member States. The most severe impact of the economic downturn has been observed in Latvia, Spain and Ireland, where unemployment between November 2008 and November 2009 rose by 12.1%, 5.4% and 5.1%, respectively.  Other EU Member States have reported only a marginal increase in unemployment over the same period, partly thanks to extensive government-funded stimulus programmes as well as public assistance to short-time work and temporary lay-off subsidies. This has notably been the case for Germany. ‘Though they are, on the whole, more positive than in recent quarters, macroeconomic indicators in the EU continue to send mixed messages,’ says Donald Storrie of Eurofound’s Employment and Competitiveness unit. “On the one hand, there are clear signs of recovery, albeit one that is slow and potentially vulnerable. On the other hand, labour markets continue to suffer and unemployment is unlikely to peak before the second half of 2010.’ Restructuring activity as captured by the ERM has continued to reflect more normal levels of activity in the recent quarter. Levels of job loss continue to decline from the peak levels of fourth quarter 2008 to first quarter 2009. So, too, did levels of job creation which fell to their lowest level since the ERM started systematically recording such cases in 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2009, 97,683 large scale restructuring job losses were announced across the EU. The United Kingdom records the highest number of job losses (27,448) with lower volumes of job loss reported in Germany (9,403), France (8,692) and Belgium (7,566). Financial intermediation was the sector that recorded the highest number of announced job losses (16,411) followed by auto manufacturing (14,673), retail (8,968), public administration (8,367) and transport, storage and communications (6,973). In its latest edition, the quarterly also provides a summary of an employment and restructuring outlook for 2010 as well as a feature on collective redundancy data from Lithuania.  Download the full text of the ERM quarterly For further information, contact John Hurley, research officer, at email joh@eurofound.europa.eu, or telephone: +353-1-204 3209 Måns Mårtensson, press officer, at email mma@eurofound.europa.eu telephone: +353-1-2043124,  and mobile: +353-876-593 507.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0833	2010-02-01	UNK	Press release, 19 January 2010	 Eurofound launches the fieldwork for the fifth European Working Conditions Survey: A snapshot of working conditions in Europe today Eurofound has just launched fieldwork for the fifth European Working Conditions Survey, involving face-to-face interviews of workers in 34 European countries. This critical and timely research tracks the current state of working conditions in Europe, highlights the quality of work and employment, and monitors changing trends. The first findings of the survey will be presented at the end of 2010. The European Working Conditions Surveys (EWCS) provide valuable and unique comparative information about working conditions, including issues such as working time, exposure to risks at work, health and safety at work, work organisation, work-life balance, training, and overall job satisfaction. The underlying aim is to help social policymakers improve overall living and working conditions. The surveys also offer opportunities for workers to make their voices heard about the state of their working conditions, how working conditions and quality of work affect their lives, and how these change over time. In cooperation with Gallup-Europe, Eurofound will for the fifth edition of the EWCS interview around 43,000 workers in 34 European countries during the period January to April 2010. Each face-to-face interview will be carried out in the person's home, covers a list of 120 questions and lasts about 40 minutes. All the information gathered will be treated in the strictest confidentiality and the anonymity of each interviewee is guaranteed. The survey targets working people who are randomly selected from a statistical sample in each country, comprising a cross-section of society, ranging from 1,000 to 4,000 people per country. Eurofound is an EU agency with a proven expertise in examining how people across Europe live and work, and how this is changing over time. Eurofound's research findings, data and recommendations allow social policy makers and company management at EU and national level to make decisions that improve workplaces and worklife balance for all. To date, Eurofound has carried out four European Working Conditions Surveys (1991, 1995, 2000/2001 and 2005). The evolution of the European Working Conditions Surveys mirrors the changes in the European Union itself. In 1991, the survey covered just 12 countries; in 1995, this was expanded to include 15 countries, and in 2000 to 16 countries: the 15 EU Member States and Norway. The 2000 survey was extended in 2001 to cover the ten candidate countries for membership to the EU. The fourth survey, carried out in 2005, covered all 27 Member States of the EU plus Croatia, Turkey, Switzerland and Norway. The fifth survey will cover the 27 EU Member States, the three EU candidate countries Turkey, Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as well as Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Albania: a total of 34 countries. This fifth edition of the survey is also an important landmark for Eurofound because it builds on the lessons learned from the previous four surveys and hence will provide a rich and varied picture of workplace trends in Europe over the last 20 years. The first results of the fifth European Working Conditions Survey will be made available before the end of 2010.

IN BRIEF News in pictures Incidence of flexible working time has increased The ECS finds that more than half of all establishments with 10 or more employees in the EU27 use some type of flexitime arrangement, substantially more than in 2005.    News in brief Consequences of bankruptcy for workers Between the first quarters of 2008 and 2009, the numbers of companies in Spain that started insolvency proceedings rose by 167%. With the number of bankruptcy cases rising significantly against a background of global recession, a new report from Eurofound - Restructuring in bankruptcy: recent national case examples - examines recent cases of bankruptcy to better understand bankruptcies in general as well as the consequences for the workers concerned and the support that they receive. It finds that bankruptcy is likely to have more serious consequences for workers who lose their jobs than are other cases of restructuring, since the company may be incapable of providing any support. It also finds that, in the absence of redundancy payments, workers are often reliant on government assistance, while pension funds in many countries are protected by regulations stating that the funds must be kept separate from the business's assets. Read the report Challenges and opportunities of cultural diversity The recent decision in Switzerland to ban the further building of minarets at mosques highlights the ongoing debate on integrating religious and ethnic minorities in European societies. On 30 November-1 December 2009, Eurofound - as part of its involvement in the ‘European network of cities for local integration policies for migrants' (CLIP) - organised a conference in Brussels on ‘Intercultural approaches to community-building and cohesion in European cities - what can European integration policy learn from cities on how to manage migration and diversity in times of economic slump?' The event brought together over 170 participants - policymakers at all levels, and representatives of civil society and of religious and ethnic minority groups - to discuss how best to address the challenges and make the most of the opportunities arising from Europe's increasing cultural diversity, especially the integration of Muslim and other faith communities. Information on the event and speakers' presentations are available Boosting opportunities for low-qualified workers In light of the barriers to skills development and opportunities that workers with just a basic level of education face in the employment market, social partners could ease their way by agreeing to validate skills acquired through work rather than through formal education. This is one of the key conclusions of a Eurofound report, Low-qualified workers in Europe. The report finds that such ‘low-qualified' workers are disadvantaged in three ways: in terms of their chances of getting a job, the nature of the jobs held, and the access they gain to training. While existing policies seek to ensure that fewer people drop out of the school system, the report finds it equally important that those with low qualifications are able to access the labour market and find stable, decent employment. Download the report Trade unions tackle fall in membership Trade unions across the EU are fighting falling membership levels with new strategies, according to a new report from Eurofound, Union strategies to recruit new groups of workers. One of the main challenges trade unions face is shrinking constituencies, as employment falls in traditionally unionised sectors such as manufacturing and public administration. Therefore, efforts to identify and recruit new members are being concentrated in sectors, and in segments of the labour market, with lower-than-average levels of unionisation - in private services, and among migrant workers, those on temporary contracts and younger workers. The report also highlights how the increasing diversity of members is being reflected in unions' experimentation with different types of membership, such as services for self-employed workers who don't enjoy the benefits of collective bargaining. This study will be published online shortly 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-january-2010-2

Flexitime on rise in European companies The first findings from Eurofound's European Company Survey (ECS) have been released with the publication of a résumé, The European Company Survey - First Findings, in Stockholm on 15 December. The survey finds that 56% of companies in the EU27 - substantially more than was the case four years ago - make use of flexitime practices. In spring 2009, Eurofound interviewed managers and, where possible, employee representatives at establishment level to map working time and flexibility strategies, human resource practices and the extent of workplace social dialogue. The survey also finds that working time flexibility is the most common type of flexibility in European companies, that part-time work has become considerably more widespread and that workplace social dialogue in Europe is robust. However, some limitations are also apparent: one third of worker representatives receive information on economic and financial conditions only infrequently, while one third of managers reported concern about time delays in decision-making due to the involvement of employee representatives.

Recession - finding the exit Debate at Eurofound's fourth Foundation Forum, held in November, ranged widely over the causes and consequences of the global recession and Europe's road to recovery from it. A key topic of concern for participants was whether Europe can adjust to the changed circumstances while keeping its social and political principles intact. Discussions at the Forum pitted the arguments for cuts in public spending against those that see a key role for state spending to maintain economic equilibrium. Participants debated whether, and by how much, governments need to boost their funding for job creation, job search assistance and training and hiring subsidies. The question inevitably arose as to whether such expensive measures are sustainable; furthermore, in terms of rising unemployment, demand could swamp the capacity of services to deliver. Speakers at the Forum also underlined the role that social partnership can play in driving European comparative advantage and highlighted the need to create appropriate responses for social security and welfare reform.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-january-2010-1
EUROFOUND_UNK_0839	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 19 December 2002	 FOCUSING ON TIME ISSUES A company survey on time, an Observatory on Working Conditions, cross-country comparisons in the industrial relations field and a monitoring tool for the quality of life for Europeans will dominate the Foundation's work in 2003. 'Time issues are in focus after recent developments such as working time reductions and increased working time flexibility,' says Raymond Pierre Bodin, Director of the Foundation. 'Previous Foundation research in this area will be extended by investigation through a company-based survey in 2003, involving all areas of the Foundation. The intention is to facilitate analysis of time arrangements in relation to policies at sectoral, national and European level.' The European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) will produce cross-country comparisons on collective bargaining, occupational pensions, childcare and parental leave, and the regulation of employee Internet. Other topics will be further developed to cover issues on the EU political agenda. The Observatory on Working Conditions will be an online monitoring tool built on information from the Foundation's own and national working conditions surveys, and other research in the area of quality of work and employment over the past twelve years. The strategy for the Living Conditions monitoring of Quality of life for Europeans will include all 28 EU Member States and candidate countries from the outset, and results and analysis from the survey will become available in 2003.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0840	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 21 November 2002	" MEASURING THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF THE KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY A first set of indicators for assessing the impact of the knowledge society on the way we live and work was presented at the conference 'European Knowledge Society Foresight' on 21-22 November 2002 in Brussels, Belgium. The indicators are a first result on a research project on European Knowledge Society Foresight, initiated by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the Dublin-based EU agency. The aim of the project is to explore the foresight methodology through a critical review of existing foresights and methods applied and to assess its possible contribution to the methodology of better understanding the drivers of change in the knowledge society. A Handbook on Knowledge Society Foresight will be published following the event. 'The value of technology development and innovation is not in the technology itself but in its benefit for citizens, for business and the society as a whole,' said Erkki Liikanen, European Commissioner responsible for Enterprise and the Information Society, as the launch of the event. To that extent, the European Foundation project will explore if the foresight methodology is an efficient tool for measuring the social impact of the knowledge society and its contribution towards the goals of the Lisbon strategy. The Foundation research project will produce results from its recently established national foresight centres to analyse the drive of the knowledge society and to prepare national knowledge foresights accessing the impact on working and living conditions, and industrial relations, towards the middle of 2003. 'We have taken a practical view and will present indicators for the knowledge society in order to understand better ""advancement"" of the countries towards the knowledge society,' says Raymond Pierre Bodin, Director of the European Foundation. 'There are great differences between EU Member States in how far they embraced the knowledge society, and we want to provide a tool for understanding the state of play, using the Foresight method of analysis.'

EUROFOUND_UNK_0841	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 26 September 2002	 Increasing Financial Share and Opportunities for Employees in Luxembourg Companies across the EU are putting in place systems through which employees can own a share of the equity of the company or have a share in the profits, over and above their normal remuneration. In an effort to promote financial participation programmes for employees in Luxembourg, Luxembourg's Minister for Labour Francois Biltgen gathers representatives from trade unions, employers and self-employed organisations and from the financial institutions in Luxembourg on 26 September 2002. 'Financial participation is seen as a means of promoting greater co-operation between management, owners and the workforce, providing a common purpose and reducing workplace conflict,' says Raymond-Pierre Bodin, Director of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, co-organiser of the event. 'However, in light of recent corporate scandals in major US companies, increased concerns with such arrangements have been raised.' During the event, the Foundation will present results from a recent comparative overview of financial participation in the EU, offering the widest geographical scope in Europe of any empirical study yet conducted on this topic. 'Our research shows that less than a third (31%) of firms, with more than 200 employees across the EU, have employee share ownership schemes in place,' says Kevin O'Kelly, research manager in charge of the research into Financial Participation at the Foundation. 'Profit-sharing schemes are more common, with 45% of firms having such schemes.'

EUROFOUND_UNK_0842	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 30 August 2002	 The Foundation Forum 2002 : Material success more important than political and social values for Irish youth Young people today can look forward to possibilities not available to earlier generations but is the yearning for material success keener than the desire to explore the more personal dimension of life? This was one principal strand of the dialogue between Professor Theodore Zeldin of Oxford University and some 120 students of Irish secondary schools and from European countries during the Foundation Forum 2002 'Europe make a difference - Challenges for the European Social Model'. The vision of today's young people about tomorrow's Europe was explored. Professor Zeldin pointed out that 'debates like these are necessary since they bring new and fresh ideas and offer an opportunity to work together on future political perspectives.' The Oxford professor commented that there has been the development in Ireland of a younger generation used to wealth, material gratification and happy to vaunt 'their right to be selfish'. He said however that the most valuable things are the things that money can not buy - friend, conversation, love. 'We risk impoverishing ourselves more than we know if we sideline the personal dimension of life,' according to Professor Zeldin. Two perspectives were raised during the debate; on the one hand the young need to be able to acquire enough experience to know what they want to choose for the future. Possibilities are more diverse but so too are the ambitions of the young. Secondly, it was clear that younger people are less interested in discussing the changes that can be made within the political system than they are in their personal achievement. There is a danger, according to Professor Zeldin, that we forget about the value of personal and spiritual development. One of the young discussants drew attention to the privilege that the younger generation enjoys in Europe in 2002. They are in a position to discuss and change the world. 'In many other parts of the world rights that we take for granted have still to be earned. We should learn to appreciate these privileges.'

EUROFOUND_UNK_0843	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 30 August 2002	" The Foundation Forum 2002: Flexibility essential in the development of a European Social Model Many issues were covered during the 2002 Foundation Forum conference which concluded in Dublin today. The main concerns were searching for a definition of what constitutes the European Social Model, how it is different from the American version, the need for indicators that are as stringent as those used to define financial performance, the flexibility of markets, the goal of full employment, the funding of pensions and the declining birth rate. The two-day event was led off with speeches by Anna Diamantopoulou, European Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs,the Irish Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern and the director of the Dublin-based European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, Raymond-Pierre Bodin. Mr Ahern emphasised that flexibility was ""absolutely essential"" in the ""development of a European Social Model"". He added that effectiveness and pragmatism needed to be key considerations when developing such policies. Mrs Diamantopoulou pointed out that there is a ""major contrast between Europe and the US. It is a choice between a more, or less, uneven distribution of income, opportunities and life chances."" Many speakers spoke of the need to define the European Social Model; perhaps Professor Yves Meny summed up this question in the best way. ""All these words are a problem. I think what we need to ensure is that whatever it is, it is attractive to Europeans and indeed the rest of the world."" Regarding the funding of pension schemes Professor Gøsta Esping-Andersen had the most radical suggestion. ""A good pension policy begins with babies."" He suggested that more should be spent on young families than on those who are of pensionable age now many of whom will have benefited from recent economic booms. Friedrich Buttler of the International Labour Organisation observed that ""global market governance has grown quicker than global social governance"". The question has become to what extent this lag is tolerable. Economic prosperity does not automatically bring social harmony and the objective for Europe should be to avoid economist John Kenneth Galbraith's characterisation of US society: Private affluence, public squalor. According to Malcolm Wicks (UK, junior minister), ""the best form of social protection is paid employment"". He said this in defence of the UK's full employment policy. Mr Wicks added that employment should be priority number one in European social policy. ""Make work possible, make work pay, make work skilled and make work family-friendly"" was his prescription for European policy-makers. Bernhard Jansen (European Commission) reminded the audience that the Nice European Council had underlined that the starting point of EU policy is ""the indissoluble link between link economic performance and social progress"".

EUROFOUND_UNK_0844	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 17 October 2002	 Quality in employment remains a challenge to Europe 'Quality in employment remains a challenge to the European Union's pledge at Lisbon of making Europe the most competitive, knowledge-based economy in the world,' states Raymond-Pierre Bodin, Director of the European Foundation for the Improvement for Living and Working Conditions, at the eve of the conference 'Quality in employment and enlargement of the European Union' held at the Palais d'Egmont in Brussels, Belgium, on 18-19 October 2002. 'Quality jobs are good for the individuals themselves and good for society as a whole.' One year after the European Foundation and the Belgian Ministry of Labour's joint conference 'For a better quality of work', the theme of more and better jobs remains high on the agenda of EU governments. This year's gathering of decision-makers and senior civil servants from the EU and candidate countries is a continuation of last year's effort. It will focus on gender, reconciliation of working and non-working life, job security, career structure and earnings, and the quality of employment in candidate countries. The event is co-organised with the Observatoire social européen and the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The Foundation's recent survey of working conditions in the candidate countries highlights considerable differences between candidate and EU countries and among the candidate countries themselves. 'Certain aspects of quality in employment appear to be better in the candidate countries, for example gender segregation is less prevalent,' says Pascal Paoli, research coordinator for the Working Conditions team at the Foundation. 'On the other hand, more workers in the candidate countries than in the EU consider their health and safety to be at risk because of their work.'

EUROFOUND_UNK_0845	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 30 August 2002	" The Foundation Forum 2002 : Social actors and youth have vital role to play in EU governance Reform of EU governance is a political issue and will ultimately be decided by politicians but it is also an issue in which the social actors have a vital role to play. Social dialogue - the process of decision-making by social partner organisations negotiating with each other - has the potential to grow more important in the years to come but is at present an under-utilised resource, according to delegates at this afternoon's debate on EU governance and the European Social Model. Controversy surrounded which social actors should have priority in the structures of social and civil society dialogue. Some speakers favoured a cautious attitude, preserving the special status of the established social partners (unions and employers) at the expense of NGOs and other civil society organisations. Others favoured a more radical and inclusive solution embracing the widest possible range of social actors. Concern was expressed by several speakers about the disconnection of youth from the political process. The turnout at European Parliament elections of the 18-25 age group, for example, is disquietingly low with abstention rates of 60-80%. Recent studies have confirmed a growing level of political apathy amongst youngsters. But there were hopeful signs as well. The spontaneous mobilisation of hundreds of thousands of young Germans and Austrians during the recent floods gave ample evidence of the energies of the younger generation and their positive potential for the political process. All speakers agreed that bridging the democratic deficit and reconnecting the youth and the ordinary citizen in the political process were two sides of the same coin. Key to both were education and participation. Citizens are empowered by education, their ability to participate is increased and the quality of their participation is enhanced. ""Educate to empower"", was the parting call of one delegate.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0846	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 29 August 2002	" The Foundation Forum 2002 : Hutton calls for Europe to celebrate Interindependence Day Author and former editor of UK broadsheet The Observer, Will Hutton, launched a broadside at the notion that Europe was failing economically at the Foundation Forum. If anything the economy of the European Union was outstripping the much vaunted productivity gains of the US economy. Mr Hutton claimed the reason for this was something called ""interdependence"" which links many public and private institutions in Europe. ""The European social model is superior to the US one,"" he said. ""Interdependence underpins the European Union and forms a common core understanding. Europeans understand that with property come reciprocal obligations, a noblesse oblige."" This is in contrast to a particular type of Republican thinking, popular with the Bush cabinet, which sees the redistribution of wealth by the state as coercive and that welfare rewards ""unindustriousness"", industriousness being the way in which Americans believe people should become rich. Hutton also claimed that the European social model enables the poor to escape poverty more easily than their US counterparts and Europe's schoolchildren get a better education. Some 47% of US pupils do not collect a school diploma whereas only 1% of German children fail, he claims. Interdependence also allows European companies to operate more efficiently and creatively than their American rivals. Hutton gave the examples of Nokia, Michelin, Airbus and Volkswagen as superior businesses to their non-European rivals.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0847	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 29 August 2002	" The Foundation Forum 2002 : Babies first plea by top academic A senior social affairs professor made a plea for European Union policy makers to consider the needs of young families rather than those of older people at the Foundation Forum 2002, held in Dublin on August 29 and 30. ""A good pension policy begins with babies,"" said Professor Gøsta Esping-Andersen of Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Spain. The academic made this call as part of his speech on the need for a new welfare state in Europe that should concentrate on the needs of the young rather than the old. His reasoning was that unlike his father's generation who suffered the pain of war and unemployment his generation and those younger gained from the economic booms of the 1960s and 1990s. Therefore, they had money set aside for their retirement. Professor Esping-Andersen said government policy should concentrate on supporting young families with good ""pedagogic"" childcare and spending on schools to offset the effects of an ageing population in Europe. Birth rates were falling throughout particularly in the ""South"" despite European's in polls saying that wanted their families to have on average 2.3 children.

The Foundation Forum is a platform where such issues can be discussed in an open and frank manner,' says the Foundation Director Raymond-Pierre Bodin. 'The increasingly important role of the social partners as drivers of legislation in regard to living and working conditions needs also to be addressed.' Over 200 high-level European policy makers and politicians will gather at Dublin Castle on August 29-30 for the Foundation Forum 2002, ""Europe makes a difference - Challenges for the European Social Model"". The Foundation Forum 2002 draw together decision-makers, relevant thinkers and other key speakers in the socio-economic policy field to discuss how to tackle issues like globalisation, enlargement, and technological change challenging the European social model. The Foundation Forum 2002 is organised by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the Dublin-based EU agency, with support of the Irish Government.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0850	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 29 August 2002	" The Foundation Forum 2002 : Flexibility at work - 'only employers gain' claim Flexible labour markets are driven by employers and their needs, claimed an academic at a controversial and lively debate at the European Foundation Forum this afternoon. While there were some significant exceptions, research shows that it is ""surreal"" to suggest otherwise, not least because flexibility leads to increased stress and poorer working conditions for employees. This was ""simplistic"" claimed an employer representative. A leading trade unionist, while agreeing that flexible labour markets are driven by employers and lead to greater workers' stress, said that there are advantages for employees too, for instance in the development of more family friendly work practices. The inflexibility of labour markets between member states of the European Union was noted, given the failure to reconcile the differing social security systems in member states. For instance, workers from member states with higher taxes and more comprehensive social security systems are reluctant to work in member states with less adequate social protection. It became evident in the debate that 'flexibility' is in the eye of the beholder, with several working definitions. One employers' representative saw it as comprising geographical mobility, functional flexibility, skills flexibility, flexible working patterns and, more controversially, as numerical flexibility and wage flexibility. Nor was there consensus in the debate as to whether flexible labour markets created growth and competitiveness.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0851	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 17 June 2002	" Good support, essential in combating social exclusion Insertion to employment is a key issue for the 'inactive' population and not only for unemployed people, according to a new study by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the Dublin-based EU agency. The report Integrated approaches to active welfare and employment policies will be presented at the conference ""Employment and labour market insertion strategies as a tool for social inclusion"", an event under the auspices of the Spanish EU Presidency, in Toledo, Spain on 17-18 June 2002. The conference will focus on the role and distribution of employment and labour market insertion strategies in combating social exclusion, particularly for these vulnerable groups. This requires attention both to those at the margins on the labour market, and those in employment but at risk of redundancy. 'The availability and accessibility of valuable service is the key to the development of good support to vulnerable groups,' says Mr.Robert Anderson, research coordinator of the living conditions unit at the Foundation. 'This means improving training, working conditions and work organisation in order to get and retain excellent front-line staff.' The relation between social protection and labour market strategies has been an important research topic for the Foundation over the last ten years. The Foundation has specifically looked at guidelines to improve the effectiveness of the strategies behind integration measures, such as public/private partnerships, coordination, user involvement and equal opportunities.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0852	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 5 June 2002	 Nearly double the risk to health and safety at work in the candidate countries Workers in the candidate countries consider their health and safety to be more at risk because of work than workers in the European Union (40% as opposed to 27%), reporting higher levels of fatigue and musculo-skeletal problems. Workers in the candidate countries also work longer hours, on average 43.61 hours per week compared to 38.25 hours in the EU. These are some of the findings of The First Survey on Working Conditions in the Candidate Countries, the first comprehensive overview of working conditions in the candidate countries by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. The findings of the survey will be presented by Mr. Raymond-Pierre Bodin, the Foundation's Director, and Mr. Pascal Paoli, research co-ordinator of the working conditions research team, during a press conference at the European Business Summit in Brussels (Heysel Expo) at 12.30 on 6 June 2002. 'Work organization tends to be less client-driven and more hierarchical in the candidate countries,' says the Foundation's Director Raymond-Pierre Bodin who made it clear that some of the survey conclusions can be attributed to differences in labour market structure. 'Our surveys show that 21% of the active population in the candidate countries works in the agricultural sector, as opposed to 5% in the EU. In the service sector, the situation is quite the opposite, with some 66% of workers in the EU and 47% in the candidate countries. The survey is based on the same methods as the three working condition surveys that the Foundation has carried out in the European Union in 1990, 1995 and 2000, allowing for comparisons to be drawn between the two blocks of countries. Some 11.000 workers in candidate countries were interviewed face-to-face for the survey in 2001. 'Gender segregation is less prevalent in the candidate countries, and a higher proportion of women work: 46% compared to 42% in the EU,' says Mr. Pascal Paoli, research coordinator of the working conditions unit. 'However, part-time work is less frequent; 7% in the candidate countries as opposed to 17% in the EU. Also the dual workload (combining paid work with unpaid household / caring work) is more balanced between the sexes in the candidate countries although it is still far from being evenly distributed.'

EUROFOUND_UNK_0853	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 4 June 2002	 The need to focus on the quality of European social services In response to calls for better access to and more meaningful choice of social services in Europe, the needs of the users as well as the staff performing social services must be better specified and determined at local levels. At the same time as efforts to improve quality in social services across the EU, practical experiences show that there are is no one quality model that is unique or applicable to social services. These are some of the points that Mr. Robert Anderson, research coordinator of the Living Conditions research team at the European Foundation, the Dublin-based EU agency, will present at the Spanish EU Presidency conference Shaping the Future of Social Services in Europe in Barcelona, Spain, on 5-7 June 2002. 'The drive for quality in social services has been stimulated by demands from users and citizens,' says Mr. Robert Anderson. 'But it now also engages governments, social partners and social providers.' While demand for quality and choice in social services is growing across the EU, Foundation research shows that user participation in design of quality initiatives needs to be coupled training and development of staff delivering them.

In total, between 1.8 and 2.1 million workers (or 1.2 % and 1.4 % of total employment) are engaged in ongoing work for temporary agencies in EU, while some 6 million persons are estimated being employed by a temporary agency at some time each year. Temporary agency work was the most rapidly growing form of non-permanent employment in the European Union during the 1990s, and concerns persist about the working conditions of 'temps' compared to their permanent colleagues. In a recently published report by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the main trends in this form of employment and the problems and challenges it poses for the different member states and the EU as a whole was examined. ""Temporary agency workers tend to be younger, mostly male, exposed to poorer working conditions and receive less training opportunities than other employees,"" says Mr. Ola Persson, research manager at the European Foundation. ""However, temporary agency work has the potential to offer economic benefits to user firms, advantages to the wider economy and profits to agencies. The study show that this can be done without the erosion or circumvention of employment standards in the user firm.""

EUROFOUND_UNK_0856	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 24 April 2002	 Inflation swallows nominal pay increases across the European Union Average collectively agreed nominal pay increases rose from around 3.2% in 2000 to 3.5% in 2001, according to the recent annual update from the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). However, when adjusted for inflation, workers in ten of the EU Member States and Norway saw their nominal pay increase swallowed up by inflation. Worst hit are workers in Italy and Spain, who have seen their nominal pay increase disappear through inflation for two years in a row. The rate of pay increase has been rising steadily since 1999, suggesting that pay `moderation´ - a priority in EU policy-making for some time - may have come under sustained pressure in some EU Member States. This is especially apparent in the euro-zone countries, where the development of wage levels is a key factor in determining whether the EU economy is heading in an inflationary or deflationary direction. Comparison of wage levels has been further facilitated by the introduction of the euro. ‘Pay has become an important financial policy instrument,’ says Ms. Stavroula Demetriades, coordinator of the Industrial Relations team at the Foundation. ‘The euro-zone countries are no longer able to use exchange and interest rates as a means of adjusting to imbalances in economic performance. The aim of the EIRO annual update, based on contributions from its 16 national centres, is to provide a broad, general indication of trends in pay increases over 2000 and 2001 in the EU Member States and Norway.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0857	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 16 May 2002	" Strong social protection possible without impeding economic performance High levels of social protection can be achieved without curbing economic performance. But this is only possible with complex and carefully planned policy mixes, resulting from consultation and negotiation with the social partners. This is one of the conclusions at today's seminar Interactions between labour market and social protection organised by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the EU social research body in Dublin. The seminar gathers Europe's leading experts on social inclusion, industrial relations and time issues. The event also marks the start of the Foundation's concentration into labour market and social protection issues, which will highlight knowledge and analysis emanating from Foundation research over many years. ""Welfare states are being reformed and modernised, while labour markets are getting more precarious, older and in some countries more unequal,"" says Ms. Hedva Sarfati, keynote speaker at the event and project director at the International Social Security Association (ISSA). ""At the same time, EU Member States have less leeway to address these issues, with increased global competition, limited public expenditure and the EMU convergence criteria and the euro."" An efficient labour market, with high participation rates and a functional two-way mobility between activity and inactivity, and between part-time and full-time work, may be even more important than the age structure of the population in guaranteeing the long-term sustainability of today's welfare states. The challenge for policy-makers is to respond to new demands within the constraints imposed by socio-economic circumstances, to which past, present and future work of the Foundation aim to contribute.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0858	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 20 April 2002	 Hourly labour costs increase across the European Union Hourly labour costs across the EU Member States have increased from 3.3% in 1999 to 3.8% in 2000 and 4.3% in 2001, according to the recent annual update from the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). There exists an enormous range of labour costs across the countries considered, with levels in the highest-cost country Denmark around three times greater than those in the lowest-cost country Greece. Labour costs were found to be the highest in the manufacturing industry and financial intermediation. The focus of this annual update from EIRO is on hourly labour costs, ie the total expenditure borne by employers in order to employ workers. The update aims to provide a broad, general indication of labour cost levels and trends in the EU and Norway, based on contributions from EIROs 16 national centres. ‘Keeping increases in labour costs relatively low has been a priority in EU policy-making for some time,’ says Ms. Stavroula Demetriades, coordinator of the Industrial Relations team at the Foundation. ‘Knowledge of labour cost levels is an essential tool in the strategic planning of investment, production, employment policy or wage levels in collective bargaining.’ Labour costs is estimated to account for some two-thirds of the production costs of goods and services, and compensation of employees is the main components of total labour costs, besides employers' social security contributions, vocational training costs and taxes relating to employment.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0859	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 24 October 203	 The Foundation is paving the road to enlargement: LONGER WORKING HOURS, HIGHER PHYSICAL RISK IN ACCEDING AND CANDIDATE COUNTRIES Choose your preferred language option: DE FR Workers in the acceding and candidate countries (ACC) work longer hours in less service-related industries than their EU counterparts, with higher exposure to various physical risk factors such as dangerous substances, fumes and noise. These are some of the conclusions that can be drawn from the wide-ranging report, Working conditions in the acceding and candidate countries, published today. ‘The survey provides a first comprehensive overview of working conditions in the 13 acceding and candidate countries, using the same methodology as in the previous European working conditions surveys carried out by the Foundation in 1990, 1995 and 2000,’ says Willy Buschak, Acting Director of the Dublin-based EU-agency European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. ‘The report is the first in a series of Foundation publications and events over the coming months, aimed at increasing knowledge, data and analysis on living and working conditions in the new enlarged Europe. A comprehensive report based on the survey of living conditions in the ACC will be published in February 2004. A conference to promote social dialogue as a tool for conflict resolution in the ACC will take place in March. The results of the 28-country pan-European Quality of Life monitoring initiative will also be available in May 2004.’ The average working week in the ACC is 44.4 hours per week compared to the EU average of 38.2. One in five of the workforce in the ACC is involved in agriculture, compared to only one in 20 in the EU. Considerably fewer people in the ACC (47%) are employed in the services sector than in the EU (66%). 51% of the workforce in the ACC is over the age of 40, compared to 47% in the current EU Member States. Some 40% of ACC workers believe their health and safety is at risk due to work, compared to only 27% in the EU. The results of this survey offer an important first and unique comparative insight into working conditions in these countries. The findings provide a positive input to the socio-economic policies for the new enlarged European Union and will serve as a basis for monitoring trends in working conditions in an enlarged Europe. The Foundation’s fourth European working conditions survey, planned for early 2005, will cover working conditions in the 25 EU Member States as well as candidate countries and selected third countries. The survey is based on face-to-face interviews with a representative sample of a total of 11,000 workers: 1000 workers in each country, apart from Malta and Cyprus where 500 persons were interviewed.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0860	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 4 February 2002	 Increasing labour force participation by promoting active ageing Older workers can cope with technological change and they are interested in training and career development. However, measures in favour of older workers are still not widespread and attitudes must change if the EU is to hit the targets for employment by 2010, says Robert Anderson, research manager at the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, speaking at the workshop “Extension of working life, gradual and flexible retirement systems” in Lanzarote, Spain on February 4-5, 2002. “Our research looked at initiatives in 150 companies in nine European Union Member States, examining measures in favour of the retention, reintegration and retaining of older workers,” says Robert Anderson. “However, actions in favour of older workers tend to be drawn from larger enterprises and there is a general need to support both development and documentation of initiatives in smaller companies.” The general trend is that the population is ageing and fewer people are entering employment. It is now high time for government, unions and employers – as well as workers – to address the contradiction that the average age of workers increases beyond 40 at the same time as worker aged 40 and over have increasingly been regarded as nearing the end of their productive working lives. The issue was highlighted again only a few weeks ago, when the European Commission published a report entitled “Increasing labour force participation and promoting active ageing”, stating that the EU must create 20 million new jobs, including 11-12 million for women and 5 million for older workers, if it is to hit the Lisbon and Stockholm targets for employment by 2010. The solution to the current trend is not to simply abolish or reduce early exit options, according to Mr. Anderson. Multi-faceted and more integrated approaches, with attention to working time including part-time work, flexibility and career development and work-life balance, are both possible and necessary. The role and active commitment of the social partners in this priority need to be increased substantially.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0861	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 10 September 2003	 The Foundation’s contribution to the IIRA World Congress in Berlin, Germany MONITORING OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS TO EXPAND TO TEN ACCEDING COUNTRIES The European Industrial Relations Observatory’s (EIRO) network of correspondents has been expanded to also cover 10 acceding countries to the European Union, offering news and analysis on industrial relations from 25 countries across Europe. The announcement by Willy Buschak, recently named acting Director of the Dublin-based European Foundation for the Improvement for Living and Working Conditions, coincides with record levels of user sessions for the Foundation’s web-based industrial relations monitoring tool EIRO. ‘We aim to apply the same professionalism in collecting, analysing and disseminating high-quality and up-to-date information on key developments in industrial relations in the acceding countries as we have in the current EU Member States during the past five years,’ says Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s acting Director. ‘The EIRO cross-country comparisons will be further developed to cover topics on the EU political agenda. Also, in the next couple of months, we’ll publish comparative reports on topics such as collective bargaining on occupational pensions, on childcare and parental leave, and on tripartism in the acceding countries and industrial disputes.’ The second Industrial relations developments in Europe report, a joint effort between the Foundation and the European Commission presents a comparative overview of the most significant industrial relations developments in 2003, is already in the pipeline. The annual review entitled Industrial relations in the EU, Japan and USA, which examines the key issues such as pay, gender pay inequality, working time, new forms of work, leave, training and skills development, is due to be published before the end of the year.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0862	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 18 August 2003	 Quotes New EIRO comparative report: New technology and the respect for privacy at the workplace TIME FOR EUROPEAN-LEVEL WORKPLACE PRIVACY REGULATION The use of new information and communication technologies (ICT) at the workplace has increased rapidly in recent years, highlighting the need to address issues of workers' privacy and employers' need to control and monitor the use of ICT at European level. The latest comparative report from the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) examines one specific issue raised by the growth of ICT at work, the relationship between internet/e-mail use at work and respect for workers' privacy. It highlights the need for clear regulation at European level by mapping and comparing the differences in existing European and national law on workplace privacy, and it offers the views of the social partners. While the European Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and national data protection legislation clearly spell out the privacy rights of the individual, the rules and regulations governing privacy at the workplace is based on a confusing web of guidelines and individual agreements at company level, often compromising either the individual worker’s or the employers’ rights. The dangers of conflicting interests on either side of the employment relationship have grown sharply over the last few years, given the increased use of ICT at the workplace and at all stages in enterprises' activities. To what extent may a worker use ICT equipment for private reasons given that a general, absolute ban on any use of the internet for other than professional reasons does not appear realistic in an information/communication society?

EUROFOUND_UNK_0863	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 7 July 2003	 Raymond-Pierre Bodin, Director of the Foundation, 1948-2003 Dublin, 7 July 2003 It is with deep sadness that the Foundation announces that its esteemed Director, Raymond-Pierre Bodin, passed away suddenly at his home in Sandycove, Co. Dublin, at the weekend. Our thoughts and sympathy are with his wife Edwige and children. Raymond Pierre Bodin was born in France in 1948. A doctor in sociology, his full and brilliant career spanned the different worlds of civil service, university, private enterprise and, finally, a European Union organisation. His early career was at the Ministry of Labour. Then in 1974 he turned his talents to the academic life as professor of social psychology and the sociology of labour at the Pierre Mendès-France University in Grenoble. In 1989, he became managing director of Eurotec Manducher (Klöckner Group), then human resources director of Klöckner Automotive. In 1996 he was appointed senior vice-president of human resources at Rhône-Poulenc Rorer (now Aventis Pharma). His abiding passion for better living and working conditions for all citizens, as well as a deep interest in European-level affairs led him to seek the challenging post of Director of the Dublin-based European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, a post he took up in May 2000. During his three years at the Foundation, Raymond-Pierre Bodin devoted himself with energy and conviction to the task of developing the Foundation’s role in promoting the European social debate. He was committed to the idea that the Foundation had a vital role to play in achieving a better life and better work in Europe. He gained the respect of all who worked with him and served as an inspirational figurehead for the Foundation as it moved into the new millennium. While at the Foundation, Raymond-Pierre Bodin continued to chair the Agence Nationale pour l’Emploi (France), as well as serving as an expert at the International Labour Office. His colleagues mourn his sudden and untimely death and extend their deepest sympathy to his family and friends. Requiescat in pace.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0864	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 12 June 2003	 Public hearing on industrial restructuring, European Parliament, 17 June 2003: INDUSTRIAL RESTRUCTURING FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL GROWTH Choose your preferred language option: DE Compulsory layoffs, pay reductions, mergers and new employment practices are part of the traditional response to the fragile economic climate and uncertainties. In recent times, more imaginative approaches also look at options including training breaks, sabbaticals, job-sharing, remote working and reduced working hours as part of what is called ‘reflective restructuring’. Whatever the approach, restructuring is a modern day requirement for managing and anticipating change, simultaneously tackling issues of economic, social and environmental significance. Against this background, a high level public hearing on industrial restructuring is being coorganised by the Employment and Social Affairs Committee of the European Parliament and the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, on 17 June 2003. The event brings together policymakers, experts, enterprise and trade unions representatives, and regional actors to debate the anticipation and management of industrial change in the enlarged European Union. Two concrete restructuring cases will highlight innovative practices and approaches to tackling restructuring situations. The first case study is Swedish telecom Telia Sonera whose redeployment and re-education concept allowed for downsizing without redundancies, and the second is Italian steel company Falck and the Region Nord-Milano local partnership for job creation and new enterprise structures. The event will also hear Members of the European Parliament address European social partners and representatives of the European Commission on the matter. The event will take place at 15.00 on Tuesday 17 June 2003 in the European Parliament, Room PHS 3C50, followed by a press conference.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0866	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 26 May 2003	 USING SOCIAL DIALOGUE TO PREPARE THE ACCEDING COUNTRIES IN THE RUN-UP TO EMU Choose your preferred language option: DE Social partners and government representatives from Euro-zone and acceding countries will gather in Vienna, Austria, on 26-28 May, to produce national development plans aimed at aligning economic growth with high levels of employment and social protection in Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia. ‘When the current Euro-zone countries prepared for the Economic and Monetary Union, social dialogue played an important role in bridging differences,’ says Christian Welz, Research Manager at the Dublin-based European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, and coordinator of the ‘Promotion of social dialogue in Central and Eastern European candidate countries’ which is carried out in collaboration with the Swedish Work-Life and EU Enlargement initiative. ‘In this project, we want to transfer those experiences to the acceding countries preparing for EMU.’ Research from the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions shows, in addition to the practical experiences of producing national development plans for Estonia, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovenia in 2002, that industrial relations systems in the candidate countries remain in a fragile state, suffering from declining trade union membership, decentralised collective bargaining systems and assymetrical tripartite structures with strong governments and weak social partners. The development programmes established within the project framework in 2002 included tackling youth unemployment through social dialogue and improving social convergence with the social partners. ‘Each national programme includes an analysis of the country’s economic development in the perspective of the Maastricht convergence criteria,’ says Timo Kauppinen, research manager at the European Foundation. ‘The national reports primarily deal with the national systems of industrial relations and their potential, but also cover their capacity to support the Maastricht convergence process by means of social dialogue.’ Following the 2-day workshop, the economic development plans will be submitted to the National Ministries of Labour in the respective candidate countries as well as to national tripartite bodies in order to prepare for eventual implementation and mechanisms.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0867	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 15 May 2003	 New report: Industrial relations developments in Europe 2002 CHANGES TO THE EUROPEAN INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS LANDSCAPE Choose your preferred language option: DE A continued decline in trade union membership and increasing pressures following several major mergers of employer organisations across the European Union, resulted in significant changes to the structure of European social partner organisations during 2002. This is according to a new report by the Dublin-based European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. The changes come at a time when the social partners are implementing a European-wide social dialogue, replacing EU-directives as a prerequisite for developing industrial relations with independent ‘non-regulatory’ agreements which are concluded at EU-level and implemented directly at national level. The social partners’ landmark multiannual work programme combines their common objectives and guidelines at European level, with regular national status and progress reports. The first result of this new work method was a general European framework for teleworkers’ conditions of employment in July 2002. On the labour market level, job security remained a key concern for trade unions in many countries, as waves of enterprise restructuring and downsizing continued to sweep across Europe. Some countries, notably Spain, Greece, Italy and Finland, saw some innovative agreements to maintain job security. The gender pay gap remains wide however, averaging 20% across the EU and Norway despite efforts by Belgium and Finland to address the issue by establishing a legal framework for equal pay. The report is the result of a joint effort between the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions and the European Commission in the field of industrial relations and builds on the experience of the EIRO Annual Review, and the Commission’s reports on Industrial Relations in Europe, which it replaces. It offers a comparative overview of the most significant industrial relations developments in 2002 and provides a review of the year’s main activities in the European social dialogue and EU employment legislation and policy, and includes a chapter on migration.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0868	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 8 May 2003	 Joint EU Presidency Conference: 12-13 May 2003, Alexandroupolis, Greece QUALITY IS KEY FOR A COMPETITIVE ENLARGED EUROPE Choose your preferred language option: DE If Europe is to meet its target of creating the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy and greater social cohesion by 2010, a more stringent focus on the quality of the labour market as a whole - and more and better jobs in particular - is needed. In an effort to encourage European social policymakers to explore how quality can contribute to achieving better jobs in an enlarged European economy, and how quality can be promoted through strong partnerships (tripartite or bipartite), the Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working conditions is co-organising a two-day conference in Alexandroupolis, Greece, on 12-13 May 2003. The conference, Better work and life – towards an inclusive and competitive enlarged Union will take place in cooperation with the Greek Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. Focusing on better quality of work, employment and life the conference will use various experiences and practical examples revolving around employment status, work and non-work time management, and modernisation of work organisation. ‘Quality that affects the work and life of the EU citizens is an issue well embedded in the business culture and the challenge today is to introduce it to both the economic and social fields,’ says Raymond-Pierre Bodin, the Foundation's Director. Labour markets, employment relations, and working and living conditions in candidate countries differ significantly from the EU Member States and quality matters are important in their modernisation process in order to ensure a smooth accession to the EU and a normal functioning after accession.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0869	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 1 April 2003	 FOUNDATION WELCOMES NEW DEPUTY DIRECTOR Choose your preferred language option: DE Willy Buschak, former Confederal Secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC), takes up the reins as Deputy Director of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions on 1 April 2003. Willy Buschak succeeds Eric Verborgh, who retires from the Dublin-based EU Agency after 18 years. After studying history and philosophy at the Ruhr-Universität in Bochum, Germany, Willy Buschak started work as a research manager with the German Trade Union for Food, Beverages and Restaurant Workers. His early career involved research on trade union subjects for the Hans Böckler Foundation and the Institute for the History of the Labour Movement in Germany. In 1991, Willy Buschak started his career at the European Trade Union Confederation as Confederal Secretary, where his fields of responsibility included democratisation of the economy, health and safety at the workplace, the environment, research, consumer and industrial policy. Willy Buschak is no newcomer to the Foundation and its work. Over an eight-year period up to 2000, he played an important part in the Foundation's progress through his role as coordinator for the workers' group in the administrative board. He thus brings with him a deep knowledge and understanding of the Foundation's key areas of work. 'Enlargement is set to be a big challenge for the Foundation, as for all other EU bodies, but the Foundation is in a strong position to meet those challenges,' says Willy Buschak. 'My role will be to support the Director in building on the successes of the past as we move to tackle this new future.'

EUROFOUND_UNK_0870	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 23 April 2003	 New publication: the Foundation's Annual Report 2002 MAKING EUROPE A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE AND WORK Choose your preferred language option: DE The work of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the Dublin-based EU-agency, has significantly increased its role as a forum for constructive discussion and debate in the socio-economic field at European level by focusing on a smaller number of significant research projects and increased cross-disciplinary analysis of its findings. This is according to the Foundation's Annual Report 2002 which was published today. 'The Foundation's work has contributed more efficiently to the EU social policy agenda in 2002, in particular to equal opportunities for men and women, financial participation and temporary agency work,' says Raymond-Pierre Bodin, the Foundation's Director.'We still, however, see a strong need to link the Foundation's analysis of living conditions to both the changing nature of employment, work organisation, and working conditions and to the modernisation of social protection and social welfare services.' Striking the right balance between the need to create a welfare system that looks after the people of Europe and the ability to pay for it, formed the basis for discussions at the first Foundation Forum on 'Challenges for the European social model', which took place in Dublin in August 2002. The event gathered 14 ministers from the EU and candidate countries as well as high-level socio-economic policy actors and thinkers in Europe, and was the first of a series of events every second year contributing to the improvement of living and working conditions in Europe. In 2002, monitoring activities have been incorporated into each core area of the Foundation's work, marking a shift in the balance between monitoring activities and strategic research. Also, 2002 saw concerted efforts to consolidate and present Foundation research on specific topics in a user-friendly format, drawing on existing Foundation research and providing an overview of work on specific themes linked to the EU social policy agenda. Three Foundation papers have been presented to date, entitled: Quality of work and employment in Europe, Access to employment for vulnerable groups and Quality of women's work and employment. In 2003, Foundation papers under the themes of 'Managing diversity', 'Supporting social inclusion' and 'Examining the changing use of time' will be published. The new tool for monitoring and reporting on living conditions and quality of life throughout Europe was developed during 2002. The new survey, to be carried out in 2003, will focus on employment, economic resources, family life, community life, health and education. The relationships between these areas will be another important aspect. Access to, and quality of, social provisions such as health care will also be a key topic. This monitoring and reporting instrument is being progressively extended to the candidate countries.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0871	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 25 March 2003	 New publication: Towards a sustainable corporate social responsibility OPEN DIALOGUE IS A PREREQUISITE FOR SUCCESSFUL CSR Choose your preferred language option: DE Successful corporate social responsibility is the result of open dialogue involving all stakeholders and incorporating their different expectations, according to a new report from the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. The report also highlights the need to view CSR as a process, not a product, and recommends integrating the concept into the very core of companies' business models. The report looks at restructuring and subcontracting and the effects of corporate involvements in local community and economic regeneration, and the promotion of environmentally acceptable practices. It includes a series of EU company case studies, examining socially responsible practices in the fields of employment, local community and the environment. However, the report reveals that the inclusion of CSR on the agenda of in-house social dialogue remains limited. To effectively promote and apply CSR, the report identifies several possible approaches. Firstly, it suggests incorporating all stakeholders in a wide range of discussions in parallel to social dialogue, covering the growing number of topics under the CSR umbrella. Another approach would integrate CSR into the social dialogue – this risks, however, slowing down the collaborative process and alienating the company management’s drive and commitment. A third approach could include all stakeholders into the process – companies, social partners, and the local community – which would strengthen dialogue between all stakeholders. The report argues that a further factor in developing successful CSR is to harness the personal commitment of company leaders to the concept and to foster CSR among small and medium-sized companies, who often lack the necessary financial and human resources.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0872	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 10 January 2003	" Third Foundation Paper: Quality of Women's Work and Employment - Tools for Change MORE WOMEN AT WORK, BUT STILL PAID LESS Women have benefited from the majority of the new jobs created over the period 1997-2001, increasing the employment rate for women from 50.6% to 54.9%, according to the European Commission. This growth has made the ambitious Lisbon European Council goal of 60% female employment rate by 2010 appear achievable. Women have also made important in-roads into the higher status professional and managerial positions. Despite these advances, women continue to be paid less for doing the same or similar work as men. 'Despite an increasing rate of employment for women over the past decade, gender participation and pay gaps remain a persistent feature of the European labour market,' says Raymond-Pierre Bodin, Director of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in Dublin. 'Women are still under-represented in some jobs and over-represented in others relative to their percentage share of total employment. Gender differences are most evident in the ""second shift"" of household work.' The third Foundation paper, Quality of Women's Work and Employment: Tools for Change, offers an analysis of the quality of women labour market participation in the EU. Based largely on existing Foundation research, the Foundation paper examines the progress made towards a better quality of working life for women and describes some tools and strategies which may serve to tackle persistent difficulties in this area.

The report also shows average collectively agreed weekly working hours throughout the EU and Norway remain stable at around 38.2 hours, with no major reduction in working time over the last four years. However, working time reduction is still a central demand for the trade union movement according to the new report. 'Collective bargaining plays a key role in determining the duration of working time in all countries considered in the report,' says Raymond-Pierre Bodin, the Foundation's Director. 'But the nature of this role differs widely between countries, with different bargaining levels (intersectoral, sectoral, or company levels) playing different parts, and bargaining coverage varying between 70% to 100%.' The report also provides figures on collectively agreed weekly work hours in the chemical, retail and civil service sectors.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0874	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 25 February 2003	" New publication: Preventing violence and harassment in the workplace VIOLENCE AND HARASSMENT AT WORK IS ON THE INCREASE Choose your preferred language option: DE About 10% of the EU's working population has experienced physical or psychological harassment in their place of work. A similar percentage report themselves to be aware of the existence of physical violence in their place of work, according to a new report by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the Dublin-based EU Agency. The report also highlights the important financial benefits to companies of reducing violence and harassment in the workplace and reveals the problem to be on the increase throughout all European Union Member States. 'Both men and women experience violence at work, but women remain more vulnerable than men, with women often concentrated in ""high-risk"" jobs such as nursing, social work and teaching,' says Raymond-Pierre Bodin, the Foundation's Director. 'Women are also most often victims of intimidation and psychological abuse while men are more frequently exposed to physical violence and assault.' The report shows that sexual harassment at work, particularly against women, is commonplace in all European countries, but often goes unreported due to fear of being ostracised, job loss and other factors. Although faced with a persistent lack of data on this controversial issue, the report shows that worker productivity can be reduced by at least 2% as a result of psychological violence alone. Results also highlight the significant negative financial and productivity implications of violence and harassment at work. These are reflected in higher absenteeism rates, ill health and early retirement, high staff turnover and increased insurance premiums. Both physical and psychological violence also has serious implications for health and well-being, causing stress disorders and suicidal tendencies. Overall cost estimates predict considerable financial gains for employers in reducing workplace violence. The report is available on www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/EF02109.htm.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0875	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 14 March 2003	 New report: Annual update on pay developments - 2002 END TO UPWARD TREND IN AGREED PAY INCREASES Choose your preferred language option: DE Average nominal pay increases declined in 2002 for the first time in three years. This 0.3 per cent downturn to only a 3.5 per cent rise last year, marks an end to the upward trend in pay increases since 1999 and is a direct result of calls for wage moderation at EU and national levels according to a new report from the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. 'The average increase fell from 2001 to 2002 in eight countries, with pay moderation most evident in Ireland, Portugal, Finland, the Netherlands and the UK,' says Raymond-Pierre Bodin, Director of the Foundation. 'However, the rate of increase rose in five countries, most notably Greece and Germany, and remained stable in two, Sweden and Denmark.' When the average 2002 real pay increase was adjusted for inflation, it was on average lower than in 2001, falling to 0.7% in 2002 in the EU Member States, down from 0.8%. However, the average nominal agreed increase in the three candidate countries covered by the report (Hungary, Slovakia and Poland) was far above the EU and Norway average at over 6% in 2002. Over the five-year period 1998-2002, the EU Member States and Norway can be divided into: Low nominal pay-increase countries (those where pay increases have averaged 2%-3%): Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany and Italy, Medium nominal pay-increase countries (those where pay increases have averaged 3%-4%): Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the UK, and High nominal pay-increase countries (those where pay increases have averaged over 4%): Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg and Norway.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0876	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 8 January 2003	" Industrial relations in the EU, Japan and USA: Levels of collective bargaining coverage remain highest in the European Union The coverage of collective bargaining is on average almost five times higher in the European Union than in the USA and four times higher than in Japan, according to recent figures released by the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). 'The annual overview ""Industrial relations in the EU, Japan and USA"" shows that, on average, around 80% of the workforce in the current EU Member States is covered by collective bargaining, ie agreements in which workers - partially or fully - have their pay and conditions set,' says Raymond Pierre Bodin, Director of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. 'At the one extreme, almost 98% of private sector workers in Austria are covered by sectoral agreements, while the United Kingdom is at the other end, at 39%. Still, taking into account the differences between union and non-union sectors, European workers' pay and conditions are agreed collectively to a much greater extent than in Japan and the USA.' The overview shows that collective bargaining is mainly done at the intersectoral level in Belgium, Finland and Ireland, while bargaining at the sectoral level is most important in Austria, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. In France and the United Kingdom, bargaining is predominantly carried out at company level. Only in Denmark and Luxembourg is there no predominant bargaining level. The report provides a comparative overview of developments in industrial relations across the EU Member States, Japan and USA, examining the key issues covered by collective bargaining - pay, gender pay inequality, working time, leave, training and skills development - as well as legislative developments, the organisation and role of the social partners, industrial action, company restructuring, and new forms of work.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0877	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 13 December 2004	 OUTSOURCING OF ICT AND RELATED SERVICES IN THE EU: EU jobs not at risk from outsourcing of ICT services Europe is ‘not losing jobs’ in the information and communication technologies services sector (ICT) due to outsourcing, according to the Foundation’s European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) in its new report Outsourcing of ICT and related services in the EU. The report shows that employment in other business services is growing consistently across all the countries studied and, in some cases, such as the Czech Republic, this growth is quite spectacular. With the single exception of Denmark, any decline in computer and related employment was more than compensated, numerically speaking, by growth in another business services sector. The strongest growth has taken place in precisely those countries where employment levels in these sectors are at their lowest. In other words, whilst the new Member States may be behind the rest of Europe in the proportion of their economies devoted to ICT services, they are catching up fast. The lowest growth rates are, by and large, in the most developed economies. The reasons for this continuing growth in ICT service employment in Europe are several. First, it is a reflection of economic and linguistic diversity, giving a large range of alternative sites for offshore outsourcing within the EU. Second, it reflects the fact that the EU is a recipient of outsourced employment from other parts of the world, notably the US. Finally, it highlights the increasing propensity to outsource ICT and ICT-enabled functions, resulting in a shift to these sectors from other parts of the economy, including the public sector. The report pieces together, impartially, the available evidence on outsourcing of ICT and related services in the European Union with the goal of informing the EU policymaking process. It draws on a body of market research and anecdotal data, in the absence of reliable data, statistics or research, which has been carried out over the past two decades on offshore information processing, trans-border teleworking, and new global division of labour in information services. Three major trends have been identified: Outsourcing of ICT services is moving from an experimental to a consolidation phase There is continuing growth in the importance of intermediaries The extension of offshore outsourcing into increasingly skilled fields.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0878	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 4 November 2004	 Right work-life balance is a win-win situation for all Better work-life balance leads to reduced stress for workers and increased productivity. It is not just an issue of importance to the individual, it is also of strategic importance to our economy. Indeed, a future shortage of workers and skills is likely to force our economy to adopt successful work-life balance policies, warned Ireland's Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern in his keynote speech on the opening day of the Foundation Forum 2004, held in Dublin on 3-4 November 2004. Acting Director of the Foundation, Willy Buschak, called for fresh thinking and new ideas to deal with what he called ‘obstacles to our attempts to meet the Lisbon targets’. Particular challenges include the ageing of the EU workforce, the need to develop a knowledge-based society and to improve productivity. ‘Do we really need to divide work and life?’ asked Mr Vlado Dimovski, Minister of Labour, Family, and Social Affairs of the Republic of Slovenia. If in the industrial age work and life was divided, in the new knowledge economy ‘life is becoming work and work is becoming life’. Life is changing radically, with different family types and the increased participation of women in the workforce. While there was general agreement that we will probably need to work longer in the future - we also need to work smarter. Established as a platform for top-level debate, the first Forum held in 2002 in Dublin, it gathers international policymakers, government leaders, social partners, researchers and other high-level actors to exchange experiences. The Foundation Forum is a biennial event supported by the Irish government. Reports from parallel debates on specific work-life issues debated at the Foundation Forum yesterday are now online (PDF, 2.65MB).

EUROFOUND_UNK_0879	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 30 November 2004	 Better work-life balance will improve Europe’s productivity Choose your preferred language option: DE FR Achieving better work-life balance would contribute to Europe’s competitive advantage, reducing workers’ stress levels at the same time as increasing overall industrial output and productivity, argues the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. Over the past decade, work intensity has risen sharply and shows no signs of slowing. Most people work shorter hours but work faster, giving rise to the situation where over half Europe’s workers are working at high speed and to tight deadlines during at least one quarter of their working time. Consequently, one in three European workers complains of backache related to their job. Nearly one in two reports working in a painful/tiring position. When asked, European workers say they would like to see governments and social partners provide them with more flexible working time arrangements. ‘There is significant evidence that work-life balance policies can have major positive benefits for companies in terms of enhancing the productivity and competitiveness, and for workers in terms of improving the quality of work and access to training and competence development,’ argues Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s Acting Director. Foundation research suggests that policymakers should improve or create new time and income options to help redistribute working time over the life course to allow for improved conditions of work, enhanced private life opportunities, and better access to training or volunteering. If the retirement age is raised, thus prolonging working life, then policymakers should ensure that, in exchange, more paid leave is accessible during the ‘stress’ phases of life. New social security structures are essential for the individual to be able to exploit a new organisation of time over working life. To promote active ageing, the Foundation argues that trade unions should include recruitment and training measures which offset the disadvantages experienced by older workers. Age-awareness training could be introduced for human resource personnel, managers and other key staff, thus supporting an environment which places a high value on older workers. - More information on work-life balance - Background note Press conference Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s Acting Director, will hold a press conference on the Foundation’s recent research in working time issues, active ageing and work-life balance, together with MEP Pronsias de Rossa at 14.00 on Tuesday 30 November 2004 in the European Parliament 0A50.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0880	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 8 November 2004	More home-owners in Slovakia than in the rest of EU Choose your preferred language option: SK (PDF, 200 KB) To own your house outright without a mortgage is more common in Slovakia than in the new Member States and the former EU15, according to the first results of the new European Quality of Life Survey carried out by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. Slovaks also rate the quality of housing, including adequate heating and quality of local environment, higher than the average in the new Member States. Slovaks regard their standard of health at levels similar to those in the former EU15 countries and much better than in other new Member States. However, citizens of Slovakia rate the quality of the public health and social care systems lowest of all EU28 countries. Slovaks are also among the least optimistic about the future in Europe. The Foundation’s research on quality of life in Europe, based on 26,000 face-to-face interviews across 28 European countries, sheds light on the living conditions, subjective well-being and individuals’ perceptions of their society. The results of this European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) provide a unique portrait of quality of life in the enlarged Europe. ‘Although differences in living conditions are considerable, values and priorities determining quality of life are not very different across the European Union – there is no underlying reason for a division between us and them, the west and the east,’ says Willy Buschak, Acting Director of the Foundation. ‘However, in order to foster cohesion in a larger and more diversified European Union and to close the gaps in unequal economic development and living standards, policymakers and civil society actors need first of all to know not only how people live, but also how they perceive their situation and how individual quality of life is assessed. We believe our report can provide this knowledge.’ More than one fifth (21%) of people in Slovakia report having participated in a training course during the previous 12 months - higher than the average in the new Member States (19%) and on a par with the EU15 (21%). One out of five Slovaks (19%), however, is afraid of losing their job within six months, compared with an average of 17% in the new Member States and 8% in the former EU15 countries. The findings of this survey will be presented at an International Seminar in Hotel Kyjev in Bratislava at 14.30 on Tuesday 9 November 2004.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0881	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 25 October 2004	Cypriots most optimistic about the future Choose your preferred language option: EL (PDF, 146 KB) People in Cyprus are most optimistic about the future and rate their overall life satisfaction higher than rest of the new Member States’ and are on a par with the former EU15, according to the first results of the new European Quality of Life Survey carried out by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. The levels of income and deprivation, and peoples’ perception of housing conditions, health and social services, place the Republic of Cyprus, together with Malta and Slovenia, closer to the quality of life standards in the former EU15 than in the new Member States. The survey reveals that the people in Cyprus are particularly satisfied with their health. However, while assessment of the quality of the public health and social care systems is higher in Cyprus than in the new Member States, it is still somewhat below the EU15 average. One third of Cypriots (33%) say they cannot afford a week’s annual holiday, and 16% report having a hard time making ends meet. The Foundation’s research on quality of life in Europe, based on 26,000 face-to-face interviews across 28 European countries, sheds light on the living conditions, subjective well-being and individuals’ perceptions of their society.

Also, four-fifths of the population (85%) report using the Internet, which is more than three times as high as the average in the new Member States (26%) and close to double the levels in the former EU15 (46%). Some 12% of the Cypriots report a fear of loosing their job within six months, compared with an average of 17% in the new Member States and 8% in the former EU15 countries.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0882	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 8 October 2004	 Occupational pension systems and industrial relations in Europe: State pensions remain major source of revenue despite trend towards individualisation of pension arrangements Traditional state pension systems are likely to remain the primary source of income for retired people in the future but Europe’s social partners are pushing for better occupational and individual pension arrangements in the light of future demographic trends, according to the latest comparative study from the Foundation’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). ‘The report shows that Europe’s social partners recognise that traditional state pension systems will in the future carry the bulk of pension obligations,’ says Willy Buschak, acting Director of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the Dublin-based EU-agency. ‘However, there is a clear trend among social partners to press for better supplementary state or occupational pension and more individual arrangements, essentially shifting the risk away from the employer to the employees with regards to pensions. This reflects a trend towards the individualisation of pension arrangements.’ Almost all European countries have recently reformed or started to reform their pension systems with a view to ensuring the adequacy and sustainability of pensions in the future. Recent demographic developments, such as falling birth rates, an overall longer life expectancy and the ageing of the ‘baby boom’ generation, has put increasing pressure on the sustainability of current pension systems. Occupational pensions and industrial relations, the recent comparative study from the Foundation’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO), examines the industrial relations aspects of recent pensions developments in 18 countries. The report focuses mainly on occupational pensions, an area where the social partners often play a significant or even dominant role. The report also confirms that in many countries there has been a reversal of the trend of lowering the average retirement age and many early retirement schemes are being abolished or at least tightened up across Europe.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0883	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 12 October 2004	 THE EUROPEAN QUALITY OF LIFE SURVEY (EQLS): Czechs rate health as major factor in high life satisfaction levels Choose your preferred language option: CS (PDF, 137 KB) Czechs rate their overall life satisfaction higher than average in the new Member States, according to the first results of the new European Quality of Life Survey carried out by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the Dublin-based EU-Agency. The levels of income and deprivation, and the perception of housing conditions and health status place the Czech Republic, together with Malta, Cyprus and Slovenia, closer to the quality of life standards in the former EU15 than in the new Member States. The survey reveals that less than half of the Czechs (41%) own their house without a mortgage, which is similar to levels in the former EU15 countries (38%) but much lower than in the other new Member State countries (66%). Of all people in the new Member States, Czechs complain the least about housing quality and they have the highest rates of municipal housing. However, the Czech levels of overall life satisfaction are still close to the lowest in the former EU15 countries. They are particularly low for people on low income and the unemployed. The Foundation’s research on quality of life in Europe, based on 26,000 face-to-face interviews across 28 European countries, sheds light on the living conditions, subjective well-being and individuals’ perceptions of their society. The results of this European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) provide a unique portrait of quality of life in the enlarged Europe. ‘In order to foster cohesion in a larger and more diversified European Union, policymakers and civil society actors need first of all to know not only how people live, but also how they perceive their situation and how individual quality of life is assessed,’ says Willy Buschak, acting Director of the Foundation. ‘Our survey provides a framework for measuring perceptions of well-being using a multi-dimensional approach covering a number of domains, ranging from economic resources, health and health care, employment and working conditions, to community life and social participation, and housing.’ One fifth (20%) of the Czechs report to have participated in job training during the previous 12 months, which is on par with the average in the new Member States (19%) and in the former EU15 countries (21%). Also, almost one third (32%) report regularly using the Internet at work, which is above the average for the new Member States (26%) but below the levels of use in the former EU15 (46%). Some 16% of the Czechs report a fear of loosing their job within six months, which is below the average of the new Member States (17%) but above the average levels in the former EU15 countries (8%).

EUROFOUND_UNK_0884	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 7 October 2004	 European conference on recent developments in European industrial relations, The Hague, the Netherlands, 7-8 October 2004: Stable industrial relations in Europe despite differences Industrial relations in the European Union are stabilising despite large difference between the structure and organisation of the social partners and governments in the former EU-15 and the new Member States, according to the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. While the legal basis for industrial relations has been unified in all EU-25 countries with the process of enlargement, mediation is still the dominant conflict resolution mechanism in the new Member States. characterised by heterogeneous and fragmented trade union and employer organisations, limited sectoral collective bargaining and a widespread absence of works councils. 'Social dialogue and tripartite consultation have proven crucial tools for industrial peace in the former EU15 countries, while still ensuring economic growth in harmony with employment and social protection,' says Willy Buschak, the Foundation's acting Director. 'The Foundation has recently explored new ways of resolving industrial conflicts involving the social partners and governments in the new EU Member States in an effort to transfer know-how and experiences from the former EU15 countries.’ In providing a snapshot of the current European industrial relations landscape, Foundation research has found the levels of trade union membership across the new enlarged European Union are still low (average 25%, ranging from 15-40%) but there are signs that this is about to increase. When comparing the levels of collective bargaining coverage, the levels remain high, covering almost four out of every five workers. The gender pay gap remains wide however, averaging 20% across the EU and Norway despite efforts by Belgium and Finland to address the issue by establishing a legal framework for equal pay. When comparing EU with Japan and USA, trade union membership levels are almost equally low in all three blocks. However, the level of collective bargaining is on average almost four times higher in the European Union than in the USA and three times higher than in Japan. 'This is the single most striking difference between industrial relations in the EU on the one hand, and in the USA and Japan on the other,' says Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s Acting Director.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0885	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 15 September 2004	 Comparative data on working conditions and working time developments in Europe: Long working hours undermine good working conditions The average working week for all workers in the new EU Member States is 44.4 hours, against 38.2 hours in the former EU15, according to research carried out by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. Average weekly working hours remain longest (40 hours) in Hungary, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Slovenia and Malta, and shortest in France (35), the Netherlands (37) and Denmark (37). The average collectively agreed normal weekly hours in the UK is 37.2. Over the period 1999-2003, the average agreed normal weekly hours for the former EU15 and Norway has fallen from 38.6 to 38.0 hours. In the United Kingdom, the average agreed normal weekly hours have fallen by around one hour (2.5%-3%) over the same period. However, over the past decade, work intensity has risen sharply and it shows no signs of slowing down. It is true that most people work shorter hours but they work faster, giving rise to the situation where over half the workers in Europe are working at high speed and to tight deadlines during at least one quarter of their working time. One in three European workers complains of backache related to their job. Nearly one in two report working in a painful/tiring position. When asked, European workers say they would like more flexible working time arrangements than at present and would like to see this provided for by governments and social partners. ‘European workers are producing more within a shorter time frame, due to the steady rise in levels of work intensity, stress and demand,’ says Willy Buschak, acting Director of the European Foundation. ‘Our research shows that a new organisation of working time over the entire life course is necessary, if Europe is to meet the challenges of an ageing society and of increased competition in the global market.’ For more comparative information on working conditions and working time issues in the EU25 and two candidate countries, consult the three sources below: Third European Working Conditions survey Survey on working conditions in the acceding and candidate countries The European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO): working time developments For further information, contact Måns Mårtensson, Press Officer, on telephone +353-1-204 3124 or mobile +353-876-593 507.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0886	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 12 July 2004	 The Foundation’s Administrative Board approves the new four-year work programme 2005-2008 Supporting Europe in realising the Lisbon objectives More and better employment, work-life balance, industrial relations and partnership, and social cohesion are the four key themes identified as priority areas for the Foundation’s work over the next four years, as outlined in the new four-year work programme which was approved by the Foundation’s Administrative Board on 9 July last. The programme underlines the importance of a comprehensive and integrated approach to these policy issues, underpinned by an effective communication strategy with the Foundation’s key audiences across Europe. The Foundation’s detailed work programme is approved on an annual basis by the Foundation’s Administrative Board. ‘The drive to make Europe the most competitive, knowledge-based economy in the world, to increase employment rates and improve the quality of employment, to stimulate innovation and entrepreneurship, while promoting social cohesion and inclusion – in short, realising the objectives of the Lisbon strategy – is the leitmotif of the programme,’ says Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s acting Director. ‘This is the eighth four-year programme of the Foundation and we are very happy to have reached consensus with our new, enlarged Administrative Board, now including representatives from all 25 EU Member States.’ The Foundation’s four-year programme looks ahead to the opportunities and challenges facing the new European Union. The Foundation aims to channel knowledge from its monitoring activities and other research into understanding the challenges, supporting change in society and the economy, and providing its stakeholders with the information necessary for managing change.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0887	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 10 September 2004	 7th European Congress of the International Industrial Relations Association (IIRA): In pursuit of the Lisbon objectives Choose your preferred language option: DE FR European workers are producing more within a shorter time frame, due to the steady rise in levels of work intensity, stress and demand over the past decade, according to research from the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the Dublin-based EU agency. As a consequence of this gradual deterioration of working conditions, work-related health problems - such as backache, headaches and overall fatigue – are reported to be on the increase. Efforts to raise overall employment rates and improve the quality of employment, to stimulate innovation and entrepreneurship, while at the same time promoting social cohesion and inclusion – in short, realising the objectives of the Lisbon agenda – are being thwarted by lack of mobilisation of resources, vision and ambition. Europe’s competitiveness is being hampered by lack of investment in vocational training: in many EU Member States, training levels are the same today as they were ten years ago. ‘There is an urgent need to move forward on all fronts – employment, competitiveness, good quality living and working conditions – at the same time,’ says Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s acting Director, ‘if we are to realise the objectives of the Lisbon strategy.’ In order to meet the challenges and objectives of the Lisbon strategy, the Foundation will focus its work over the next four years around four key priority themes: more and better employment, work–life balance, industrial relations and partnership, and social cohesion. The ambition of the new four-year programme 2005-8, the eighth since the Foundation’s inception in 1975, is to continue to provide its stakeholders and the general public with an extensive knowledge base of comparative data on industrial relations, working conditions and related aspects of living conditions. More importantly, the aim is to channel knowledge from the Foundation’s monitoring activities and other research into understanding the challenges, supporting change in society and the economy, and providing its stakeholders with the information necessary for managing change.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0888	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 30 August 2004	 Recent trends in pension arrangements shift the risk away from the employer to the employees Traditional state pension systems are likely to remain the primary source of income for retired people in the future, according to the latest comparative study from the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). But Europe’s social partners are pushing for better occupational and individual pension arrangements in the light of future demographic trends. Falling birth rates, an overall longer life expectancy and the ageing of the ‘baby boom’ generation have put increasing pressure on the sustainability of current pension systems. As a response, almost all European countries have recently reformed or started to reform their pension systems with a view to ensuring the adequacy in the future. As a consequence, many countries have seen a reversal of the trend of lowering the average retirement age and many early retirement schemes are being abolished or at least tightened up. Occupational pensions and industrial relations, the recent comparative study from the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO), examines the industrial relations aspects of recent pensions developments in 18 countries. The report focuses mainly on occupational pensions, an area where the social partners often play a significant or even dominant role. ‘The report shows that Europe’s social partners recognise that traditional state pension systems will in the future carry the bulk of pension obligations,’ says Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s acting Director. ‘However, two significant trends can be observed: one is the tendency to foster the development of occupational pensions. Its relative importance, however, depends on the extent of collective bargaining and ‘maturity’ of industrial relation systems in the country. The second is growing number of individual arrangements, in which defined-benefit systems, for instance, are likely to be replaced by schemes based on defined contributions.’ This trend of individualisation of pension arrangements could have adverse effects on certain categories of workers. The report shows that there are large differences in pension coverage among different groups of workers. Women, part-timers and unskilled workers are underrepresented in most occupational schemes, as well as the self-employed and workers in various other types of non-standard employment. The report is available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/2004/04/study/index.html.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0889	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 1 July 2004	 THE EUROPEAN QUALITY OF LIFE SURVEY (EQLS): Germans rate health and social services among highest in Europe Choose your preferred language option: DE German citizens rank the quality of their health services and social services higher than the EU average. People in Germany also rank the quality of local environment highly. Only 5% of respondents in Germany complain about noise, air pollution, lack of access to recreational or green areas and water quality in the immediate neighbourhood, which compares to 19% of people across the former EU15. Germans are, however, less optimistic about the future than other citizens in the former EU15, the new Member States and the three candidate countries, according to a survey on quality of life in the enlarged Europe, conducted by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. People in Germany rank overall life satisfaction and happiness on a par with the average EU15. The Foundation’s research on quality of life in Europe, based on 26,000 face-to-face interviews across 28 European countries, sheds light on the living conditions, subjective well-being and individuals’ perceptions of their society. The results of this European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) provide a unique portrait of quality of life in the enlarged Europe. ‘In order to foster cohesion in a larger and more diversified European Union, policymakers and civil society actors need first of all to know not only how people live, but also how they perceive their situation: how individual quality of life is measured,’ says Willy Buschak, acting Director of the Foundation. ‘Our survey provides a framework for measuring perceptions of well-being using a multi-dimensional approach covering a number of domains, ranging from economic resources, health and health care, employment and working conditions, to community life and social participation, and housing.’ Improving health status a crucial task in the new Member States Being in good health is an indispensable precondition for enjoying a high quality of life. In the new Member States and the candidate countries, the self-rated health status is on average worse than in the EU15. Compared to the latter, poor health status is reported 2.5 times more often by the citizens living in the new Member States, and two times more in the candidate countries, respectively. About one third of the population in the new Member States report having a long-standing illness, compared to one fifth in the former EU15. People living in post-communist countries report health problems more frequently than those living in Cyprus, Malta or Turkey. These findings for individual health correspond with widespread dissatisfaction with the quality of the health services and with reported difficulties in access to medical care in post-communist countries. NMS citizens less satisfied with quality of life, but equally optimistic The report found that subjective well-being is lower in the new Member States than in the former EU15, confirming gaps found in objective living conditions, especially economic resources and living standards, working conditions and health. In most EU15 countries, the least satisfied groups are still more satisfied than the most satisfied groups in the new Member States and the candidate countries. Mainly, but not solely, this reflects the huge difference in living standards between these two groups of countries. Material living conditions are of paramount importance for citizens’ subjective well-being, but aspects of ‘loving’ and ‘being’ also impact on how satisfied people are with their lives. More house owners in the new Member States but worse housing conditions One in five households in the new Member States and one in three in the candidate countries lack an indoor flushing toilet or have housing problems such as rot in windows, damp and leaks, the survey reveals. Fewer than 10% of households in the former EU15 face such problems. The housing conditions confirm the general picture of lower living standards in the new Member States and three candidate countries. By and large, living space is smaller, homes are less comfortable, and the neighbourhood less secure. However, home ownership is much more common in the new Member States and the candidate countries. Nearly 75% live in their own dwelling compared to 60% in the EU15. Strong family ties compensate for economic strain and weak institutions In all 28 countries, families and friends are shown to be a crucial factor in providing social integration and support. In both groups of countries, a huge majority of the population – around 80-95% – can count on help from relatives, friends or neighbours when personal problems arise; and in all countries, people rely primarily on family members. In general, support from family members is found to be more important in the new Member States and the candidate countries than in the EU15. Strong family ties in the new Member States and the candidate countries are also indicated by a higher frequency of contacts with other family members. Here, around 85% have frequent contact with parents or children, compared to 72% in the EU15. More information is available. See also background note.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0890	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 29 June 2004	 THE EUROPEAN QUALITY OF LIFE SURVEY (EQLS): Higher than average life satisfaction in Poland Choose your preferred language option: PL (PDF, 200KB) People in Poland experience on average a greater difficulty in making ends meet than people in the other nine new EU Member States (NMS), according to a survey on quality of life in the enlarged Europe, conducted by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. 64% of Polish people say their total monthly income is not sufficient to cover even the basic costs of living, against an average of 61% in all new Member States. Some 82% of people in Lithuania and 21% in Malta report the same problems. Only 29% of people in the former EU15 express similar difficulties. However, Polish people express an overall life satisfaction that is higher than the NMS average. Optimism about the future among Polish people is also close to the NMS average. The Foundation’s research on quality of life in Europe, based on 26,000 face-to-face interviews across 28 European countries, sheds light on the living conditions, subjective well-being and individuals’ perceptions of their society.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0891	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 13 May 2004	 EU Presidency conference ‘Families, Change and Social Policy in Europe’ in Dublin, 13-14 May 2004: The family remains a cornerstone of European societies Choose your preferred language option:DE FR Solidarity between generations is much more common than reflected in the public debate on the ‘war between the generations’. This is revealed in two recent surveys on the quality of life and family issues in the enlarged EU of 25 countries by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the Dublin-based EU-Agency. Some 85% of the people in the new EU Member States and the former EU-15 claim that strong generational conflicts do not exist. In the former EU 15 nearly half of the citizens instead stress racial and ethnic tensions as the most important generational cleavages, whereas more than half of the population in the new EU Member States identify strong tensions between rich and poor as the main dividing line in society. With increasing life expectancy and declining fertility rates, there is a growing gap between the number of elderly people who need care and the people providing it. Currently around 25% of people in the new EU Member States are involved in some kind of regular yet informal care of others, with around 21% of people in the former EU15. The reports examine family support and care within the family system, and more importantly, how people want to finance such care: 80% of people in the new EU Member States advocate extended family care in the future, with a corresponding figure of only 59% in the EU15. People in the new EU Member States are willing to foot the care bill for the elderly, while people in the former EU15 favour shifting the burden to the taxpayer. Reducing unemployment is seen as the highest priority to support families in six of the 15 former EU15 countries. This is followed by flexible working hours and childcare. In the new EU Member States, the emphasis is much more on child allowance and the level of replacement income during parental leave, i.e. on measures covering costs related to rearing children. ‘With a steady decline in fertility over the past three decades, there is a need to put family policies back on the agendas in many EU Member States and take concerted action to increase birth rates. Europe’s population growth is currently 40% lower than the United States,’ says Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s Acting Director. The reports show that accession of the 10 new EU Member States does not change Europe’s decreasing fertility rates. Only Malta (1.9) and Cyprus (1.83) have fertility rates higher than the EU 25 average (1.46), and the other eight new EU Member States all fall below. The average level in the former EU15 is 1.47 children per family. The report forms part of the Foundation’s series on quality of life in Europe, including the three candidate countries, Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey. Conference paper ‘Family life in Europe – Results of recent surveys on Quality of Life in Europe’ by Hubert Krieger, Research Manager, is now available and can also be accessed from the Irish EU Presidency website.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0892	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 16 June 2004	 12th European Social Services Conference ‘Delivering quality and access to social care and health in an enlarged Europe’, Dublin, 16-18 June 2004: Need to boost confidence in quality of health and social services across Europe The Irish rank the quality of their health and social services below the European average, according to the European Quality of Life (EQLS) survey carried out by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. Austrians, Finns and Belgians rate the quality of their respective health and social services the highest in Europe. Together with Portugal, Greece and Italy, Ireland is below the mean score for all countries in the 28-country EQLS-survey. People in Bulgaria, Slovakia and Turkey rank the quality of their health and social services the lowest. The promotion of equity and accessibility of health and care systems has become a key element in the debate on social protection in Europe. To provide European policymakers with a snapshot of the current social situation in the enlarged European Union, as well as information and analysis on how people perceive access and quality of health and social services, the Foundation launched a survey in spring 2003 on the quality of life in 28 countries. The survey reveals that a great deal needs to be done to increase confidence of citizens in the quality of their health and social services. There was also some indication of services failing to reach those in particular need, such as unemployed people. ‘Social inequalities in health, income, education and employment, are found in all EU15 Member States, and are emerging as an important feature of the health situation in the acceding and candidate countries,’ says Robert Anderson, research coordinator at the Foundation. ‘Clearly, health policies and systems alone can not address these inequalities but the health and social services have an important role to play.’ The survey also revealed that there are no marked general differences by gender in assessments of health or social services. This might be considered surprising as women both report more ill-health and are likely to be greater users of health and social services in their role as carers of children and older people.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0893	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 29 April 2004	 THE EIRO ANNUAL UPDATE ON PAY 2003: Moderate pay increases across Europe Choose your preferred language option: DE FR Average collectively agreed nominal wage increases across the EU and Norway fell by 0.4% in 2003, from 3.5% in 2002 to 3.1% in 2003. Taking account of lower inflation, average real income rose by 0.2% from 2002 to 2003, according to the annual update on pay from the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). In the 10 acceding countries, however, the average nominal pay increases rose to 8.7% in 2003, up from 8.1% in 2002, while on average real pay increased by 1.1%, from 2.8% in 2002 to 3.9% in 2003. ‘The EU’s broad economic guidelines on pay, which suggest that increases in nominal wages should be consistent with price stability and that increases in real wages should not exceed growth in labour productivity, were observed in most EU Member States,’ says Willy Buschak, Acting Director of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. ‘The results of the comparative survey suggest a definite trend towards wage moderation across Europe.’ While two out of three workers (72%) in the EU Member States have their pay and working conditions set by collective agreements, bargaining coverage in the acceding countries is generally lower, averaging about four out of every ten workers. In the enlarged Europe of 25 countries, 67% of the workforce will be covered by collective bargaining, when weighing the figures with the relative size of each country’s workforce. The report also offers in-depth analysis of collective agreements on pay in sectors selected to represent manufacturing industry (metalworking), services (banking), and the public sector (local government).

Pay is arguably the area in which industrial relations and collective bargaining has the most direct effect on broader economic developments, influencing inflation, unemployment, etc. The EU's 2003-5 broad guidelines for the economic policies of the Member States and the Community, adopted by Council in June 2003, state that the maintenance of sound macroeconomic conditions depends on wage developments (as well as on the policies pursued by central banks and governments). Wage developments should contribute to stable macroeconomic conditions and to an 'employment-friendly' policy mix. Member States should promote the right framework conditions for wage negotiations among the social partners. It is regarded as important to ensure that nominal wage increases are consistent with price stability and productivity gains. In particular, labour cost developments should remain moderate in the context of a possible cyclical recovery in productivity or temporary increases in inflation. This would allow companies to increase job-creating investment. Member states should 'foster the macroeconomic dialogue in a context of productivity-oriented wage policies'. The guidelines also stress a perceived need to allow wages better to reflect productivity, taking into account productivity differences in labour market conditions. Disclaimer EIRO does not attempt to produce a fully scientific and comparable set of pay comparisons, given that EIRO is not a statistical service and that pay is an area where meaningful international comparisons are especially difficult. Different national systems of pay formation, industrial relations, taxation and social security, and the divergent ways in which pay-related statistics are collected and presented, mean that comparisons between countries are hard to draw. Nevertheless, given the key importance of pay, EIRO provide these general indications of recent developments while pointing out the problems, caveats and qualifications. The figures provided should be treated with caution, and the various notes and explanations read with care.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0895	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 31 May 2004	 RURAL DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE, WESTPORT, CO. MAYO, IRELAND, 31 MAY - 1 JUNE 2004: HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE IN RURAL EUROPE People in Ireland are more optimistic about the future than the average European in both rural and urban areas, according to research by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the Dublin-based EU agency. People in the Irish countryside consider their local community safer at night in contrast to people in urban areas. However, a greater number of Irish people from rural areas feel they have too little time for hobbies compared to people in urban areas - the opposite perception exists across the majority of European countries. ‘Rural areas are very diverse across Europe with different problems, challenges, approaches and priorities,’ says Robert Anderson, research coordinator at the Foundation. ‘Analysing how rural areas in Europe compare with urban areas on quality of life issues is vital in developing new policies to generate incomes, to improve employment opportunities, to reverse the trend of rural depopulation, and to improve infrastructure, among other issues.’ The research concludes that quality of life in rural Europe is generally high, and that life satisfaction is equally high in rural and urban Europe. However, the report suggests that quality of life in rural Europe lags behind urban Europe in the strategic domains of economic resources, health and health care, housing, knowledge, education and e-learning. The Foundation’s research on quality of life in Europe, based on 26.000 face-to-face interviews across EU-28, provides a framework for measuring perceptions of well-being using a multi-dimensional approach covering a number of domains, ranging from economic resources, health and health care, employment and working conditions, to community life and social participation, and housing. Conference paper ‘Quality of life in rural Europe’ (Word, 1.28MB) by Robert Anderson, Research Manager, is now available. Information on the conference can also be accessed from the Irish EU Presidency website. More on the Foundation’s Quality of Life monitoring activities.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0896	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 13 April 2004	 The European Working Conditions Observatory: PART-TIME WORK GIVES BETTER WORK-LIFE BALANCE Part-time workers are less likely to report job-related health problems and are more likely to achieve a positive work-life balance. However, there is a price to pay, according to the first topic report from the new European Working Conditions Observatory (EWCO). The report ranks fewer opportunities for training and career progression, lower salary levels and reduced access to supplementary payments and social protection benefits. ‘The European Working Conditions Observatory EWCO is a new online monitoring tool with news and up to date data on working conditions, quality of work and employment issues in the EU,’ says Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s acting Director. ‘Europe needs more and better jobs, and EWCO aims to assist in the analysis of trends and challenges for the future world of work, and the outlining of which policies and actions are required to achieve this.’ EWCO provides regular news updates from a network of correspondents covering a selection of EU Member States, as well as topic reports and survey data reports providing in-depth analysis. ‘We will focus our work on the quality of work and employment, that is to say issues relating to career and employment, health and well-being, skills and competences, and work-life balance,’ says Agnès Parent-Thirion, research coordinator for the working conditions team. ‘It is, in effect, a widening of the Foundation’s work since over a decade of producing unique data, analysis and recommendations on issues ranging from stress in the workplace to health and safety to working time. The next European Foundation Working Conditions survey will be carried out in 2005, covering the 25 EU Member States, the three EU candidate countries (Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey), and Norway and possibly Switzerland.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0897	2010-01-07	UNK	Background note, 31 March 2004	 DE FR Social dialogue and conflict resolution in the acceding countries: A ROAD MAP FOR BETTER CONFLICT RESOLUTION In 2002, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions and the Swedish Work Life and EU Enlargement launched a joint project on Social Dialogue in the acceding countries to examine how social dialogue could be used as a vehicle to prepare for EU membership. The first part of the project examined how social dialogue can best be utilised in preparing for and adapting to the EMU criteria, while ensuring economic growth in harmony with employment and social protection. In the Vienna seminars the social partners and Government representatives prepared national development plans for preparing for Economic and Monetary Union. More information on these events. The second phase of the project focused on the improvement of conflict resolution mechanisms in the acceding countries. The Prague workshops focused on the analysis of the national road maps to conflict resolution. As a result of these workshops, government representatives and social partners produced national development plans for all 10 acceding countries. The development projects will be presented and analysed at the conference 'Social dialogue and conflict resolution mechanisms in the acceding countries' to be held in Kranj, Slovenia from 31 March - 2 April 2004.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0898	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 5 March 2004	 Quality of life in Europe SIMILAR PERCEPTIONS OF QUALITY OF LIFE ACROSS EUROPE Although differences in living conditions are considerable, values and priorities determining quality of life across Europe are not very different: having a good job is ranked as the highest factor for a good life across Europe, and the fight against unemployment is universally perceived to be one of the most important means of improving the economic and social conditions of family life. These are the main conclusions from a joint report on living conditions and quality of life by the European Commission and the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, providing a social picture of the Europe of 28 countries on the eve of enlargement. 'The results of the survey support an integrated employment policy, focusing on higher employment rates to achieve better quality jobs', said Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s acting Director. 'With this report, we have for the first time an analysis of social conditions across all 28 current and future Member States, plus candidate countries. It also represents the launching pad for the Foundation’s monitoring initiative of quality of life in Europe, completing the Foundation’s monitoring tools on industrial relations and working conditions in Europe'. The good life – what is it? The survey found that good health, sufficient income and having a family are the three main factors contributing to a good life for the majority of Europeans. When other less important factors are analysed, some differences appear between EU15 and the ACC: a good job, good relationship with a partner, having children, and adequate accommodation are mentioned more frequently in the ACC than in the EU15. Having enough leisure time to enjoy life is relatively more important in the EU15. Money matters The next wave of enlargement will widen the range of inequality across the EU- from 2.8 times higher GDP per capita in the current EU15 to 6.5 times in EU25, thus shifting the north-south gradient in economic development and living standards by an east-west bias. Overall, the report found that life overall satisfaction in Europe of 28 is strongly linked to income level and GDP per capita. Deficits in ACC 13 on traditional economic indicators are matched by poor life satisfaction scores. Bulgaria, Romania and Latvia reported the lowest levels of satisfaction with life ever recorded in EU surveys since they were launched in 1973. The focus of EU policy on economic convergence is therefore justified as a means to improve quality of life of citizens in acceding countries, argues the report. GDP growth and economic catch-up will over time result in improved life satisfaction on the ACC 13. Having a good job most important for a good life across Europe The majority of Europeans agree that having a job provides not only income but also social contacts, self-esteem and a better quality of life. Those who have been unemployed for at least two years over the previous five years report lower satisfaction with life in general, with family life, with social life, and with health than those who have been in continuous employment. However, poor working conditions have a detrimental effect on several areas of satisfaction. Those who work overtime, in high intensity jobs, or in jobs that are physically or mentally demanding, report lower satisfaction levels than those who work under favourable conditions. About 20% of working Europeans blame work for bad or even disrupted social relations. This percentage is higher in the acceding and candidate countries (27%) than in the EU 15 (19%). Furthermore, 61% of those who report having psychologically burdensome jobs, 54% of those with physically demanding jobs, and 49% of those working at high intensity claim to have difficulties in their relations with family and friends due to work. Long-term unemployment the root cause of poverty Cuts in social welfare payments are cited as an important determinant of poverty in the ACC, while EU 15 citizens are more likely to see lack of education as an important cause. This is followed by alcoholism, sickness, family break-up and drug abuse. Alcoholism is more frequently mentioned in the ACC as a factor leading to poverty while drug abuse is identified more often by EU 15 respondents. When asked about the general causes of poverty and social exclusion, social injustice is perceived as the main cause throughout the EU 25, although only 35% of EU 15 respondents hold this view compared with an absolute majority in the ACC.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0899	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 31 March 2004	 Social dialogue and conflict resolution in the acceding countries: A ROAD MAP FOR BETTER CONFLICT RESOLUTION Choose your preferred language option: DE FR New ways of resolving industrial conflicts involving the social partners and governments in the 10 acceding countries will be explored on the basis of work carried out on Social dialogue and conflict resolution in the acceding countries, a project co-funded by the Foundation and the Swedish Work-Life Enlargement initiative. 'Social dialogue and tripartite consultation have proven crucial tools for devising road maps for industrial peace in the future, while still ensuring economic growth in harmony with employment and social protection,' says Willy Buschak, the Foundation's acting Director. 'Over the past two years, this project has brought together employers, trade unions, national governments and researchers from the 10 acceding countries to investigate how social dialogue can be used to adapt, improve and - if necessary - reform the existing mechanisms of extra-judicial conflict resolution.' The project found that mediation is the dominant conflict resolution mechanism in the acceding countries. However, the transformation towards a market economy during the 1990s has resulted in fragile industrial relations systems in all countries. These are characterised by heterogeneous and fragmented trade union and employer organisations, limited sectoral collective bargaining and a widespread absence of works councils. The project highlighted the need for more and better training for mediators and the social partners. The project has drawn on the experiences of EU Member States, and has promoted the notion of mutual learning. The report is now available. See also background note.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0900	2010-01-07	UNK	Background note, 5 March 2004	 Quality of life in Europe SIMILAR PERCEPTIONS OF QUALITY OF LIFE ACROSS EUROPE As Europe moves towards enlargement to an initial ten new Member States in May 2004, there is increasing pressure on Europe’s policymakers to strike the right balance to ensure a cohesive, strong and productive new Union. Quality of life issues play a key role in determining the successful outcome of enlargement and several recent initiatives have sought to provide the kind of information and data required to make sense of the situation in a 25 country EU or indeed within an enlarged Europe of 28 states. This report is an integrated summary of the findings from a series of seven comparative studies on quality of life, living conditions, and related areas in the 13 acceding and candidate countries (ACC 13) and 15 Member States of the European Union (EU 15) [see footnote]. The main objective of the studies was to contribute to the monitoring and analysis of living conditions and quality of life in the ACC13, based on comparisons with the EU15. The report looks at quality of life as a multi-dimensional view of human well-being, and aims to go beyond a narrow economic focus on income and material conditions as components of welfare, covering dimensions such as income, deprivation, working conditions, perceptions of social exclusion, satisfaction with various domains of life, and perceptions of certain issues related to migration, health, caring and family issues. The studies were based on a single composite data set compiled largely from a Eurobarometer survey of adults carried out in the ACC 13 in spring 2002. The survey covered a diverse range of topics. A number of dimensions of living conditions and quality of life – income and deprivation, working conditions, perceptions of social exclusion, satisfaction with various domains of life, and perceptions of certain health, caring and family issues. Fertility ideals and outcomes. Migration intentions. The data-set on which the studies were based did not purport to provide a comprehensive representation of quality of life, nor did it attempt to take account of the national and institutional contextual factors (such as the character of political systems or levels of social provision) which have such a strong bearing on the quality of life experienced by individuals. Rather, it provided a snapshot of certain key dimensions of quality of life. It did this so in a way that was consistent across the ACC13 and allowed for comparisons with the EU15.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0901	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 13 November 2008	Eurofound publishes resource pack on migration in Europe Should I stay or should I go? Opportunities and challenges of cross-country mobility (DUBLIN, IRELAND) More than half of European citizens (53%) put ‘freedom of travel and work in the EU’ first when asked what the EU represents to them, well ahead of the introduction of the euro and safeguarding peace. However, in reality, only a small number of Europeans have actually moved to another Member State. Eurofound's new resource pack on migration examines migration patterns and highlights the associated opportunities and challenges. In theory, Europeans are all for it: 49% think that mobility is a good thing for an individual while 50% think there are advantages for the economy, according to the figures published in the resource pack. However, only 4% of workers have actually seized the opportunity and moved to another country in the EU after leaving their parental home, according to Eurofound´s report ‘Mobility in Europe’. Fear of losing contact with family and friends is cited by 44% of EU citizens as a risk in 2005. And 17% of those who had actually moved did report deterioration in their contact with family and friends. The challenge of having to learn a new language is also often quoted as a disincentive to cross-country mobility. Only 31% of the employed EU population said they would be ready to move even if faced with unemployment in the future. The resource pack also contains a new report on the social and economic integration of migrants in cities, the second output from the European Network of Cities for Local Integration Policy for Migrants (CLIP) project. It looks at equality and diversity policies in city administrations in relation to employment as well as service provision for migrants. It documents numerous good practice examples showing how European cities are striving to ensure greater equality in their employment practices. The report also identifies key challenges for city administrations in relation to migrants, such as the lack of information and knowledge regarding employment levels and working conditions of migrants; the under-representation of migrants in local authority employment in comparison to local labour market levels; and the under-representation of migrants in middle and higher management in public authorities.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0902	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 15 October 2008	Eurofound launches report on migrants’ employment and social integration in Europe: European cities ensure equality when employing migrants (DUBLIN, IRELAND) The European Employment Strategy could emphasise the key role of local authorities in providing more and better jobs for migrants, according to a new report from the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound). Sustainable participation in the labour market is one of the most important pre-conditions for social inclusion and integration into the host society. Access to jobs is recognised as a crucial factor in integrating people from different backgrounds into society, as is the provision of services that migrants can access fully and effectively, without discrimination. As local authorities are a major employer on the local labour market, they are at the forefront of the challenge of developing appropriate policies to integrate migrants and to ensure social cohesion and security for all urban dwellers. The new report, the second output from the European Network of Cities for Local Integration Policy for Migrants (CLIP) project, looks at equality and diversity policies in city administrations in relation to employment as well as service provision for migrants. It documents numerous good practice examples showing how European cities are striving to ensure greater equality in their employment practices. Sefton (UK), for example, has set up a forum to facilitate the reporting of racist and hate crime; Amsterdam (NL) has involved members of its migrant communities in delivering healthcare services; and Frankfurt (DE) has broadened the scope of its job advertising to target migrant communities. The report also identifies key challenges for city administrations in relation to migrants, such as the lack of information and knowledge regarding employment levels and working conditions of migrants; the relative under-representation of migrants in local authority employment in comparison to local labour market levels; and the representation of migrants in middle and higher positions in public authorities. The report provides an important evidence-based contribution to the EU policy debate on diversity and integration of migrants, which is widely neglected, and it sets out recommendations for policymakers at EU, national and municipal level. The report is aimed at filling an important knowledge gap and is published jointly with the Council of Europe and three cities: Amsterdam, Stuttgart and Vienna.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0903	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 19 November 2008	Eurofound publishes first findings of its second European Quality of Life Survey Perception of life satisfaction and quality of life remains high among Europeans (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Europeans are generally satisfied with their quality of life, but levels vary considerably across countries, according to the second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS). The survey, carried out by Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU Agency, offers a unique and timely insight into quality of life in Europe, and provides policymakers and other interested groups with information on how individuals assess their quality of life. On average, Europeans rate their life satisfaction with a 7, and 7.5 for happiness, on a scale from one to ten. There are, however, big variations between both levels of life satisfaction and happiness, especially among the 12 new EU Member States. Not surprisingly, the survey found that people with higher incomes, good health, secure jobs and higher levels of education are more satisfied, happy and fulfilled. People living with a partner and children also report higher levels of life satisfaction. ‘The differences in terms of life satisfaction and attitudes towards the future underline the significant inequalities in living conditions and in the experience of daily life for Europeans,’ says Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director. ‘In particular, well-being in the former socialist countries varies greatly between social and demographic groups. There are marked disadvantages associated with low income, and older people are more likely to report dissatisfaction with their situation.’ ‘Eurofound’s European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) represents a unique attempt to explore quality of life in a wide range of countries,’ says Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, commenting on the survey and its findings. ‘It is a major source of information, highlighting the social and economic policy challenges facing the EU following the two recent rounds of enlargement.’ Income and standard of living are key elements of quality of life. Standards of living and reported well-being of Europeans are closely related to the economy of the country in which they live. The survey found that the proportion of people who suffer multiple deprivations, i.e. those who could not afford five or six of the basic necessities, is five times higher in the 12 new EU Member States than in the former EU15 countries. For the group of three candidate countries the deprivation is even up to ten times higher than that for EU15. Health is a cornerstone to Europeans; four out of five Europeans (81%) said that good health was ‘very important’ for their quality of life. Altogether, only 21% of people rate their health as ‘very good’, while 46% rate it as ‘good’. Also, more people in the 12 new EU Member States and the three candidate countries rate their health as ‘bad or very bad’; this applies in particular to women in these countries. Reporting poor health is, not surprisingly, associated with increasing age: in the EU27, fewer than 2% of people aged between 18 and 34 years report bad health, as against 18% of those aged 65 and over. Access to, and quality of, health care services are important factors for social protection. A substantial number of Europeans, however, report difficulty in accessing health care services. For instance, in the EU27, more than 25% of people report problems because they are too far from their doctor or hospital, more than 38% experience delays in getting medical appointments and more than 27% have difficulty with the expense involved in seeing a doctor. Health and quality of family relationships are usually ranked the most important aspect of quality of life for Europeans. Family remains for most people the first port of call for support in emergencies, as well as for child and elder care. It is clear, however, that men and women are involved differently in the family. Responsibilities in the household, for example, are not shared equally. Women are more likely to report involvement in caring activities on a daily basis, also spending much more time on domestic duties. In the EU27, women report spending 33 hours per week, and men over 18 hours, in caring for and educating children, while women spend 18 hours per week cooking and doing housework, as against 10 hours per week for men. Enabling citizens to develop some balance between family life, personal commitments and working life has become central to the social policy debate. Still, almost half (48%) of citizens in paid employment in the EU27 say that at least several times a month they are too tired as a result of their work to do household jobs, while nearly one in four (22%) say they are too tired several times a week. Similar but smaller proportions of workers say that they have difficulties in fulfilling their family responsibilities because of the amount of time they spend in work: almost one in three (29%) indicate that this happens at least several times a month, and for 11% this is the case several times a week. The EQLS also looks at assessment of the quality of the environment and society; for example, it presents measures trust in other people and institutions. When asked to rate their level of trust in other people on a scale from one to 10, people in the Nordic countries and the Netherlands express the highest levels of trust, giving a rating of between 6.5 and 7.2. People living in Cyprus express the lowest levels of trust, at only 2.6, followed by Former Yugoslav Republic (FYR) Macedonia 3.8. Eurofound’s survey on quality of life in Europe is based on more than 35,000 face-to-face interviews with people aged 18 years or older. The field work was carried out during September 2007 – February 2008 in 31 countries: the 27 EU Member States and the three EU candidate countries – Croatia, FYR Macedonia, and Turkey – as well as Norway. For 24 countries, the sample size was around 1,000. For France, Italy, Poland and the UK the sample size was approximately 1,500. In Germany and Turkey it was 2,000. The full descriptive report will be published in March 2009, followed by a series of secondary analyses reports.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0904	2010-01-07	UNK	Background, 26 February 2004	" MIGRATION LIKELY TO BE ABOUT 1 PERCENT, SURVEY SAYS The study is based on Eurobarometer data collected for the European Commission. The survey was conducted in Spring 2002 in the 13 acceding and candidate countries. Figures above relate to averages for the 10 acceding countries. The sample was 1000 persons per country, except Malta and Cyprus (500) and Poland and Turkey (2000). On the basis of the data from the Eurobarometer poll, the study goes on to consider the motives for migration, which can be seen to differ quite significantly from one country to another. It also looks at the possible effect of ‘brain gain’ with highly skilled people in particular returning to their country of origin to take advantage of an improved economic situation and a higher quality of life. The study and the poll on which it is based make no distinction between the free movement of workers, for whom transitional measures can apply for up to 7 years after enlargement, and free movement of persons in general. Existing EU provisions on free movement of persons, right of residence and freedom of establishment will come into effect on 1 May 2004. Experience of past enlargements shows that emigration diminishes rather than increases after enlargement. For example, emigration from Spain to the other EU countries fell from over 200,000 in 1970 (establishment of free trade area) to 120,000 in the late 1970s (application for membership) and about 2,000 to 3,000 in the early 1990s (post-accession). The latest data for mobility within the European Union shows that about 1.5% of employed people within the current EU moved in one year from another region within their Member State or from another Member State. Furthermore a study carried out in 2001 showed that about 8% of the EU population indicated their intention to move to another Member State in the next five years, but only 4% had done so in the past 10 years. It is therefore likely that indications relating to intention to move are higher than actual numbers moving. The European Union currently welcomes approximately 1.5 million immigrants per year from countries outside accession states. 		The poll measured attitudes towards migration into the EU on three different levels: a general inclination to migrate a basic intention to migrate a firm intention to migrate The study has certain limitations. It is based on data collected at a time when it was not clear which Member States would impose restrictions on access to labour markets. It does not differentiate between different destinations for migration. There is no information on intended length of stay. The full summary is available for download.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0905	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 26 February 2004	 MIGRATION LIKELY TO BE ABOUT 1 PERCENT, SURVEY SAYS Migration from all new Member States to all current Member States – under conditions of full freedom of movement – would be likely to be about 1% of the population of the new Member States over the next five years, totalling approximately 220,000 persons per year. This is according to a new study by the European Foundation for the Improvement in Living and Working Conditions, the Dublin-based EU-agency, and the European Commission, released in Brussels today. It suggests that the European Union take appropriate regional and structural policy measures to stimulate growth and to encourage young and highly qualified employees to remain in their countries and the promotion of enhanced labour mobility in an enlarging European Union, if it is to be beneficial for both sides. The study goes on to show that the typical potential migrants from the acceding countries are young, educated to tertiary level, or still studying, and living as a single person with no dependents. There is an increasing tendency for them to be female. 'This study confirms the view of the European Commission that fears of a huge wave of migration from the new Member States after 1 May 2004 will be proven to be unfounded' said Margot Wallström, acting Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs at the presentation of the report in Brussels on Thursday. 'The new Member States will provide a much-needed input of highly skilled individuals able to contribute actively to the development of the European economy'. The study shows that, in fact, there is the serious risk of a 'youth and brain drain' from the accession countries, with about 2%-3% of the 15-24 age-group indicating a firm intention to move. Accession countries are also in danger of losing highly-qualified people – one third of potential migrants with a firm intention to move are students and a quarter are better qualified (tertiary level). 'The dilemma of migration, as a considerable policy challenge to the EU, is that while labour mobility may be good for economic growth and cohesion across the EU regions as a whole', said Willy Buschak, acting Director of the Foundation, 'it may put pressure on social cohesion at the local level if not accompanied by a holistic approach to integration'. Unemployment does have an influence on migration, but to a much lesser extent then previously thought and in a limited number of countries. Overall only 2% of unemployed people indicated a firm intention to move. Family situation does seem to influence people: of the 1% that indicated a firm intention to move, 70.4% were single people, compared to 26.0% that were married or cohabiting, and 3.6% who were widowed, divorced or separated. The study states that 'the receiving countries of the EU can expect a high quality labour supply, which should improve its short-term economic and its long-term socio-economic base with a more active demographic structure. This provides more opportunities than risks for the old EU Member States. It appears that policy in the old Member States has to address a problem of high numbers of aspiring students and will have to adapt measures to support a larger number of migrants who are coming from a situation of unemployment. Extended pressure on existing social security systems in the old EU Member States should not occur in the short run'. In conclusion, the study notes that the impact on new Member States of outward migration may in the medium term be a more significant problem than the impact of inward migration on current Member States. It suggests that the European Union take appropriate regional and structural policy measures to stimulate growth and to encourage young and highly qualified employees to remain in their countries and the promotion of enhanced labour mobility in an enlarging European Union, if it is to be beneficial for both sides.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0906	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 8 October 2008	Eurofound publishes new research and analysis on employment expansion across the European Union: The European Employment Strategy has paid off, report says (DUBLIN, IRELAND) The European Employment Strategy has paid off, in terms of creating both more and better jobs, according to the new European Restructuring Monitor’s annual report 2008 from the European Foundation of the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound), the Dublin-based EU agency. The report, which examines patterns of employment expansion in Europe between 1995-2006,  concludes that women workers in particular have benefited from this period of stronger European employment growth. Most Member States of the European Union have generated both more and better jobs in the decade after 1995, especially in the EU15 area. The proportion of working age population in active employment has risen from 60% to 66% in the EU15, with total employment growing by more than 22 million jobs. But what about the quality of all these jobs created from 1995 to 2006: were they mostly good or bad jobs? The aim of this ERM 2008 Report, entitled More and better jobs: patterns of employment expansion in Europe, is to provide an evaluation of the quality of the jobs created for the different European countries, and to provide comment and analysis at various levels, eg. country, sector, by gender, and employment status. ‘The overall picture is very positive, good news indeed for the achievement of the overall objectives of the Lisbon Agenda. More and better jobs, and more opportunities for women, are created in Europe, representing a shift towards the knowledge economy,’ says Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director. ‘But the same progress has led to increasing difficulties for low-skilled workers or workers displaced in declining industries. Policymakers have to be wary about stagnating employment growth in low-paid jobs. This can mean fewer employment opportunities for low-skilled workers at a time when the decline of new medium-quality jobs creates an obstacle to upward mobility in the employment structure.’ The best performers in terms of job quantity and quality were Ireland, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden, according to the report. Most of the jobs were located in knowledge-intensive services, especially in the business services sector and the health and education sectors. In comparison, the report points out that other countries like Spain, Greece and Italy also experienced a large expansion in employment, but this expansion was flatter in terms of quality and less concentrated in higher quality jobs. The Netherlands, France and Cyprus showed intense job creation at the top and at the bottom with a big gap in the middle. The employment situation of women, especially in the former EU15 countries, has improved both quantitatively and qualitatively. The majority of net new jobs in the EU over the last decade have been taken by women and most of these jobs have been of high or medium-high quality. The report also concludes that low-paid jobs have become more atypical in the EU since 1995. In many countries, most employment created in low-paid jobs was part-time or fixed-term, whereas full-time permanent jobs in the low-paid segment were either destroyed or remained stagnant. Migrant workers from outside the EU tended to occupy the lowest-paid jobs. In Spain, Cyprus, Ireland and Greece, for example, the report points to the finding that most of the net jobs created in the two bottom job quality quintiles in these countries were taken up by non-EU nationals.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0907	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 2 October 2008	Eurofound explains the flexicurity concept and how it is employed in Europe: Flexicurity – it takes three to tango (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Flexicurity is a policy approach that attempts to combine flexibility of labour markets for employers and security of employment for employees. It has the potential to substantially enhance the competitiveness of the European economy and create higher levels of employment. The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound), the Dublin-based EU agency, has drawn on its research results to produce a resource pack containing fact sheets covering the issue from three distinct perspectives: finding the right approach nationally from the Member States, putting flexicurity into practice at company level, and evaluating the impact of flexicurity on workers' lives – as well as providing an analysis of how flexicurity affects vulnerable groups. The idea of flexicurity is straightforward: the need of employers to be flexible has to be balanced with the workers’ need to have a secure income. However, getting to grips with the different components of flexicurity and understanding the diverging approaches of Member States remains a challenge. One fundamental question to be addressed is: which parties should assume the main responsibility for ensuring both security and flexibility – employers, the state, or a combination of the two in conjunction with the social partners? The responsibility for flexicurity should be shared between all partners involved and all levels, if it is to be a successful approach. ‘A one-size-fits-all approach across Europe to flexicurity will not work – each labour market has its own characteristics to take into consideration,’ argued Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director, at the launch of the resource pack on 1 October 2008. ‘Our work is aimed at creating a better understanding of the challenges and realities involved, offering advice on how to achieve flexicurity that benefits workers, employers and the state.’ Eurofound argues that flexicurity will go from being a buzz-word to a reality in all EU labour markets in the coming years. A proper approach to flexicurity requires security based on employment security, not job security, and containing a mix of rights and tools. Given the multidimensional nature of flexicurity, policymakers have to strive for an integration of different policy areas, to be able to provide flexible and reliable contractual arrangements, comprehensive lifelong learning programmes, effective active labour market policies, and modern social security systems. Crucially, the most vulnerable workers need specific attention so as avoid the risk of falling into in-work poverty.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0908	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 21 August 2008	Eurofound publishes annual report on pay increases across the European Union Women still earn less than men in Europe (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Women in Europe earn on average almost 16% less than men doing similar jobs, according to new data published by Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). The good news is that the gender pay gap in the EU15 countries is shrinking. The bad news, however, is that the pay gap between men and women doing similar jobs in the new EU Member States is wider than the EU average. The gender wage gap averaged 15.9% across the EU27 in 2007, as indicated by the annual update on pay increases, which covers all EU27 Member States and Norway. This is down from the 16.2% recorded in 2006. Since 2001, the average wage gap in the EU15 countries has fallen: it stood at 20.4% in 2001, 19.2% in 2002, 18.6% in 2003, 17.4% in 2004 and 18.1% in 2005. In the ten new EU Member States, and the newcomers Romania and Bulgaria (which together make up the NMS12 countries), the gender wage gap averages 17.8%, which is 3.4 percentage points higher than the average in the EU15. In the 2006 pay review, the gap for these NMS was found to be 17.5%, 2.2 points higher than the average in the EU15. Among the 28 countries examined in the report, the gender wage gap is greatest in Slovakia (26.9%) and least in Slovenia (at 6.9%). Belgium, Greece, Ireland and Italy show a notably narrower gender wage gap of 10% or less. In Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands and Portugal, there is a comparatively wider wage gap of 20% or more. The report also looks at collectively-agreed pay increases generally across the EU27 Member States and Norway, as well as in the chemicals, retail and civil service sectors. The report also looks at current wage rates and minimum wage increases, and increases in average earnings. The full text of the report on pay developments is available.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0909	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 1 October 2008	Eurofound and ANACT co-organise EU Presidency conference on the transformations and challenges at work: Quality of work in Europe in 2010 and beyond (DUBLIN, IRELAND) The economic and social changes of the last 30 years have profoundly changed the way employees work, experts from the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) will argue at a two-day high level conference under the auspices of the French EU Presidency. Eurofound’s work, aimed at providing social policymakers with research findings, data and recommendations, shows that working conditions vary considerable across Europe. Gender gaps, in terms of pay, time and employment levels, are still evident across Europe. The trend of work intensification is on the increase, and health and safety risks are still prevalent, especially psychosocial risks. Eurofound’s research also shows that workers with regular and predictable schedules are most positive about their work–life balance, and that special attention to the work organisation is an important factor in creating better working conditions. The conference, which takes place in Lyon, France on 2-3 October 2008, will focus both on the models available for understanding the new work challenges, and on innovative practices used in companies, in social dialogue or in public policies in various EU Member States. The  conference will be opened by Rémi Descosse, Chairman of the Administrative Board of ANACT, and Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director.The first plenary session will be followed by four workshops, which address these questions: How can occupational health and well-being be maintained in a service economy? What types of work organisation and competencies are needed in a knowledge economy? Career development over the life course: how can it best be ensured and adapted? What policies are needed to make work more attractive? The conference is a collaboration between Eurofound and ANACT (l’Agence Nationale pour l’Amélioration des Conditions de Travail) and covers the quality of work in Europe, 2010 and beyond. It offers opportunities for human resource managers, researchers, practitioners, social partners and representatives of institutions, from France and from other European countries, to meet and exchange experiences.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0910	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 3 September 2008	Eurofound publishes annual report on working time across the European Union The gap in working times between Eastern and Western Europe remains wide (DUBLIN, IRELAND) The average collectively agreed weekly working time in the European Union in 2007 stood at 38.6 hours, according to the annual update of the working time development from Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). The report, which looks at working time agreements set by collective bargaining, also found that average paid annual leave entitlement for European workers stood at 25.2 days across the EU in 2007. There is still a substantial gap in working time between the former EU15 Member States and the majority of the new EU Member States, according to the report. The average in the EU15 stood at 37.9 hours in 2007 (the same as in 2006), compared with 39.6 hours (also unchanged from 2006) in the NMS12, a difference of 1.7 hours, or 4.5%. The average collectively agreed normal working time, which covers some three-quarters of the labour force in Europe, has remained static overall in five of the former EU15 countries and Norway, and has fallen by less than an hour per week in three, the report says. Over the nine-year period 1999–2007, average agreed normal weekly hours in the former EU15 countries and Norway fell only slightly from 38.6 to 37.8, a reduction of 2.1%. Reductions of an hour or more have occurred in Luxembourg (1.0 hours), the UK (1.1 hours), Portugal (1.2 hours), Sweden (2.5 hours) and, most notably (driven by legislation), France (4.0 hours). Since 2003, when EIRO started collecting data in the new Member States, the 40-hour working week has remained the standard in the majority of these countries. Exceptions to the 40-hour week are found in Cyprus, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, where agreed hours are closer to the EU15 average. Slovakia is the only country among the new EU Member States where considerable working hour reductions have been recorded over the past few years. Across the European Union, the highest levels of actual weekly hours[i] worked by full-time employees in their main jobs are found in Bulgaria, Romania and the UK, and the lowest in France, Italy and Denmark. Ten of the 12 new Member States report actual working hours above the EU 27 average, compared with only three of the EU15. The report, which also allows for the comparison of average collectively agreed annual paid leave entitlement for workers in the EU 27, affirms that the average number of fully paid holidays in Europe is 25.2 days per year. The average in the EU15 and Norway stands at 26.7 days, with great differences between Sweden (33 days) and Greece (23 days). Among the NMS, figures are available only for Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Romania and Slovakia, where the average is 21.9 days of paid leave per year.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0911	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 10 June 2008	Eurofound contributes to Employment Week 2008, focusing on today's most talked about employment issues Helping Europe’s social policy-makers tackle youth unemployment and globalisation (Dublin, Ireland): Off-shoring of employment accounts only for 8% of job losses in the European Union today, according to research from Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU Agency providing European social partners with comparative research, data and recommendations. Its argues that European policy-makers face difficult decisions today since the developments in international trade in services could result in a serious impact on future employment, given that service-sector jobs account for 70% of employment in the European Union. This comes at a time when negative public opinion toward globalisation is on the rise. Between 2003 and 2006, the proportion of European citizens who see globalisation as a threat to employment went up from 39% to 47%. The attitudes towards globalisation among Europe’s social partners, however, remain broadly positive. Youth employment and unemployment rates are highly susceptible to cyclical economic change. Europe’s social policy-makers are challenged to design policies for individual industries or sectors that not only take into consideration regional differences and involve social actors, particularly the social partners and public authority representatives, but also to implement these solutions before economic circumstances have changed, .More urgently, policy-makers need to find ways for young people to get started on the employment ladder. The rate of youth unemployment is 20% or higher in 12 of 26 European countries. During Employment Week 2008, experts from Eurofound will present their latest conclusions in the fields of youth and employment, and employment and competitiveness. Isabella Biletta, research manager, Industrial Relations and Workplace, will present recent findings on youth and employment on Wednesday 1430-1600 Donald Storrie, head of unit, Employment and Competitiveness, will chair the discussions in the session on Managing Change, on Thursday 1130-1300 Radoslaw Owczarzak, research manager, Employment and Competitiveness, will give a presentation on competitiveness and the quality of jobs, on Thursday 1430-1600.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0912	2010-01-07	UNK	Press           release, 7 April 2008	News from an international conference on European cities integrating migrants: Housing: evaluating best practice for integrating migrants Living in adequate accommodation is regarded as the most necessary prerequisite for a good quality of life, alongside having a good job and a satisfactory family life. And for migrants in particular, housing is even more important playing a crucial role in the structural integration of individuals and groups. This is the central theme of the high-level conference ‘European cities integrating migrants: From Amsterdam to Zagreb: Fostering a dialogue about successful policies’ taking place in Brussels on 7 April. Gathering EU policymakers, mayors of several European cities, experts, national and regional representatives, civil society and social partners , the conference will look at measures of good practice in the various cities and discuss the development of guidelines to help cities cope more effectively with the challenge of integrating migrants. Based on the findings in the report ‘Housing and integration of migrants in Europe’, the analysis assesses the role of companies, social partners, and religious, non-governmental and voluntary organisations at local level in supporting and developing more successful migrant integration policies. The economic and cultural integration of migrants represents both a challenge and an opportunity for all EU Member States. Many of the challenges have had to be dealt with at local level. Cities and local authorities have a vital role to play, not only in the implementation of integration policies, but also in the development of innovative policies on housing, education and cultural diversity. This report from the CLIP network – the European network of cities for local integration policies for migrants – aims to present and analyse innovative policies and their successful implementation at the local level by highlighting innovative and good practice examples from 20 cities involved in the project. It argues for an integrated, cross-departmental approach to policies targeting housing issues, the integration of migrants and other municipal areas. Such a regular interdisciplinary collaboration within the municipal administration should be accompanied by cooperation and partnerships with local bodies, such as NGOs, welfare organisations, churches, chamber of commerce, unions and associations representing landlords and tenants.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0913	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 20 August 2008	Eurofound publishes annual report on pay increases across the European Union Big differences between wage increases in Europe (DUBLIN, IRELAND) The average real wage increase for European workers fell from 2.7% in 2006 to 2.3% in 2007, according to new data published by Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). The annual update on pay developments in Europe recorded big differences between EU Member States, both in terms of pay trends and the level of pay increases. It also found a continued moderation in wage increases in the former EU15 countries; among the new EU Member States, however, a distinctive upward trend was evident, with average wage increases almost four times higher than in the former EU15 countries. Collective bargaining plays a relatively significant role in pay setting across Europe. The new report, which covers the current 27 EU Member States (EU27) and Norway, found that average collectively-agreed nominal wage increases across the EU rose from 5.6% in 2006 to 7% in 2007. In the former EU15, the average increase in 2006 stood at only 2.9%, rising to 3.1% in 2007. In the ten new EU Member States (NMS10), the average increase was 8.5% in 2006, rising to 10.5% in 2007. When the newest members Romania and Bulgaria are added, the respective figures for the larger NMS12 are 9% and 11.9%. However, when inflation is taken into account, the rate of real increase across the EU27 fell from 2.7% in 2006 to 2.3% in 2007. In the EU15, the average real pay increase stood at only 0.8% in 2006, and fell to 0.2% in 2007. In the NMS12, the average real pay increase also fell, from 5.2% in 2006 to 5% in 2007. In the NMS10, the average real pay increase fell from 5% to 4.1%. During the period under review, differences in pay trends and the level of pay increases varied substantially between individual Member States. Pay rises in Greece and Ireland, for example, ran far ahead of the EU15 averages in both 2006 and 2007. Among the NMS, countries such as Cyprus, Malta and Slovenia saw low increases in pay. The overall average for this group of countries was pushed up significantly by the double-digit increases in the Baltic States, Bulgaria and Romania in both years. In terms of trends, the rate of increase rose between 2006 and 2007 in 18 of the countries reviewed, remained unchanged in one country and fell in nine. The rate increased in the NMS, most sharply in Latvia, Bulgaria and Romania), with the exceptions of Cyprus, Malta and Slovenia, where it fell. In the EU15, the overall tendency was for a slight rise (with the highest increases in Sweden and Finland); however, the rate of increase was unchanged in the Netherlands and fell in Austria, Belgium, France, Greece, Italy and Spain. The report also looks at collectively-agreed pay increases in three selected sectors (chemicals, retail and the civil service), current wage rates and minimum wage increases, increases in average earnings, and the extent of the gender pay gap across all countries.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0914	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 13 June 2008	Eurofound gathers Finland’s leading social partners to discuss Finland’s industrial relations landscape in 2025 Defining the role of social partners in Finland in 2025 (Dublin, Ireland) Trade union membership levels in Finland look set to decrease from current levels of 70% to 62 % in 2025, according to new research from Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU agency. At the same time, membership levels of Finnish employer organisations are also likely to drop from 70% to 63%. Efficient tripartite collaboration, the hallmark of Finland’s industrial success in recent decades, will be challenged and questioned with these diminishing membership levels, as will the role and responsibilities of Finland’s social partners. Eurofound will present these and other findings of its report Industrial Relations Foresights 2025 for EU27 and Global7 countries on 17-18 June 2008 in Helsinki. The two-day conference will gather researchers and industrial relations experts from more than 30 countries. A panel discussion will take place on Wednesday 18 June 2008, between 14.00 and 17.00, gathering Finland’s leading social partners to discuss the Finnish industrial relations model benchmarked against all EU27 Member States, Australia, Brazil, China, India, Japan, South Africa and the United States of America as per the report. The panel discussion will be conducted in English. The following people will speak at the panel debate together with Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director, and Timo Kauppinen, Eurofound research manager, employment and competitiveness: Tarja Cronberg, Minister of Employment and Enterprise Matti Tukiainen, Director, Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK) Mikko Mäenpää, President, Finnish Confederation of Salaried Employees (STTK) Matti Viljanen, President, Confederation of Unions for Professional and Managerial Staff in Finland (AKAVA) Eeva-Liisa Inkeroinen, Director, Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) Markku Jalonen, Director General, Commission for Local Authority Employers (KT) Teuvo Metsäpelto, Director General, Office for the Government as Employer (VTML) Journalists are invited to attend the panel debate at the Katajanokan Kasino, Laivastokatu 1, 00160 Helsinki on 18 June at 1400.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0915	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 2 June 2008	Eurofound organises a major international conference in Poznań, Poland, 3-5 June 2008, to debate global competition and European companies’ location decisions: Delocalisation is not Europe’s number one ‘job-killer’ (Dublin, Ireland) Delocalisation or off-shoring of jobs is far from the biggest cause of job destruction in Europe, recent research from Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU agency can reveal. According to its European Restructuring Monitor (ERM), only 8% of announced job losses were due to jobs being moved elsewhere in the period between 2003 and 2006. The proportion of ERM recorded job losses that are attributable to delocalisation varied from around 25% in Portugal and Ireland to less than 5% in the Netherlands and Belgium. A look at sectors shows that it is in high to medium-tech sectors rather than in low-tech sectors that delocalisation plays the more important role. The sector accounting for the highest proportion of EU jobs lost through delocalisation (one in four of the total) was banking and insurance, a service sector with a generally high-skill profile. Globalisation brings new opportunities and markets for business, and more choices and lower prices for customers. For workers, however, it can mean the loss of jobs and the erosion of incomes and living standards. Policymakers and business organisations tend to stress the positive effects of increased trade for consumers, in particular lower prices and more choice through increased competition. Trade unions, in general, seem to focus mainly on dealing with the consequences of globalisation on employment, in particular the relocation of jobs to other areas. Employers, for their part, often stress the need to be able to react flexibly in the face of increased international competition. Eurobarometer surveys show that when asked about whether globalisation had positive or negative connotations on EU citizens, the positive results fell from 63% in 2003 to 42% in 2006. The proportion of European citizens seeing globalisation as a threat to employment rose from 39% in 2003 (EU15) to 47% in 2006 (EU25). With companies outsourcing parts of their production to other countries or operating sites in various countries, the question arises as to how workers’ interests are best represented. Trade unions and bodies of worker representation are normally organised within national boundaries and this also applies to social dialogue. International production lines challenge this model. Eurofound will bring European business leaders, policymakers and social partners together at an international conference on the topic of ‘Global competition and European companies’ location decisions’ at the IBB Andersia Hotel, Plac Andersia 3, 61-894 Poznań, Poland, between 3-5 June 2008. The three-day event will examine the role that location plays in companies’ success, explore how Europe can attract inward investment and assess the role of EU policies in making Europe a more attractive location for business. All sessions during the event are open to representatives from the media.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0916	2010-01-07	UNK	Press           release, 14 March 2008	Eurofound launches major communication campaign on active ageing: Reassessing the role of older people As Europe experiences dramatic demographic change, companies and policymakers are increasingly taking a different approach towards older people, be it as potential customers with considerable spending power or as a valuable resource in the workplace. Promoting employment opportunities for an ageing workforce, for example, is a complex challenge that requires rethinking at company, national and EU level. In this context, Eurofound launches a communication campaign aimed at bringing policymakers, companies and society up to par with the latest research data, recommendations and case examples to tackle the challenges and explore the opportunities associated with active ageing. From a work perspective, creating conditions for working longer means introducing policies that maintain and promote the health of all employees, develop and update the skills of older workers through training, and provide suitable working conditions, including measures to reconcile work with family and care responsibilities – of growing importance in an increasingly female older workforce. With the ageing of the population, policy attention is also turning to the issue of care. While the role of the family is acknowledged as being central to fulfilling care needs, the need for paid workers to support informal care arrangements has become more important with changes in family formation and the higher proportion of women – seen as the traditional family carers – entering the labour market. Older people still have many needs for care, health and security, and many are lonely, poor or ill, which should be met by good public services. ‘In our research over the past decade, the good news is that we have found that European companies have changed their attitudes towards older people,’ says Robert Anderson, Eurofound’s expert on ageing. ‘Increasingly, older people are viewed as potential customers with considerable spending power and as a valuable resource in the workplace in terms of skills and knowledge.’ The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) is launching a campaign on 'Working Longer, Living Better – Europe’s coming of age' in Brussels, Belgium, on 17 March 2008. The campaign, which explores the impact of an ageing society and workforce, providing insights into developments at EU, national and company level, brings together Eurofound’s research findings, recommendations and examples of good practice and strategies for change in the workplace that it has compiled over the last decade.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0917	2010-01-07	UNK	Joint press           release, 28 February 2008	ANNOUNCING A JOINT CONFERENCE ON 4 MARCH 2008 BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND EUROFOUND: The impact of globalisation on structural change and employment Despite its high profile, off-shoring of employment is currently responsible for only 8% of job losses in the EU. However, developments in international trade in services could in the future impact considerably on employment in the EU, given that service-sector jobs account for 70% of employment in the European Union. In the recently published 2007 annual report from the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM), ‘Restructuring and employment in the EU: The impact of globalisation’, it argues for the application of active labour market policies, especially greater support for displaced workers in the form of assistance with job-seeking, to reap the benefits of globalisation. These and other issues related to the impact of globalisation will be debated at a forthcoming high-level conference, ‘The impact of globalisation on structural change and employment’, in Brussels on 4 March. Eurofound and MEPs Alejandro Cercas, Stephen Hughes and Harlem Désir have joined forces to create a forum at which the impact of globalisation will be discussed and long-term strategies for meeting its challenges explored. The conference will gather some 250 high-level speakers and participants from the European Parliament, the Slovenian EU Presidency, the European Commission, as well as experts from various academic institutions, Eurofound, the International Labour Organisation (ILO), and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The conference will examine the challenges facing businesses, regional authorities, national governments and EU policymakers and debate how the increasingly international division of labour is creating new winners and losers. Romana Tomc, Secretary of State in the Slovenian Ministry of Labour, Family and Social Affairs will open the conference and Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, will deliver the closing address. A first roundtable will look at the current development of globalisation, the new international division of labour and on the distribution impact of globalisation. A second roundtable will look at the factors that drive companies to relocate in the face of increased competition, and will assess the role of worker representatives and corporate culture in such decisions. A third roundtable discussion will focus on European, national and regional responses to globalisation, and analyse the lessons that can be learnt from the new European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. The fourth and final roundtable will debate how flexicurity and active labour market policies are implemented in Member States, and come up with strategies to tackle the future challenges of globalisation.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0918	2010-01-07	UNK	Press           release, 30 January 2008	Diverse approaches to older workers across Europe Few companies are actively responding to demographic change, despite the fact that the ageing labour force debate has increasingly moved up the European policy agenda. This is according to research from Eurofound, the EU agency based in Dublin, Ireland. Although age management policies in companies have become more common, there is a wide diversity of approaches and developing and implementing good practice tends to be triggered by the direct business needs of companies, rather than by pressure from public policy or age-awareness campaigns. For example, flexible working practices are key to age management strategies in Austria, Germany and the Netherlands, while the Nordic countries tend to focus on improving employees’ health and well-being. Companies in Belgium, France, Greece, Italy and Spain, for their part, focus more on training and development. ‘Organisations are more likely to be successful when they clearly communicate the purpose of their age management strategy and establish a comprehensive policy framework that involves all parties,’ says Robert Anderson, Head of Unit of Eurofound’s ‘Living Conditions and Quality of Life’ research team. ‘Managers often identify value for money and its impact, but in fact there are few systematic evaluations of company initiatives.’ The demographic challenges facing Europe intensify the need for debate on the employment and working conditions of workers as they age. Working conditions tend to vary considerably across age groups: the effect of age on physical abilities is neither uniform nor systematic. In studies that have examined the relationship between work performance and age, no clear-cut association has been found and the results vary considerably. However, it is clear that if workers are to remain in employment for longer, working conditions need to be improved – a strategy that, apart from contributing to increasing the employment rates of older people, will benefit workers of all ages. Measures taken at company level to address this issue often combine an ergonomic review of the job, an evaluation of individual abilities and an assessment of the demands of a job, with a view to eliminating tasks that cannot be carried out by workers with reduced physical capacity. Other approaches include physical training, medical monitoring and promotion of healthy, active lifestyles. During the course of 2008, Eurofound will highlight its work on active ageing and flexible solutions in the workplace. Arguing that older workers are key to sustainable development in the EU, Eurofound contends that companies will increasingly have to rely on the experience and skills of older workers. Eurofound has an extensive range of reports and databases that support the policy and practice of active ageing policies. These include maintaining and promoting health and work ability as employees age, developing skills and continued employability of older workers, and offering suitable working conditions and employment opportunities.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0919	2010-01-07	UNK	Press           release, 28 January 2008	Limit wage subsidies in favour of EU-wide mobility grants to benefit from the opportunities of globalisation The new European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), created by the European Commission in response to widespread concerns over globalisation, should not provide temporary wage subsidies but rather prioritise career counselling services, and retraining and possibly a mobility grant, which would help displaced workers who are looking to improve their situation by covering some of the high costs of moving between Member States. This argues the 2007 annual report from the Eurofound’s European Restructuring Monitor (ERM), Restructuring and employment in the EU: The impact of globalisation. The new report examines the changing nature and economic impact of intensified trade, identifies the sectors, regions and types of jobs most affected by it and describes what active labour market policies can do to help alleviate the problems caused by globalisation. The report draws on data collected by the European Foundation in the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) as well as data from the European Labour Force Survey and the OECD. The report goes on to argue that imposing protectionist measures to address the challenge of globalisation would hamper free trade and limit the benefits it can deliver to society as a whole, while wage subsidies could simply result in other workers becoming displaced. Instead, the report recommends the application of active labour market policies, especially greater support for displaced workers in the form of assistance with job-seeking The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is designed to compensate workers who have been made redundant through trade liberalisation. The report looks at the experience of the comparable US initiative, the Trade Adjustment Act (TAA), and concludes from this that that it is difficult to direct assistance solely at workers who have been displaced as a result of trade. Such assistance could also be seen as unfair where workers displaced for reasons other than trade do not receive similar assistance. The report recommends not using the EGF to provide temporary wage subsidies: these tend to have no effect, with subsidised applicants being recruited who would have been recruited anyway, or else they result in the displaced worker getting a new job at the expense of another worker. Instead, the report promotes the concept career counselling services, and retraining and possibly a mobility grant of an intra-EU mobility grant, which would help displaced workers who are looking to improve their situation by covering some of the high costs of moving between Member States. The report also looks at examples of EU Member States that have taken alternative approaches to addressing the challenges of globalisation. In Denmark, for example, the emphasis on vocational education and training for adults makes a substantial contribution to the re-skilling of the workforce, with many commentators stating that the tripartite involvement of government and social partners in the scheme’s design and implementation is a key part of its success. Meanwhile, in Sweden, the Swedish Union of Technical and Clerical Employees in Industry (SIF) is deeply involved in engaging with management in attempting to pre-empt restructuring measures and to deal constructively with the consequences, should it occur. Central to two examples is the deep involvement of the social partners at all stages of the training programmes.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0920	2010-01-07	UNK	Press           release, 29 November 2007	Eurofound publishes its annual Industrial relations in the EU, the US, Japan, and other global economies report: Spotlight on temporary agency work, SMEs and industrial relations in the EU, Japan and US The impact of growing global competition on temporary agency work and small and medium-sized enterprises is a key focus of the annual report highlighting Industrial relations in the EU, Japan, US and other global economies. The report, just published by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound), the Dublin-based EU Agency was launched at a conference co-organised by Eurofound and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in Geneva, Switzerland on 29 and 30 November, gathering industrial relations experts from Europe, Japan, US, Asia and South America. For the first time, the report also includes data on emerging economies, notably Brazil, China and India. The findings are produced by Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO), providing an overview of developments in the field of industrial relations in the EU and other global economies with a view to informing social dialogue and preparing decision makers for the challenges of globalisation. The report also confirms the ongoing trend of declining trade union membership and density levels in the European Union as well as in Japan and in the United States. In Japan, trade union membership was slightly above the 10 million mark in 2006, corresponding to an estimated trade union density level of 18.2%. This represents a 3.3% drop in trade union density since 2000, or a drop of 1.5 million members. In the US, almost 15.4 million trade union members were recorded in 2006, representing 12% of all wage and salary workers since 2000. A similar downward trend in trade union membership, albeit at generally higher levels and less pronounced, can be found in the EU. However, the picture is far more varied across the EU Member States, with trade union density ranging from between 70% and 80% in some Nordic countries to less than 10% in France. In relation to industrial conflict, both the US and Japan showed limited and declining levels of conflict. In the EU, industrial action followed the usual cycles of bargaining rounds in the different countries and was therefore linked to differences between employers and trade unions over the terms of agreement renewals – as was the case in Cyprus, Finland, Germany, Hungary and Italy. This year’s conference is entitled Industrial relations in the EU, the USA, Japan, and other global economies - Working time and industrial relations. Next year’s conference will focus on the areas of pay development, minimum wage and wage flexibility.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0921	2010-01-07	UNK	Press           release, 26 October 2007	Henrik Litske, 1958 - 2007 It is with very great sadness that the Foundation has learnt of the tragic and sudden death of its esteemed colleague Henrik Litske. The thoughts and sympathy of the Director and staff of the Foundation are with his family and friends at this very difficult time. Henrik Litske was born in Denmark in 1958. After graduating with a degree in Economics and working conditions from the University in Copenhagen, Henrik Litske embarked on a career in public service, beginning at the Danish Institute of Occupational Health and reaching the level of Advisor with the Danish Ministry of Labour. In 1988, he joined the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in Dublin as an expert on health and safety prevention, in particular cost-benefit analysis. During his 19 years at the Foundation, Henrik Litske’s expertise was first applied in the fields of health. He was also one of the initiators of the first European Working Conditions Survey. He then worked in the fields of sustainable development and social cohesion and social inclusion, living conditions and the European Quality of Life Survey. His latest project was about living conditions in rural Europe. Henrik Litske worked at developing the Foundation’s role in the European social debate and raising awareness of pertinent socio-economic issues. He was committed to the idea that the Foundation had a vital role to play in achieving better living and working conditions across Europe. He will be missed by all who worked with him at the Foundation and its wider tripartite network including representatives of government, employer organisations, trade unions and academic institutions in the EU Member States and beyond. The Foundation has lost a respected colleague, a most valued researcher and a recognised team member. His colleagues mourn his sudden and untimely death and extend their deepest sympathy to his family and friends.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0922	2010-01-07	UNK	Press           release, 19 July 2007	Sharp contrast in days’ leave across EU (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Marked differences exist between EU Member States in the total number of days’ leave they offer workers, with some countries having almost three-and-a-half working weeks’ more time off than others. Research findings published today from the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) show that workers in Sweden have 42 days of annual leave and public holidays combined, in contrast to workers in Estonia, who have just 26 days. In addition, the length of the working week and annual hours worked vary greatly from one country to another. On average, workers in the 12 new EU Member States work two and a half working weeks more each year than do workers in the former EU15, according to Working time developments – 2006, the annual update from Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). On average, workers in the EU15 have 35.6 days of annual leave and public holidays combined, while workers in the 12 new Member States have 31.3 days. (For the EU27 as a whole, the average is 33.7 days.) After Sweden, the countries with the greatest number of days’ leave are Germany (40 days), Italy (39 days), Luxembourg and Denmark (38 days each). The countries with the least amount of leave, after Estonia, are Latvia (27 days), Hungary (28 days) and Ireland which, with just 29 days’ of combined leave and holidays, is the lowest ranking country in the EU15. In 2006, the average length of the working week, for full-time employees working in their main job, varied from 42.1 hours in Latvia to 37.6 hours in France. While the average collectively agreed working week in the EU27 was 38.7 hours, in practice, the actual average working week was 1.2 hours longer, at 39.9 hours. The report also looks at the number of hours worked annually. Overall, the longest annual working hours in the EU are in Estonia, Latvia, Hungary, Poland and Romania, while the shortest are in France, Sweden, Denmark and Germany. Average annual hours in Estonia (1,872) are 304 hours longer than in France (1,568) – the equivalent of around 7.6 working weeks in Estonia. The annual update also focuses on the issue of ‘on-call’ work or duty arrangements, whereby workers must be available to be called into work if required by their employer. On-call arrangements are most prevalent in the healthcare, transport, and hotels and catering sectors, and most common in Norway and the Netherlands. This form of work is an ongoing source of legal disputes, particularly in the healthcare sector, concerning such issues as payment for on-call time and whether on-call duties count as working time.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0923	2010-01-07	UNK	Press           release, 9 July 2007	European workers get significant hike in pay in 2006 (DUBLIN, IRELAND) The average wages of European workers increased significantly between 2005 and 2006, according to the annual report on pay developments from Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). However, there are considerable differences between the former EU15 countries and twelve new EU Member States, both in terms of trends and the level of pay increase. The average collectively agreed nominal increases across the European Union rose from 4.9% in 2005 to 5.6% in 2006. When adjusted for inflation, the average collectively agreed wage increase across all 27 EU Member States was 2.7% in 2006, up from 1.9% in 2005. There were large differences between countries with regard to real wage increases. In the former EU15 countries, the average increase in 2006 stood at 2.9%, up from 2.8% in 2005, while the rate of real increase rose from 0.6% in 2005 to 0.8% in 2006. More significantly, however, the average increase in the 12 new Member States rose from 7.5% in 2005 to 9.1%.in 2006, and the rate of real increase climbed from 3.5% to 5.2%. ‘While the overall figures for the 27 EU Member States indicate continued moderation in terms of both nominal and real pay increases in Europe, in line with EU monetary policy, the findings in this report regarding the twelve new EU Member States paint a different picture,’ said Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director. ‘However, these findings are good news for workers in the twelve new EU Member States. The pay gap between workers in the former EU15 and the twelve new EU Member States is closing rapidly.’ According to the findings, the overall picture in all 27 Member States of the European Union shows ongoing moderation in real and nominal pay increases in the former EU15 countries and an upward trend in the twelve new EU Member States. In the new EU Member States, the average nominal pay was 3.1 times higher than in EU15 in 2006 and the real wage increase was 6.5 times higher. In the new Member States, real pay increases varied from just 1% in Cyprus to 16% in Latvia, indicating a wider variation range than in the former EU15 countries. The real average increase in the new Member States came in it at 5.2% in 2006, up from 3.5 % in the previous year. For the former EU15 countries, the range of real pay increases in 2006 was between 2.6% in Greece and -0.1% in Germany. The real average increase in the former EU15 countries in 2005 stood at only 0.6%, rising to 0.8% in 2006. The annual update from Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) aims to provide a broad, general indication of trends in pay increases over 2005 and 2006 across the EU Member States and Norway. The report also examines collectively agreed pay increases in metalworking, banking and local government, increases in minimum wage levels, increases in average earnings, and the gender pay gap.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0924	2010-01-07	UNK	Press           release, 30 October 2007	Getting the balance right on mobility: an EU/US perspective (Dublin, Ireland) Europe is dealing with the growing challenges of globalisation, rapid technological change and a developing knowledge society. Maintaining employment and social cohesion is a further challenge. The Lisbon agenda seeks to meet these challenges by making Europe a more competitive, flexible and adaptable economy. Greater labour mobility between regions and between jobs is a crucial element in this. Recent research from the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) has confirmed that around 2% of the EU workforce was born in a different Member State than their current state of residence. Approximately 4% of the EU population has lived in another EU country while another 3% has lived in a country outside the Union. It is often argued that this level of mobility is too low, in comparison to the US, for instance. In the US, 32% of the population live outside the state in which they were born. Including regions in the comparison changes the picture considerably: approximately 21% of the EU population has lived in a region (or country) other than their own. Even so, the level is still below that of the US. The need for greater flexibility and adaptability on the part of workers, and the extent and structure of their actual mobility is the subject of much debate. What is the dominant policy discourse on these questions on both sides of the Atlantic? How does this discourse differ between Europe and the US and where does it converge? How much mobility is required? What are the benchmarks required to determine the necessary or optimal level of mobility? These and other questions will be addressed at the conference Labour mobility in a transatlantic perspective, held at the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) in Loughlinstown, Co. Dublin, on 30-31 October. Speakers from both sides of the Atlantic include Sean Gorman, Secretary General, Irish Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Ron Bird, Chief Economist, Bureau of International Labor Affairs, US Department of Labor, Catalene Passchier from the European Trade Union Congress (ETUC), and Heide Loughheed from the Irish Business and Employers Confederation (IBEC). The event, which is co-organised by Eurofound and the German Marshall Fund of the United States, is open to journalists.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0925	2010-01-07	UNK	Press           release, 30 July 2007	"European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) quarterly: Most job cuts due to internal restructuring (DUBLIN, IRELAND) A total of 72,051 job cuts were announced in Europe between 1 April and 30 June 2007 as a result of 335 company restructuring cases, the latest European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) quarterly reveals. The UK records the largest numbers of job losses, followed by Poland, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany. These five countries made up 67% of all announced job losses in this quarter. In line with figures from previous editions of the ERM quarterly, internal restructuring remains the most frequent reason for job losses (55%), followed by bankruptcy/closure (21%) and merger/acquisition (15%). Surprisingly, off-shoring and delocalisation accounted for less than 3% of all jobs lost. Over the same period, 95,588 new jobs were announced. According to the ERM, the great majority (97%) of all planned new job creations are due to expanding business activities. The commerce sector leads the way with an estimated 14,300 new jobs, followed by the announcement of 12,400 jobs in the post and telecommunications sector. New Member States account for 73% of new job creations. This quarterly report includes a country focus on Bulgaria and Romania, exploring the economic and labour market issues related to company restructuring. During the second quarter of 2007, 2,200 new jobs were announced in Bulgaria and 6,000 in Romania. The report also provides a brief overview of recent restructuring activities in Malta and Cyprus. The European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) is a tool that records industrial restructuring cases as reported in the press. All announcements involving the reduction or creation of at least 100 jobs or affecting 10% of the workforce in sites employing 250 people or more are taken into account. The cases are identified through a review of daily papers and the financial press in the 27 Member States of the European Union and Norway.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0926	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 14 June 2007	EUROFOUND CELEBRATES THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF EIRO: A decade of benchmarking industrial relations in Europe (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Europe’s leading monitoring instrument – offering reliable and up-to-date news and information on industrial relations developments in Europe – marks its 10th anniversary on 14 June 2007. Over the past ten years, EIRO has published over 9,000 articles and documents on its website, registering more than 3.6 million user sessions in 2006. Today, EIRO publishes between 70 and 80 articles per month, attracting over 80,000 user sessions in May 2007. The short news bulletins about current industrial relations developments across Europe are uploaded to EIRO on a weekly basis. Most viewers appreciate the longer, comparative studies and articles on changes in legislation, minimum wages and gender pay gap, annual updates on pay and working time developments. EIRO also contains a wealth of other information such as thematic reports and national industrial relations profiles on all EU Member States. ‘The European Industrial Relations Observatory is a leading driving force in Eurofound’s ambition to both monitor living and working conditions in Europe, and to provide policy-makers with recommendations on how to improve it,’ says Jorma Karppinen, Director of the Dublin-based EU agency European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions hosting EIRO. ‘In fact, EIRO was Eurofound’s first website, and its success has been ensured by the strong and direct involvement of European social partners, its competitive advantage of being the only pan-European online database on industrial relations, and by providing comparative, yet news-oriented information and analysis.’ The European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) was set up in 1997, at the request of the European Commission. EIRO has over the past decade served its growing audience of European, international and national-level policy-makers, specialists, commentators and the general public with up-to-date information and comparative analysis of industrial relations developments across the European Union. EIRO’s monitoring activities are carried out by a network of correspondents, drawn from leading research institutes in the 27 EU Member States and Norway, with one centre reporting on EU-level developments. To extend the coverage of industrial relations developments beyond the EU, since 2001 EIRO has been working with experts in Brazil, China, Japan and the USA. An EU dictionary of industrial relations containing over 300 entries complements the observatory information, together with a comprehensive list of relevant links by country.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0927	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 14 June 2007	EUROFOUND LAUNCHES ITS 2006 EUROPEAN INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS REVIEW: Collective bargaining developments act as spur to industrial relations across Europe (BRUSSELS, BELGIUM) Despite an increasing focus on gender equality in Europe, resulting in a range of policy initiatives and legal regulations, there is evidence to indicate that gender equality in careers is still some way off. These are among the findings of the European Industrial Relation Observatory (EIRO) in its latest annual review of industrial relations developments in Europe. The research reveals that even though women’s careers are changing, the nature of this change can best be described as a gradual erosion of traditional patterns, rather than a transformation that is likely to significantly improve opportunities for women. The EIRO Annual Review of Industrial relations developments in Europe 2006 reviews the year’s main activities in European social dialogue and employment legislation and policy, while also presenting a comparative overview of the most noteworthy industrial relations developments at national level. It examines the key issues covered by collective bargaining and looks at developments in the area of social partner activity and industrial action. It highlights in particular the issues of cross-border mobility and reconciliation of work and private life. According to the review, the volume of collective agreements overall in the EU Member States remained much the same as in previous years. However, the previously narrow bargaining agendas in the new EU Member States have been widened during 2006, for example in Estonia, where agreements cover the termination and suspension of employment contracts, occupational health and safety, social guarantees and union–employer cooperation. Other significant collective bargaining agreements during the year include the agreement on promoting the employment of older workers and on diversity and non-discrimination at work in France. A new agreement covering temporary agency workers in Austria obliges employers to set up a retraining fund to finance certain further training measures, in particular on behalf of more vulnerable employee groups. A new national agreement signed in Ireland stipulates that the social partners must give consideration to pensions, both in terms of their adequacy and coverage, as ‘a priority issue’. Finally, training is included in collective bargaining in Germany, exemplified by a new agreement in North Rhine-Westphalia that obliges employers and works councils to identify, once a year, employees’ need for continuing training. 2006 was also a busy year for trade union merger activity in some countries, while there was also some restructuring of employers’ representation and a range of developments in the field of social dialogue. In Austria, Lithuania, Denmark, Slovenia, Romania and Malta, there was increasing cooperation between trade unions. Employer organisations in Bulgaria and Romania merged to form umbrella bodies, while in Lithuania and Portugal, employers moved towards closer cooperation.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0928	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 5 June 2007	Eurofound presents analysis on mobility in Europe at Employment Week 2007: Ensuring long-term success of mobility with better balance between economic gains and social integration (BRUSSELS, BELGIUM) Local authorities in Europe must play a far more pro-active role in facilitating access to affordable and decent housing for migrants across Europe, according to the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound). Labour market research shows that language proficiency, adequate qualifications and their recognition as well as access to the informal labour market are key conditions for successful labour market integration. Six out of ten people (62%) in the European Union view geographical mobility as a ‘good thing’, according to Eurofound research. Most people also believe it to be good for the labour market and the economy generally, as well as for the individual. More importantly, nine out of ten people who have moved country or region see positive results in one way or another: more than one third report better housing conditions, one quarter have a higher income and a better job situation for themselves or their partner, and 15% report a better quality of work and a better local quality of life. What do people view as the main barriers to move to another country? Almost 60% of respondents say that the main barrier is the lack of language skills, 30% say it is the difficulty in finding employment in the new country and nearly a quarter say it is adapting to another culture. Migration is a trade-off between personal economic gains in terms of higher income, better job and career combined with a better lifestyle on the one hand and the concerns of losing social contacts, support from family and friends combined with the cost of moving (acquiring another language and adjusting to another culture) on the other hand. ‘To ensure the long-term success of mobility in Europe it is imperative to strike the right balance between economic gains and social integration, and mobility and stability,’ says Hubert Krieger, research manager at Eurofound. ‘Local authorities spearheading effective and preventive urban integration policy would provide an important contribution to better mobility in Europe.’ Eurofound’s research rejects the notion of a migration exodus, a European-wide mobility landslide. The intention of Europeans to move to another country in the next five years is relatively low and hardly spectacular: only below 3% of all Europeans expect to move to another European country and around 7% to another region. Also, not all people stating that they intend to move will do so. Existing social ties and socio-cultural differences are major barriers to cross-border migration, although less so in new Member States. Eurofound estimates that about one third to one half of people stating they would like to move will actually move. This means that overall between 1% and 1.5% of Europeans will move to another EU country in the next five years and between 2.8% to 3.5% to another region.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0929	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 5 June 2007	Eurofound highlights working conditions in Europe at Employment Week 2007: Quality of work in Europe – a top priority (BRUSSELS, BELGIUM) Improving the quality of work should be a top priority in the EU, according to the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) in its Fourth European Working Conditions Survey. Putting the accent on quality will be necessary in order to achieve sustainable, socially cohesive economic growth in a competitive global environment. This means increasing labour market participation as well as creating better and more productive jobs – key to contributing to the prosperity that underpins the European social model. Eurofound’s research points to the difficulty in defining exactly what constitutes a good quality job. Employers’ expectations such as worker commitment and adaptability can be considered key elements of job quality, alongside more traditional dimensions such as pay, health and job security. Four out of five workers in the EU are satisfied with working conditions generally, according to Eurofound’s survey. But satisfaction with specific aspects of work, such as pay or possibilities for career advancement, tends to be significantly lower. It is also the case that health and safety risks at work remain an important concern, especially among workers from newer Member States. So, too, is the finding that levels of access to training have not increased in Europe over the last 10 years. The Foundation’s European Working Conditions Surveys, conducted every five years since 1990, provide a valuable insight into quality-of-work issues. The fourth survey presents the views of workers on a wide range of issues including work organisation, working time, equal opportunities, training, health and well-being, and job satisfaction. The interviews were carried out in late 2005 with nearly 30,000 workers in 31 countries (the EU25, the then acceding countries, Bulgaria and Romania, as well as Croatia, Norway, Switzerland, and Turkey).

EUROFOUND_UNK_0930	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 23 May 2007	Eurofound publishes comparative overview report on migrant workers in Europe: Migrants in Europe face severe challenges (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Legal immigration of non-nationals into the EU has increased in the last decade by more than 26%, according to the latest comparative overview from Eurofound’s European Working Conditions Observatory (EWCO). Immigrants play an increasingly important role in the labour markets of EU Member States, but the disadvantages experienced by immigrants represent a major challenge for social and labour market policies in Europe, the report states. The report, which investigates the working and employment conditions of migrant workers who travel from one country to another for any reason and work as employees or self-employed people in the country of destination, also finds that migrants in Europe are segregated into low-paid jobs that offer limited opportunities for upward mobility. They are more likely than non-migrants to suffer unhealthy conditions at work, to work longer hours, and to perform shift work, night work, and weekend work. They are also more frequently exposed to discrimination in the workplace, by supervisors, colleagues, customers or patients. ‘The recruitment of migrant workers plays an important role in the economic development in Europe, and migrant workers play an increasingly important role in EU labour markets. Although there is increasing awareness of the crucial role played by migrant workers in fostering economic growth, greater attention needs to be paid to their working and employment conditions,’ said Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director in a comment to the report. In most countries, these workers tend to be segregated in unskilled occupations and are also more likely to perform undeclared work. Despite being a particularly vulnerable segment of the labour force, migrant workers are often poorly represented by trade unions, according to the report. They face higher unemployment rates and, when employed, are more likely to be overqualified for the job they do, representing a significant waste of human capital and considerable inequality. Moreover, they are exposed to considerable job insecurity. Migrant workers’ poor working conditions can be linked to difficulties in obtaining a work permit, even in countries where there are labour supply shortages. They also face obstacles in acquiring citizenship and can thereby be excluded from access to such skilled occupations as public sector employment, the professions and business activity.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0931	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 19 February 2007	Despite EU-wide statutory rights to parental leave, big differences still exist Working time arrangements can have a significant bearing on the efficiency, productivity and competitiveness of companies, not to mention the health, well-being and motivation of their employees, Eurofound argues in its recent analysis on part-time work in Europe. Although the right to parental leave has been established in all EU Member States, important differences continue to exist between countries with regard to policy provisions and patterns of take-up of such leave by parents. Just over half of Europe’s companies and public authorities with 10 or more employees have had staff on parental leave in the past three years, a new analysis of the Foundation’s European Establishment Survey on Working Time 2004-2005 has found. Sweden, with some 89% of establishments making use of the option to take parental leave, is the clear leader among the 21 countries surveyed – the former EU15 countries plus the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Hungary, Latvia, Poland and Slovenia. Finland is ranked second at 80%, followed by Slovenia (63%) and Belgium (61%). At the other end of the ranking, Poland comes in third last (45%), then Portugal (44%) and, at the bottom, Spain (25%). These differences, the report points out, may be explained by national variations in statutory provisions, in addition to other societal differences such as public childcare provision and labour market conditions. The key components of parental leave schemes in all countries surveyed are a statutory entitlement part and a financial provision part; the latter provides for either moderate or high earnings replacement levels. Not surprisingly, the take-up rates of parental leave are high in the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland and Sweden) where the existing schemes are flexible and underwritten by high earnings replacement levels. In these countries, most women choose to benefit from parental leave and return to employment afterwards, with comprehensive childcare services and other reconciliation measures as support. Take-up rates are more moderate in France, the Netherlands and Spain where between one third and two thirds of mothers make use of their parental leave entitlement. Elsewhere, take-up rates of parental leave by mothers are much lower, including in five of the countries – Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and the UK – where parental leave is unpaid, but also in Belgium where a flat-rate payment is available. In Luxembourg and Austria, parental leave take-up is at best moderate. The survey also set out to examine the companies’ attitudes to parental leave. It found that just 11% of the establishments with recent experience of parental leave reported having encountered problems as a result. However, over half of the establishments reported difficulties in finding replacement staff for those on parental leave and half of them also mentioned continuity of staff and work problems. Uncertainty about if or when the employees on parental leave will return to work represented a problem in 44% of companies while a sizeable proportions of establishments mentioned having problems with too many staff absent on leave (24%) and reintegration difficulties with staff returning to work (22%).

EUROFOUND_UNK_0932	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 8 March 2007	Eurofound celebrates INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY 2007: Gender gap still wide for working women in the EU Despite advances in women’s employment in recent years, Europe’s labour markets and workplaces remain largely unequal. The gap in pay levels between men and women is still wide; few women make it to top management positions, and women in part-time jobs work more than men in full-time jobs. In the light of International Women's Day on Thursday 8 March 2007, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) is highlighting its recent research and work on women and equality issues. The amount of time that Europeans spend in paid work has consistently declined over the past 15 years, according to the recently published fourth European Working Conditions Survey. However, working women spend more time in unpaid work than do working men in all European countries, when weekly working hours are combined together with time spend commuting to and from work, caring for children and the elderly, and doing house work. ‘While our research shows that men work longer hours than women in paid employment in all countries, women in fact work more hours than men when paid and unpaid working hours are combined,’ says Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director. ‘Employment levels in Europe won’t increase unless we solve the issues of care for children and the elderly, address gender inequalities in domestic tasks and improve working time options that promote better work-life balance for both women and men.’ Recent research findings from Eurofound have also illustrated a positive trend of women moving into high management or decision-making positions in European workplaces. Over the past 15 years, the percentage of women superiors has risen from 20% in 1995, to 23% in 2000, to 25% in 2005. However, there are still substantial differences between countries. The highest proportions of women in supervisory and managerial positions are in the Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands as well as in the eastern European countries, reaching nearly 40% in Finland and Estonia. In contrast, southern European countries and some continental countries, have the lowest proportions – less than 20% in Germany and Italy. Women continue to be paid less than men, despite collective agreements and minimum wage legislation that is in principle gender-neutral. The gender pay gap is, however, smaller in the new EU Member States than in the former EU15 countries. The difference between the gross hourly pay of men and women in the former EU15 and Norway, for example, was 18.1% in 2005, down from 20.4% in 2001. In the new Member States, the difference in hourly pay is somewhat more equal and has remained broadly stable at around 17% over the period 2003–2005. In the European Union of 27 countries, the lowest hourly-wage pay gap is found in Malta (4%, i.e. where a woman on average earns 96% of a man’s salary). The widest gap is in Germany where the figure is 26%. All in all, there are still more women in the lower earning categories than men. Although the right to parental leave has been established in all EU Member States, important differences continue to exist between countries with regard to policy provisions and take-up patterns. Just over half of Europe’s companies and public authorities with 10 or more employees have had staff on parental leave in the previous three years. Not surprisingly, the take-up rates of parental leave are high in the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland and Sweden) where existing schemes are flexible and underwritten by high earnings replacement levels. In these countries, most women choose to benefit from parental leave and return to employment afterwards, with comprehensive childcare services and other reconciliation measures as support. Take-up rates are more moderate in France, the Netherlands and Spain where between one third and two thirds of mothers make use of their parental leave entitlement. Elsewhere, take-up rates of parental leave by mothers are much lower, including in five of the countries – Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and the UK – where parental leave is unpaid, but also in Belgium where a flat-rate payment is available. In Luxembourg and Austria, parental leave take-up is at best moderate.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0933	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 14 February 2007	Strengthening the competitive advantage of Europe’s biomedical health care sector Strengthening the competitiveness of Europe’s biomedical health care sector is vital if value-creating research, development and jobs are to remain in Europe, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound), the Dublin-based EU Agency, argues. In an effort to boost the competitive advantage of the sector in competition with those in the United States and Asia, Eurofound has contracted the Danish Technological Institute to map the current and future challenges the sector is facing, as well as finding ways how to address the lack of funding and the insufficient supply of qualified employees in Europe. The 2163 European biotechnology companies employ over 96,500 people and generates over EUR 21.5 billion in revenue (2004). Compared to other industries, Europe’s biotechnology industry is small in numbers, but it is nonetheless vital when it comes to driving economic growth and innovation in other European industries such as the pharmaceutical industry, industrial production (washing powder etc.), agriculture, and food production. ‘European policy-makers, as well as business executives and employees in Europe’s biomedical health care sector, need a comprehensive understanding of change and the consequences of change on their sector, so that they can respond to an effective and proactive way,’ says Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director. ‘This study is aimed at ensuring that company strategies, competences of the employees, and the regulatory framework meet future challenges.’ The first step in the study is to map the trends and key drivers of change in the sector. Second, in order to illustrate the challenges facing different types of companies in the sector and the different paths taken by companies to ensure competitiveness and growth, the study will include four company portraits and two case studies of clusters. Based on the insights from the case studies, future scenarios will be developed, enabling legislators, employers and employees to reflect on their choice of strategies for the future. ‘In our experience, the combination of a concise mapping of a sector together with in-depth case studies and a set of thought-provoking scenarios offer an eminent starting point for strategic considerations and decisions within the companies and organisations within that sector,’ says project manager Tine Andersen from the Danish Technological Institute. ’Therefore, it is our hope that our results will be studied and discussed by stakeholders, legislators, and in the companies that we aim to portray.’ The project ends in September 2007. However, the mapping report will be available in March 2007, and the six case studies are conducted and published from March to May 2007. The scenarios will be available on the project’s website in August 2007. Read more about the project.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0934	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 8 February 2007	Higher business confidence is positive for Europe’s labour markets Business confidence in Europe is at very high levels and possible resurgence in domestic demand is good news for EU labour markets, the latest European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) quarterly predicts. With dampened inflation and falling unemployment figures in practically all EU27 Member States, the positive outlook in this quarter continues the trend outlined in the previous ERM quarterly. Despite an increased number of restructuring cases and job losses during the fourth and final quarter of 2006, the number of new jobs created during the same period increased by approximately 20% over the previous quarter. A total of 141,069 new jobs were announced during the fourth quarter 2006, the ERM quarterly reports. A great majority (95%) of all planned new job creations are due to expanding business activities, with the French health and social work sector leading the way with an estimated 30,000 new jobs. This is followed by the announcement of 5,000 news jobs in the Hungarian Air Forces, by 4,000 new jobs at Glasgow Airport in the United Kingdom, and 3,000 new jobs respectively at Tesco (commerce) and Natixis (financial services) in France. During the same period, 95,661 job cuts were announced. Poland and Hungary record the largest numbers of job losses, followed by the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy. These five countries made up 63% of all announced job losses in this quarter. Similar to previous reports in the ERM quarterly, internal restructuring (59.6%) remains the most frequent reason for jobs losses, followed by bankruptcy/closure (14.1%) and merger/acquisition (12%). It is notable that off-shoring/delocalisation only amounted to less than 9 % of all jobs lost. The latest ERM quarterly also looks at two cases of strategic importance for European industry. The first concerns the German car giant Volkswagen, following on from previously reported cases, outlining how job cuts originally envisaged in Germany will now take place in other European countries. The second case concerns EADS, the leading European aerospace and defence group which has recently encountered severe problems with the Airbus A380.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0935	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 25 April 2007	High business confidence reflected in many new jobs across Europe (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Economic growth and expectations in Europe remain positive, with high business confidence and falling unemployment levels, the latest European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) quarterly reports. Much of the economic data, particularly for Germany, is better than it has been for many years, and the slowdown in the US economy continues without any apparent impact in Europe. Despite an overall increase in the number of restructuring cases and job losses during the first quarter of 2007, the number of new jobs created during the same period increased by almost one third (30%) over the previous quarter. A total of 184,500 new jobs were announced during the first quarter of 2007, the ERM quarterly reports. The largest number of announced job creations was found in the UK, accounting for 29% of the total. This is largely due to one single case, John Lewis Ltd, which announced the creation of 35,000 jobs over the next 10 years. Also in the commerce sector, Asda announced the creation of 8,000 jobs in the UK by the end of 2007. As in the previous quarter, Poland ranks second, its planned job creation being distributed among many cases. The largest ones are the Polish police force and the mining company KGHM, which announced the creation of 7,000 and 2,300 jobs, respectively. In Germany, Romania and France, just a few cases made up the main share of planned job creation. During the same period, 132,700 job cuts were announced. The Czech Republic records the largest number of job losses, followed by France, the UK, Italy and Germany. In this quarter, these five countries make up 77.5% of all announced job losses. Similar to previous reports in the ERM quarterly, the most frequent category is internal restructuring, which has increased its share to 76.8% (59.6% in the previous quarter), followed by bankruptcy/closure (9.9%). It is notable that off-shoring/delocalisation only amounts to 5.5% of all jobs lost, below the 9% mark reported in previous quarters. The thematic sections of this edition of the ERM quarterly explore the restructuring cases of Alcatel-Lucent, the Franco-US technologies giant, and EADS, the leading European aerospace and defence group. The report also provides a brief overview of recent restructuring activities in Malta and Cyprus.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0936	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 24 January 2007	Announcing Eurofound’s Programme of Work 2007: Improving living and working conditions in the EU The annual programme of work for 2007 of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) outlines a series of activities that provide added value to its stakeholders and users of its knowledge. Among the highlights in 2007: secondary analysis of the European Working Conditions Survey, fieldwork for the second European Quality of Life Survey, expansion of the Network of European Observatories (NEO) to 28 countries, more focused communication and promotion activities, and contributions to the 2007 European Year of Equal Opportunities. Eurofound will continue to use a variety of research strategies in carrying out its work in 2007. Large-scale representative surveys provide unique data on the economic and social situation in Europe, marked in 2007 by the second European Quality of Life Survey. While the main focus will be on the EU, the work will also touch on the candidate and neighbouring countries, and to some extent also involve comparisons of the EU vis-à-vis global competition. ‘The thrust of the research will include social, economic, legal and competitiveness factors to study the improvement of living and working conditions,’ says Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director. ‘In 2007, the skills and resources of Eurofound will be developed to meet the new objectives: more forecast-oriented work, including some global comparisons, innovation, productivity and competitiveness. Eurofound expects to have a staff of 94 and a budget of EUR 20.2 million. The four strategic research themes – employment and restructuring, working conditions and work–life balance, industrial relations and partnership, and social cohesion and quality of life – altogether encompass 25 research initiatives. Eleven of these are new in 2007, including sectoral employment level forecasts, undeclared work, the role of micro-companies in employment growth, the self-employed, working conditions and social dialogue, industrial relations at global corporate level, and regional-level developments and business creation. During the course of the year, Eurofound’s communication efforts will be focused on better understanding its customers’ needs, more tailor-made information products, better timing of contributions to the public debates, with the overall aim of increasing its visibility and intensifying Eurofound’s impact on decision-makers.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0937	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 22 January 2007	Better web access to the Foundation’s information The Foundation is improving access to its research, data and recommendations by bringing its specialised websites under the umbrella of the new look Eurofound website. At the same time, the Foundation is re-branded – online and offline – as Eurofound. ‘We are improving the Eurofound website, our primary communication channel, with the increasing numbers of users in mind,’ says Jorma Karppinen, Director of the European Foundation. ‘To strengthen our brand, increase visibility and to avoid any confusion over the long official name in growing number of EU languages, the Foundation will be promoted as Eurofound from now on.’ With an increasing number of information users in the former EU15 countries, new EU Member States and in the EU acceding and candidate countries, the new Eurofound website is equipped with better search functionality, shorter and clearer reports, and more graphics. The common look and feel of all websites is the result of a common structure and some common features of all four specialist websites, initiated to accommodate new and improved search facilities using integrated Google search technology, and improved accessibility for users with a disability. The 27 EU Member States are covered in the majority of the Foundation’s web products, which include: European Working Conditions Observatory (EWCO) – information on quality of work and employment European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) – information on industrial relations European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) – information on restructuring and industrial change EurLife - statistical indicators on quality of life. The decision to move to one single design came as a result of user testing on the main site which showed significant improvements in usability following the redesign in 2005. During 2006, the web usage of the Foundation’s corporate website Eurofound increased by 36% to 2.6 million users. This increase was in line with the increases experienced by both the European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) at 28% and the European Working Conditions Observatory (EWCO) at 24%. It was, however, the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) that increased the most at 54%.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0938	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 7 December 2006	FIRST FINDINGS OF THE FOURTH EUROPEAN WORKING CONDITIONS SURVEY: Good career prospects here, say workers in Malta More workers in Malta (44%) consider that their job offers good prospects for career advancement in any other country in Europe (32%), the first findings of the Fourth European Working Conditions Survey show. The survey paints a rosy picture of working conditions in Malta in comparison to countries in the European Union, but it raises serious concerns over work-related health effects among its workers. Workers in Malta are satisfied with their working conditions, due largely to job security, a positive working atmosphere and good opportunities to learn and grow. The representative survey found that four out of five Maltese workers (81%) are satisfied with working conditions, and only a limited amount (15%) fear losing their job in the coming six months. More than every third worker (35%) has undergone paid-for training in the previous six months, and every second worker (51%) believes they can still do their job at the age of 60. Work in Malta is characterised by a high degree of worker autonomy. The survey shows that over four out of five (84%) of workers in Malta can choose or change their order of tasks, their methods of work, and their speed of work. In the European Union of 25 countries, only three out of five workers (67%) enjoy the equivalent work organisation possibilities. However, every second (52%) worker in Malta says that work affects their health, which is considerably higher than the average in the European Union of 25 countries (35%). Almost one in three (29%) complain of backache, compared to one in four (23%) across the EU25. Also muscular pains (30%), headaches (23%) and backache (29%) are well above the European averages (21%, 14% and 23% respectively). Almost one in three workers (28%) also report high levels of stress at work, higher than the average levels for EU25 (21%). ‘These first results from the European Working Conditions Survey is overall positive for workers in Malta, but with some areas of serious concern, most notably in regards to health,’ says Jorma Karppinen, the Foundation’s director. ‘Social policymakers in Malta are continuously challenged to reach the goals of improved employment levels and quality of work as laid out in the Lisbon criteria.’ The Foundation’s European Working Conditions Surveys, conducted every five years, provide a valuable insight into quality-of-work issues since 1990. The fourth survey presents the views of workers on a wide range of issues including work organisation, working time, equal opportunities, training, health and wellbeing and job satisfaction. The interviews were carried out in late 2005 with nearly 30,000 workers in 31 countries (the EU25, the two acceding countries, Bulgaria and Romania, as well as Croatia, Norway, Switzerland, and Turkey).

EUROFOUND_UNK_0939	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 5 December 2006	"THE FOURTH EUROPEAN WORKING CONDITIONS SURVEY: Italians less satisfied with work than most European workers Also available: italiano Workers in Italy are less satisfied with their jobs than average among European workers, the first findings of the Fourth European Working Conditions Survey show. More than every second worker in Italy would argue that their job-skills correspond well to their tasks at work, but only every fifth worker would have undergone paid-for job-skills training in the previous 12 months. Stress is the most common work-related health symptom among Italian workers, new research from the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions reveals. Italian workers report common work-related health symptoms (backache, headache, overall fatigue) on par with average levels for the 25 countries of the European Union, but a significantly higher number of workers in Italy (27%) compared to the rest of Europe (22%) cite stress as the main work-related health symptom. The representative survey also put work practices under the spotlight. On average, Italian workers report high level of autonomy (79%). However, a lower percentage of workers (51%) says to get support and assistance from colleagues compared to two of three (67%) in the rest of Europe. A similar picture can be given for assistance from a superior: 34% compared to 56% for the EU25. This is also reflected in comparatively low levels of teamwork in the Italian workplaces; only four out of ten (39%) of Italians report that their work regularly involves team collaboration, as opposed to more than five out of ten (55%) on average in the rest of the European Union of 25 countries. ‘These first results from the Fourth European Working Conditions Survey show a negative trend in relation to some aspects of working conditions in Italy over the past five years’ says Jorma Karppinen, Director of the European Foundation. ‘Italian policy-makers are challenged to improve target areas such as training and health-related issues in the run up to meeting the Lisbon criteria of improved employment levels and quality of work’. On a positive note, the report shows that workplace smoking restrictions in Italy have been effective. Along with the other European countries, in which workplace smoking has been banned or restricted in recent years (eg. Ireland, The Netherlands, Sweden), Italy shows one of the lowest rates of exposure to passive smoking in the workplace, 9% compared to an average of 20% for the EU25. The Foundation’s European Working Conditions Surveys, conducted every five years, provide a valuable insight into quality-of-work issues since 1990. The fourth survey presents the views of workers on a wide range of issues including work organisation, working time, equal opportunities, training, health and wellbeing and job satisfaction. The interviews were carried out in late 2005 with nearly 30,000 workers in 31 countries (the EU25, the two acceding countries, Bulgaria and Romania, as well as Croatia, Norway, Switzerland, and Turkey).

EUROFOUND_UNK_0940	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 29 November 2006	NEW STUDY ON MOBILITY IN EUROPE: Mass migration a myth in an enlarged Europe, new report says Only 4% of European citizens have ever moved to another country in the European Union and less than 3% to another country outside the EU, a study on Mobility in Europe by the Foundation reveals. While European policy stresses the importance of mobility, the research findings beg the question: are Europeans afraid of change? Geographical mobility is generally perceived as a ‘good thing’ for European integration by a solid majority of 62% of respondents, the study on Mobility in Europe by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, has found. Mobility is also generally perceived as a good thing for the employment-related domains of ‘the labour market’ and ‘the economy’, as well as for the ‘individual’. The new report is a descriptive analysis of the data collected by a Eurobarometer survey in the second half of 2005, examining geographical mobility and job mobility in detail. The survey results confirm the moderate rate of mobility across Europe: only 4% of EU citizens have ever moved to another country in the EU and less than 3% to another country outside the EU. Asked about their intentions to move in the future, only 3% of all EU citizens indicate that they might move to another EU country in the next five years. However, considerable variation does exist between countries. ‘Geographical mobility of labour remains a major policy challenge for Europe,’ says Jorma Karppinen, the Foundation’s Director. ‘On the one hand there is concern that too little geographical mobility between regions and Member States will have negative consequences on labour market adaptability and competitiveness. On the other hand, the difficulties posed by a ‘brain (and youth) drain’ may be far more serious for the poorer regions of eastern Europe than the challenges which will face the richer parts of central and northern Europe in trying to integrate migrant workers.’ The pattern of future labour migration from the new Member States to the EU15 countries is set to vary widely, while its overall extent will remain limited, the Foundation predicts. In the medium- to long-term, however, it warns that the greatest challenges lie in the impact of youth and ‘brain drain’ for the sending rather than the receiving countries. The research examines the different reasons why people would want to migrate. In the new Member States, work-related factors such as higher household income (59%) and better working conditions (57%), as well as the opportunity to discover new things (30%), feature high on the list of priorities. In contrast, in the EU15 countries,, reasons why people would want to migrate fall into the ‘lifestyle and fun’ category: discovering new environments (64%) and meeting new people (39%). A quarter of respondents from the EU15 countries mentioned ‘better weather’ as a serious reason to migrate.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0941	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 11 September 2006	Helping local authorities to integrate migrants The increasing number of workers migrating within the European Union has put the integration issue high on the policy agenda of national and local policymakers. To support the social and economic integration and full participation of migrants, especially at local level, the European Foundation is launching the Network of Cities for Local Integration Policy (CLIP). The economic, social and cultural integration of migrants represents both a challenge and an opportunity for all Member States of the European Union. Many of the challenges have to be dealt with at local level. Cities and local authorities have a vital role to play not only in the implementation of integration policies but also in the development of innovative policies on housing, education and cultural diversity. In order to support cities to implement their local integration policies successfully, the European Foundation, the Council of Europe and the City of Stuttgart have jointly set up the network of Cities for Local Integration Policy (CLIP). The network will be launched by Councillor Vincent Jackson, Lord Mayor of Dublin, Dr Wolfgang Schuster, Mayor of Stuttgart, and Dick Roche TD, Irish Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The CLIP network brings together 25 large European cities in a joint learning process which will extend over several years. It aims to support the social and economic integration and full participation of migrants, to combat social inequalities and discrimination of migrants, to create conditions leading to peaceful coexistence between migrants and the native population and to help migrants to preserve their own cultural identity. ‘Past experiences have taught us that any immigration policy has to be accompanied by a coherent and well-resourced integration policy, including proper placement, adequate acquisition of knowledge and cultural standards, and close interaction with the receiving society,’ says Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s Deputy Director. ‘The CLIP network seeks to fill a gap in the analysis and evaluation of recent efforts by local authorities to coordinate their activities and learn from each other, and contributes to the European Commission’s efforts to coordinate European integration policy between the Member States.” The cities are supported in their peer review process by a group of expert European research centres in Oxford, Vienna, Liege, Amsterdam and Bamberg. The scientific support should enable cities to evaluate their policies, to understand what works and to avoid mistakes made in other cities. This initiative will provide useful opportunities for cities in the European Union, which are in the start-up phase of new integration policies. Read more on this topic.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0942	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 18 September 2006	Europe’s manufacturing sector hard hit by job losses Manufacturing of food, textiles and clothing are the sectors losing most jobs in the European Union, according to the first annual review from the European Restructuring Monitor, the monitoring tool of the European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC). Since 2000, eight of the top ten sectors with declining employment in the EU15 have been in manufacturing. The report attributes the decline in manufacturing to ‘developments in the former EU15 countries, while the 10 new EU Member States are “holding-up well”’. Indeed, the report shows that while the manufacture of fabricated metal products is in the top ten declining sectors in former EU15, it is one of the top ten growth sectors in the ten new Member States, evidence of a geographical relocation of production. The report also identifies health, social work and education as sectors that have contributed to much of the EU15’s employment growth in recent years. According to the report, Ireland and Spain have enjoyed high employment growth during the year. Pockets of high growth are also evident in parts of France, Italy, Greece, the UK and Sweden. In the new Member States, Cyprus and Latvia show the highest employment growth, together with some areas of Poland and the Czech Republic. Hotels, restaurants and business services account for the high levels of job growth, with business services leading the way: here growth is as high as 38% in the new Member States. However, the report cautions that the overall picture in Eastern Europe is ‘rather bleak’, with the most significant decline in employment found in most of Poland and eastern Germany. In France, the region of Lorraine shows the worst employment decline. A more modest decline is evident in Greece, Italy, Denmark and the UK. The report notes that agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining and quarrying continue their long term relative decline, leading to ‘the loss of a very substantial number of jobs in 10 new EU Member States’. It anticipates that significant job loss will continue in the agricultural sector, especially in the new Member States, ‘for many years to come’, due to their adoption of the Common Agricultural Policy, and the CAP reforms taking place throughout the enlarged European Union. The new report “Restructuring and employment in the EU: Concepts, measurement and evidence” is based on the findings of the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM), which collects and presents cases of restructuring based on media reports on a quarterly basis.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0943	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 7 November 2006	"FIRST FINDINGS OF THE FOURTH EUROPEAN WORKING CONDITIONS SURVEY: Working conditions in Europe – what workers say Also available: français ¦ Deutsch European workers are satisfied with their working conditions, due largely to improved job security, a positive working atmosphere and good opportunities to learn and grow, the first findings of the fourth European Working Conditions Survey show. However, working conditions vary considerably between individual Member States, between ‘old’ and ‘new’ Member States and also between sectors, women and men and different age groups. The services sector continues to grow in importance in the European labour market, employing around 66% of workers in the 25 EU Member States and in Bulgaria and Romania, the two EU candidate countries. The percentage of workers employed in both manufacturing and agriculture is declining; manufacturing now accounts for 29% of employment and agriculture just 5%. The proportion of workers who use computers at least a quarter of the time in Europe has increased from 31% in 1991 to 47% in 2005. There has been a consistent decline over the past 15 years in the number of workers who consider their health and safety to be at risk because of their work, from 31% in 1991 to 27% in 2005. There are, however, big differences between the former EU15 countries (25%) and the new Member States (40%). ‘These first results from the European Working Conditions Survey show that although there is a definite scope for increasing productivity in Europe, policymakers are continuously challenged to reach the goals of improved employment levels and quality of work as laid out in the Lisbon criteria,’ says Jorma Karppinen, the Foundation’s director. ‘A majority of European workers report that work is interesting and offers new opportunities to learn, but access to training has not increased, particularly not for older workers, which indicates slow growth in life-long learning initiatives.’ Over the last 15 years, the percentage of workers in high-skilled white-collar occupations has risen from 32% to 38%. High-skilled white-collar jobs now account for 40% or more of the jobs in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. There are, however, substantial differences in the levels of training that employers provide, ranging from 6%–10% in the 10 new Member States and the two acceding countries, to around 40% in northern Europe. The survey shows that while women continue to move into certain categories of occupations (medium- or low-skilled service jobs such as clerical workers and service and sales workers) the proportion of workers whose immediate boss is a woman has consistently increased over the last 10 years. In the 10 new Member States, the proportion of female managers is higher than in the EU15 (29% as against 24%). The pay gap between men and women shows no signs of closing, with around half of all women in the EU25 countries firmly positioned in the lower third of the overall income scale. Some four out of five workers (80%) say they are satisfied with their work–life balance although more than 44% of those working long hours – over 48 hours a week – report being unhappy with their work–life balance. Men, particularly working fathers, report more dissatisfaction with their work–life balance than women. Standard working hours still appear to be the norm for most workers in Europe. Working hours for the majority of the EU27 workforce revolve around a five-day, 40-hour week. Over 55% of all workers work the same number of hours every day, and over 70% work the same number of days every week. The proportion of people working non-standard hours (working at night or at weekends) has fallen slightly since 1995. The Foundation’s European Working Conditions Surveys, conducted every five years, provide a valuable insight into quality-of-work issues since 1990. The fourth survey presents the views of workers on a wide range of issues including work organisation, working time, equal opportunities, training, health and wellbeing and job satisfaction. The interviews were carried out in late 2005 with nearly 30,000 workers in 31 countries (the EU25, the two acceding countries, Bulgaria and Romania, as well as Croatia, Norway, Switzerland, and Turkey). The full report of the fourth European Working Conditions Survey will be available on 15 February 2007.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0944	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 20 September 2006	High levels of life satisfaction, happiness and optimism about the future in Romania Romanians are very optimistic about the future, and show high levels of overall life satisfaction and happiness, despite meagre material conditions, poor quality of housing and unusually long working hours, according to the European Foundation’s European Quality of Life Survey for Romania. Two out of five Romanians are experiencing difficulties in making ends meet, the recent report from the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions reveals. The Dublin-based EU agency provides research, data and recommendations to governments and social partners in the European Union. The report, Quality of Life in Bulgaria and Romania, shows that there are still large income inequalities in Romania, with particular pressure on the unemployed and families with one breadwinner, elderly retired people, single parents and large families. More strikingly, three out of four Romanians cannot afford a week’s annual holiday, and one in three household have accumulated debts regarding utility bills such as electricity, water and gas over the past 12 months. One third of Romanian households also find their accommodation to be inadequate, citing problems such as lack of space, leaking in the roof or no indoor flushing toilet. Surprisingly, in the face of large income inequalities and meagre material conditions, Romanians indicate very high levels of overall life satisfaction, happiness and optimism about the future, reporting levels closer to the levels found in the former EU15 countries than in either the ten new Member States and the other two EU candidate countries Bulgaria and Turkey. Most significantly, one in three Romanians is ‘very optimistic’ about the future, which is a significantly higher rate than that found in either Bulgaria or Turkey, or on average in either the New Member States or the former EU15 countries. Job satisfaction is also high in Romania, higher than in the ten New Member States and in the former EU15 countries, the research reveals. Romanians rate job autonomy and career prospects at levels similar to those in the New Member States. Almost one in five Romanians, however, fears that they might lose their job in the coming six months, which is double the figure for the EU15. This rating is still on par with that of the New Member States but significantly better than that of Bulgaria. In addition, the research indicates that Romanians work long hours, on average 3 hours more per week than workers in the rest of the European Union. The findings of the Foundation’s research will be presented to government officials and social partners in Bucharest, Romania, on 20–21 September.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0945	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 2 October 2006	Tackling the future need for social care Faced with the challenge of an ageing population, European policy-makers urgently need to address the supply of suitably qualified care workers. This is the message that 100 delegates will hear today at the conference, ‘The future for employment in social care in Europe’, in Helsinki, Finland. Drawing upon lessons from research by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions on good practice initiatives in recruiting and retaining care workers in Europe, the two-day conference will debate recommendations for policy-makers for the next five to 10 years. The care sector in Europe is economically very significant, offering job opportunities for an estimated 10% of the workforce. However, a recent examination of the European care sector by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the Dublin-based EU agency, points to a number of weaknesses: these include relatively few younger labour market entrants and increasing levels of staff turnover, often a result of the lack of career prospects and poor working conditions. ‘Europe’s ageing population and workforce makes the European social model vulnerable’, says Mr Jorma Karppinen, the Foundation’s Director. ‘European policy-makers need to develop strategies that simultaneously create more and better jobs in social care and reduce the financial burden on their social provision systems.’ The Foundation has recently concluded research on how to increase the quantity and quality of care workers, looking at good practice in 11 EU Member States, and Bulgaria and Romania. The resulting report, Employment in Social Care in Europe, proposes a comprehensive set of policy recommendations, such as improving the public image of care work, raising the skills profile of care workers, increasing salary levels, attracting more migrants to the profession, achieving a better age and gender balance and improving overall working conditions for care workers. The report also outlines a number of possible measures for tackling the high turnover and early burnout seen among care workers: introducing vocational on-the-job training and lifelong learning; improving the quality of supervision and of human resource management; and facilitating workers in updating their skills and competencies. Such measures could help attract new entrants to the sector, ensure greater job satisfaction throughout the entire career and have a major bearing on the quality of care work, the report concludes. The conference is organised by the European Foundation in cooperation with Finland’s National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health (STAKES) and the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health (FIOH), under the auspices of the Finnish EU Presidency.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0946	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 5 September 2006	Workers in Europe benefit from more holiday entitlements: The amount of collectively agreed annual leave – holidays - for workers in Europe varies widely, from 33 days in Sweden to 20 days in Cyprus and Slovenia, according to the annual update on working time development in Europe from the Foundation’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). The average entitlement across the former EU15 countries and Norway stands at 26.8 days, showing a slight increase every year since 2000 when it was 25.6 days. Workers in Austria, the Czech Republic, Finland and France have 25 days each: a week less than their Danish and German counterparts (and closer to a fortnight less than in Sweden). Meanwhile, workers in Greece (23 days) fared better than those in Bulgaria (22 days), Slovakia (21.3 days), Cyprus (20 days) and Slovenia (20 days), where workers had to work a fortnight longer than in Germany and Denmark, and almost three weeks longer than in Sweden. Average collectively agreed annual leave exceeds the statutory minimum by at least four days in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Sweden and the UK. Workers in the 10 new EU Member States work, on average, 101 hours a year (nearly 6%) longer than their counterparts in the former EU15 countries, the new EIRO overview reveals. This works out at equivalent to working over two and a half weeks a year more than their fellow EU workers. In the EU25, the average collectively agreed annual working time was 1,748.4 hours. In the former EU15 countries, it was 1,707.8 hours, compared to 1,808.8 hours in the new EU Member States. However, annual working time in Greece and Ireland is similar to the average for the new Member States, while that in Cyprus and the Czech Republic is closer to the average for the former EU15 countries. The longest average annual working hours in the European Union are in Hungary, Latvia, Lituania, Estonia, Slovenia and Poland, while the shortest are in France, Denmark and Germany. The EIRO report, or update, also looks at statutory working time and leave limits, actual working hours and overtime. It provides an overview of the duration of working time – as set by collective agreements and legislation – in the European Union, Norway and two acceding countries (Bulgaria and Romania). The overview also provides the weekly working hours for full-time workers as set by collective bargaining in six sectors selected to represent manufacturing industry (metalworking and chemicals), services (banking and retail) and the public sector (local government and the central civil service).

EUROFOUND_UNK_0947	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 8 June 2006	Intention to migrate strong among young in Lithuania: Well-educated men and women in the 25-34 age group from Lithuania are four times more likely to migrate to another EU Member State than equally well-educated men and women in the same age group from the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia, according to new findings from research from the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. The Dublin-based EU agency’s work investigated EU policies aimed at promoting and restricting labour mobility in European countries. It found similarly high levels of intention to migrate among young, well-educated men and women in Poland, Estonia and Latvia. The pattern of future labour migration from the new Member States to the former EU15 countries is set to vary widely, while its overall extent will remain limited, the Foundation predicts. In the medium- to long-term, however, it warns that the greatest challenges lie in the impact of youth and ‘brain drain’ for the sending rather than the receiving countries. The research examines the different reasons why people would want to migrate. In the new Member States, work-related factors such as higher household income (59%) and better working conditions (57%), but also the opportunity to discover new things (30%), feature high on the list of priorities. In contrast, in the former EU15 countries, reasons why people would want to migrate fall into the ‘fun’ category: discovering new environments (64%) and meeting new people (39%). A quarter of respondents from the former EU15 countries mentioned ‘better weather’ as a serious reason to migrate. ‘Geographical mobility of labour remains a major policy challenge for Europe,’ says Jorma Karppinen, the Foundation’s Director. ‘On the one hand is the concern that too little geographical mobility between regions and Member States will have negative consequences due to reduced adaptability and competitiveness. The concern on the other hand is the impact on national labour markets, both on the giving and receiving ends, arising from geographical mobility between poorer regions in Eastern Europe and richer parts of central and northern Europe.” The European Commission has designated the year 2006 as the ‘European Year of Workers’ Mobility’, designed to raise awareness and spread information about the rights and opportunities of workers who work in another country, and also to promote greater job mobility for better career and income prospects of employees. Geographical mobility also provides an opportunity for the European economy to overcome skills shortages and unemployment in certain countries and sectors.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0948	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 5 April 2006	European survey on working time and work-life balance: High levels of flexi-time arrangements in the UK compared to Europe More than half (56%) of all private companies and public organisations in the UK with more than 10 employees have flexible working time arrangements in place, according to new research from the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the Dublin-based EU agency. In terms of flexibility, this ranks UK companies and public sector bodies fourth behind Latvia, Sweden and Finland. However, the degree of flexibility offered by flexi-time arrangements in the UK is less advanced than elsewhere in Europe. Flexible working-time arrangements are regarded as being advantageous for both the employer and the employee, the interview-based survey of personnel managers and employees representatives in 21,000 workplaces across Europe reveals. A higher degree of job satisfaction (EU average 63%, UK 50%), better adaptation of working hours to the workload (EU 55%, UK 49%), and lower absenteeism (EU 26%, UK 35%) are reported as the benefits of flexi-time arrangements. The negative effects, such as a rise in costs (EU 5%, UK 6%) and communication problems (EU 10%, UK 10%) are minor in comparison. ‘This positive approach to flexi-time arrangements is good news for job creation in Europe, since it makes work more attractive, especially for women and older workers,’ says Jorma Karppinen, the Foundation’s Director, in a response to the findings. ‘This survey provides unique knowledge about working time arrangements and practices in the workplace in Europe, and it gives the views of both managers and worker representatives.’ The survey results also characterises the UK labour market as part-time friendly. UK companies and public organisations rank first in Europe when it comes to easily switching from full-time to part-time work. More importantly, only one in five (18%) personnel managers in the UK report slightly or significantly worse career prospects for part-time workers than full-time workers, compared to an average of one in three (28.8%) in Europe. The findings confirm, however, that more UK companies and public organisations rely on overtime and that employees are more likely to be rewarded with money than with time off in the UK. The European survey on working time and work-life balance is a large-scale survey carried out among more than 21,000 establishments (both private companies and public organisations) in the 15 old Member States of the European Union (EU15) and in six of the new Member States: the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Latvia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0949	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 17 May 2006	European survey on working time and work-life balance in companies: Big differences in flexi-time arrangements in Europe The highest proportion of companies and organisations offering flexible working time arrangements in Europe is to be found in Latvia, Sweden, Finland and the United Kingdom, a new survey on working time from the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions reveals. At the opposite end of the scale, Cyprus, Portugal, Greece and Hungary have the fewest companies offering such arrangements. The findings of the survey will be presented at Employment Week 2006 in Brussels, Belgium on 17 May. On average, flexible working time arrangements exist in about one in two (48%) establishments with 10 or more employees in Europe, the survey shows. There is, however, a wide variety of such flexi-time schemes in operation. Some 16% of the establishments surveyed operate schemes that allow workers to vary only their starting and finishing times on the same day. More sophisticated schemes, allowing the accumulation of credit or debit hours, are found in 7% of the establishments surveyed. A further 12% of establishments offer at least some of their workers the opportunity to take full days off in compensation for accumulated credit hours. Finally, 13% of establishments offer the most advanced flexible working time option, one which permits workers to compensate for credit hours by taking longer periods off work. ‘Meeting the targets of the Lisbon agenda demands a clear understanding of the dynamics of the modern workplace and the societal factors that are impacting the way we work’, says Jorma Karppinen, the Foundation’s Director. ‘The results of this unique survey demonstrate the benefits of flexible working time arrangements, benefits that can help attract more people into employment and retain them.’ The survey results indicate that both establishments and employees can benefit from the introduction of flexible working-time arrangements. A majority of the managers surveyed report – as a result of flexible working time arrangements – ‘a higher degree of job satisfaction’ among the establishment’s employees (61%), while more than half (54%) report that such arrangements have contributed to a ‘better adaptation of working hours to the workload’. Other positive results reported include lower levels of absenteeism and a reduction in paid overtime. Only a minority of managers report negative consequences, such as communication problems or increased costs. This generally positive assessment is shared by employee representatives: 73% cite ‘a higher degree of job satisfaction’ in the establishment as an outcome, while 67% report a ‘better adaptation of working hours to the workload’. The survey also found that employee representatives regard the introduction or extension of flexible working time arrangements as the preferred initiative for improving their colleagues’ work–life balance. The Foundation carried out the comprehensive survey Working time and work–life balance in European companies in more than 21,000 European workplaces between autumn 2004 and spring 2005. The survey covered the 15 ‘old’ Member States of the European Union and six of the new Member States – the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Latvia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia. Both personnel managers and – where available – employee representatives were interviewed. The survey included questions on a variety of topics: flexible working time arrangements and working time accounts; part-time work; overtime and non-standard working hours; parental and other long-term leave; phased and early retirement; and policies to support a work–life balance. The Foundation will present the findings of the survey at Employment Week 2006 in Brussels, Belgium on 17 May. The presentation of the results is part of the Foundation’s ‘Your Work, Your Life’ campaign, designed to raise awareness of the issues currently facing Europe and its workplaces. The campaign explores the implications for working life of demographic ageing, gender mainstreaming and new working patterns, as well as looking at strategies for achieving a satisfactory work–life balance.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0950	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 6 June 2006	High levels of intention to migrate among young in Latvia: Well-educated men and women in the ages 25-34 from Latvia are four times more likely to migrate to another EU Member State than equally well-educated men and women in the same age group from the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia, new research from the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, has found. The work by the Dublin-based EU agency, which assesses EU policies to promote and restrict labour mobility in Europe states, found similar levels of intention to migrate among young, well-educated men and women in Poland, Estonia and Lithuania. The extent of future labour migration from the new Member States to the former EU15 countries will vary significantly while its overall extent will remain limited, the Foundation predicts. In the medium- to long-term, however, it warns that the greatest challenges lie in the effects of youth and 'brain drain' for the sending rather than the receiving countries. The research concludes that there are different reasons why people would want to migrate. In the new Member States, work-related factors such as higher household income (59%) and better working conditions (57%), but also the chance to discover new things (30%), feature high on the list of priorities. In the former EU15 countries, however, more 'fun' factors are reasons that encourage people to migrate, such as discovering new environments (64%) and meeting new people (39%). A quarter of respondents from the former EU15 countries suggested 'better weather' as a serious reason to migrate. 'Geographical mobility of labour remains a policy challenge for Europe,' says Jorma Karppinen, the Foundation’s Director. 'On the one hand is the worry that too little geographical mobility between regions and Member States will have negative consequences due to reduced adaptability and competitiveness. On the other hand are the effects on national labour markets, both on the giving and receiving ends, due to too much geographical mobility between poorer regions in Eastern Europe and richer parts of central and northern Europe.' The European Commission has designated the year 2006 as the 'European Year of Workers’ Mobility', an attempt to, in part, raise awareness and inform about workers’ rights and opportunities of working in another country, but also to promote higher job mobility for better career and income prospects of employees. The advantages for the European economy to overcome skills shortages and unemployment are an underlying advantage.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0951	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 9 February 2006	High overall life satisfaction levels in Finland but general dissatisfaction over pay Most Finns regard their working conditions as favourable, but only a few consider themselves well paid, according to a report from the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the Dublin-based EU agency. The report will be presented to the Finnish government, social partners and civil society in Helsinki today. Finland boasts one of the highest levels of overall life satisfaction and happiness in Europe, according to results from the first European Quality of Life Survey. Only 19% of Finns experience stress at work, compared to an average of 47% across the former EU15 countries. The report also found Finns to be quite satisfied with their own health, as well as with the quality of health and social services in Finland. However, the report reveals that only a quarter of the Finnish population (24%) consider themselves to be well paid, in contrast to an average level of 43% in the former EU15 countries. Significantly, one in five Finns (21%) says they cannot afford a week’s annual holiday, a higher than average figure in the other former EU15 countries. ‘In the majority of findings from the European Quality of Life survey, Finland compares well with the other 25 EU Member States, and many Finns consider themselves as having relatively favourable working conditions,’ says Jorma Karppinen, the Foundation’s Director. ‘However, there are issues around economic deprivation and high levels of chronic illness, which need to be addressed. This report should support policymakers and practitioners in their work to tackle these issues.’ The Foundation’s European Quality of Life Survey recorded twice as many people in Finland (38%) with long-term illness or disability compared to levels in the former EU15 countries (20%), with particularly high levels in the 18-24 age group. The representative survey, based on 26,000 face-to-face interviews across 28 European countries, sheds light on living conditions, subjective well-being and individual perceptions of society.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0952	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 8 March 2006	Most new jobs created in new Member States A total of 80,485 new jobs were announced in Europe’s financial media as a result of 146 company restructuring cases during the last quarter of 2005, the latest European Restructuring Monitor Quarterly reveals. In total, the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) recorded 360 cases of company restructuring in the former EU15, the ten new Member States and two acceding countries, Bulgaria and Romania. During this period, 101,689 job cuts were announced. Over half of the planned new job creations relate to expanding business activities in the new EU Member States. Out of a total of 44,126 new jobs created in these countries, primarily in the manufacturing, retail, and transport and communication sectors, Poland accounts for 18,002, Romania 13,195 and Slovakia 12,929. The majority of job losses occurred as a result of internal restructuring, bankruptcies and closures. The sectors most affected by the cuts are manufacturing, public administration and the financial sector. ‘The trend of continued net job losses across the 27 countries ERM monitors is in line with previous quarters,’ says Jorma Karppinen, the Foundation’s Director, commenting on the new report. ‘However, the interesting fact is that more than half of the announced new job creations are located in the new EU Member States.’ The latest European Restructuring Monitor Quarterly also provides a country profile of Sweden, exploring the economic and labour market issues related to company restructuring. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Swedish labour market experienced a small degree of restructuring, with some 1.96 job losses announced per 10,000 employees, as the country continued the economic upsurge begun in 2004. The Quarterly also provides an insight into the EU chemicals sector, a leading industry significantly affected by restructuring activities during this period with 24 cases, accounting for 3,471 job losses and 5,440 job creations.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0953	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 22 March 2006	Temporary agency work in an enlarged European Union: Temporary agency work: an increasingly important form of employment in the European Union Temporary work agencies in the former EU15 countries employ the full-time equivalent of 1.3% of total employment, according to new research from the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the Dublin-based EU agency. The report, which offers a snapshot of temporary agency work in 25 EU Member States, as well as Norway and the acceding countries Bulgaria and Romania, paints a picture of a small but important sector with a significant growth potential. In EU15 countries, the employment levels range from 0.3% in Denmark to 2.6% in the United Kingdom, with high levels also in the Netherlands, Belgium and France. Overall, this involves some 2.5 to 3 million employees, employed by approximately 20,000 firms, in a segment with a likely annual turnover in excess of €75 billion. In the new EU Member States, in those countries for which data is available, employment levels ranges from 0.5% in Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, to 1.4% in Hungary. ‘The temporary agency work sector appears to be well regulated, by means of a mix of statues, collective agreements and codes of conduct, at least in the EU15 countries,’ says Jorma Karppinen, the Foundation’s Director, in a response to the findings. ‘Surprisingly, many similarities exist in the functioning of temporary agency work in both the former EU15 countries and the new Member States – with the significant difference that there exists no sectoral level collective bargaining in the latter countries.’ This report, commissioned by the European Commission’s sectoral social dialogue committee on temporary agency work, is based on a comparative study covering 28 countries carried out by the Foundation’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). It looks at the definition and extent of TAW, its regulation in the different countries, and the views of the social partners on recent developments in the sector. From the very outset, the social partners at both national and confederal levels (Eurociett and UNI-Europa) have contributed with further data and detailed comments on both the national and the overview reports.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0954	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 9 March 2006	European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) and Luxembourg: Highest level of satisfaction among Luxembourg’s older people People aged 65 years and over in Luxembourg report the highest levels of life satisfaction in Europe, according to the European Quality of Life Survey carried out by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the Dublin-based EU-agency. Not only are people in Luxembourg more satisfied with life than the average citizen in Europe: they are also happier overall and more optimistic about the future. A greater proportion of people in Luxembourg, compared to other European countries on average, also report that they can afford to take a week’s annual holiday, thus reflecting the country’s above-average level of material conditions. On the other hand, the results reveal that many people in Luxembourg are not very satisfied with their jobs and in fact live in fear of losing their job in the coming six months. ‘While quality of life in Luxembourg scores high across several dimensions, the analysis finds that people in Luxembourg are not very happy with their current jobs, with many people reporting a fear of losing their job in the near future,’ says Jorma Karppinen, the Foundation’s Director in a response to the findings. ‘Also surprising is the relatively low number of people regularly using the Internet in Luxembourg, which is close to the European average.’ Based on 26,000 face-to-face interviews across 28 European countries, the Foundation’s survey into quality of life in Europe sheds light on living conditions, subjective well-being and perceptions of individuals about their society. The report offers a unique portrait of life in its various aspects across 25 EU Member States. Its findings provide policymakers and actors in civil society with data and information on the elements that go into determining quality of life for individuals, such as financial situation, housing conditions, work–life balance, personal health and health services, educational level and household and family circumstances.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0955	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 21 March 2006	The European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) in Bulgaria: Bulgarians boast highest levels of home ownership in Europe, despite poor material conditions and quality of life Bulgarians do not rate their overall satisfaction with life very highly, and tend to have low levels of happiness and optimism for the future, in comparison with people in the rest of Europe, according to the European Quality of Life Survey carried out by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the Dublin-based EU-agency. More worryingly, according to the findings, Bulgarians rate the quality of health care and social services in their country, as well as their own personal health, at levels well below the average in both the EU25 and EU candidate countries Romania and Turkey. Also, almost two out of every three Bulgarians report difficulties in making ends meet. More than four out of five Bulgarians cannot afford a week’s annual holiday, the report reveals. ‘The findings from the survey paint a bleak picture of living conditions in Bulgaria,’ comments Jorma Karppinen, the Foundation’s Director in response to the findings. ‘However, we hope that our analysis can contribute to the current process of macroeconomic and structural reform in the run-up to Bulgaria’s full membership of the European Union in 2007.’ On a positive note, the survey found that more than four out of five Bulgarians own their own home outright, which represents one of the highest levels of home ownership in Europe. Bulgarians also rate the quality of housing and the local environment higher than in the other EU candidate countries, Romania and Turkey. The European Foundation’s research on quality of life in Europe is based on 26,000 face-to-face interviews across 28 European countries in 2003, shedding light on living conditions, subjective well-being and perceptions of individuals of their society. The report not only provides a unique portrait of quality of life in an enlarged Europe, but also offers policymakers and actors in civil society with knowledge on how individual quality of life is assessed. The Foundation will present the findings and recent analysis from the survey to government officials and social partners at a seminar to be held the Hilton Hotel in Sofia on 21 March 2006.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0956	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 18 January 2006	The Foundation's work programme for 2006: Accent on job creation, mobility, better working conditions and work–life balance in 2006 Access to good quality jobs for all workers is a central policy concern in the European Union. The Foundation’s 2006 work programme will focus on this priority issue, while also dealing with the related issues of employment creation and retention, mobility of workers and their families, working time arrangements and work–life balance. Key tasks for 2006 include making an input into the 2006 European Year of Workers’ Mobility, and presenting findings from the fourth European Working Conditions Survey and the Company Survey on Working Time and Work-life Balance. Finally, in November 2006, the Foundation will host the third Foundation Forum, entitled ‘Competitive Europe, Social Europe – partners or rivals?’. ‘The Foundation is in a strong position to contribute to the improvement of living and working conditions for all Europeans,’ affirms Jorma Karppinen, Director of the Foundation, the Dublin-based EU agency. ‘We have identified themes for our 2006 work programme that increasingly affect our lives in the competitive global environment. The results of our work will feed into the debate and provide policymakers with information that could ultimately lead to an enhanced quality of life for all European citizens.’ The Foundation will continue to provide data through its monitoring instruments and surveys, which have proved very effective in building a picture of life in the 25 Member States, as well as in Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Turkey. Initial findings will be presented from the 2005 European Working Conditions Survey, with further analyses being carried out on selected topics. Findings from the Company Survey on Working Time will be released in the first quarter of the year. At the same time, preparations for the second European Quality of Life Survey will get underway. In addition to weekly news releases from the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) website, EIRO will feature an industrial relations profile of each Member State. The Industrial Relations Annual Report will present a comparison between current developments in Europe and its major competing economies. The European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) will publish its first annual report on restructuring in Europe. Information from the monitoring activities will be supplemented by in-depth studies of ‘what works’. An in-depth study of temporary agency work from the point of view of industrial relations will be published at the beginning of the year. The Foundation will then unveil a major study and database on Employment Initiatives for the Ageing Workforce. Other studies will look at employment opportunities in childcare, the ‘attractive workplace’ as a way for companies to contribute to the Lisbon strategy, and strengthening the capacity for social dialogue in the new Member States. The Foundation will use a number of thematic campaigns – on mobility, work-life balance and quality of work – to diffuse its message in 2006. The newly launched twice-yearly magazine, Foundation Focus, will devote the two issues for 2006 to the ageing workforce and equal opportunities. A new policy-oriented publication, Foundation Findings, will be launched in the spring. As 2005 saw a huge increase - by one third - in the number of web user sessions to the Eurofound website, the planned integration of the Foundation’s separate web activities in 2006 under one common ‘Eurofound’ banner should make the site even more user-friendly.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0957	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 14 December 2005	EU-wide survey finds that both companies and employees profit from flexible working time Almost half of all establishments in Europe with ten or more employees practise flexible working time arrangements, but there are substantial differences across EU member states. Both managers and employee representatives report positive outcomes of flexible working time, including a higher degree of job satisfaction, better adaptation of working hours to the workload and lower absenteeism. These are some of the results from a large-scale representative sample survey run by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in the former 15 member states and in six of the new member states (the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Latvia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia). In over 21,000 establishments covering both private and public sectors, personnel managers and employee representatives – where available – were interviewed about working time arrangements and work–life balance at the workplace. Core issues included part-time work, overtime, childcare, parental leave and flexible working time arrangements. 'This survey provides unique knowledge on working time arrangements in Europe. It provides a representative picture of the practice at the workplace, and gives the views of both managers and the workers’ representatives', says Jorma Karppinen, the Foundation’s Director. Other key findings of the survey show that in Cyprus, Portugal and Greece, less than every third establishment offers any flexibility with regard to working hours, while about two thirds of all establishments in Sweden, Latvia and Finland do so. The degree of flexibility also varies considerably. In Nordic, German, Austrian and Czech establishments, a flexible working time arrangement generally means the opportunity to accumulate hours in a ‘working time account’. However, in southern European establishments, flexibility is often limited to a variation in the start and end of work on a daily basis. Some 61% of all managers reported that higher job satisfaction was a key effect of the introduction of flexible working time. Employee representatives regard the introduction or extension of flexible working time arrangements as the most desirable initiative for improving work–life balance. A descriptive report on the findings of the survey will be published in April 2006. See also: First results.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0958	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 23 November 2005	European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) quarterly: Slowdown in restructuring cases during last quarter A total of 102,106 job losses were announced as a result of 242 restructuring cases in Europe between 1 July and 31 September 2005, according to the latest issue of European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) quarterly – representing a 28% decrease over the previous quarter. Over the same period, some 99,557 new jobs were announced, which is 15% fewer new jobs than during the previous three-month period. The highest number of planned job creations is found in the new Member States, where 63,506 out of 99,557 new jobs are due to expanding business activities arising from 169 restructuring cases. According to the ERM, the Foundation’s online monitoring tool which provides up-to-date news and analysis on company restructuring in Europe, most of the restructuring cases announced are found in Poland, Romania and Bulgaria. In the former EU15 countries, the United Kingdom continues to record a high rate of business expansion with 13 restructuring cases accounting for 20,196 new jobs. Germany recorded a lower rate of restructuring activities resulting from business expansion, with 13 restructuring cases accounting for 9,895 new jobs. This quarterly report places the spotlight on the EU construction and woodworking sector, a leading industrial employer in Europe and strategically important sector for the European Union. Over the past quarter, this sector has been significantly affected by restructuring activities with 35 cases accounting for 4,038 job losses and 9,630 job creations. ‘In most cases, these new jobs are the result of rapidly expanding markets in eastern Europe, rather than company relocations in the strict sense of the term, where existing activities are being transferred,’ comments Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s Acting Director. ‘However, the ERM does not capture job loss and job creation in small and micro-enterprises in the construction and woodworking industry.’ This issue of the ERM Quarterly offers a country focus on Romania, where internal restructuring represents 31% of the cases recorded in the third quarter of 2005. The report also analyses the performances of two companies – Hewlett-Packard which has announced severe cuts of 14,500 jobs in July 2005, and Ikea which continues to grow positively in 2005, thus contributing to the creation of new jobs across Europe. The European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) is one of the Foundation’s monitoring tools, providing news and analysis on company restructuring activities across 27 countries in Europe: the former EU15 countries plus the ten new Member States, as well as Bulgaria and Romania.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0959	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 10 November 2005	New EIRO comparative study on industrial relations in agriculture: Europe’s farmers earn below national average wages The average pay rates in Europe’s agriculture sector are below the overall national average – often considerably so – according to the latest comparative study by the Foundation’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). In the 18 countries in Europe with some form of statutory national minimum wage, a relatively high proportion of farmers and other workers in the agriculture sector are paid at this rate, ranging from 32% in France, 29% in Lithuania and the Netherlands, to 6% in the United Kingdom and 2.8% in Slovenia. The Foundation study was carried out in 23 EU countries (Luxembourg and Portugal were excluded), as well as Bulgaria, Romania and Norway. The agriculture sector in Europe employs 13.3 million people, or 6.6% of total employment. The study founds that industrial relations in this sector are different from those in other sectors, due in large part to the high degree of self-employment and generally low proportion of employees. As a consequence, there is no clear demarcation between trade union and employers’ organisations. ‘Apart from policy matters such as subsidies, prices, the CAP, production levels and taxation, the issues of immigrant labour and seasonal work are high on the agenda in the sector,’ says Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s Acting Director. ‘Because of labour and skill shortages, seasonal work is to a large extent performed by immigrant workers. The concerns of irregular, illegal employment and pay inequities call for immediate action to regulate the situation. There is a clear need for social dialogue to support initiatives aimed at reforming the traditional institutions and mechanisms specific to industrial relations in this sector.’ The study confirms a decline in the number of traditional farms in Europe. Over the past 10 years, the number of farms has decreased to around 15.2 million in the EU and the two acceding countries – a reduction of between 20%-25%. At the same time, major structural changes are taking place in the agriculture sector today, presenting new challenges to farmers. There is a strong trend towards concentration of farming activities and an increase in the average size and turnover of farms. As a result of strong competition at domestic and international level, competitiveness is also escalating. Rules aimed at standardising, levelling and harmonising sales of products, together with demands for livestock health environment protection and bio-diversity, are similarly putting pressure on the sector. A presentation of this study will take place in Bucharest on 9 December 2005. The event is aimed at social partners and government representatives, academics, researchers and the media.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0960	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 30 November 2005	Launching the European Industrial Relations Dictionary: a clear insight into the workings of industrial relations at European level The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the Dublin-based EU agency, publishes the European industrial relations dictionary, a comprehensive collection of the most commonly used terms in employment and industrial relations at EU level today. Select your language: DE FR Employment and industrial relations in all European countries has been influenced by European integration over the past half century. A specific EU social dimension is emerging, with its supranational institutional structures, the legal framework of EC law and fundamental rights, and transnational economic integration. To understand the European system of industrial relations, it is necessary to have a sense of how it grew, how it is shaped, and what its current and emerging structure looks like. ‘The European industrial relation dictionary is the Foundation’s response to an increasing demand for an up-to-date, easily accessible and useful resource on the European system of industrial relations,’ comments Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s Acting Director. ‘The dictionary is aimed at assisting users such as members of trade union and employer organisations, persons from government and international bodies, academics, researchers and all those wishing to gain relevant and detailed information about European industrial relations concepts and practices.’ Designed as an easy-to-use online reference tool, the European industrial relations dictionary is a comprehensive collection of the most commonly used terms in employment and industrial relations at EU level today. It contains almost 300 alphabetically listed entries, featuring concise definitions and relevant contextual information, with hyperlinks to EU legislation and case law. Hence it offers an almost encyclopaedic insight into European industrial relations theory and practice. The definitions contained in the dictionary have been adapted to include all the latest political and institutional developments of the European Union, such as the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and the European Constitution. The European industrial relation dictionary follows in the wake of the Foundation’s series of national glossaries, published in the 1990s, which cover employment and industrial relations in former EU15 Member States. The overall aim of the dictionary is to give a clear insight into the workings of industrial relations at European level.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0962	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 28 September 2005	THE FUTURE OF EUROPE'S CONSTRUCTION SECTOR: Higher building costs if new technology not used by small and micro enterprises Increasing use of information technologies in Europe’s construction sector will, together with internationalisation and access to new markets, lead to decreasing material prices, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions predicts in its overview of the sector. However, it warns, since the sector is dominated by strong home-market structures and a large number of micro and small companies with a few large multinationals, focus on bringing the benefits of information technology advances to the companies is essential to avoid customers being charged higher prices. ‘Internationalisation or globalisation will lead to decreasing material prices, which benefits larger enterprises that can purchase in bulk, using new information technologies. Small construction companies will have to cooperate in order to command in bulk together, and to reap the benefits of information technologies on efficiency, transparency and cost-cutting,’ says Willy Buschak, Acting Director of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the Dublin-based EU agency providing policy-makers information on socio-economic progress in the European Union. The European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC), the Foundation’s research arm specialising in monitoring of industrial change in Europe, highlights the sector’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats in a new overview of the European construction sector. A set of reports provide an overview of the sector, as well as examine the forces driving change in the sector, looking particularly at the sector’s productivity, demographics, the effects of EU enlargement and movement of labour, technological developments, and regulation and legislation. The construction sector, which accounts for 4-9% of GDP and 4-10% of employment in the union, is being challenged by an increasingly crowded marketplace following the EU enlargement, more recruitment challenges due to an ageing population, and higher demands on health and safety. The European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) makes a case that for the sector to stay competitive and grow, all actors - companies, social partners, policymakers and sectoral experts – need to acknowledge the changing framework conditions and act in unison. An EMCC workshop in Madrid, Spain on 29-30 September will identify and discuss trends and changes in the European construction sector, gathering companies, social partners, policy makers, and sectoral experts to reflect jointly on and exchange their experiences regarding changes and challenges affecting the sector, and to identify actions for further development, innovation and growth.The workshop is organised by the European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) and hosted by the Spanish Social and Economic Council (Consejo Económico y Social, CES), the Foundation's National Liaison Centre, with the support of the Spanish Construction Confederation (CNC).

EUROFOUND_UNK_0963	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 29 August 2005	THE EUROPEAN RESTRUCTURING MONITOR ERM QUARTERLY: Strong link between restructuring and job creation The number of new jobs created through restructuring activities in Europe is almost equal to the number of jobs lost during the second quarter of 2005, according to the latest European Restructuring Monitor Quarterly. In the period April to June 2005, the figure for total job announcements in the EU almost doubled in comparison to the first quarter of the year, the ERM quarterly reports. During this period, some 213 restructuring cases resulted in 120,000 new jobs, mainly created in the manufacturing and wholesale and retail industry. New job creations almost balanced out the 142,000 job losses announced during the same period. Among the 27 countries covered by the ERM, Romania reported the highest number of job losses (35 job losses per 10,000 workers), followed by Hungary (17), Finland and Sweden (10 each), and the United Kingdom (9). ‘This new data from the European Restructuring Monitor confirms that company restructuring does not necessarily always have to be bad news,’ says Willy Buschak, Acting Director of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the Dublin-based EU agency providing information about socio-economic progress in the European Union. ‘We are recording an increasing number of cases where companies announce expansion and the creation of additional jobs.’ The lion’s share of these new job announcements were found in the new EU Member States, creating new jobs mainly in the manufacturing, wholesale and retail/repairs sectors. Poland has attracted some 24,500 new jobs, Romania 20,600 and the Czech Republic 10,000 during the period. In all the 27 countries covered by the ERM, the highest number of restructuring activities were recorded in Poland (70 cases), the United Kingdom (64), Germany (63) and Romania (59), The latest issue of the ERM quarterly examines two cases of business expansion in more depth: BMWs decision to open a new factory in high-cost Germany and Tesco’s expansion in Poland. Restructuring in Spain is covered in the country focus. This issue’s sector focus explores the situation in retail.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0964	2010-01-07	UNK	Background note, 29 June 2005	"Ireland boasts high levels of life satisfaction and optimism The European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS): Ireland Press release Note to the editor The European Quality 	 	 of Life Survey (EQLS) 	 	 was carried out in May–August 2003, by the European 	 	 Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in the 	 	 EU25 and in three candidate countries – Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey. The 	 	 survey 	 	 is an important source of information, highlighting the opportunities 	 	 and challenges facing the EU since its recent enlargement. It aims to provide 	 	 an accurate picture of the social situation in an enlarged EU, which 	 	 includes 	 	 both objective and subjective elements. Nevertheless, it should be noted 	 	 that there are some limitations to the data. While the sample sizes 	 	 of approximately 1,000 per country provide a general population profile, 	 	 they are too small 	 	 to allow for a detailed analysis of sub-groups, such as immigrants or 	 	 single parent families. Furthermore, although the wide range of topics covered 	 	 in the survey is, on the one hand, informative, it also means that the topics 	 	 could not be treated in extreme detail. Some of the dimensions of quality 	 	 of life are measured using a more narrow set of indicators than ones used in highly specialised 	 	 surveys. However, the strength of the survey is that it provides both objective 	 	 and subjective information on the main aspects of quality of life. Methodology A single standard questionnaire was used in the survey. Interviews were 	 	 carried out face-to-face and the unit of interview was the sampled individual, 	 	 although certain items relating to characteristics of the household were 	 	 also included in the questionnaire. The questionnaire was originally drafted 	 	 in English by a consortium of research institutes; it was then translated 	 	 into the national languages of the Member States, using back-translation 	 	 methods to check the accuracy of translation. It was designed to fit into 	 	 a 35-minute interview time-frame, given the available fieldwork budget. 	 	 The questionnaire covered a broad spectrum of life domains with an emphasis 	 	 on employment, housing, family, social and political participation, quality 	 	 of society and subjective well-being. Fieldwork for the survey was carried out by Intomart, a European private 	 	 sector data collection agency, which coordinates a network of partner 	 	 agencies spanning the 28 countries. Methods of sample selection varied, 	 	 but consisted mainly of ‘random walk’ methods for the selection of households, 	 	 as well as random selection of individuals aged 18 years and over within 	 	 households. In all countries, the sampling method was designed to provide 	 	 a fully randomised sample. Although the overall response rate was 58%, 	 	 individual response rates varied widely and ranged from below 35% in Ireland 	 	 and Spain, to 91% in Germany. For 23 of the countries surveyed, the sample 	 	 size achieved was around 1,000 cases. For the five smaller states – Cyprus, 	 	 Malta, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Estonia – the sample size was approximately 	 	 600 cases. The total sample size consisted of 26,257 cases. Sample data 	 	 were re-weighted by age, sex and region, to conform to national population 	 	 patterns. After collection, the data were checked extensively by 	 	 the Social Science Centre in Berlin (WZB). More than 50 macro-indicators 	 	 were added at this point, in order to link respondents’ reports (e.g. 	 	 household income) with the social situation of the country (e.g. GDP per capita). Next step Analysis of the survey results has already begun, with a review of the 	 	 main findings in relation to country and demographic characteristics. 	 	 This provides the basis for a descriptive report on how countries differ 	 	 in some respects, and how the results are related to the characteristics 	 	 of social groups. There are no extensive attempts to explain why such 	 	 differences arise. More detailed analysis is underway to examine the data 	 	 in relation to more specific themes and to improve understanding of the 	 	 results. Four reports are near completion in relation to: quality of life, subjective well-being and perception of society; households and family, social networks and community life; living standards and resources, income and employment, subsistence economy, deprivation and exclusion; housing and local environment. Further in-depth analysis is being commissioned and papers based on the analytical reports will be published from 2005 onwards.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0965	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 6 July 2005	Pay and jobs main issues for industrial action EIRO comparative overview on industrial action 2000-2004 Figures on number of working days lost per 1,000 employees in the last five years show a very low level of industrial action in some of the new EU Member States (Estonia, Lithuania and Poland) and in some of the old ones (Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands). A recent study by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions found that the highest level of industrial action was found in Spain (219.7 days lost per 1,000 workers), Italy (134.7 days) and Austria (103.5 days). The report from the Foundation’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) reviews trends and developments in industrial action in 2000-2004. It also examines the causes for industrial action and looks at dispute resolution in the various countries. ‘Pay remains the main issue for industrial action in most European countries,’ says Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s Acting Director, commenting on the findings of the report. ‘the second most important reason is employment, including dismissals, redundancies, job losses and unemployment. In comparison with the past, the early 2000s have been a time of relatively industrial peace in many European countries: in the 1980s days lost to industrial action in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Spain and the UK averaged over 400 days lost per 1000 workers.’ The study found that the sectors most affected by industrial action in 2000-2004 were transport and communications, industry/manufacturing and the broad public sector. Distribution of industrial action between private and public sector varies considerably between the countries considered. Industrial action is one of the most high-profile aspects of industrial relations, not least in terms of media coverage and public impact and attention. It is seen by some commentators as an important indicator of whether or not industrial relations systems are functioning well, with some viewing industrial action as a sign that a system is malfunctioning. Others regard it as a relatively normal feature of a healthy and well-functioning system. However, industrial action is an area where international comparisons are notoriously difficult. This is largely because the way in which statistics are produced differs greatly between countries, with the definition of the industrial action recorded varying considerably, and the data being collected by a variety of official and other bodies.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0966	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 16 September 2005	LAUNCHING THE FIELDWORK FOR THE 4TH EUROPEAN WORKING CONDITIONS SURVEY: Improving working conditions in Europe The intensification of work – doing more work in less time – has affected an increasing number of workers in EU Member States over the past 15 years, the Foundation’s last European Working Conditions Survey revealed in 2001. Next week, the fieldwork for the fourth working conditions survey covering workers in 31 European countries will start. The survey provides an overview of the state of working conditions in Europe, highlighting trends and identifying major issues and changes in the workplace. ‘If Europe is to reach the labour market participation levels for men and women set out in the Lisbon criteria, we need more good quality jobs,’ says Willy Buschak, Acting Director of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the Dublin-based EU agency providing knowledge and information about socio-economic progress. ‘The European Working Conditions Survey is a unique tool that allows Europe’s decision makers to monitor and make policies for better working conditions. In its fourth edition, the survey has been expanded to also cover issues related to modern forms of work organisation, gender-sensitive issues and how people perceive their quality of work’. Starting on 19 September, more than 23,000 face-to-face interviews will be carried out with workers in the former EU15 countries, the ten new EU Member States, the four accession and candidate countries (Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Turkey), plus Norway and Switzerland. The questionnaire covers all aspects of working conditions, including physical environment, workplace design, working hours, work organisation and social relationships in the workplace. First results from the new European Working Condition Survey will be published in 2006. Consult the Foundation’s expertise in the area of quality of work.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0967	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 7 November 2005	Launching the Foundation Focus, a twice-yearly magazine offering focused research findings on current topics of key socio-economic importance: Four out of five jobs lost in Europe due to internal restructuring New technology, changing customer demands and new patterns of work organisation are the main factors behind internal restructuring in companies, accounting for four out of five job losses in Europe. A comprehensive picture on restructuring is documented in Foundation Focus, the new twice-annual magazine launched this week by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. More than 80% of around one million announced job losses over the past 18 months in Europe were due to internal restructuring. This stemmed from the need to adapt to technological change, from changes in consumer demand and from changes in work organisation. In comparison, less than 5% or 63,000 job losses were clearly attributable to the company’s decision to relocate its production activities. The first Foundation Focus is dedicated to the issue of restructuring, which has in recent years become a characteristic feature of the European industrial landscape. Each issue will focus on a topic of critical social and economic importance in the European Union, offering a series of articles on different aspects of the topic. ‘Europe creates and loses jobs every day, and it is the collective responsibility of public authorities, enterprises and social partners to ensure that workers are moved to sectors where new jobs are created,’ says Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s Acting Director. ‘We hope the Foundation Focus will earn its place as an important contributor to argument and debate at European and national level on the issues shaping the future of Europe’s living and working conditions.’ Restructuring is, however, not only about jobs. Foundation Focus aims to offer a wide perspective of the issue, also dealing with how workers respond to restructuring initiatives, how they are represented, and at what stage they are involved in the process. Equally, it looks at how innovative European strategies could possibly provide some of the answers to the issues raised by restructuring at regional level. And, perhaps most importantly, it examines how people have had to respond to such change in the way they work.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0968	2010-01-07	UNK	Press          release, 29 June 2005	Ireland boasts high levels of life satisfaction and optimism The European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS): Ireland Background note (in English), Supporting graphics (in English, Powerpoint presentation, 399KB) Irish people are more satisfied with life than the average European, according to the new European Quality of Life Survey carried out by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the Dublin-based EU-agency. But while quality of life in Ireland is high overall in several dimensions, it is not enjoyed by everyone in society. Irish people in the lowest income quartile report significantly high levels of subjective economic strain, with more Irish having trouble making ends meet or being able to afford a week’s annual holiday, than in other countries in the former EU15. The survey also highlights that gender differences in the distribution of household roles are marked in Ireland. Measures of family support and quality of family life, however, are reassuringly positive and Irish people also report relatively high levels of participation in church and community life, in comparison to the other 27 countries surveyed. Commenting on the EQLS report, Willy Buschak, Acting Director of the European Foundation noted: ‘Although the Irish rate their own health as relatively good, assessments of the quality of health services and of public transport are well below the EU15 average. On the other hand, assessments of the quality of the education and pension systems are relatively high.’ ‘We hope that our survey, which provides policymakers and social society actors with knowledge on how people perceive their situations and how individual quality of life is assessed, can help to bridge the gap between the old and the new Member States of the European Union,’ he added. Based on 26,000 face-to-face interviews across 28 European countries, the Foundation’s research on quality of life in Europe sheds light on living conditions, subjective well-being and perceptions of individuals of their society. The report not only provides a unique portrait of quality of life in an enlarged Europe, but also offers policymakers and actors in civil society with knowledge on how individual quality of life is assessed.

Results from the Foundation’s European Quality of Life Survey and other statistical resources will be made available online as part of the new online searchable database EurLIFE. The new instrument, which will allow users to create graphs and tables on the basis of their own requirements, is the most recent information resource to be created by the Foundation and the first such interactive tool to assist the user in charting trends and developments in the quality of life sphere. ‘EurLIFE is an easy-access interactive information tool accessible to everyone interested in gathering data on European quality of life.’ commented Willy Buschak, Acting Director of the European Foundation. ‘For the first time, policymakers, researchers and journalists will be able to access and manipulate this data in an easy and timely manner, contributing significantly to filling the information gap which has existed in this area to date.’ The unique database was developed from comparable EU-wide data sources and includes the most up-to-date information from the Foundation’s own monitoring tools on quality of life and working conditions. The data cover the 25 Member States and three candidate countries, Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey and covers a broad spectrum of social indicators in a set of 12 life domains with approximately 15 indicators for each domain. It provides easy access to a large amount of empirical data to generate user-oriented tables and diagrams for selected countries and time periods ranging from 1990 to 2003. The core types of differentiation are by gender, country, age and income quartile. It is planned to update the database every two years, from 2006. The launching of the new tool coincides with the architectural overhaul of the Foundation’s portal, Eurofound which will further facilitate access to the Foundation’s research findings and data, with different access-points for the same information. Most notably, the information will be accessible by subject, sector or areas of expertise.

The conference, held at the Hotel Parc Belle-Vue in Luxembourg, will open at 15.00 on 21 June 2005 by François Biltgen, Luxembourg’s Minister for Labour and Employment, Luxembourg Presidency and Willy Buschak, Acting Director of European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0971	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 26 April 2005	High life satisfaction despite poor work-life balance in Spain Background note (in English and Spanish), Supporting graphics (in English, Powerpoint presentation, 378KB) In Spain, levels of satisfaction with life and optimism about the future are somewhat higher than the European average, according to the European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS), carried out by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. Despite high levels of overall life satisfaction, the survey reveals some economic deprivation and hardship, especially among women and older people, reflecting slightly lower household income levels in Spain, in comparison with other former EU15 Member States. Older people in Spain tend to be less satisfied and are markedly less optimistic about the future. Tension between men and women in Spain is apparently higher: 17% of Spanish men report a lot of tension compared to the EU25 average of 10%, while 22% of Spanish women say this compared to the EU25 average of 13%. Commenting on the EQLS report, Willy Buschak, Acting Director of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions noted: ‘Spain is the country in the EU15 where the highest proportion of both men and women report work-life problems. Nearly half of Spanish women report that several times a week, they are too tired to carry out household tasks after they come home from work, compared with a quarter of women in the former EU15. The corresponding figures are 35% for Spanish men and 21% for men on average in the EU15 countries.’ More Spanish women workers fear losing their jobs in the coming six months than overall in the EU15 countries. Spain is the only country in which more than twice as many women as men fear this. Based on 26,000 face-to-face interviews across 28 European countries, the Foundation’s research on quality of life in Europe sheds light on living conditions, subjective well-being and perceptions of individuals of their society. The report provides information on a number of areas central to the concept of quality of life, ranging from households and family, social networks and community life, to living standards and resources, income and employment, and housing and local environment. The report not only provides a unique portrait of quality of life in an enlarged Europe, but also offers policymakers and actors in civil society with knowledge on how individual quality of life is assessed.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0972	2010-01-07	UNK	Supporting graphics, 21 April 2005	 Continued wage moderation across Europe Press release (in English), Background note (in English) This annual report (or update) from the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO), based on contributions from its national centres, aims to provide a broad, general indication of trends in pay increases over 2003 and 2004 across the EU Member States, two candidate countries (Bulgaria and Romania) and Norway. We do not attempt to produce a fully scientific and comparable set of pay comparisons, given that EIRO is not a statistical service and that pay is an area where meaningful international comparisons are especially difficult. Differing national systems of pay formation, industrial relations, taxation and social security, and the divergent ways in which pay-related statistics are collected and presented, mean that comparisons between countries are hard to draw. Nevertheless, given the key importance of pay in industrial relations, we provide these general indications of recent developments while pointing out the problems, caveats and qualifications. The figures provided should be treated with extreme caution, and the various notes and explanations read with care. Average collectively agreed pay increases Collective bargaining plays a significant role in pay setting in all countries considered here. The share of the workforce of the extended EU that have their pay and conditions set, at least to some extent, by collective agreements stands at around two-thirds - though considerably lower in many of the new Member States (eg Estonia and Latvia) and the UK, and higher in some of the EU 15 (eg France, Belgium, Sweden, Finland and Italy). The role of bargaining in pay determination differs widely between the countries. Notably, the different bargaining levels (intersectoral, sectoral, company etc) play different parts, while the importance of bargaining in pay determination differs considerably between economic sectors and groups of workers. igure 1 below provides figures for average nominal collectively agreed basic pay increases in each country (or a broadly equivalent indicator, where these are not available). Where possible, the figures cover the whole economy, though there are exceptions (see the notes below the figure). Data are not yet available for the whole of 2004 in a number of cases. Variations in the 2003 figures from those appearing in the EIRO pay update for 2003 are explained mainly by the replacement of provisional or partial figures with more reliable ones, plus in some cases changes in the data used, where more appropriate sources have been identified. (In this and subsequent figures, the data are sorted in order of increase [highest to lowest] for 2004. Where there is no 2004 figure, the country is ranked by its 2003 figure in comparison with the 2004 figures for the other countries.) Figure 1. Average collectively agreed pay increases, 2003 and 2004 (%) Source: EIRO. * 2004 figure excluding France. The statistics in figure 1 should be read in conjunction with the following notes. Austria: figures, from Statistik Austria index of agreed minimum wages, refer to most collective agreements concluded in the autumn of each year. Belgium: figures cover blue-collar workers only (equivalent figures for white-collar workers were 1.9% in 2003 and 2.2% in 2004); figures represent total of collectively agreed pay increases - 0.4% in 2003 and 1.4% in 2004 for blue-collar workers (0.1% in 2003 and 0.9% in 2004 for white-collar workers) - plus automatic pay indexation and effects of reduction of working time; figures, from Federal Public Service for Employment, Labour and Social Dialogue (SPF Emploi, Travail et Concertation sociale/FOD Werkgelegenheid, Arbeid en Sociaal Overleg), are for years to December. Bulgaria: no figures available for average collectively agreed pay increase (bargaining coverage is patchy); the statistics provided, from the National Statistics Institute (NSI), are for the average increase in earnings; 2004 figure is for the first nine months. Cyprus: 2003 figure from Pancyprian Federation of Labour (PEO); 2004 figure is estimate (range of 2.0%-2.2%) by Employers and Industrialists Federation (OEB). Czech Republic: figures, from Information System on Working Conditions (ISWC), refer to nominal increases in enterprise-level collective agreements (the more prevalent bargaining level); the Czech-Moravian Confederation of Trade Unions (Ceskomoravská konfederace odborových svazu, CMKOS) estimates the average nominal increase in higher-level collective agreements signed by its affiliates in 2004 at 4.0%. Denmark: no general figures available, and figures used relate to the key industry sector agreement, which operates the 'minimum-wage' system, whereby sectoral agreements set only minimum rates, with subsequent local bargaining producing further increases; the figures represent the minimum hourly increases from March each year. Estonia: no figures available for average collectively agreed pay increases (data collection is still being developed, and bargaining coverage is low); the statistics provided are the increases recorded in a wages survey by the Statistical Office of Estonia (Statistikaamet, ESA); 2004 figure is the increase in first three quarters, compared with first three quarters of 2003 - the annual figure will be higher, as increases are generally greater in the fourth quarter. Finland: figures refers to the average annual labour cost impact of the 2003-4 central incomes policy agreement, which provided: in 2003 for a general pay rise of EUR 0.17 per hour or EUR 28.39 per month from March, with a minimum increase of 1.8%, plus an additional 0.8% for sectoral distribution and an 'equality item' of 0.3%, payable according to the gender balance in each sector; and in 2004 for a general rise of EUR 0.16 per hour or EUR 26.72 per month from March, with a minimum increase of 1.7%, plus an additional 0.5% for sectoral distribution. France: figure, from the Ministry of Employment's Office for Research and Statistics (Direction de l'animation de la recherche, des études et des statistiques du ministère de l'Emploi, DARES), refers to the weighted average increase in sectoral collective agreements' pay scales (the equivalent figure for 2002 was 3.1%); the median increase in sectoral collective agreements' pay scales in 2003 was 2.8% (2.6 % in 2002). Germany: figures, from the Institute for Economics and Social Science (Wirtschafts- und Sozialwissenschaftliches Institut, WSI) collective agreement archive, represent the annual average increase in collectively agreed pay per employee. Greece: figures refer to increases in minimum rates as set out in 2002-3 and 2004-5 National General Collective Agreements. Hungary: na Ireland: the 2003 figure refers only to the private sector and represents the first 3% increase under the first 18-month Sustaining Progress (SP) national wage agreement, (2003-4) covering the first nine months of the deal, plus half of the 2% increase for the next six months of the deal; the 2004 figure refers only to the private sector and represents the second half of the second 2% increase under the first SP deal, plus the final 2% increase, plus the first 1.5% awarded under the second SP deal (which also awarded low-paid workers an additional 0.5%); different pay arrangements apply under national agreements in the public sector, with average increases totalling 5.0% in 2003 and 11.5% in 2004. Italy: figures, from National Institute of Statistics (Istituto Nazionale di Statistica, Istat), based on the contents of national sectoral collective agreements (include basic pay, shift allowances, monthly bonuses and other bonuses regularly paid during the course of the year); 2004 figure represents the January-November increase compared with same period in 2003.

Malta: figures, from the Economic Survey by the government's Economic Policy Division, refer to the 12 months to September in each year. Netherlands: figures from Labour Inspectorate (Arbeidsinspectie). Norway: there are no reliable figures on collectively agreed basic pay increases for all employees; the figures given, from the Technical Calculation Committee for Income Settlements (Teknisk Beregningsutvalg, TBU), represent the total annual pay increase (including wage drift and 'carryover' effects from previous years); 2004 figure expressed by TBU as 3¾%.

Romania: 2003 figures refer to the increase set out in the tripartite 'single national collective agreement', which provides a minimum basic framework for employment conditions; 2004 figure refers to national minimum wage increase imposed by government (after bargaining over single national collective agreement failed). Slovakia: 2003 figure is EIRO estimate; 2004 figure from Information System on Working Conditions, Trexima Bratislava. Slovenia: figures, from Official Journal of the Republic of Slovenia (Uradni list Republike Slovenije), refer to private sector only; equivalent figures for public sector were 5.0% in 2003 and 1.2% in 2004.

UK: figures. from Labour Research Department (LRD) Workplace Report, are for the 12 months to October each year. Real pay increases Figure 1 above refers to nominal pay increases. To produce an indication of real pay increases, figure 2 below adjusts the increases for inflation, subtracting the annual rates of inflation for December 2002-December 2003 and December 2003-December 2004 respectively, as calculated in line with Eurostat's Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). Similar inflation figures are not available for Bulgaria and Romania, so national sources are used (National Statistics Institute and Institute of National Statistics respectively). For the EU 25 as a whole, 2004 saw inflation start to rise, from an average of 1.9% over December 2002-December 2003 to an average of 2.4% over December 2003-December 2004. The EU 15 witnessed a similar rise, from 1.8% to 2.2%. Figure 2.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0973	2010-01-07	UNK	Background note, 21 April 2005	 PAY DEVELOPMENTS IN EUROPE 2004: Continued wage moderation across Europe Press release (in English), Supporting graphics (in English) European workers’ wages increased by less in 2004 than in previous years, the Foundation’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) reveals in its annual update of collectively agreed pay increases. Confirming a continuing slowdown of pay increases, the average nominal increases across the EU25 fell from 4.2% in 2003 to 4.0% in 2004, although there were major variations between countries. When adjusted for inflation, workers in the majority of EU Member States received real pay increases in 2004, ranging from 0.1 to 4,5%. For workers in Germany (-0.2), Malta (-0,3), Spain (-0,3), Austria (-0,4) and Cyprus (-1,8%), inflation outstripped the nominal pay increases for 2004. Background This annual update from the Foundation’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) aims to provide a broad, general indication of trends in pay increases over 2003 and 2004 across the EU Member States, two candidate countries (Bulgaria and Romania) and Norway. This review also looks at collectively agreed pay increases in selected sectors (chemicals, retail and the civil service), increases in average earnings and minimum wages, and the gender pay gap. Caution We do not attempt to produce a fully scientific and comparable set of pay comparisons, given that EIRO is not a statistical service and that pay is an area where meaningful international comparisons are especially difficult. Differing national systems of pay formation, industrial relations, taxation and social security, and the divergent ways in which pay-related statistics are collected and presented, mean that comparisons between countries are hard to draw. Nevertheless, given the key importance of pay in industrial relations, we provide these general indications of recent developments while pointing out the problems, caveats and qualifications.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0974	2010-01-07	UNK	Background note, 26 April 2005	High life satisfaction despite poor work-life balance in Spain Press release (in English and Spanish) Note to the editor The European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) was carried out in May–August 2003, by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in the EU25 and in the three candidate countries – Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey. The survey is an important source of information, highlighting the opportunities and challenges facing the EU since its recent enlargement. It aims to provide an accurate picture of the social situation in an enlarged EU, which includes both objective and subjective elements. Nevertheless, it should be noted that there are some limitations to the data. While the sample sizes of approximately 1,000 samples per country do provide a general population profile, they are too small to allow for a detailed analysis of sub-groups, such as immigrants or single parent families. Furthermore, although the wide range of topics covered in the survey is, on the one hand, informative, it also means that the topics could not be treated in extreme detail. Some of the dimensions of quality of life are measured using a more narrow set of indicators than ones used in highly-specialised surveys. However, the strength of the survey is that it provides both objective and subjective information on the main aspects of quality of life. Methodology A single standard questionnaire was used in the survey. Interviews were carried out face-to-face and the unit of interview was the sampled individual, although certain items relating to characteristics of the household were also included in the questionnaire. The questionnaire was originally drafted in English by a consortium of research institutes; it was then translated into the national languages of the Member States, using back-translation methods to check the accuracy of translation. It was designed to fit into a 35-minute interview time-frame, given the available fieldwork budget. The questionnaire covered a broad spectrum of life domains with an emphasis on employment, housing, family, social and political participation, quality of society and subjective well-being. Fieldwork for the survey was carried out by Intomart, a European private sector data collection agency, which coordinates a network of partner agencies spanning the 28 countries. Methods of sample selection varied, but consisted mainly of ‘random walk’ methods for the selection of households, as well as random selection of individuals aged 18 years and over within households. In all countries, the sampling method was designed to provide a fully randomised sample. Although the overall response rate was 58%, individual response rates varied widely and ranged from below 35% in Ireland and Spain, to 91% in Germany. For 23 of the countries surveyed, the sample size achieved was around 1,000 cases. For the five smaller states – Cyprus, Malta, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Estonia – the sample size was approximately 600 cases. The total sample size consisted of 26,257 cases. Sample data were re-weighted by age, sex and region, to conform to national population patterns. After collection, the data were checked extensively by the Social Science Centre in Berlin (WZB). More than 50 macro-indicators were added at this point, in order to link respondents’ reports (e.g. household income) with the social situation of the country (e.g. GDP per capita). Next step Analysis of the survey results has already begun, with a review of the main findings in relation to country and demographic characteristics. This provides the basis for a descriptive report on how countries differ in some respects, and how the results are related to the characteristics of social groups. There are no extensive attempts to explain why such differences arise. More detailed analysis is underway to examine the data in relation to more specific themes and to improve understanding of the results. Four reports are near completion in relation to: quality of life, subjective well-being and perception of society; households and family, social networks and community life; living standards and resources, income and employment, subsistence economy, deprivation and exclusion; housing and local environment. Further in-depth analysis is being commissioned and papers based on the analytical reports will be published from 2005 onwards.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0975	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 5 May 2005	" Less holidays, longer hours for workers in EU’s new Member States Workers in the 10 new EU Member States work on average 112 hours - or almost three working weeks - more per year than workers 			in the EU15, according to the Foundation’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) in its annual update on working 			time developments. Workers in Sweden, for example, had 44 days off from work last year - more than double the collectively 			agreed annual leave and public holidays for workers in Estonia, Lithuania, Poland and Slovenia. Collectively agreed weekly working time has stabilised at 38.6 hours in the last two years, on average 0.7 hours shorter 			in the EU15 and Norway and 0.9 hours longer in the new EU countries. The EIRO comparative report found, however, that the 			normal working week is longer in all countries (except Lithuania) than the average collectively agreed working week. 			In the EU25, average usual weekly hours were 40.2 in 2003, compared with average collectively agreed weekly working time of 			38.6 hours in 2004. The highest levels of usual hours worked by full-time employees in the EU25 are found in Latvia, the UK and Poland, and the 			lowest in Italy, France and the Netherlands. Within the EU15 countries, the United Kingdom stands out with the longest 			full-time hours (43.1) and a 5.9 hours gap between agreed and usual hours. Norway has the lowest hours of all the countries 			examined. ’Collective bargaining plays a key role in determining the duration of working time in most of the countries in Europe, 			with coverage levels of around three-quarters of the workforce in the former EU15 and less than half in the new Member States,’ 			comments Willy Buschak, Acting Director of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and 			Working Conditions. ‘Still, we found that women in part-time jobs work on average two hours more than men in part-time 			jobs in Denmark, Germany and Sweden. The opposite is the case in Greece, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg and Portugal, where 			women in part-time occupations work, on average, two hours less than men.’ The EIRO comparative study looks at working time developments in all EU countries plus Bulgaria, Romania and Norway. 			It provides information on average collectively agreed weekly hours, statutory maximum working week and day, usual 			weekly working hours, annual leave and annual working time. It also examines collectively agreed weekly hours in the 			manufacturing industry (chemicals), services (retail) and the public sector (central civil service).

EUROFOUND_UNK_0977	2010-01-07	UNK	Background note, 14 March 2005	 Industrial relations in the EU, Japan and USA, 2003-4 Back to press release (in English) It seems that 2003-4 was not a period of radical change in industrial relations in the EU, Japan and USA, with the main feature being a continuation of previously established trends. However, there were signs of some developments that may point the way to longer-term change. Since 2000, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions has each year conducted a project comparing aspects of industrial relations in the European Union and the world's two other largest economies - Japan and the USA. The essential aim is to provide a picture of similarities and differences in both basic structures and current developments, not least to help illuminate what does and does not make the 'European social model' distinctive, and to assist with 'benchmarking' the EU against its major competitors in an era of deepening economic globalisation. The information in this report on the EU is taken mainly from the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). In the areas of migration and pensions especially, there are some gaps in the information available for the 10 new Member States that joined the Union in May 2004. The data for Japan and the USA are taken largely from special reports on industrial relations developments in 2003-4 prepared for the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions by experts in these countries - see JP0411101F and US0411101F- plus sources such as the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Japan Institute for Labour Policy and Training (JILPT). Furthermore, parts of the report are informed by the discussions at a conference on 'Industrial relations in the EU, USA and Japan' organised in Dublin on 18-19 October 2004 by the Foundation. Unemployment levels Unemployment levels in the EU remain much higher than in Japan and the USA. The EU's projected rate for 2004 is 9.1%, compared with 5.5% in the USA and 4.8% in Japan. The accession of the new Member States has pushed up overall EU rate - the 2004 figure for the EU 15 alone is 8.1%, though this is still substantially higher than in Japan and the USA. The EU rate rose in 2002 (to 8.9%) and 2003 (to 9.1%), before flattening out in 2004 (the same trend was observed in the EU 15). The US rate also rose in 2002 (to 5.8%) and 2003 (to 6.0%), but is projected to fall quite sharply in 2004. Japan's long-term upward trend peaked in 2002 (at 5.4%), before falling slightly in 2003 and more substantially in 2004. Collective bargaining In Japan and the USA, collective bargaining coverage continued its long and relatively slow decline (mirroring falling trade union membership), now standing at around a fifth and an eighth of the workforce respectively. In the EU Member States, there was little change in bargaining coverage reported in 2003-4 (the longer-term picture is general stability in the EU 15, though decline in a few cases such as the UK). However, at overall EU level the accession of the 10 new Member States in 2004 - most of which have much lower bargaining coverage rates than the old Member States - has reduced the coverage of the EU workforce by bargaining. Nevertheless, somewhere around two-thirds of the workforce of the expanded EU are probably still covered. Bargaining remained almost entirely decentralised in Japan and the USA, and indeed Japanese unions experienced greater difficulties than in the past in even setting industry-wide wage increase targets in the 2003-4 enterprise-level bargaining rounds. In the EU countries, bargaining was, as usual, conducted at all levels from the national intersectoral to the individual workplace, depending on national systems, while still being considerably more centralised overall than in Japan and the USA. However, the new EU Member States generally have decentralised bargaining systems and enlargement has thus arguably shifted the 'average' level of bargaining towards the company level. 2003-4 also saw increasing pressure towards decentralisation in a number of 'old' EU Member States - prime examples being France and Germany - with long-standing systems of sectoral collective bargaining (though generally the move is towards 'organised' decentralisation while maintaining a sectoral framework). The single most important issue in US collective bargaining remained health insurance, against a background of rising healthcare costs. In Japan, there were some signs of diversification beyond pay in the regular annual spring bargaining rounds. The bargaining agenda in some EU Member States (especially the 'old' ones) continued to encompass a wide and varying range of issues beyond pay and working hours. Trade union membership The already comparatively low level of trade union membership and density continued to fall in the USA and Japan. In the EU (where the overall union density is considerably higher than in Japan and the USA), 2003-4 is likely to have witnessed a continuation of the trends of the past decade - rising membership (though not necessarily density) in a substantial number of countries, but an overall fall in union membership across the EU, mainly because of massive membership losses in some central and eastern European countries and significant losses in large countries with high absolute numbers of union members, such as Germany and the UK. Against this backdrop, union mergers continued in Japan and many EU countries, while proposals for a radical merger and restructuring process threatened to split the USA's AFL-CIO confederation. Another common theme has been for unions to reach out to new groups outside their traditional constituencies. On the employer side, a number of organisations restructured or merged in some EU Member States in 2003-4. Industrial action In Japan and the USA, labour disputes and industrial action remained at very low levels in historical terms. The picture was more mixed in the EU 15, but the data available again indicate that a general trend towards lower levels of strikes and similar activity has been maintained in most countries in recent years. In some of the generally low-strike new Member States, however, 2003-4 saw a number of signs of increasing militancy, often over pay.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/background-note-14-march-2005
EUROFOUND_UNK_0978	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 2 March 2005	 Health, social services and education sectors most at risk of stress While work intensification may be levelling off, stress-related outcomes – such as burnout, fatigue, or back problems – are still on the increase, according to the latest topic report from the Foundation’s European Working Conditions Observatory (EWCO). The report attempts to assess the scale and prevalence of work-related stress in a sample of seven Member States, and to analyse the role of contributing factors such as lack of job control, job insecurity, lack of social support at work and changing work organisation patterns (lean production, just in time management). It reveals that the health, social services and education sectors are most at risk of work-related stress. As these sectors employ a significant majority of women and are large-scale employers, stress tends to affect a disproportionate number of female workers. Nonetheless, where trend information is present in the northern European countries, the data indicate an increase in stress-related outcomes both for men and women. Putting a price on work-related stress is an exercise fraught with difficulty but the report cites figures from the German authorities estimating the costs of absenteeism due to psychological disorders to have been €3 billion in 2001. Work-related stress is one factor behind the large increase in this type of work absence. Despite the growing costs associated with work-related stress, the authors point out that little research exists on the effectiveness of organisational interventions to combat stress. The issue of work-related stress, including its identification and prevention, has received increasing attention at national and EU level. The recent work-related stress agreement negotiated by the EU level social partners shows that there is a will to establish a framework within which employee and employer representatives can work together to combat stress at work. The Foundation’s topic report is based on an analysis of data from national surveys and research information available from seven countries: Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden. The European Working Conditions Observatory currently has a network of national correspondents covering 12 EU Member States, as well as an EU level correspondent reporting on working conditions developments. Four new national correspondents covering UK, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria will join the network in 2005.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0979	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 14 March 2005	 Still wide differences in industrial relations in the EU, Japan and USA Background note (in English) Collective bargaining remains the dominant method of settling pay and working time in Europe, covering around two-thirds of workers in the European Union of 25 countries. This stands in contrast to the one fifth of the workforce in Japan and only one eighth of the US workforce that are covered by collective agreements. The levels, methods and even issues of collective bargaining remain widely different between the three economic blocks, argues the Foundation in its new ‘Industrial Relations in the EU, Japan and USA 2003-4’ report. Since 2000, the Foundation’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) has each year conducted a project comparing aspects of industrial relations in the European Union, Japan and the USA. The aim of the project is to provide a picture of similarities and differences in both basic structures and current developments, not least to help illuminate what does and does not make the 'European social model' distinctive. On the issue of trade union membership levels, the report found a continuation of recent trends in the European Union: rising membership levels in a substantial number of countries, but an overall fall in union membership. The already comparatively low level of trade union membership and density continued to fall in the USA and Japan. Union mergers continued in Japan and many EU countries, while proposals for a radical merger and restructuring process raises questions for the USA's AFL-CIO confederation. Another common theme has been for unions to reach out to new groups outside their traditional constituencies. On the employer side, a number of organisations restructured or merged in some EU Member States in 2003-4. On the issue of industrial actions, the report found that labour disputes and industrial action remained at very low levels in Japan and the USA. In the EU15, industrial action is more common, but data available indicate a general trend towards lower levels of strikes and similar activities.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0980	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 1 March 2005	 Hungarians are happier but less satisfied with life than average Also available in Hungarian Hungarians are less satisfied with life and less optimistic about the future than average in the European Union, according to the European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) carried out by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. Hungarians are, however, happier than average in the new EU Member States. Hungarians also rate the quality of their housing and local environment, as well as social and health care services, higher than new Member States averages. House ownership without a mortgage is twice as common in Hungary (76%) than in the former EU15 (38%). The Foundation’s research on quality of life in Europe, based on 26,000 face-to-face interviews across 28 European countries, sheds light on the living conditions, subjective well-being and individuals’ perceptions of their society. The survey paints a picture of a relatively stable albeit technologically inept labour market. A quarter (20%) of Hungarians report having participated in a training course during the previous 12 months – which is on par with the former EU15 (21%) and new Member States (19%) averages. More importantly, only 9% of Hungarians report a fear of losing their job in the next six months, which is closer to the former EU15 average of 8% than the 17% in the new Member States and 27% in the three candidate countries. A whopping four out of every five Hungarians (80%) claim not to use the Internet at all, which is the lowest level of usage in the European Union of 25 countries plus the three candidate countries Bulgarian, Romania and Turkey. ‘Although differences in living conditions are considerable, values and priorities determining quality of life are not very different across the European Union – there is no underlying reason for a division between us and them, the west and the east,’ says Willy Buschak, Acting Director of the Foundation. ‘However, policymakers and civil society actors need to know not only how people live, but also how they perceive their situation and how individual quality of life is assessed, to foster cohesion in a larger and more diversified European Union. We believe our report not only provides a unique portrait of quality of life in the enlarged Europe, but that it also can provide the knowledge necessary to close the gaps in unequal economic development and living standards in the enlarged Europe.’ All material indicators suggest that Hungarians are economically on par with people in the new EU Member States. On the one hand, almost two out three Hungarians (63%) cannot afford one week’s annual holiday, which is lower than average in both the former EU15 average (24%) and the new Member States (61%). On the other hand, however, 28% of the respondents report feeling severe subjective economic strain, which is below the average for the new Member States (39%).

EUROFOUND_UNK_0981	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 15 February 2005	 More job losses across Europe in the last quarter A total of 309 restructuring cases or 161,090 job redundancies were announced during the last quarter of 2004 across the 18 EU Member States covered by the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM). This represents a sharp increase on the previous quarter when 159 cases or 56,342 job losses were reported. The majority of cases were noted in just four countries – UK (68), Germany (45), Poland (45) and France (44). At the same time, however, some 74 business expansion cases were recorded, resulting in 38,725 new jobs from the beginning of October to the end of December 2004. Once again, the majority of these cases were reported in just four countries, with new Member States Poland (29) and Slovakia (12) attracting 9,520 and 5,065 jobs respectively whilst France (16) and the UK (13) boast the bulk of the remaining job creation with 10,640 and 6,990. ‘The new high numbers for both job losses and job creations in Europe confirm the trend of increasing industrial restructuring,’ says Willy Buschak, Acting Director of the European Foundation for the Improvement for Living and Working Conditions, the Dublin-based EU-agency, in response to the findings. ‘The worst hit sectors are manufacturing, transport, telecommunications and financial services.’ The European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) is an information service of the Foundation that analyses data on industrial restructuring in Europe. ERM is served by a network of correspondents whose task is to register cases of industrial restructuring reported in the press in the former EU15 and three of the 10 new Member States: the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. Coverage will include all 25 EU Member States as well as Bulgaria and Romania in April 2005.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0982	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 09 February 2005	 Massive job losses announced in the UK Almost 24,000 jobs are set to go in the United Kingdom, if companies follow through with restructuring activities announced during last quarter of 2004, according to the new European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) Quarterly. Some 57 restructuring cases, which will result in job losses over the next 12 months, were recorded by the ERM in the period from the beginning of October to the end of December 2004. Worst hit are the chemical, financial services, and transport sectors. During the same period, however, some 13 announcements of business expansion were recorded, which will result in 6,990 new jobs being created. The high levels of industrial restructuring - one of the highest in the European Union - come at a time when the UK economy enters a record breaking fiftieth quarter of economic growth and employment growth levels at an all-time high. An average job in the UK cost £29,700, making it the seventh-most expensive country in terms of employment costs in Europe. ‘Relocation of jobs to low-cost labour markets outside the EU is a big threat to certain UK industries and areas, in particular the financial and insurance sectors,’ says Willy Buschak, Acting Director of the European Foundation for the Improvement for Living and Working Conditions, the Dublin-based EU-agency, in response to the findings. ‘In the last quarter, ERM recorded 6,281 job losses in the UK’s financial services sector. Unions fear that another 12,000 jobs are to be moved from the UK to low-cost wage centres in Asia and South Africa in 2005.’ The European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) is an information service by the European Foundation that analyses data on industrial restructuring in Europe. ERM is served by a network of correspondents whose task is to register cases of industrial restructuring reported in the press in the former EU15 and three of the 10 new Member States: Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. Coverage will be extended to 25 EU Member States, and Bulgaria and Romania, in April 2005. The ERM Quarterly is available online.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0983	2010-01-06	UNK	Press          release, 14 May 2007	Eurofound publishes report on Quality of Life in Turkey Turkish people satisfied with life but key differences remain (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Turkish people report overall satisfaction with their quality of life despite the fact that there are major differences when it comes to education, employment, healthcare and public services, according to the results of Eurofound’s latest report on Quality of life in Turkey. The majority of Turkish people are satisfied with their life in areas most important to them as individuals, for example, family life. However, in areas for which the state is directly responsible, such as education and the standard of living, opinions are vastly different. Also, the distribution of income between households varies considerably and almost half the population reports that they have had trouble paying for at least one household necessity during the year. Commenting on the report, Eurofound Director Jorma Karppinen, stated ‘This report highlights the complex picture of the social situation in modern-day Turkey. Although major differences still remain in comparison to the EU, significant advances have clearly been made in the quality of life for Turkish people.’ Turkey is a young society, with almost a third (29%) of its population is under the age of 15. The number of children owes more to improved public health than to family size, for two children is now the average. Its population may exceed 90 million by 2023 and 100 million by 2050, surpassing Germany’s - currently the highest in the European Union - in just over a decade. Its income per head is lower than any EU Member State. Turkish GDP per capita is far below the EU average, although the annual growth rate of Turkish GDP is much greater than the average for EU15 countries. The biggest demographic challenge facing Turkish policymakers is increasing the supply of jobs. Although attitudes to work are positive, Turkey has a much lower proportion of adults participate in the labour force than is common in EU countries. The majority are employed in unstable daily-paid work or self-employed. As a consequence, almost every second Turk report having had trouble paying for at least one household necessity during the previous 12 months. Gender differences are also significant: more than five times as many men as women are in paid employment, with women twice as likely to be unpaid family workers.

The study compares the social conditions of Turkish people with those in the EU15, the 10 Member States who joined the EU in 2004 and with Turkey’s own neighbours, Bulgaria and Romania who became members of the EU this year.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0984	2010-01-07	UNK	Background note, 27 January 2005	The European Quality of life survey (EQLS) This European Quality of Life (EQLS) survey was carried out by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in the EU25 and three candidate countries (Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey) in May-August 2003. The EQLS represents an ambitious attempt to explore quality of life in a wide range of countries. It is a major source of information, highlighting the opportunities and challenges the EU faces in the light of recent enlargement. The survey provides an accurate picture of the social situation in the enlarged Union, a picture that includes both objective and subjective elements. At the same time, it should be noted that there are some limitations to the data. While the sample sizes of around 1,000 per country provide a general population profile, they are too small to allow for detailed analysis of sub-groups, such as immigrants or single parent families. Furthermore, although the wide range of topics covered by the survey is on the one hand a clear advantage, it also means that none of the topics could be treated in great depth. Some of the dimensions of quality of life are measured with a narrower set of indicators than one would use in highly-specialised surveys. However, the strength of the survey is that it provides a synthesis of information on the main aspects of quality of life, both objective and subjective. Improving health status a crucial task in the new Member States Being in good health is an important factor for enjoying a high quality of life. In the new Member States and the candidate countries, the self-rated health status is on average worse than in the EU15. Compared to the latter, poor health status is reported 2.5 times more often by the citizens living in the new Member States, and two times more in the candidate countries, respectively. About one third of the population in the new Member States reports having a long-standing illness, compared to one fifth in the former EU15. People living in post-communist countries report health problems more frequently than those living in Cyprus, Malta or Turkey. These findings for individual health correspond with widespread dissatisfaction with the quality of the health services and with reported difficulties in access to medical care in post-communist countries. NMS citizens less satisfied with quality of life, but equally optimistic The report found that subjective well-being is lower in the new Member States than in the former EU15, reflecting gaps found in objective living conditions, especially economic resources and living standards, working conditions and health. In most EU15 countries, the least satisfied groups are still more satisfied than the most satisfied groups in the new Member States and the candidate countries. Material living conditions are of paramount importance for citizens’ subjective well-being, but aspects of ‘loving’ and ‘being’ also impact on how satisfied people are with their lives. More home owners in the new Member States but worse housing conditions One in five households in the new Member States and one in three in the candidate countries lack an indoor flushing toilet or have housing problems such as rot in windows, damp and leaks, the survey reveals. Fewer than 10% of households in the former EU15 face such problems. The housing conditions confirm the general picture of poorer living conditions in the new Member States and three candidate countries. By and large, living space is smaller, homes are less comfortable, and the neighbourhood less secure. However, home ownership is much more common in the new Member States and the candidate countries. Nearly 75% live in their own house compared to 60% in the EU15. Strong family ties In all 28 countries, families and friends are shown to be a crucial factor in providing social integration and support. In both groups of countries, a huge majority of the population – around 80-95% – can count on help from relatives, friends or neighbours when personal problems arise; and in all countries, people rely primarily on family members. In general, support from family members is found to be more important in the new Member States and the candidate countries than in the EU15. Strong family ties in the new Member States and the candidate countries are also indicated by a higher frequency of contacts with other family members. Here, around 85% have frequent contact with parents or children, compared to 72% in the EU15. Methodology A single standard questionnaire was used. Interviews were face-to-face and the unit of interview was the sampled individual although certain items relating to characteristics of the household were included in the questionnaire. The questionnaire was originally drafted in English by a consortium of research institutes and was then translated into the national languages of the Member States, using back-translation methods to check the accuracy of the translation. It was designed to fit into a 35-minute interview in light of the available fieldwork budget. The questionnaire covers a broad spectrum of life domains with an emphasis on employment, housing, family, social and political participation, quality of society and subjective well-being. The fieldwork was carried out by Intomart, a European private sector data collection agency, which coordinates a network of partner agencies spanning the 28 countries. Methods of sample selection varied but consisted mainly of ‘random walk’ methods to select households and random selection of individuals aged 18 and over within households. In all countries, the sampling method was designed to provide a fully randomised sample. The overall response rate was 58% but response rates varied widely, ranging from under 35% in Ireland and Spain to a reported 91% in Germany. For 23 of the countries, the achieved sample size was around 1,000 cases. For five smaller states (Cyprus, Malta, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Estonia) the sample size was approximately 600. The total achieved sample consisted of 26,257 cases. Sample data were re-weighted by age, sex and region to conform to national population patterns. After data collection the data were checked extensively by the Social Science Centre in Berlin (WZB). More than 50 macro-indicators were added at this stage in order to provide a linkage between respondents’ reports (e.g. household income) and the social situation of the country (e.g. GDP per capita). Next steps Analysis of results from the survey has begun with a review of the main findings in relation to country and demographic characteristics. This provides the basis for a descriptive report of how countries differ in some respects, and how the results are related to the characteristics of social groups. There are no extensive attempts to explain why such differences arise. More detailed analysis is underway to examine the data on more specific themes and to improve understanding of the results. Four reports are nearing completion on: Quality of life, subjective well-being and perception of society Households and family, social networks and community life Living standards and resources, income and employment, subsistence economy, deprivation and exclusion Housing and local environment Further in-depth analysis is being commissioned and papers based on the analytical reports will be published from 2005 onwards.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0985	2010-01-07	UNK	Press release, 27 January 2005	Austrians are satisfied and happy with life but wary about the future Austrians are happier and more satisfied with life than the average European, according to the European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) carried out by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. Austrians also rate the quality of their housing, social and health care services among the highest in all EU28 countries. However, Austrians are among the least optimistic about the future in Europe, a tendency which is particularly noted among older people. What's more, a relatively large amount of Austrians report tension between generations, and few people have much trust in the state-funded pensions system. The Foundation’s research on quality of life in Europe, based on 26,000 face-to-face interviews across 28 European countries, sheds light on the living conditions, subjective well-being and individuals’ perceptions of their society. The results of this survey provide a unique portrait of quality of life in the enlarged Europe. ‘Although differences in living conditions are considerable, values and priorities determining quality of life are not very different across the European Union – there is no underlying reason for a division between us and them, the west and the east,’ says Willy Buschak, Acting Director of the Foundation. ‘However, in order to foster cohesion in a larger and more diversified European Union and to close the gaps in unequal economic development and living standards, policymakers and civil society actors need first of all to know not only how people live, but also how they perceive their situation and how individual quality of life is assessed. We believe our report can provide this knowledge.’ All material indicators suggest that Austrians are generally well-off in comparison to most Europeans: only 14% of Austrians cannot afford one week’s annual holiday and only 3% report feeling severe subjective economic strain, figures which are well below European averages. The survey also paints a picture of stability and confidence in the Austrian labour market. A quarter (27%) of Austrians report having participated in a training course during the previous 12 months - again higher than the EU average (21%). Only 5% of Austrians report fearing losing their job in the next six months, compared with an average of 8% in the former EU15 countries, 17% in the new Member States, and 27% in the candidate countries.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0986	2010-01-06	UNK	Press             release, 2 October 2007	"Eurofound presents the Fourth European Working Conditions Survey for Hungary: Hungarian workers: exposed but well-informed about health and safety risks at work More workers in Hungary are exposed to health and safety risks at work than elsewhere in the ten new EU Member States, but nine out of ten workers (91.6%) in Hungary consider themselves well-informed about health and safety risks. This level of information about health and safety risks at work is higher in Hungary than on average in the EU15 (82.4%) and in the new Member States (88.3%). ‘The European Working Conditions Survey shows that workers in Hungary are almost as satisfied with their working conditions as on average in the ten new EU Member States, and that fewer Hungarian workers fear loosing their job in the coming six months than on average in the former Eastern European bloc of countries,’ Jorma Karppinen, Director of Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU agency, will tell representatives from the Hungarian government and social partners in Budapest during a visit on 1-2 October 2007. ‘There are, however, concerns in relations to pay levels, career prospects, work organisation, and health and safety at work, among Hungarian workers that policy-makers will have to address to reach the Lisbon objectives.’ The survey reveals few modern characteristics in the organisation of work in Hungary, with fewer Hungarian workers report using computers, the Internet and email at work, or tele-work from home, than workers in the EU15 and the other new EU Member States. One in three workers in Hungary (29.4%) work with computers, in contrast to the average level in the EU15 (49.8%) and in the new Member States (32.9%). Similarly, only one in four workers in Hungary (21.3%) use internet for work. Similarly negative, the levels of work intensity and working to tight deadlines are serious issues in Hungary with almost two out of every three workers feeling the strain. The representative survey also put job satisfaction under the spotlight. Three out of four workers in Hungary (75.9%) are satisfied or very satisfied with their working conditions, which is slightly lower with the average figure in the new Member States (77.2%) and the EU15 (84.8%). Another positive finding, more Hungarian workers (30.6%) report having a woman as an immediate boss, which is a higher proportion than in the EU15 (23.9%) and in the new Member States (28.3%). The report also found comparatively low levels of violence and harassment in the Hungarian workplaces; fewer workers in Hungary (2.7%) report threats of physical violence at work compared to the average level in the rest of the European Union of 15 countries (6.3%) and in the New Member States (5.2%). Four out of five Hungarian workers get help from their colleagues if they ask for it (79.9%), which is higher than the averages for the EU27 (67.6 % ) and the new Member States (76.6 %).

EUROFOUND_UNK_0987	2010-01-06	UNK	Press           release, 16 July 2007	Economic and social problems pose policy challenge for Croatia (DUBLIN, IRELAND) A substantial majority of Croatian citizens say they are happy with their family life and personal relationships. However, citizens of this candidate country for EU membership are pessimistic about the future and dissatisfied with the low income levels, regional differences in economic development, high long-term unemployment and the quality of public services. These are some of the findings of a new report from Eurofound, Quality of life in Croatia: Key findings from national research, based on a major nationwide survey into quality of life issues carried out in 2006. The report explores both objective living conditions and subjective views of well-being from a number of perspectives, and makes recommendations to policymakers on how quality of life in the country could be improved. While Croatians rate some aspects of their quality of life highly – such as interpersonal relationships, personal health, the environment and national security – other aspects pose considerable challenges for policymakers. The biggest challenge is how to boost living standards: average household incomes are around €300 per month. In 2005, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was less than half of the then EU25 average (as expressed in purchasing power parity, or PPP). Moreover, the average level of education is low, with over 40% of the population not having progressed beyond primary level. Overall, levels of trust and social cohesion are low: one third of citizens feel that caution is necessary when dealing with other people, 35% feel that tensions exist among ethnic groups, and 62% are concerned about tensions between rich and poor. Meanwhile, only one in four citizens feels optimistic about the future. The report recommends that raising living standards and promoting social inclusion should become a priority across all areas of policymaking. It suggests concrete measures to improve quality of life, including expanding the provision of affordable housing, giving incentives to encourage children and young people to stay in school longer, and making childcare more affordable to help women enter the workforce. The report draws its data from a range of findings, in particular the Quality of Life Survey conducted by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Croatia in 2006. This survey used a questionnaire that Eurofound had developed for its own European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS), conducted in 2003. (Croatia was not included at that time). The survey provides, for the first time, data and internationally comparable indicators that paint a comprehensive picture of life in Croatia in a European context.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0988	2010-01-06	UNK	Press          release, 27 June 2007	French satisfied with work, confident in the future (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Four out of five workers in France are satisfied or very satisfied with their working conditions, results from the fourth European Working Conditions Survey reveal. French workers also express confidence in their job with only half the number of French workers reporting a fear of losing their jobs in the coming six months compared to the average in the European Union of 27 countries. Only about one third of French workers (35.7%) consider themselves well-paid for the work they do, however, significantly lower than the EU27 average (44.3%), neighbouring Belgium (55.1%), Germany (58.4%) and Spain (47.7%). French workers also report traditional and regular working hours, with almost three quarters (71.4%) usually working the same five days per week. According to the report, the average commuting time in France is below the European average, 37 minutes versus 42 minutes per day. French workers also report high satisfactions levels with their ‘work-life balance’, working hours that fit with family and social commitments (80.9% against the EU27 average of 79.4%). Indeed, more workers in France are content with their work-life balance than in Spain (75.4%) but fewer than in Belgium (83.1%) or Germany (85.5%). ‘The results of this survey outline the challenges ahead in reaching the Lisbon objectives,’ says Willy Buschak, Eurofound’s Deputy Director presenting the findings to an audience of government, social partners and civil society representatives in Paris today. ‘Our research shows that the use of technology and access to training at work is still limited in France. On a positive note, however, more French workers enjoy good work-life balance with regular and foreseeable working times than elsewhere in Europe.’ Information and communication between workers and management in the companies and organisations in France does not seem to be a high priority, according to the findings of the report. Less than seven out of ten workers (68.9%) consider themselves well-informed about health and safety risks at work, below the European average of 83.1%. Also, fewer workers in France are consulted about changes in work organisation than in the rest of Europe (42.8% versus the EU27 average of 47.1%). Similarly, few workers are subject to regular formal assessment of performance in France than compared to the rest of Europe (27.5% against 40%). Also in France, fewer workers practice telework from home than on average in the European Union (7.0% versus 8.3%), despite the fact that more French workers (53.3% versus 45.5%) frequently use computers for work.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0989	2010-01-06	UNK	Press          release, 28 February 2007	Denmark tops European work satisfaction league Danish version More workers in Denmark are satisfied with their working conditions than elsewhere in Europe, according to findings from the European Foundation’s fourth European Working Conditions Survey. Many Danish workers (39%) also report high levels of prospects for career advancement, and more than every second worker (54%) consider themselves well paid for the work they do. The Danish labour market can be characterised as a productive, consumer-oriented service economy, with more workers (72%) dealing directly with customers than elsewhere in Europe (62%). Denmark, together with Sweden, Norway, and Finland, lead the way in Europe in using computers at work. More than half of all Danish workers use Internet and email at work, a figure which is significantly higher than the average figure for the European Union of 27 countries. More workers in Denmark (16%) regularly tele-work from home compared to the European average (8%). More than every second worker in Denmark (54%) is consulted about changes in the work organisation. This is less than the amount of workers consulted in the neighbouring Sweden (60%) and Finland (72%), but above the average levels for the EU27 (47%). Similarly positive, more than four out of five workers in Denmark are well informed about health and safety risks, despite levels of exposure to noise and tiring or painful positions at work remain close to the European averages, with no significant changes over the past five years. ‘The Danish labour market is the envy of Europe in terms of flexibility in the work places and high levels of satisfaction with working conditions among its workers,’ says Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director. ‘It’s a brilliant example of how good working conditions contribute to higher employment levels, productivity and growth, essentially the goals set out in the Lisbon criteria.’ Intensity at work is, however, in a growing problem reported by Danish workers. More Danish workers report working at very high speed (75%), to tight deadlines (69%), than average in Europe (60% and 62%). This is a similar pattern reported by workers in the other Nordic countries. Danish workers also report the highest levels of autonomy at work in Europe, with high levels of task rotation (68%), the possibility to choose or change the method (81%) and speed of work (81%). Danish workers also report high levels of teamwork. Bullying and harassment is another area of concern, as well as unwanted sexual attention, according to the report. While there exist different levels of awareness of violence, harassment and discrimination in European work places, the actual levels recorded in Denmark are higher than the averages for European countries. Efforts to tackle health and safety issues at work in Denmark seem to have an effect. Although almost one in every four worker complain about muscular pain (23%) and stress (27%) in Denmark, fewer workers (23%) consider health or safety at risk because of work than those in particularly Sweden (48%). More than nine in every ten workers (93%) in Denmark would argue that they are able to do the same job at 60 as they do today, a result significantly higher than the European average. The Foundation’s European Working Conditions Surveys, conducted every five years, provide a valuable insight into quality-of-work issues since 1990. The fourth survey presents the views of workers on a wide range of issues including work organisation, working time, equal opportunities, training, health and wellbeing and job satisfaction. The interviews were carried out in late 2005 with nearly 30,000 workers in 31 countries (the EU25, the then two acceding countries, Bulgaria and Romania, as well as Croatia, Norway, Switzerland, and Turkey.).

EUROFOUND_UNK_0990	2010-01-06	UNK	Press          release, 15 June 2007	High levels of paid-for training in Belgium (BRUSSELS, BELGIUM) Four out of ten Belgian workers (40%) have received training paid for by their employer over the previous 12 months, results from the fourth European Working Conditions Survey for Belgium show. This proportion is significantly higher than the average figure for the European Union of 27 countries (26%). Work in Belgium is characterised by a high level of autonomy, with the majority of workers able to change their methods of work (76%) as well as order of tasks and speed (both 72%). Nearly twice as many Belgian workers (14%) regularly telework from home compared to the European average (8%). Over four in ten (45%) use internet and e-mail at work. Most workers in Belgium report overall satisfaction with their working conditions (90%), with more than half of all workers (55%) considering themselves well paid for the work they do and that their job skills correspond well to their tasks at work. Similarly positive, a lower percentage of workers (31%) carry out monotonous tasks compared to the rest of Europe (42%). Although the survey gives a positive overview of working conditions in Belgium, it raises concerns about the levels of violence, harassment and discrimination at work. Belgium shows a relatively high rate of physical violence at work (8%), compared to an average of 6% for the EU27. This is also reflected in the levels of bullying (8%), comparatively higher than the average in the rest of Europe (5%). On a positive note, new legislation aimed at addressing this issue came into force on 6 June 2007 in Belgium. The European Working Conditions Surveys, carried out by the Dublin-based European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound), is conducted every five years. It provides a valuable insight into quality of work issues in Europe, illustrating trends and developments since 1990. The fourth survey presents the views of workers on a wide range of issues including the organisation of work, working time, equal opportunities, training, health and well-being and job satisfaction. The interviews were carried out in late 2005 with nearly 30,000 workers in 31 countries (the EU25, the two then acceding countries, Bulgaria and Romania, as well as Croatia, Norway, Switzerland, and Turkey).

EUROFOUND_UNK_0991	2010-01-06	UNK	Press             release, 27 September 2007	"Eurofound presents the Fourth European Working Conditions Survey for Portugal: Portuguese workers: overall satisfaction with work but not with pay Workers in Portugal report overall satisfaction with their working conditions – on a par with workers in the EU27 Member States, the fourth European Working Conditions Survey reveals. However, while one in three Portuguese workers thinks they have good career prospects, a significantly lower proportion of Portuguese workers than the EU average feel they are well paid for the work they do. Also, two out of ten workers are afraid of losing their job in the coming six months, an indicator significantly higher than in the rest of Europe. ‘The European Working Conditions Survey shows that Portuguese workers are by and large content with their working conditions, although there are concerns in relations to pay levels, the quality of work and flexibility within the workplace,’ according to Jorma Karppinen, Director of Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU agency. ‘The Portuguese labour market boasts high female labour market participation levels in comparison with the other EU Member States, which makes Portugal the only EU Member State in the south of Europe to have met this specific Lisbon employment objective.’ Most Portuguese workers say they are satisfied with their work–life balance, with four out of five workers (82.4%) able to balance working hours with family and social commitments. In fact, more workers in Portugal are content with their work–life balance than in Spain (75.4%), France (80.9%) and Italy (73%). In contrast to the rest of Europe, where work intensity is a growing phenomenon, fewer Portuguese workers than on average in Europe report this problem. Another positive finding is that more Portuguese workers than the EU average have a woman as their immediate boss (26.9% as against 24.5%). However, only just over a quarter of Portuguese workers (28.6%) consider themselves to be well paid, in contrast to the average level in the former EU15 (47%) and in EU27 countries (43.2%). Portugal also has a low level of tele-working from home (2.1%) compared to the situation in the EU27 (8.3%). Fewer workers in Portugal work with computers and use email/internet at work than on average in Europe and in the neighbouring countries. The survey also raises concerns over work-related health effects among Portuguese workers. Almost one out of three workers (31.4%) considers their health or safety to be at risk at work, and five out of ten (57.1%) work in tiring or painful positions. A high percentage of Portuguese workers report headaches (23.9%) and muscular pains (28.8%). The corresponding average figures for the EU27 countries are significantly lower at 15.5% and 22.8% respectively.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0992	2010-01-06	UNK	Press             release, 17 September 2007	"Eurofound presents the European Working Conditions Survey results for Slovenia: Good working conditions in Slovenia at risk from increasing levels of intensity and work-related health effects (LJUBLJANA, SLOVENIA) Working conditions in Slovenia are in many respects on par with those in the former EU15 Member States, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) will tell social policy-makers in Slovenia today. There are, however, there are a number of crucial issues relating to work organisation and health which Slovenian policy-makers are challenged to tackle. The majority of workers in Slovenia enjoy regular working hours, predominantly characterised by 9-5 jobs, five days a week. More workers in Slovenia use computers, and email and internet, at work than on average in the former EU15 and in the twelve new EU Member States. Almost nine out of ten workers in Slovenia (87.2%) spend most of the working day at the company premises, which is significantly higher than on average in the EU15 and new Member States. The work organisation and job content in Slovenia is similar to those in the EU15 countries, most notably in regards to the amounts of repetitive work, task rotation and in dealing directly with customers. Also, a large amount of Slovenian workers (38.0%) have undergone training during the previous 12 months, which is higher than on average in the EU15 (27.3%) and in the new EU Member States (25.6%). ‘Working conditions in Slovenia are in many respects on par with those in the former EU15 Member States,’ says Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director. ‘However, to reap the benefits from this situation and to maintain the country’s competitive edge, social policy-makers will have to tackle the challenges raised by high levels of intensity at work, as well as low autonomy and health & safety effects.’ A significant number of workers in Slovenia report working at high speed and to tight deadlines, Eurofound’s research findings confirm. Three out of four workers in Slovenia (75.2%) work at very high speed, which is higher than average in the EU15 (61.1%) and in the new EU Member States (51.5%). The perceived level of intensity among workers in Slovenia is one of the highest in Europe. The work-related health effects among workers in Slovenia are important. Almost every second worker (45.9%) report backache, one in four (25.7) report headache and four out of ten (38.2%) report muscular pains due to work in Slovenia. The corresponding average figures for the EU15 countries are significantly lower (21.1%, 13.1% and 13.4%). Workers in Slovenia rate their job satisfaction low in comparison to the rest of Europe. More than one in four workers (27.3%) fear loosing their job in the coming three months, and only one in three workers (30.6%) consider themselves well paid for the work they do. These two indicators perhaps contribute to explaining that less than three out of four workers (71.6%) are satisfied or very satisfied with work, which is lower than in the EU15 and in the neighbouring countries.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0993	2010-01-06	UNK	Press           release, 27 March 2008	Eurofound presents data on working conditions for older workers in France Better working conditions help older employees remain in the workforce As the average age of the European population rises, promoting employment opportunities for our ageing workforce is a challenge that must be met in companies, in Member States and at EU level. On 27–28 March, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound), the Dublin-based EU agency, will meet with key policy-makers in Paris, to present strategies and discuss solutions to boost the number of older people in employment by improving working conditions. For older workers, good health is one of the key factors for remaining in the labour market. In France, almost one in three (28%) older workers (those aged 55 years and older) thinks that work affects their health. Among its neighbouring countries, this figure is only surpassed by Belgium (30,8%). Fewer workers report that work affects their health in the Netherlands (21,2%), Germany (19,5%) and the United Kingdom (14,6%). Ensuring that employees have adequate career and employment security is important for promoting quality of work and employment, of which the perception of discrimination at the work place due to age is a factor. Research from Eurofound reveal that 6,5% of workers aged 55 years and older in France report having been subjected to age discrimination in the workplace – more than twice as high as the average levels for the 27 EU Member States (2,7%). Similarly high levels are reported among workers in this age group from Belgium (7.4%) and in the Netherlands (6,8%); however, lower levels are reported in Germany (5,7%) and the UK (3,2%). ‘The low participation of older people in the labour markets across Europe stems from a combination of inadequate working conditions, rigid workplace organisation, low levels of skills, and poor health, rather than the wish to retire early,’ says Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director. ‘We aim to inform decision-makers, whether in government or in companies, of the latest findings from our research, to assist them in tackling the challenges and exploring the opportunities associated with an ageing workforce.’ Eurofound will present its latest data, findings and analysis to representatives from the French governments, trade unions and employers’ organisations during a two-day visit to Paris on 27–28 March 2008. Part of Eurofound’s ongoing roadshow programme, the visit will be divided into a bilateral meeting with Eurofound’s stakeholders (representatives of government, trade unions and employer organisations) and a seminar for a wider audience. Since its inception in 2001, over 50 road show visits to all 27 EU Member States have taken place, drawing growing numbers of participants, including experts and practitioners from local and regional authorities, NGOs and academia. As part of its work on this topic, Eurofound launched a campaign on 17 March, entitled Working Longer, Living Better – Europe’s coming of age. The campaign, which explores the impact of an ageing society and workforce, provides insights into developments at EU, national and company level. It brings together Eurofound’s research findings and recommendations, along with examples of good practice and strategies for change in the workplace that it has compiled over the past decade.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0994	2010-01-06	UNK	Press release, 15 September 2008	Eurofound presents data on working conditions to social partners in Greece 15-16 September 2008: Working conditions in Greece lagging behind rest of Europe (DUBLIN, IRELAND) New research findings, data and analysis on working conditions, age management, pay and wage flexibility in Greece compared to the other 26 EU Member States will be presented by Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU agency, to Greek social partners during talks in Athens on 15-16 September 2008. Workers in Greece tend to work more hours than the average European, 45.4 hours per week in comparison to an average of 38.4 hours in the EU27 Member States, according to research from Eurofound. Over the past 15 years, there is a trend towards reducing working hours for workers across Europe. In Greece, however, long working hours continue to be the norm, despite an average collectively agreed normal working week of 40 hours. One out of four Greek workers (25.9%) works at least ten hours per day more than five times per month, which is significantly more than the one out of six (16.9%) workers across the European Union in the same situation. Following a decrease in the nominal collectively agreed pay from 5.8% in 2006 to 5.1% in 2007, together with higher inflation levels, workers in Greece received average real pay increases of 1.2% in 2007, which is well below the EU average of 2.3%. During a two-day visit to Greece, Eurofound experts will brief representatives from the Greek Ministry of Employment and Social Protection, the SEV Hellenic Federation of Enterprises, and the trade union GSEE about its latest comparative findings and research data on living and working conditions in Greece. Eurofound’s mandate is to provide Europe’s social policy-makers with comparative data and advice. Its comparative research into working conditions, resulting from regular pan-European surveys and in-depth analysis over the past 15 years, provides a snapshot of how workers in Greece perceive their working conditions, in comparison to workers elsewhere in Europe. Over the past two decades, work intensification has become an increasing feature of working conditions for workers across Europe. In Greece, work intensity is shown to be at higher than average levels in EU27 countries, with working at very high speed (73.3% compared to 59.6%) and working to tight deadlines (68.4% compared to 61.8%) being the two primary indicators. Research also shows that Greek workers have relatively limited opportunities to determine their working hours themselves, and this can impact negatively on their work–life balance. Across the EU27, only workers in Cyprus and Bulgaria have less flexibility in terms of working hours. A significant number of Greek workers consider their health to be affected by work in comparison to workers elsewhere in Europe (68.1% compared to 35.2%). Nearly one in two  Greek workers report problems with backache and stress due to work, which is twice as high as elsewhere in Europe. Surprisingly, perhaps, is the finding that Greek workers report half as many days off work due to illness and health problems than the average in Europe, a tendency which has remained constant over the past 15 years.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0995	2010-01-06	UNK	Press           release, 25 March 2008	Eurofound presents data on working conditions for older workers in the Netherlands Better working conditions help older employees remain in the workforce As the average age of the European population rises, promoting employment opportunities for our ageing workforce is a challenge that must be met in companies, in Member States and at EU level. On 26–27 March, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound), the Dublin-based EU agency, will meet with key policy-makers in the Hague, to present strategies and discuss solutions to boost the number of older people in employment by improving working conditions. For older workers, good health is one of the key factors for remaining in the labour market. In the Netherlands, one in five (21,2%) older workers (those aged 55 years and older) thinks that work affects their health. In Belgium, the corresponding figure is one in three (30,8%), similar to levels experienced in France (28%). In Germany and the United Kingdom, fewer older workers feel this (19,5% and 14,6% respectively). Ensuring that employees have adequate career and employment security is important for promoting quality of work and employment, of which the perception of discrimination at the work place due to age is a factor. Research from Eurofound reveal that 6,8% of workers aged 55 years and older in the Netherlands report having been subjected to age discrimination in the workplace, more than twice the average levels for the 27 EU Member States (2,7%). Similarly high levels are reported by workers in this age group among elderly workers from Belgium (7,4%), with lower levels found in France (6,5%), Germany (5,7%) and the UK (3,2%). ‘The low participation of older people in the labour markets across Europe stems from a combination of inadequate working conditions, rigid workplace organisation, low levels of skills, and poor health, rather than the wish to retire early,’ says Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director. ‘We aim to inform decision-makers, whether in government or in companies, of the latest findings from our research, to assist them in tackling the challenges and exploring the opportunities associated with an ageing workforce.’ Eurofound will present its latest data, findings and analysis to representatives from the Dutch governments, trade unions and employers’ organisations during a two-day visit to The Hague on 25–26 March 2008.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0996	2010-01-06	UNK	Press release, 25 March 2009	Eurofound publishes its Second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS) Two out of three Slovaks rate their own health as very good or good Two out of three Slovaks rate their own health as very good or good, higher than average across the twelve new EU Member States, according to the Second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS), carried out by Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU Agency. Similar perceptions of the quality of and access to their health care system were recorded in the survey, which ranks Slovakia in the middle of all EU27 countries. Slovaks also rate their public transport system relatively high. The survey, to be launched under the Czech EU Presidency in Prague on 25 March, also reveals that Europeans are generally satisfied with their quality of life despite big variations between both levels of life satisfaction and happiness, especially among the 12 new EU Member States. Four out of five people (81%) across the European Union say that health is very important in determining their quality of life. On the state of their health, more than two out of three people (67%) rate their health as very good or good, one in four (24%) as fair, and one in ten (9%) as bad or very bad. More people in the 12 new EU Member States and the three candidate countries rate their health as ‘bad or very bad’, in particular the women in these countries. Reporting poor health is, not surprisingly, associated with increasing age: in the EU27, fewer than 2% of people aged between 18 and 34 years report bad health, as opposed to 18% of those aged 65 and over. The survey also reveals that a substantial number of Europeans have difficulty in accessing health care services. One in four (25%) report problems because they are too far from their doctor or hospital, while more than two in five (38%) experience delays in getting medical appointments and more than one in four (27%) have difficulty meeting the expense involved in seeing a doctor. Similarly, the survey reveals that family life is also key to quality of life with seven out of ten people in Europe (68.7%) saying a good family life is very important for quality of life. The survey shows that one in three people across the EU27 (30%) report that they are involved in childcare on a daily basis, with small differences between the NMS12 (33%) and the EU15 (29%). In terms of actual time spent, women report spending 33 hours per week, and men over 18 hours, in caring for and educating children. Women also report spending 18 hours per week cooking and doing housework, as against 10 hours per week for men. One in five (20%) in the EU15 feel that they do more than their fair share of housework, and somewhat less (18%) in the NMS12 and in the CC3 (17%). The perceived quality of society is another fundamental element of the multidimensional concept of quality of life. The dimensions of societal – and not only individual – well-being are emphasised in the Lisbon Strategy and are a focus of EU social policy. The political and economic impact of the two recent rounds of enlargement can be seen in the income distribution, trust in institutions and social relations. The level of trust in political institutions is lowest in Poland, Hungary, Lithuania and the Czech Republic among the 12 new EU Member States, and in Italy, Portugal and the UK among the EU15 countries. When asked to rate their level of trust in other people in their country on a scale from one to 10, people in the Nordic countries and the Netherlands express the highest levels of trust. People living in Cyprus express the lowest levels of trust, followed by the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). ‘The challenges arising from social exclusion, unemployment, an ageing population, changing family structures, new gender roles as well as EU enlargement have pushed quality of life issues to the fore in the EU policy debate,’ says Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director. ‘The European Quality of Life Survey documents not only living conditions and the economic circumstances of people in Europe, but also how they feel about them, and about the society in which they live.’ In the EQLS, social relations are examined in terms of tension between groups, as well as attitudes towards migrants. In the EU15, the survey shows that the highest levels of tension between men and women and between the young and the old are found in Luxembourg (23% and 25%), followed by Spain (20% and 19%) and Greece (18% and 21%). At the other end of the scale is Denmark (6% and 5%). Among the 12 new Member States, Hungary stands out in this area (20% and 30%), followed by Bulgaria, Cyprus and Malta. Enabling citizens to develop some balance between family life, personal commitments and working life has become central to the social policy debate. Still, almost half (48%) of citizens in paid employment in the EU27 say that, at least several times a month, they are too tired as a result of their work to do household jobs. The report shows that men and women in the EU27 struggle with work-life balance almost to the same extent. Some 22% of working men state that they are too tired several times a week to do household jobs, while 21% of women report the same problem. Meanwhile, 11% of men find it difficult several times a week to fulfil family responsibilities because of work, as do 10% of women. The survey shows clearly that people’s material conditions, standard of living and well-being strongly depend on income as well as the economic wealth of the country in which they live. According to the EQLS, about one in four households in the CC3 and one in five in the NMS12 were unable to pay their utility bills on time. These figures are considerably higher than for the EU15, where about one in 10 households were unable to pay their bills on time. ‘In this survey, we have face-to-face interviews with 35,000 people in 31 countries across Europe, which were carried out between November 2007 and February 2008,’ says Robert Anderson, Head of Unit, Living Conditions and Quality of Life team at Eurofound. ‘The survey offers a unique and timely insight into the multidimensional concept of quality of life in Europe and provides information about the standard of living and quality of life of Europeans which is essential for policymakers and interested groups whose aims are to seek improvements in that quality of life.’ The full report is available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef0902.htm The survey mapping tool, presenting the data from the report in an easily accessible format, is available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/qualityoflife/eqls/eqls2007/results.htm A resumé is available in all 22 official EU languages at www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef0852.htm A press pack on the Quality of Life Survey is available from http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/press/presspack/eqls2007/index.htm For further information, contact Måns Mårtensson, Press Officer, on email: mma@eurofound.europa.eu, or telephone: +353-1-204 3124 or mobile +353-876-593 507.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0997	2010-01-06	UNK	Press           release, 16 May 2008	Eurofound presents findings from the Fourth European Working Conditions Survey for the Czech Republic: Workers report increasing work intensification Four out of five workers in the Czech Republic report overall satisfaction with their working conditions, the fourth European Working Conditions Survey reveals. However, only one in four Czech workers thinks they have good career prospects and only one in three workers consider themselves well paid for the work they do, which are levels well below the EU averages. ‘The European Working Conditions Survey shows that Czech workers are by and large content with their working conditions, although there are concerns regarding training provision, work intensification and inflexible working time arrangements,’ says Jorma Karppinen, Director of Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU agency. ‘In comparison to the other 26 Member States of the European Union, the Czech labour market has more similarities with those of the former EU15 states in terms of characteristics, opportunities and workers’ perception, than with the labour markets in the ten new EU Member States.’ However, work intensity is a growing phenomenon, showing a clear trend towards increasing levels over the period since the previous survey in 2001. Seven out of ten Czech workers (71.2%) report having to work to tight deadlines or at very high speed at least one quarter of their working time, which are the third highest levels in Europe behind Finland (73.6%) and Sweden (71.7%). The survey also shows that pace of work is determined by the boss and direct demand from customers in the Czech Republic. Also, only just over a third of Czech workers (34.9%) consider themselves to be well paid, in contrast to the average level in the former EU15 (47%) and in EU27 countries (43.2%). More significantly, although there are cultural differences in responding to this question, more than one third of Czech workers (32.2%) fear losing their job in the coming six months, higher than the average for the ten new EU Member States (25.2%) and the EU15 countries (11.3%). Most Czech workers say they are satisfied with their work–life balance, with four out of five workers (79.5%) able to balance working hours with family and social commitments, although more Czech workers are contacted about work outside working hours (31.3%) than on average in the EU (22.1%), or in neighbouring Austria (25.1%) and Slovakia (22.4%). A significantly higher proportion of Czech workers telework than on average in Europe (18.7% vs 8.3% EU average), and the number of Czech workers using a computer at work is closer to the levels in the former EU15 than the ten new EU Member States (CZ 39.4%, EU15 49.8% and NMS 32.9%). The findings of this survey will be presented to officials from the Czech Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, as well as representatives from the Czech trade unions and the employers organisations, in Prague on Monday and Tuesday 19-20 May. Journalists are invited to a press conference outlining the details of the findings at 12:00 on Tuesday 20 May 2008, at the Representation of the European Commission in the Czech Republic, Jungmannova 24, CZ-111 21 Prague 1, Czech Republic.

EUROFOUND_UNK_0998	2010-01-06	UNK	Press release, 25 March 2009	Eurofound publishes its Second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS) Romanians rate the quality of their public transport system closer to the levels recorded in the EU15 countries Romanians rate the quality of their public transport system closer to the levels recorded in the EU15 countries than in the twelve new EU Member States, according to the Second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS), carried out by Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU Agency. Also trust in political institutions in Romania is on a par with levels recorded in the United Kingdom, Italy and Portugal. Romanians rate the quality of and access to their health care system on par with its neighbours, but rate their own individual health among the lowest levels in Europe. The survey, to be launched under the Czech EU Presidency in Prague on 25 March, also reveals that Europeans are generally satisfied with their quality of life despite big variations between both levels of life satisfaction and happiness, especially among the 12 new EU Member States.

Swedes also show great confidence and trust in their political institutions, ranking them among the top four in Europe. The quality of the public transport system in Sweden is among the top six, ranked below the levels recorded in neighbouring Finland and Denmark. The survey, to be launched under the Czech EU Presidency in Prague on 25 March, also reveals that Europeans are generally satisfied with their quality of life despite big variations between both levels of life satisfaction and happiness, especially among the 12 new EU Member States.

In the EU15, the survey shows that the highest levels of tension between men and women and between the young and the old are found in Luxembourg (23% and 25%), followed by Spain (20% and 19%) and Greece (18% and 21%). At the other end of the scale is Denmark (6% and 5%). Among the 12 new Member States, Hungary stands out in this area (20% and 30%), followed by Bulgaria, Cyprus and Malta. Enabling citizens to develop some balance between family life, personal commitments and working life has become central to the social policy debate. Still, almost half (48%) of citizens in paid employment in the EU27 say that, at least several times a month, they are too tired as a result of their work to do household jobs. The report shows that men and women in the EU27 struggle with work-life balance almost to the same extent. Some 22% of working men state that they are too tired several times a week to do household jobs, while 21% of women report the same problem. Meanwhile, 11% of men find it difficult several times a week to fulfil family responsibilities because of work, as do 10% of women. The survey shows clearly that people’s material conditions, standard of living and well-being strongly depend on income as well as the economic wealth of the country in which they live. According to the EQLS, about one in four households in the CC3 and one in five in the NMS12 were unable to pay their utility bills on time. These figures are considerably higher than for the EU15, where about one in 10 households were unable to pay their bills on time. ‘In this survey, we have face-to-face interviews with 35,000 people in 31 countries across Europe, which were carried out between November 2007 and February 2008,’ says Robert Anderson, Head of Unit, Living Conditions and Quality of Life team at Eurofound. ‘The survey offers a unique and timely insight into the multidimensional concept of quality of life in Europe and provides information about the standard of living and quality of life of Europeans which is essential for policymakers and interested groups whose aims are to seek improvements in that quality of life.’ The full report is available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef0902.htm The survey mapping tool, presenting the data from the report in an easily accessible format, is available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/qualityoflife/eqls/eqls2007/results.htm A resumé is available in all 22 official EU languages at www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef0852.htm A press pack on the Quality of Life Survey is available from http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/press/presspack/eqls2007/index.htm For further information, contact Måns Mårtensson, Press Officer, on email: mma@eurofound.europa.eu, or telephone: +353-1-204 3124 or mobile +353-876-593 507.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1001	2010-01-06	UNK	Press release, 25 March 2009	Eurofound publishes its Second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS) Poles rate their own health above average across the twelve new EU Member States Poles rate their own health above average across the twelve new EU Member States, according to the Second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS), carried out by Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU Agency. However, they rank the quality of and access to the health care system in the country among the worst in Europe. Trust in political institutions in Poland is also very low, among the lowest in Europe, while Poles rate the quality of their public transport system almost on par with the former EU15 countries. The survey, to be launched under the Czech EU Presidency in Prague on 25 March, also reveals that Europeans are generally satisfied with their quality of life despite big variations between both levels of life satisfaction and happiness, especially among the 12 new EU Member States. Four out of five people (81%) across the European Union say that health is very important in determining their quality of life. On the state of their health, more than two out of three people (67%) rate their health as very good or good, one in four (24%) as fair, and one in ten (9%) as bad or very bad. More people in the 12 new EU Member States and the three candidate countries rate their health as ‘bad or very bad’, in particular the women in these countries. Reporting poor health is, not surprisingly, associated with increasing age: in the EU27, fewer than 2% of people aged between 18 and 34 years report bad health, as opposed to 18% of those aged 65 and over. The survey also reveals that a substantial number of Europeans have difficulty in accessing health care services. One in four (25%) report problems because they are too far from their doctor or hospital, while more than two in five (38%) experience delays in getting medical appointments and more than one in four (27%) have difficulty meeting the expense involved in seeing a doctor. Similarly, the survey reveals that family life is also key to quality of life with seven out of ten people in Europe (68.7%) saying a good family life is very important for quality of life. The survey shows that one in three people across the EU27 (30%) report that they are involved in childcare on a daily basis, with small differences between the NMS12 (33%) and the EU15 (29%). In terms of actual time spent, women report spending 33 hours per week, and men over 18 hours, in caring for and educating children. Women also report spending 18 hours per week cooking and doing housework, as against 10 hours per week for men. One in five (20%) in the EU15 feel that they do more than their fair share of housework, and somewhat less (18%) in the NMS12 and in the CC3 (17%). The perceived quality of society is another fundamental element of the multidimensional concept of quality of life. The dimensions of societal – and not only individual – well-being are emphasised in the Lisbon Strategy and are a focus of EU social policy. The political and economic impact of the two recent rounds of enlargement can be seen in the income distribution, trust in institutions and social relations. The level of trust in political institutions is lowest in Poland, Hungary, Lithuania and the Czech Republic among the 12 new EU Member States, and in Italy, Portugal and the UK among the EU15 countries. When asked to rate their level of trust in other people in their country on a scale from one to 10, people in the Nordic countries and the Netherlands express the highest levels of trust.

These figures are considerably higher than for the EU15, where about one in 10 households were unable to pay their bills on time. ‘In this survey, we have face-to-face interviews with 35,000 people in 31 countries across Europe, which were carried out between November 2007 and February 2008,’ says Robert Anderson, Head of Unit, Living Conditions and Quality of Life team at Eurofound. ‘The survey offers a unique and timely insight into the multidimensional concept of quality of life in Europe and provides information about the standard of living and quality of life of Europeans which is essential for policymakers and interested groups whose aims are to seek improvements in that quality of life.’ The full report is available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef0902.htm The survey mapping tool, presenting the data from the report in an easily accessible format, is available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/qualityoflife/eqls/eqls2007/results.htm A resumé is available in all 22 official EU languages at www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef0852.htm A press pack on the Quality of Life Survey is available from http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/press/presspack/eqls2007/index.htm For further information, contact Måns Mårtensson, Press Officer, on email: mma@eurofound.europa.eu, or telephone: +353-1-204 3124 or mobile +353-876-593 507.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1005	2010-01-06	UNK	Press release, 25 March 2009	Eurofound publishes its Second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS) The Portuguese rate their own health much lower than their neighbours in Spain and other Mediterranean countries The Portuguese rate their own health much lower than their neighbours in Spain and other Mediterranean countries, according to the Second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS), carried out by Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU Agency. Also the quality of and access to the health care system in the country is ranked low, among the three lowest in Europe. On the contrary, only one in five Portuguese report high tensions between racial and ethnic groups in the country, one of the lowest levels recorded across Europe. The survey, to be launched under the Czech EU Presidency in Prague on 25 March, also reveals that Europeans are generally satisfied with their quality of life despite big variations between both levels of life satisfaction and happiness, especially among the 12 new EU Member States. Four out of five people (81%) across the European Union say that health is very important in determining their quality of life. On the state of their health, more than two out of three people (67%) rate their health as very good or good, one in four (24%) as fair, and one in ten (9%) as bad or very bad. More people in the 12 new EU Member States and the three candidate countries rate their health as ‘bad or very bad’, in particular the women in these countries. Reporting poor health is, not surprisingly, associated with increasing age: in the EU27, fewer than 2% of people aged between 18 and 34 years report bad health, as opposed to 18% of those aged 65 and over. The survey also reveals that a substantial number of Europeans have difficulty in accessing health care services. One in four (25%) report problems because they are too far from their doctor or hospital, while more than two in five (38%) experience delays in getting medical appointments and more than one in four (27%) have difficulty meeting the expense involved in seeing a doctor. Similarly, the survey reveals that family life is also key to quality of life with seven out of ten people in Europe (68.7%) saying a good family life is very important for quality of life. The survey shows that one in three people across the EU27 (30%) report that they are involved in childcare on a daily basis, with small differences between the NMS12 (33%) and the EU15 (29%). In terms of actual time spent, women report spending 33 hours per week, and men over 18 hours, in caring for and educating children. Women also report spending 18 hours per week cooking and doing housework, as against 10 hours per week for men. One in five (20%) in the EU15 feel that they do more than their fair share of housework, and somewhat less (18%) in the NMS12 and in the CC3 (17%). The perceived quality of society is another fundamental element of the multidimensional concept of quality of life. The dimensions of societal – and not only individual – well-being are emphasised in the Lisbon Strategy and are a focus of EU social policy. The political and economic impact of the two recent rounds of enlargement can be seen in the income distribution, trust in institutions and social relations. The level of trust in political institutions is lowest in Poland, Hungary, Lithuania and the Czech Republic among the 12 new EU Member States, and in Italy, Portugal and the UK among the EU15 countries. When asked to rate their level of trust in other people in their country on a scale from one to 10, people in the Nordic countries and the Netherlands express the highest levels of trust. People living in Cyprus express the lowest levels of trust, followed by the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). ‘The challenges arising from social exclusion, unemployment, an ageing population, changing family structures, new gender roles as well as EU enlargement have pushed quality of life issues to the fore in the EU policy debate,’ says Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director. ‘The European Quality of Life Survey documents not only living conditions and the economic circumstances of people in Europe, but also how they feel about them, and about the society in which they live.’ In the EQLS, social relations are examined in terms of tension between groups, as well as attitudes towards migrants. In the EU15, the survey shows that the highest levels of tension between men and women and between the young and the old are found in Luxembourg (23% and 25%), followed by Spain (20% and 19%) and Greece (18% and 21%). At the other end of the scale is Denmark (6% and 5%). Among the 12 new Member States, Hungary stands out in this area (20% and 30%), followed by Bulgaria, Cyprus and Malta. Enabling citizens to develop some balance between family life, personal commitments and working life has become central to the social policy debate. Still, almost half (48%) of citizens in paid employment in the EU27 say that, at least several times a month, they are too tired as a result of their work to do household jobs. The report shows that men and women in the EU27 struggle with work-life balance almost to the same extent. Some 22% of working men state that they are too tired several times a week to do household jobs, while 21% of women report the same problem. Meanwhile, 11% of men find it difficult several times a week to fulfil family responsibilities because of work, as do 10% of women. The survey shows clearly that people’s material conditions, standard of living and well-being strongly depend on income as well as the economic wealth of the country in which they live.

Lithuania also has one of the lowest levels of tensions between racial and ethnic groups in Europe.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1009	2010-01-06	UNK	Press release, 25 March 2009	Eurofound publishes its Second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS) Eight out of ten people in Ireland rate their own health as very good Eight out of ten people in Ireland rate their own health as very good, ahead of all other countries in Europe, according to the Second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS), carried out by Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU Agency. On the issue of access to good quality health care, however, the Irish rate their health care system on a par with Greece and Portugal, just ahead of Bulgaria and Macedonia. The survey, to be launched under the Czech EU Presidency in Prague on 25 March, also reveals that Europeans are generally satisfied with their quality of life despite big variations between both levels of life satisfaction and happiness, especially among the 12 new EU Member States. Four out of five people (81%) across the European Union say that health is very important in determining their quality of life. On the state of their health, more than two out of three people (67%) rate their health as very good or good, one in four (24%) as fair, and one in ten (9%) as bad or very bad. More people in the 12 new EU Member States and the three candidate countries rate their health as ‘bad or very bad’, in particular the women in these countries. Reporting poor health is, not surprisingly, associated with increasing age: in the EU27, fewer than 2% of people aged between 18 and 34 years report bad health, as opposed to 18% of those aged 65 and over. The survey also reveals that a substantial number of Europeans have difficulty in accessing health care services. One in four (25%) report problems because they are too far from their doctor or hospital, while more than two in five (38%) experience delays in getting medical appointments and more than one in four (27%) have difficulty meeting the expense involved in seeing a doctor. Similarly, the survey reveals that family life is also key to quality of life with seven out of ten people in Europe (68.7%) saying a good family life is very important for quality of life. The survey shows that one in three people across the EU27 (30%) report that they are involved in childcare on a daily basis, with small differences between the NMS12 (33%) and the EU15 (29%). In terms of actual time spent, women report spending 33 hours per week, and men over 18 hours, in caring for and educating children. Women also report spending 18 hours per week cooking and doing housework, as against 10 hours per week for men. One in five (20%) in the EU15 feel that they do more than their fair share of housework, and somewhat less (18%) in the NMS12 and in the CC3 (17%). The perceived quality of society is another fundamental element of the multidimensional concept of quality of life. The dimensions of societal – and not only individual – well-being are emphasised in the Lisbon Strategy and are a focus of EU social policy. The political and economic impact of the two recent rounds of enlargement can be seen in the income distribution, trust in institutions and social relations. The level of trust in political institutions is lowest in Poland, Hungary, Lithuania and the Czech Republic among the 12 new EU Member States, and in Italy, Portugal and the UK among the EU15 countries. When asked to rate their level of trust in other people in their country on a scale from one to 10, people in the Nordic countries and the Netherlands express the highest levels of trust. People living in Cyprus express the lowest levels of trust, followed by the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). ‘The challenges arising from social exclusion, unemployment, an ageing population, changing family structures, new gender roles as well as EU enlargement have pushed quality of life issues to the fore in the EU policy debate,’ says Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director. ‘The European Quality of Life Survey documents not only living conditions and the economic circumstances of people in Europe, but also how they feel about them, and about the society in which they live.’ In the EQLS, social relations are examined in terms of tension between groups, as well as attitudes towards migrants. In the EU15, the survey shows that the highest levels of tension between men and women and between the young and the old are found in Luxembourg (23% and 25%), followed by Spain (20% and 19%) and Greece (18% and 21%). At the other end of the scale is Denmark (6% and 5%). Among the 12 new Member States, Hungary stands out in this area (20% and 30%), followed by Bulgaria, Cyprus and Malta. Enabling citizens to develop some balance between family life, personal commitments and working life has become central to the social policy debate. Still, almost half (48%) of citizens in paid employment in the EU27 say that, at least several times a month, they are too tired as a result of their work to do household jobs. The report shows that men and women in the EU27 struggle with work-life balance almost to the same extent. Some 22% of working men state that they are too tired several times a week to do household jobs, while 21% of women report the same problem. Meanwhile, 11% of men find it difficult several times a week to fulfil family responsibilities because of work, as do 10% of women. The survey shows clearly that people’s material conditions, standard of living and well-being strongly depend on income as well as the economic wealth of the country in which they live. According to the EQLS, about one in four households in the CC3 and one in five in the NMS12 were unable to pay their utility bills on time. These figures are considerably higher than for the EU15, where about one in 10 households were unable to pay their bills on time. ‘In this survey, we have face-to-face interviews with 35,000 people in 31 countries across Europe, which were carried out between November 2007 and February 2008,’ says Robert Anderson, Head of Unit, Living Conditions and Quality of Life team at Eurofound. ‘The survey offers a unique and timely insight into the multidimensional concept of quality of life in Europe and provides information about the standard of living and quality of life of Europeans which is essential for policymakers and interested groups whose aims are to seek improvements in that quality of life.’ The full report is available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef0902.htm The survey mapping tool, presenting the data from the report in an easily accessible format, is available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/qualityoflife/eqls/eqls2007/results.htm A resumé is available in all 22 official EU languages at www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef0852.htm A press pack on the Quality of Life Survey is available from http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/press/presspack/eqls2007/index.htm For further information, contact Måns Mårtensson, Press Officer, on email: mma@eurofound.europa.eu, or telephone: +353-1-204 3124 or mobile +353-876-593 507.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1011	2010-01-06	UNK	Press release, 25 March 2009	Eurofound publishes its Second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS) Greeks rate their own health among the highest in Europe Greeks rate their own health among the highest in Europe, although they rank the quality of and access to their health system as one of the worst according to the Second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS), carried out by Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU Agency. Trust in political institutions in Greece is above the UK and Italy, but below France, Spain and Austria. Greeks have little confidence in their public transport system, ranking it well below the average across the 27 Member States of the EU.

They also rate the quality of and access to their health system favourably, among the top six in Europe. Trust in political institutions is low in France, on par with levels recorded in Estonia and Cyprus. Also, more than half of the interviewed sense very high tensions between racial and ethnic groups in the country, which was among the highest in the survey.

Reporting poor health is, not surprisingly, associated with increasing age: in the EU27, fewer than 2% of people aged between 18 and 34 years report bad health, as opposed to 18% of those aged 65 and over. The survey also reveals that a substantial number of Europeans have difficulty in accessing health care services. One in four (25%) report problems because they are too far from their doctor or hospital, while more than two in five (38%) experience delays in getting medical appointments and more than one in four (27%) have difficulty meeting the expense involved in seeing a doctor. Similarly, the survey reveals that family life is also key to quality of life with seven out of ten people in Europe (68.7%) saying a good family life is very important for quality of life. The survey shows that one in three people across the EU27 (30%) report that they are involved in childcare on a daily basis, with small differences between the NMS12 (33%) and the EU15 (29%). In terms of actual time spent, women report spending 33 hours per week, and men over 18 hours, in caring for and educating children. Women also report spending 18 hours per week cooking and doing housework, as against 10 hours per week for men. One in five (20%) in the EU15 feel that they do more than their fair share of housework, and somewhat less (18%) in the NMS12 and in the CC3 (17%). The perceived quality of society is another fundamental element of the multidimensional concept of quality of life. The dimensions of societal – and not only individual – well-being are emphasised in the Lisbon Strategy and are a focus of EU social policy. The political and economic impact of the two recent rounds of enlargement can be seen in the income distribution, trust in institutions and social relations. The level of trust in political institutions is lowest in Poland, Hungary, Lithuania and the Czech Republic among the 12 new EU Member States, and in Italy, Portugal and the UK among the EU15 countries. When asked to rate their level of trust in other people in their country on a scale from one to 10, people in the Nordic countries and the Netherlands express the highest levels of trust. People living in Cyprus express the lowest levels of trust, followed by the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). ‘The challenges arising from social exclusion, unemployment, an ageing population, changing family structures, new gender roles as well as EU enlargement have pushed quality of life issues to the fore in the EU policy debate,’ says Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director. ‘The European Quality of Life Survey documents not only living conditions and the economic circumstances of people in Europe, but also how they feel about them, and about the society in which they live.’ In the EQLS, social relations are examined in terms of tension between groups, as well as attitudes towards migrants. In the EU15, the survey shows that the highest levels of tension between men and women and between the young and the old are found in Luxembourg (23% and 25%), followed by Spain (20% and 19%) and Greece (18% and 21%). At the other end of the scale is Denmark (6% and 5%). Among the 12 new Member States, Hungary stands out in this area (20% and 30%), followed by Bulgaria, Cyprus and Malta. Enabling citizens to develop some balance between family life, personal commitments and working life has become central to the social policy debate. Still, almost half (48%) of citizens in paid employment in the EU27 say that, at least several times a month, they are too tired as a result of their work to do household jobs. The report shows that men and women in the EU27 struggle with work-life balance almost to the same extent. Some 22% of working men state that they are too tired several times a week to do household jobs, while 21% of women report the same problem. Meanwhile, 11% of men find it difficult several times a week to fulfil family responsibilities because of work, as do 10% of women. The survey shows clearly that people’s material conditions, standard of living and well-being strongly depend on income as well as the economic wealth of the country in which they live. According to the EQLS, about one in four households in the CC3 and one in five in the NMS12 were unable to pay their utility bills on time. These figures are considerably higher than for the EU15, where about one in 10 households were unable to pay their bills on time. ‘In this survey, we have face-to-face interviews with 35,000 people in 31 countries across Europe, which were carried out between November 2007 and February 2008,’ says Robert Anderson, Head of Unit, Living Conditions and Quality of Life team at Eurofound. ‘The survey offers a unique and timely insight into the multidimensional concept of quality of life in Europe and provides information about the standard of living and quality of life of Europeans which is essential for policymakers and interested groups whose aims are to seek improvements in that quality of life.’ The full report is available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef0902.htm The survey mapping tool, presenting the data from the report in an easily accessible format, is available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/qualityoflife/eqls/eqls2007/results.htm A resumé is available in all 22 official EU languages at www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef0852.htm A press pack on the Quality of Life Survey is available from http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/press/presspack/eqls2007/index.htm For further information, contact Måns Mårtensson, Press Officer, on email: mma@eurofound.europa.eu, or telephone: +353-1-204 3124 or mobile +353-876-593 507.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1014	2010-01-06	UNK	Press release, 25 March 2009	Eurofound publishes its Second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS) Finns rate the quality of and access to their health system only behind the levels recorded in Austria and Belgium Although Finns rate the quality of and access to their health system only behind the levels recorded in Austria and Belgium, they rate their own health much less favourably, at levels below the average across the European Union, according to the Second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS), carried out by Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU Agency. The levels of trust in political institutions, and the quality of public transport system, are notably high, only behind Denmark and Luxembourg. The survey, to be launched under the Czech EU Presidency in Prague on 25 March, also reveals that Europeans are generally satisfied with their quality of life despite big variations between both levels of life satisfaction and happiness, especially among the 12 new EU Member States. Four out of five people (81%) across the European Union say that health is very important in determining their quality of life. On the state of their health, more than two out of three people (67%) rate their health as very good or good, one in four (24%) as fair, and one in ten (9%) as bad or very bad.

Also, the Spanish rate the quality of and access to their health system as one of the top ten in Europe. One in three people in Spain, however, sense high tension between racial and ethnic groups in the country, while trust in the political system is high, at levels recorded in mainly northern European countries. The survey, to be launched under the Czech EU Presidency in Prague on 25 March, also reveals that Europeans are generally satisfied with their quality of life despite big variations between both levels of life satisfaction and happiness, especially among the 12 new EU Member States.

When asked to rate their level of trust in other people in their country on a scale from one to 10, people in the Nordic countries and the Netherlands express the highest levels of trust. People living in Cyprus express the lowest levels of trust, followed by the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). ‘The challenges arising from social exclusion, unemployment, an ageing population, changing family structures, new gender roles as well as EU enlargement have pushed quality of life issues to the fore in the EU policy debate,’ says Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director. ‘The European Quality of Life Survey documents not only living conditions and the economic circumstances of people in Europe, but also how they feel about them, and about the society in which they live.’ In the EQLS, social relations are examined in terms of tension between groups, as well as attitudes towards migrants. In the EU15, the survey shows that the highest levels of tension between men and women and between the young and the old are found in Luxembourg (23% and 25%), followed by Spain (20% and 19%) and Greece (18% and 21%). At the other end of the scale is Denmark (6% and 5%). Among the 12 new Member States, Hungary stands out in this area (20% and 30%), followed by Bulgaria, Cyprus and Malta. Enabling citizens to develop some balance between family life, personal commitments and working life has become central to the social policy debate. Still, almost half (48%) of citizens in paid employment in the EU27 say that, at least several times a month, they are too tired as a result of their work to do household jobs. The report shows that men and women in the EU27 struggle with work-life balance almost to the same extent. Some 22% of working men state that they are too tired several times a week to do household jobs, while 21% of women report the same problem. Meanwhile, 11% of men find it difficult several times a week to fulfil family responsibilities because of work, as do 10% of women. The survey shows clearly that people’s material conditions, standard of living and well-being strongly depend on income as well as the economic wealth of the country in which they live. According to the EQLS, about one in four households in the CC3 and one in five in the NMS12 were unable to pay their utility bills on time. These figures are considerably higher than for the EU15, where about one in 10 households were unable to pay their bills on time. ‘In this survey, we have face-to-face interviews with 35,000 people in 31 countries across Europe, which were carried out between November 2007 and February 2008,’ says Robert Anderson, Head of Unit, Living Conditions and Quality of Life team at Eurofound. ‘The survey offers a unique and timely insight into the multidimensional concept of quality of life in Europe and provides information about the standard of living and quality of life of Europeans which is essential for policymakers and interested groups whose aims are to seek improvements in that quality of life.’ The full report is available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef0902.htm The survey mapping tool, presenting the data from the report in an easily accessible format, is available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/qualityoflife/eqls/eqls2007/results.htm A resumé is available in all 22 official EU languages at www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef0852.htm A press pack on the Quality of Life Survey is available from http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/press/presspack/eqls2007/index.htm For further information, contact Måns Mårtensson, Press Officer, on email: mma@eurofound.europa.eu, or telephone: +353-1-204 3124 or mobile +353-876-593 507.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1018	2010-01-06	UNK	Press release, 25 March 2009	Eurofound publishes its Second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS) Cypriots rate their own health on a par with the Greeks and the Spanish, among the top four in Europe Cypriots rate their own health on a par with the Greeks and the Spanish, among the top four in Europe, according to the Second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS), carried out by Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU Agency. They rate their quality and access to healthcare somewhat less positively, closer to the average of the EU25 than the ten new EU Member States. People in Cyprus also rate among the lowest tensions between racial and ethnic groups in the country. The survey, to be launched under the Czech EU Presidency in Prague on 25 March, also reveals that Europeans are generally satisfied with their quality of life despite big variations between both levels of life satisfaction and happiness, especially among the 12 new EU Member States. Four out of five people (81%) across the European Union say that health is very important in determining their quality of life. On the state of their health, more than two out of three people (67%) rate their health as very good or good, one in four (24%) as fair, and one in ten (9%) as bad or very bad. More people in the 12 new EU Member States and the three candidate countries rate their health as ‘bad or very bad’, in particular the women in these countries. Reporting poor health is, not surprisingly, associated with increasing age: in the EU27, fewer than 2% of people aged between 18 and 34 years report bad health, as opposed to 18% of those aged 65 and over. The survey also reveals that a substantial number of Europeans have difficulty in accessing health care services. One in four (25%) report problems because they are too far from their doctor or hospital, while more than two in five (38%) experience delays in getting medical appointments and more than one in four (27%) have difficulty meeting the expense involved in seeing a doctor. Similarly, the survey reveals that family life is also key to quality of life with seven out of ten people in Europe (68.7%) saying a good family life is very important for quality of life. The survey shows that one in three people across the EU27 (30%) report that they are involved in childcare on a daily basis, with small differences between the NMS12 (33%) and the EU15 (29%). In terms of actual time spent, women report spending 33 hours per week, and men over 18 hours, in caring for and educating children. Women also report spending 18 hours per week cooking and doing housework, as against 10 hours per week for men. One in five (20%) in the EU15 feel that they do more than their fair share of housework, and somewhat less (18%) in the NMS12 and in the CC3 (17%). The perceived quality of society is another fundamental element of the multidimensional concept of quality of life. The dimensions of societal – and not only individual – well-being are emphasised in the Lisbon Strategy and are a focus of EU social policy. The political and economic impact of the two recent rounds of enlargement can be seen in the income distribution, trust in institutions and social relations. The level of trust in political institutions is lowest in Poland, Hungary, Lithuania and the Czech Republic among the 12 new EU Member States, and in Italy, Portugal and the UK among the EU15 countries.

With regard to their own health, however, Belgians share the bottom place with Luxembourg among the EU15 countries, well below the EU27 average.

Meanwhile, 11% of men find it difficult several times a week to fulfil family responsibilities because of work, as do 10% of women. The survey shows clearly that people’s material conditions, standard of living and well-being strongly depend on income as well as the economic wealth of the country in which they live. According to the EQLS, about one in four households in the CC3 and one in five in the NMS12 were unable to pay their utility bills on time. These figures are considerably higher than for the EU15, where about one in 10 households were unable to pay their bills on time. ‘In this survey, we have face-to-face interviews with 35,000 people in 31 countries across Europe, which were carried out between November 2007 and February 2008,’ says Robert Anderson, Head of Unit, Living Conditions and Quality of Life team at Eurofound. ‘The survey offers a unique and timely insight into the multidimensional concept of quality of life in Europe and provides information about the standard of living and quality of life of Europeans which is essential for policymakers and interested groups whose aims are to seek improvements in that quality of life.’ The full report is available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef0902.htm The survey mapping tool, presenting the data from the report in an easily accessible format, is available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/qualityoflife/eqls/eqls2007/results.htm A resumé is available in all 22 official EU languages at www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef0852.htm A press pack on the Quality of Life Survey is available from http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/press/presspack/eqls2007/index.htm For further information, contact Måns Mårtensson, Press Officer, on email: mma@eurofound.europa.eu, or telephone: +353-1-204 3124 or mobile +353-876-593 507.

IN BRIEF News in pictures Debating Europe’s exit strategy from recession Taking part in a plenary debate at the fourth Foundation Forum held in Dublin on 5–6 November are (left to right) Nicolas Schmit, Luxembourg’s Minister for Labour, Employment and Immigration, Jørgen Rønnest, Chair of Social Affairs Committee, BusinessEurope, Robert Verrue, Director General, DG Employment and John Monks, General Secretary, ETUC.     A slideshow of some photographs and a video of the Forum are also available. News in brief First findings of ECS to be launched The first findings from Eurofound’s European Company Survey 2009 (ECS) are being launched at an event hosted by Eurofound on 15 December in Stockholm. The event, ‘Company practices in the face of economic downturn’, will outline findings from the survey of over 27,000 establishments in 30 European countries. Representatives of management and, where possible, employee representatives were interviewed in order to document company practices in working time arrangements, flexibility strategies, pay, and the role played by social dialogue. In addition to looking at the findings of the ECS, participants will also discuss such issues as the contribution that social dialogue can make to delivering change, the appropriate flexibility strategies for companies in a time of crisis, and whether so-called ‘high performance’workplaces represent a path for future success. Read more on the European Company Survey Calling all providers of research services Eurofound has launched a call for expressions of interest (CEI) from the providers of research services.The topics to be researched are ‘employment growth and demand and supply of labour’, ‘more and better jobs and higher productivity through partnership’, ‘promoting social inclusion and sustainable social protection’and ‘monitoring and survey research activities’. On the basis of the CEI, Eurofound will create a shortlist of candidates, who may be invited at a future date to supply a proposal for a specific procurement procedure; this shortlist may be used for a range of different procurement procedures over a three-year period. Read more about this call for expressions of interest Childcare workshop in Brussels Early childhood services can provide vital support – both educational and social – to parents. Eurofound is hosting a workshop on 27 November in Brussels to look at the role that such services play, and discuss how they can contribute to more effective parenting.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1023	2010-01-06	UNK	Press release, 6 May 2009	Eurofound publishes report on wage developments in Cyprus Cyprus second lowest collectively agreed wage increases across Europe in 2008 (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Workers in Cyprus saw their annually collectively agreed wage increase by 2.5% in 2008, up from 2.1% in 2007, according to new research from Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU agency charged with providing European social policy-makers with research data, analysis and recommendations. This is the second lowest increase recorded across all 27 Member States in the EU, only behind Malta and on par with Denmark. The development in Cyprus confirms a trend of wage moderation, similar to that of many former EU15 countries. The new research from Eurofound concludes that the rate of increase in collectively agreed nominal wage increases rose between 2007 and 2008 rose in 16 countries reviewed across the European Union, and fell in 11. The largest increases were recorded in Latvia (23.8%), Lithuania (20.6%), Estonia (16.4%) and Romania (15.9%), and the lowest were recorded in Malta (1.8%), Cyprus (2.5%), Denmark (2.5%), Germany (2.9%), and Portugal (3.1%) and Austria (3.1%). Collective bargaining plays a relatively significant role in pay setting across Europe. New research from Eurofound’s concluded that average collectively-agreed nominal wage increases across the EU fell from 6.2% in 2007 to 6.1% in 2008. In the former EU15, the average increase in 2007 stood at 3.3%, rising to 3.9% in 2008. In the ten new EU Member States, the average increase was 10.2% in 2006, falling slightly to 9.2% in 2008. When the newest members Romania and Bulgaria are added to the ten new Member States, the respective figures were 11.9% in 2007, falling to 10.1% in 2008. Findings from Eurofound’s new research on wage development, as well as research on working time and flexibility, will be presented to representatives from the Cyprus government, trade unions and employers’ organisations in Nicosia. A delegation from Eurofound will visit Cyprus on May 6-8 2009 and meet with Ms Sotiroula Charalambous, Minister for Labour and Social Insurance, as well as representatives from SEK, PEO, PASYDY, DEOK, TURKSEN, DEVIS and KTAMS, as well as the OEB. A half-day seminar on issues related to pay and working time will be held in collaboration with the Cyprus Institute of Labour INEK PEO in Nicosia on Thursday 7 May 2009.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1024	2010-01-06	UNK	Press release, 25 March 2009	Eurofound publishes its Second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS) Austrians rate their health care system top of the class in Europe Austrians rate their health care system top of the class in Europe, according to the Second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS), carried out by Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU Agency. Also, confidence in the public transport system is high, rated only behind Luxembourg and Finland. Trust in political institutions among Austrians is among the highest in Europe but Austrians rate their own health below the EU15 average. The survey, to be launched under the Czech EU Presidency in Prague on 25 March, also reveals that Europeans are generally satisfied with their quality of life despite big variations between both levels of life satisfaction and happiness, especially among the 12 new EU Member States. Four out of five people (81%) across the European Union say that health is very important in determining their quality of life. On the state of their health, more than two out of three people (67%) rate their health as very good or good, one in four (24%) as fair, and one in ten (9%) as bad or very bad. More people in the 12 new EU Member States and the three candidate countries rate their health as ‘bad or very bad’, in particular the women in these countries. Reporting poor health is, not surprisingly, associated with increasing age: in the EU27, fewer than 2% of people aged between 18 and 34 years report bad health, as opposed to 18% of those aged 65 and over. The survey also reveals that a substantial number of Europeans have difficulty in accessing health care services. One in four (25%) report problems because they are too far from their doctor or hospital, while more than two in five (38%) experience delays in getting medical appointments and more than one in four (27%) have difficulty meeting the expense involved in seeing a doctor. Similarly, the survey reveals that family life is also key to quality of life with seven out of ten people in Europe (68.7%) saying a good family life is very important for quality of life. The survey shows that one in three people across the EU27 (30%) report that they are involved in childcare on a daily basis, with small differences between the NMS12 (33%) and the EU15 (29%). In terms of actual time spent, women report spending 33 hours per week, and men over 18 hours, in caring for and educating children. Women also report spending 18 hours per week cooking and doing housework, as against 10 hours per week for men. One in five (20%) in the EU15 feel that they do more than their fair share of housework, and somewhat less (18%) in the NMS12 and in the CC3 (17%). The perceived quality of society is another fundamental element of the multidimensional concept of quality of life. The dimensions of societal – and not only individual – well-being are emphasised in the Lisbon Strategy and are a focus of EU social policy. The political and economic impact of the two recent rounds of enlargement can be seen in the income distribution, trust in institutions and social relations. The level of trust in political institutions is lowest in Poland, Hungary, Lithuania and the Czech Republic among the 12 new EU Member States, and in Italy, Portugal and the UK among the EU15 countries. When asked to rate their level of trust in other people in their country on a scale from one to 10, people in the Nordic countries and the Netherlands express the highest levels of trust. People living in Cyprus express the lowest levels of trust, followed by the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). ‘The challenges arising from social exclusion, unemployment, an ageing population, changing family structures, new gender roles as well as EU enlargement have pushed quality of life issues to the fore in the EU policy debate,’ says Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director. ‘The European Quality of Life Survey documents not only living conditions and the economic circumstances of people in Europe, but also how they feel about them, and about the society in which they live.’ In the EQLS, social relations are examined in terms of tension between groups, as well as attitudes towards migrants. In the EU15, the survey shows that the highest levels of tension between men and women and between the young and the old are found in Luxembourg (23% and 25%), followed by Spain (20% and 19%) and Greece (18% and 21%). At the other end of the scale is Denmark (6% and 5%). Among the 12 new Member States, Hungary stands out in this area (20% and 30%), followed by Bulgaria, Cyprus and Malta. Enabling citizens to develop some balance between family life, personal commitments and working life has become central to the social policy debate. Still, almost half (48%) of citizens in paid employment in the EU27 say that, at least several times a month, they are too tired as a result of their work to do household jobs. The report shows that men and women in the EU27 struggle with work-life balance almost to the same extent. Some 22% of working men state that they are too tired several times a week to do household jobs, while 21% of women report the same problem.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1025	2010-01-06	UNK	Press release, 25 March 2009	Eurofound publishes its Second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS) Almost one in six people in the Netherlands report high tensions between racial and ethnic groups in the country Almost one in six people in the Netherlands report high tensions between racial and ethnic groups in the country, the highest levels found in Europe, according to the Second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS), carried out by Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU Agency. The Dutch put great trust in their political institutions, however, among the five highest levels recorded across Europe. The Dutch also rank their own health, and the quality of and access to their health care system, among the top five highest in Europe.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1027	2009-11-26	UNK	Press release, 27 November 2009	" Eurofound organises a high-level conference on intercultural relations and related policies with 'Cities for Local Integration Policies for Migrants' (CLIP) Network in Brussels, Belgium 30 November – 1 December 2009. Evidence based policy to integrate migrants to European society Improving relationships with migrants and with Muslim communities in order to increase social cohesion in European Cities is the focus for a high-level European conference Eurofound organises in collaboration with the European Commission (DG EAC), the Council of Europe (Congress and Intercultural Cities Project), the Committee of the Regions, the Open Society Institute and the Network of European Foundations (NEF) on 30 November – 1 December. 		 Intercultural policies and intercultural dialogue are high on the social policy agenda in many European Member States, due to increasing cultural diversity in European cities. Improving intercultural relations are important components of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities policies of the European Union. Empirical evidence suggests significant and prolonged discrimination of migrant ethnic and religious minorities in Europe. It encourages cities to take intercultural relations serious due to the ambiguous nature of intercultural relations in many cities: On one hand peaceful-coexistence as well as pragmatic relations and on the other hand dissatisfaction on both sides, low involvement and insufficient resources for migrant organisations. It also challenges the public perception that faith issues with Muslim communities are difficult “per se”. There is more satisfaction in cities than perceived regarding the handling of faith issues like mosque building, religious education or dress codes. In general more day-day issues like burial are more important than symbolic issues like religious buildings. Effective and targeted intercultural policies in European cities have a great potential  to support increased social cohesion and a sense of belonging combined with new intercultural city identity of all cities “old” and “new”. Those policies could be used to improve the economic situation in the city by using the cultural diversity of its workforce to enhance competiveness and innovation.  	 The 'Cities for Local Integration Policies for Migrants' (CLIP) Network will be holding a high-level conference on 30 November and 1 December 2009 in Brussels entitled “Intercultural approaches to community-building and cohesion in European cities - what can European integration policy learn from cities on how to manage migration and diversity in times of economic slump?”. This meeting will examine new evidence based on a comprehensive inventory of activities of cities; with result of studies from the 'Cities for Local Integration Policies for Migrants' (CLIP) Network, the Open Society Institute, and the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA). 		 The two-day high-level conference brings together European level and local policy makers of cities and representatives of Civil Society and of religious and ethnic migrant minority groups in order to discuss an effective policy response to challenges, concerns and opportunities of the increasing cultural diversity in European cities. Evidence seems to suggest that there is a specific policy issue around intercultural relations between Muslim communities and Western liberal societies. 		 ‘The aim of the conference is to support an evidence based policy discourse on these issues through an effective combination of a bottom-up and top-down learning process. The examples of good practices show there is a realistic hope to improve the social cohesion of European cities,’ says Hubert Krieger, research manager in charge of the project at Eurofound. ‘European policy makers improve their awareness of what happens on the ground; local policy makers learn about experiences in other parts of Europe and about new strategic development on the EU level; Civil Society and ethnic and religious minorities feel an accepted part of an open and host intercultural dialogue by expressing their concerns directly to policy makers.’ Read more about the conference For further information, contact Måns Mårtensson at email mma@eurofound.europa.eu, telephone +353-1-204 3124 or mobile +353-876-593 507.

EGF – assisting laid-off workers The extra assistance in terms of financial and human resources made possible through the European Globalisation adjustment Fund (EGF) was an ‘extremely valuable addition to other funding sources’, according to key players involved in the process of assisting workers made redundant in two recent high-profile company restructuring cases. A case study from Eurofound, Added value of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund: A comparison of experiences in Germany and Finland, outlines the role that EGF funding played in integrating workers laid off from restructuring in companies in the mobile telephony sector – in BenQ in Germany, and Perlos in Finland. According to the research, a key element of the Fund’s success in augmenting national and regional efforts was the extra time it allowed for training and for more individualised and in-depth assistance, especially for more vulnerable groups of workers. Overall, the EGF – in these cases at least – appears to have had a significant impact on the employability and well-being of workers who were made redundant. Impact on workers and regions Changes in market patterns have profoundly affected mobile phone and component manufacturers, with BenQ in Germany and Perlos in Finland both shifting production from Europe to low-cost countries in Asia. While restructuring was necessary for the company’s continued success, in both cases it involved large-scale factory closures and the loss of thousands of jobs. Given that both companies had located much of their production in regions with little in the way of alternative employment opportunities, and that many of the jobs in question employed workers with few transferable skills, the job losses were particularly devastating. Models of assistance Two different models of assistance for redundant workers are in operation in Germany and Finland: the transfer company and the change security centre. Both are well developed; however, in the German case, the normal model of a transfer company would not include the highly individualised assistance and training for such workers, as well as peer group support, that formed part of the EGF package. And for both the German and Finnish cases, EGF assistance allowed delivery partnerships to prepare more detailed assessments of labour market requirements and develop tailored training provision, which was more likely to lead to positive job outcomes. In Finland, due to governmental budgetary restrictions, hiring extra support staff to assist workers is problematic. EGF funding, however, meant that more support staff could be recruited, and the local job centre was able to receive support from additional advisors, an occupational psychologist and a team leader. Aiding those most in need A further limitation of both the German and Finnish traditional models is that they both often suffer from limitations of time and financial resources. This creates the greatest problems for those workers who are most in need of assistance, as such workers need more in-depth intervention, counselling and training to enable them to re-enter the labour market. In the case of both BenQ and Perlos, those interviewed for the case study felt that the key benefit of EGF intervention was the extra resources and personnel that was mobilised to assist workers, rather than the creation of new types of support schemes. And in both cases, it was felt to be the most vulnerable groups of affected workers – older workers, those with low levels of skills and women (particularly single mothers) – who benefited the most from the additional support provided through EGF funding. When surveyed, workers in both companies particularly appreciated the more intense and individualised support offered in the form of more advisors.

Fighting recession, facilitating recovery Younger men, with lower levels of education, working in manufacturing, have suffered most in terms of job loss in the current recession. Moreover, experience of previous recessions indicates that for some countries the likelihood of further increases in unemployment still looms, even as others are showing signs of an economic upturn. Eurofound’s new resource pack, Sink or swim: recession and recovery in Europe, launched at the fourth Foundation Forum in November, uses data from its European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) and other sources to present company-, national- and European-level approaches to softening the impact of the downturn and facilitating a timely exit from the recession. Reports and factsheets in the pack outline potential avenues for recovery, analyse the effects upon employment to date and prospects for the future, examine the role of social partnership in finding creative responses and look at how moves to a ‘green’economy may also create sustainable jobs. National anti-crisis packages As the effects of the recession reverberate across Europe, national and regional governments in the Member States have responded by launching comprehensive anti-crisis packages. A key element of many of these packages is support and assistance for companies and workers facing labour market challenges. Some countries have focused on the demand side of the economy by making substantial use of tax cuts, while others have sought to boost the supply side by enhancing business-support initiatives. Countries also vary in the emphasis they place on supporting specific target groups, such as small and medium-sized enterprises, exporting companies, young people or older people. In recent months, a wide range of different public support instruments to foster the labour market have been made available across Europe. Mere stop-gap solutions? Eurofound research shows that some initiatives, such as short-time working – used particularly in manufacturing enterprises – have bought time for some economies and companies, by keeping job losses to a minimum. However, these instruments – designed as stop-gap solutions – cannot be maintained if the overall economic climate does not improve. There is a real danger of unemployment levels rising rapidly even in countries such as France or Germany, which have so far managed to avoid large-scale restructuring. Evidence from previous recessions also points to the fact that a reduction in output does not translate into an immediate fall in employment: therefore, further job losses may result from the output falls suffered to date. Social partners face up to the challenge The recession also has had an impact on social dialogue, the effects varying widely between countries and sectors. The responses from the social partners to government actions vary. Employers view increased government spending on health and social welfare as a drain on the economy, while trade unions seek to protect the terms and conditions of employment for their members employed in the public sector. Employee representatives and trade unions are faced with the uncomfortable choice of either agreeing to less favourable terms of employment to assist in that cost reduction, or risking the laying off of at least part of the workforce, the relocation of the establishment or even the closure of the business. This process of so called concession bargaining often entails employee representatives agreeing to the implementation of pay freezes or pay cuts.  Download the resource pack	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-november-december-2009-0

Director’s Diary In this, the final issue of Eurofound News for 2009, it is timely to take a look back at some of Eurofound’s achievements over the year. In January, Eurofound launched its new four-year annual work programme, ‘Europe at work: Better opportunities for all’. Over the course of the year, substantial progress was made on Eurofound’s ongoing pan-European surveys: in March, the descriptive report for the second European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) was launched, while fieldwork was wrapped up for the second European Company Survey (ECS) 2009. At present, as the in-depth analysis reports of the second EQLS are being prepared for publication, Eurofound is preparing to launch the first findings from the ECS. Assessing the impact of the economic downturn, and investigating practical responses to it, formed an important part of Eurofound’s work in 2009. This culminated in the fourth Foundation Forum, held on 5–6 November, in which around 200 participants came together to discuss the theme of ‘Global recession: Europe’s way out’. At this high-level event, European policymakers, researchers and social partners examined whether there was a specifically European way out of the recession, one that could result in the creation of a more sustainable social model. The Forum also marked the launch of Eurofound’s latest resource pack, which addresses the theme of recession and recovery. A conference report detailing the discussions that took place will be available online shortly, as will a number of video interviews with key speakers. A crucial element in recovery is putting in place the necessary building blocks. The Foundation seminar series, in progress as Eurofound News goes to press, seeks to look beyond the current crisis and find ways to maintain levels of employment and skills for the future.

Gender pay gap still persists The gap between men’s and women’s earnings still persists, according to recent research on pay developments from Eurofound. On average, women across the EU in 2008 earned 16.6% less than men. This is despite the explicit gender-neutral terms of European collective agreements and minimum wage laws. A Eurofound report, Pay developments – 2008, also finds that the gender pay gap is wider in the 12 new EU Member States than in the former EU15. At the two ends of the spectrum are Estonia, where it stands at 30.3%, and Italy, where it is only 4.4%. Other countries in which the pay gap is notably wide (more than 20%) include Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands and Slovakia. Shrinking pay gap Although persistent, the average gender pay gap – at least in the EU15 –  has fallen considerably and steadily, from 20.4% in 2001 to 19.2% in 2002, 18.6% in 2003, 17.4% in 2004, 18.1% in 2005 and 15.3% in 2006. In 2008, the pay gap in the EU15 was 15% – somewhat narrower than for the EU27 as a whole. By contrast, in the 12 new EU Member States, the gender pay gap averages 18.6%: 3.6 percentage points higher than the average for the EU15. Increase in real pay plummets More generally, the report also finds that the average real wage increase for European workers fell from 3.6% in 2007 to 1.3% in 2008. The annual update on pay developments in Europe 2008 recorded sizeable differences between EU Member States, with the nominal rate of increase dropping only slightly, but the real rate of increase (with the effects of inflation factored in) falling sharply.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1033	2009-11-03	UNK	Press release, 4 November 2009	" Eurofound publishes its European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) Annual Report 2009 ‘Restructuring in recession’ A coordinated macroeconomic response at European level is required to tackle the recession (DUBLIN, IRELAND) The impact of the recession has already been significant for most Member States in terms of job loss and rising unemployment. Experience of previous recessions, however, shows that the labour market may continue to deteriorate well into 2010, particularly when the large number of temporary measures to maintain employment have matured across Europe. In its 2009 annual report on restructuring in Europe, Eurofound argues that the European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP) is the correct policy response to tackle the recession, and that more coordinated macroeconomic responses at European are required. 		 The main policy response to the recession in Europe has been a return to fiscal demand stimulus policy. At Member State level, the anti-crisis packages have included a combination of support to enterprises, tax reductions and increases in minimum wage to foster consumer demand, increased public sector employment and reduced employment taxes.  Many companies throughout Europe have taken initiatives to maintain jobs, most prominently, various means of reducing working hours. In countries such as Germany, which have extensive public support for these schemes, job loss has been minimal due to the shortening of the working week. Other company-level initiatives include production stops, obligations to take annual leave, shorter working weeks or days, enhanced use of working time accounts, leave rotation and sabbaticals. 		 These efforts are putting enormous strain on the economies of individual Member States, and since they are designed as short-term responses, the report argues that there is clear role for the European Union to coordinate efforts in the longer term. The report argues that given its strong competition policy mandate, the EU will have a vital role to play in ensuring the avoidance of a protectionist response from Member States. The issue of protectionist state aids is likely to figure prominently in the forthcoming policy debate. If the recession is as deep as many fear, there may even be good arguments for at least temporary public support for crisis industries, the report argues. It is crucial, however, that this does not disturb the functioning of the Single Market. This can only be avoided with EU-level industrial policy or coordination. It may be that the current recession will spark a significant development of EU industrial policy. The European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) Annual Report 2009 ‘Restructuring in recession’ looks at the impact of the current recession on employment, comparing the present experience with that of previous recessions. It provides an overview of recent developments in restructuring across Europe from a number of perspectives, focusing on the construction, car manufacturing and financial services sectors. It looks at initiatives that companies have taken to safeguard jobs and the role played by the social partners in finding solutions. This company-level investigation is complemented by looking at European-level measures to protect employment – in particular, the role assigned to the European Globalisation adjustment Fund. Finally, this analysis is rounded out by looking at national level responses. The report will be launched in Dublin on 5 November 2009 at the fourth Foundation Forum. The Foundation Forum 2009 will take place on 5-6 November 2009. With the support of the Irish Government the event will be held in Dublin Castle and will draw together some 200 decision takers and policymakers from the European Union Member States and the European Institutions to debate the theme of Europe's response to global recession. In particular, the Forum will examine the roles of government and the social partners, taking account of Europe’s social model and lessons learned from previous crises.  Download the ERM Annual Report 2009 ‘Restructuring in recession’ More information about the Foundation Forum 2009 For further information, contact Måns Mårtensson: mma@eurofound.europa.eu, telephone +353-1-204 3124 or mobile +353-876-593 507.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1034	2009-10-29	UNK	Press release, 30 October 2009	" Eurofound publishes its European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) Quarterly for the 3rd quarter 2009 Restructuring job loss in EU declines in third quarter (DUBLIN, IRELAND) The European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) recorded a total of 326 cases of restructuring in the European Union between 1 July and 30 September 2009, involving some 119,000 announced job losses and 36,000 announced job gains. Restructuring activity as captured by the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) has continued to reflect more normal levels of activity in the recent quarter. The surge in restructuring-related job loss that the ERM captured in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 shows no sign of returning. Although most economic indicators point to an end of the economic downturn, it is unclear how labour markets will fare once public stimulus programmes have come to an end. 		 Europe is slowly emerging from one of the deepest recessions on record with the European Commission predicting positive growth in the third quarter of 2009. The most recent quarterly output data are beginning to paint a more encouraging picture, with positive growth taking place in 10 Member States, including France and Germany, between the first and second quarter of 2009. But in a variety of ways, each Member State continues to suffer the ravages of the economic shock provoked by the financial crisis. 		 Unemployment in the EU27 continues to rise, although the rate of increase is falling. According to latest available data in the European Union, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 9.1%. The level of unemployment in the euro area is higher, at 9.6%. Both, however, remain below the faster rising levels reported in the United States, at 9.7% in July 2009. As in previous quarters, the lowest unemployment rates were in the Netherlands (at 3.5%), Austria (4.7%) and Cyprus (5.6%). The highest levels were recorded in Spain (18.9%), the Baltic countries Latvia (18.3%), Lithuania (13.7%) and Estonia (13.3%) and Ireland (12.5%). Given that unemployment is a lagging indicator, however, it is likely that it will continue to rise even after output stabilises, possibly well into 2010. 		 During the third quarter of 2009, 118,896 job losses were announced across the EU. France records the highest number of 27,659 job losses. A much lower volume of job losses is reported in the other three countries at the top of the list: Germany (15,278), the Netherlands (11,950) and the Czech Republic (11,874). The UK follows with 11,487 reported job losses. In this quarter, the public administration sector (22,514 jobs), followed by post and telecommunications (15,753), and manufacturing of motor vehicles (11,947) accounted for the largest amounts of announced job losses. 		 During the same period, the ERM recorded 36,635 announced job creations. the UK recorded the highest number of announced job gains (10,863), followed by Poland (6,327) and Belgium (4,700). Romania (3,980) comes fourth in this list, just ahead of the Czech Republic (3,968). One in four new jobs created in Europe were in the retail sector. 		 In its latest edition, the quarterly also looks at restructuring in the European shipbuilding sector and includes a feature on collective redundancy data from Denmark.

The findings of the report reflect the extent to which environmental concerns have become a key element of policymaking and illustrate the consensus that exists between trade unions, employers and governments regarding the importance of the ‘green agenda’. The report shows that across Europe, national governments and the social partners are keen to maximise the job creation potential of this new area, and stimulate economic recovery, reduce carbon dioxide emissions as well as develop alternative energy sources. However, the report goes on to point out that the ‘green economy’ is not a short-term, quick-fix solution that will help countries emerge rapidly from the economic crisis. Changing Europe’s energy infrastructure, limiting carbon emissions, while simultaneously maintaining competitiveness and ensuring that workers’ skills remain up to date, needs careful, long-term planning. Going for green growth The European Commission’s European Economic Recovery Plan, published in November 2008 recommends investment in green measures to move towards a low-carbon economy, limit climate change, promote energy security and create new ‘green-collar’ jobs. In addition, many governments see the green agenda as a tool for revitalising Europe’s economy, and as a means of job creation. Most recovery packages launched at Member State level include a green element. Such packages may include subsidies for refurbishing insulation and heating systems (as in Austria, Ireland and Lithuania), the use of tax credits to encourage households to invest in alternative energy and insulation (in Belgium), and investment in new technologies, such as carbon capture (as in Norway and the UK). Social partner responses While social partners from both sides of industry have at least in principle embraced the green agenda, differences are evident in the approaches of employer and employee representatives Employer organisations are more focused on maintaining competitiveness and are more likely to be driven by the requirements of compliance – in fact, employer initiatives are often embedded in general corporate social responsibility strategies. By contrast, trade union organisations are more likely to engage in lobbying and campaigning, targeting governments and the business community. Training and upskilling urgently needed Both at European level and nationally, there are concerns that a skills shortage could hamper moves towards a European green-tech economy. The social partners in the UK have voiced such fears: as a result, the UK social partners, particularly on the employers’ side, are actively promoting strategies to boost the levels of skills required in the green economy. In Italy, universities and private training providers are developing courses to provide the skills needed by workers in a future green economy. However, difficulties may arise concerning the international comparability of new skills and qualifications.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1036	2009-09-09	UNK	Eurofound News, Issue 9, October 2009	" Director’s 	 diary Over the summer months Eurofound has been busy working on the different phases of its three flagship surveys – the European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS), the European Company Survey (ECS 2009) and the European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS). Charting European industrial relations The global economic downturn had a significant impact upon industrial relations over the course of 2008. Although nominal pay increases were generally higher than in 2007, having been negotiated before the full effects of the economic downturn had become apparent, pressure grew as the year advanced for limiting pay increases or instituting pay freezes. Stark differences in working time There are substantial differences in working time between the former EU15 Member States and the majority of the new EU Member States (NMS12), according to a new report from Eurofound, Working time developments – 2008. Research in brief Working week longest in Romania, shortest in France The figure shows harmonised Eurostat data for the average number of actual weekly hours of work in the main job of full-time employees.     News in brief Readers invited to contribute to external evaluation Eurofound has contracted the Centre for Strategy and Evaluation Services (CSES) to carry out an external evaluation of its work programme for the period 2005–2008. Social partnership – weathering the storm? The latest edition of Eurofound’s magazine-format publication Foundation Focus looks at how social partnership in Europe has responded to the economic downturn. Situation in European labour markets still poor Although there are some tentative signs of recovery, the consensus appears to be that the current recession may last longer in Europe than in the other major developed economies, according to the latest issue of the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) quarterly. Saving jobs in the face of recession As European economies slide into recession, a growing number of businesses are under threat, putting the jobs of more workers at risk.

IN BRIEF News in pictures Pictured left is a campaign poster, close to Eurofound’s Dublin offices, calling for a ‘Yes’ vote in the recent Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. Voters voted 67.1% in favour of the constitutional amendment required to ratify the Treaty, as against 32.9% who voted against.     News in brief Final preparations for Foundation Forum 2009 Europe must find a way of out of recession. But can it do so with its social and political principles intact? Or will some fundamental European values be jettisoned in regaining global competitiveness? These are the questions to be discussed at Foundation Forum 2009, ‘Global recession: Europe’s way out’. As always, the Irish government’s support is key to the success of the Forum, which takes place in Dublin on 5–6 November. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Brian Cowen is invited to open the debate, and ministers from Luxembourg, Slovenia and Poland are speaking in plenary and breakout sessions. High-level representatives of the social partners are attending, with ETUC General Secretary John Monks speaking on the lessons learned from previous recessions. Amy Domini, founder and CEO of Domini Social Investments will share her insights on the ‘American way out’, while Maria Joao Rodrigues, Special Advisor on the Lisbon Strategy, will present European perspectives on weathering the storm. More on the Forum Restructuring in the construction sector With access to credit severely curtailed, the construction industry is in crisis. A new report from Eurofound, Restructuring in the construction sector, looks at how the sector is coping with the downturn and what measures have been taken to reduce job loss. Many governments have launched large-scale public works aimed at improving infrastructure and simultaneously preserving construction jobs. Some have provided tax breaks to stimulate housing demand, while others have adapted their rules on benefit payments or expanded short-time working schemes. However, such measures have not prevented significant job loss, particularly among lower-skilled, younger, and migrant workers. Download the report Industrial relations resources on Eurofound web site Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) publishes a wealth of information on industrial relations developments in the EU. But it can be hard to make sense of developments in other Member States without some background knowledge of their industrial relations culture. The ‘Industrial relations country profiles’ provide, for each country, a concise guide to the basic economic facts and figures, the main trade union and employer bodies, the type and level of collective bargaining, the extent of industrial conflict and more. Complementing this national-level information, the recently updated European industrial relations dictionary provides definitions and contextual information on such uniquely European concepts as ‘posted workers’ and ‘direct effect’. Visit www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/country_index.htm for the country profiles (forthcoming) and, for the dictionary, www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary Promoting young people’s inclusion in labour market Policy concern is growing in many Member States about the rising numbers of young people who are entering long-term disability schemes – in many cases, because of mental health problems, such as depression or anxiety disorders. Eurofound’s research into the issue will feature at an upcoming high-level conference on labour market inclusion hosted by the Swedish Presidency, on 26–27 October in Stockholm. Politicians, experts, researchers and stakeholders from across the EU will look at ways of tackling the issue. Commission launches Social Europe newsletter The European Commission has launched a new email newsletter on the themes of employment, social affairs and equal opportunities.

Director's diary Like all European-level organisations, Eurofound has to adapt to the institutional changes taking place in the European Union. Against the background of a newly elected Parliament, changes in the make-up of the European Commission, and the recent ratification of the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland, Eurofound is working hard to continue to fulfil its mandate to deliver relevant, up-to-date findings to decision makers. For example, an information intiative targeting newly returned MEPs is currently underway through Eurofound’s Brussels Liaison Office. Meanwhile, finishing touches are being put to the fourth Foundation Forum, which addresses European responses to the global recession. Foundation Forum 2009 will debate the impact of the recession and discuss the actions that workers, employers and national governments can undertake to weather the storm. Several key Eurofound publications dealing with the theme of recession will also be launched at the Forum – the 2009 annual report from the European Restructuring Monitor, Restructuring in recession, and the latest resource pack, Sink or swim: Recession and recovery in Europe. New publications this month include a report looking at the ‘greening’ of the European economy, the latest annual review of working conditions in the EU, and a number of case studies of successful examples of integration of migrants from the ‘European network of cities for local integration policies for migrants’ (CLIP). Eurofound continues to collaborate proactively with EU Presidency programmes, bringing its research findings to a high-level conference on labour market inclusion in Stockholm this month, as part of the Swedish Presidency. Preparation is also progressing on Eurofound’s contribution to the upcoming Spanish Presidency in 2010.

IN BRIEF Research in brief Working week longest in Romania, shortest in France The figure below shows harmonised Eurostat data for the average number of actual weekly hours of work in the main job of full-time employees, based on its Labour Force Survey for the third quarter of 2008. These hours include all working hours, including extra hours, whether paid or not. Read Working time developments – 2008 News in brief Readers invited to contribute to external evaluation Eurofound has contracted the Centre for Strategy and Evaluation Services (CSES) to carry out an external evaluation of its work programme for the period 2005–2008. As well as being a regulatory requirement, such an evaluation is a key instrument for sound financial management, a valuable tool in providing evidence to aid decision making, and a vital measure for organisational learning and continuous improvement. The results of the fully independent external evaluation will be reported to Eurofound’s Governing Board in October 2009, with a final report to be prepared towards the end of the year. The fieldwork for the evaluation includes surveys of Eurofound’s stakeholders and target audiences. Readers of Eurofound News are invited to participate in an online target audience survey; your input, which will be treated with utmost confidentiality, is greatly welcomed and will make an important contribution to the evaluation. To complete the questionnaire please go to www.cses.co.uk/survey/eurofound/target/intro.htm Thank you in advance for taking part!   Social partnership – weathering the storm? The latest edition of Eurofound’s magazine-format publication Foundation Focus looks at how social partnership in Europe has responded to the economic downturn. Using Eurofound research, it seeks to find out how the social partners have reacted to the economic crisis, whether or not the crisis has led to less or more dialogue, and what solutions have been developed at the level of the workplace. It becomes apparent that employers have cooperated with trade unions on a range of initiatives aimed at avoiding mass dismissals, including paid and unpaid leave programmes, part-time and short-time working, and joint efforts to deal with the impacts of restructuring. Download the latest Focus Situation in European labour markets still poor Although there are some tentative signs of recovery, the consensus appears to be that the current recession may last longer in Europe than in the other major developed economies, according to the latest issue of the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) quarterly. Most recent data confirm that the situation in European labour markets keeps deteriorating. Over the last quarter, the ERM reported 125,000 announced job losses as against announced job gains of 31,000, the sectors most affected being education, manufacturing and financial services. Nevertheless, some jobs are still being created. One of the most interesting developments is the creation of new ‘green jobs’ such as those announced by Véolia Environnement in France and the Electricity Supply Board in Ireland in the areas of recycling and clean energy technology. The quarterly is available online Saving jobs in the face of recession As European economies slide into recession, a growing number of businesses are under threat, putting the jobs of more workers at risk. A new report, Tackling the recession: Employment-related public initiatives in the EU Member States and Norway, examines the various measures being taken by governments, employers and trade unions in different countries in an effort to maintain jobs and minimise the losses that do occur. These include short-time working and temporary lay offs, support for training, employment counselling, retraining of the unemployed, reducing or deferring companies’ social security contributions, and providing direct and indirect financial support for enterprises. The report affirms the importance of maintaining public support even after the economic situation stabilises, given the time required for the effects of such measures to be realised.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1041	2009-07-27	UNK	Press release, 28 July 2009	" Eurofound publishes its annual report on working time developments across the European Union 		 Stark differences in working time across Europe 		 In 2008, the average collectively agreed weekly working time in the European Union remained unchanged at 38.6 hours, according to the annual update on working time developments from Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU Agency. The report, which looks at working time agreements set by collective bargaining, also found that the average paid annual leave entitlement for workers in Europe was 25.2 days across the EU in 2008; however, some countries had up to three weeks’ more holidays than others. 		 There are substantial differences in working time between the former EU15 Member States and the majority of the new EU Member States (NMS12), according to the report, Working time developments – 2008. The average working week in the EU15 was 37.9 hours in 2008 (the same as in 2007). It was longer in the NMS12 – 39.5 hours (down very slightly from 39.6 in 2007), a difference of 1.6 hours or 4.2%. 		 For most European workers, collective agreements are the main way in which working time is set. Through its analysis of working time developments over the past decade in the EU15, Eurofound has discovered that in these countries the working week has grown somewhat shorter: average agreed weekly working hours have fallen from 38.6 hours to 37.9 hours – a fall of 1.8%. While the working week has also reduced in the 10 Member States that joined in 2004 (the NMS10), the reduction has been less: since 2003, average agreed weekly working hours declined by only 0.2 hours or 0.5%, down from 39.6 hours to 39.4. These collectively agreed reductions in working hours did not entail a loss of pay; however, towards the end of 2008, cuts in working hours with consequent cuts in pay became increasingly topical as the economic crisis deepened. Enforced reductions in working time – and usually pay – in the form of short-time work and temporary layoffs have been on the increase in many EU countries as companies seek to cope with falling demand. Across the European Union, the longest working weeks (see note 1), worked by full-time employees in their main jobs, are found in Romania (41.8 hours), the Czech Republic (41.7 hours) and Latvia (41.7 hours). The shortest are in France (38.4 hours), Belgium (38.6 hours) and Ireland (38.9 hours). Only three of the EU15 countries have working weeks longer than the average for the entire EU27; by contrast, workers in 10 of the 12 new Member States work longer weeks than the EU27 average. 		 The report also compares the average collectively agreed entitlements for paid annual leave in the EU. It finds that the average number of fully paid holidays in Europe is 25.2 days per year. The average in the EU15 and Norway stands at 26.5 days, with a substantial difference between the average in Sweden (33 days) and in Greece (23 days). Among the new EU Member States, the average is 21.4 days per year, with notable, though smaller, differences between the Czech Republic (25 days) and Estonia (20 days).

Charting European industrial relations The global economic downturn had a significant impact upon industrial relations over the course of 2008. Although nominal pay increases were generally higher than in 2007, having been negotiated before the full effects of the economic downturn had become apparent, pressure grew as the year advanced for limiting pay increases or instituting pay freezes. Similarly, towards the end of the year, the enforced reduction of working time and pay moved onto the agenda, with short-time working becoming increasingly prevalent.          Eurofound’s annual review, Industrial relations developments in Europe 2008, highlights the key developments in the EU Member States and Norway during the year, at both national and EU level. It also outlines developments in employment legislation, social dialogue, industrial action and company restructuring, and looks in greater detail at the regulation, industrial relations, and the employment and working conditions of self-employed workers. Role of the social partners In 2008, the downturn led to the social partners shifting their focus towards the protection of jobs, as a response to major restructuring initiatives. In some countries, social partners were involved in formulating national crisis-response measures; however, this was dependent on countries’ industrial relations traditions and structures, and on the nature of the measures taken, the involvement varying from country to country. In Bulgaria, Estonia and Lithuania, the social partners complained of a lack of involvement and consultation over the preparation of the government’s measures. In the Netherlands, by contrast, government and social partners reached agreement on a range of measures such as moderate wage demands, reduced unemployment insurance contributions, and assistance for low-paid and vulnerable groups. Short-time working schemes The most common crisis-response measure with a direct industrial relations impact was probably the introduction or amendment of short-time working schemes, as the economy slowed and company order books shrank. Such schemes have a number of benefits: they can help employers adapt to drops in demand and retain skilled workers during difficult times; they can provide workers with an alternative to redundancies; and they can contribute to keeping down unemployment. Short-time working became increasingly prevalent in many countries and affected mainly the manufacturing sector – in particular, automotive companies and their suppliers. Self employed workers The final chapter looks in detail at the collective representation of self-employed workers – a complex topic, given the variety of definitions of what truly constitutes ‘self-employment’. While self-employment has long been common in many traditional sectors of the economy, technological innovations in recent decades have resulted in the emergence of self-employed workers in many other occupations, such as graphic design, music composition and information technology (IT), particularly in web-based environments. However, forms of employment have recently emerged that do not entirely correspond to traditional self-employment or to proper dependent employment, and have been sometimes labelled ‘economically dependent work’. These forms of employment have fuelled the debate on the implications of such transformations on the regulation of labour, including both legislation as well as collective representation and bargaining.

Stark differences in working time There are substantial differences in working time between the former EU15 Member States and the majority of the new EU Member States (NMS12), according to a new report from Eurofound, Working time developments – 2008. Across the EU, the longest working weeks are in Romania, the Czech Republic and Latvia. The shortest are in France, Belgium and Ireland.  The report, which looks at working time agreements set by collective bargaining, also found that the average number of fully paid holidays for European workers was 25.2 days in 2008; however, this varies considerably between countries, with Sweden having 33 days but Estonia having only 20 days. Reduction in working week appears to have slowed Eurofound has been publishing annual updates on working time for 10 years. Data for the EU15 and Norway have been collected since 1999, over which period the average agreed weekly working hours have fallen from 38.6 hours to 37.9 hours, or by about 1.8%. However, most of this reduction in working time occurred before 2003. Since then, there has been virtually no change in the average collectively agreed working time for western Europe, and general reductions in working hours have scarcely featured on the collective bargaining agenda in most countries. This was again the case in 2008, when agreed cuts in working time without loss of pay were virtually absent from the collective bargaining agenda. While the working week has also reduced in the 10 Member States that joined in 2004 (the NMS10), the reduction has been less: since 2003, average agreed weekly working hours declined by only 0.2 hours – from 39.6 hours to 39.4. Short-time work in response to crisis These collectively agreed reductions in working hours did not entail a loss of pay; however, towards the end of 2008, cuts in working hours with consequent cuts in pay became increasingly topical as the economic crisis deepened. Enforced reductions in working time – and usually pay – in the form of short-time work and temporary layoffs have been on the increase in many EU countries as companies seek to cope with falling demand. Paid annual leave The report also compares the average collectively agreed entitlements for paid annual leave in the EU. It finds that the average number of fully paid holidays in Europe is 25.2 days per year.

Director's diary Over the summer months Eurofound has been busy working on the different phases of its three flagship surveys – the European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS), the European Company Survey (ECS 2009) and the European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS). Five of the secondary analytical reports from the second EQLS are in preparation, with publication foreseen by the end of the year. With the fieldwork for the second ECS 2009 completed, a limited extension of the survey took place during the summer; it used both subjective and objective measures to gather data on the financial performance of the surveyed establishments to help understand the policies and practices that companies use in such areas as flexibility, human resources management and social dialogue and their links to performance. Meanwhile, preparations are ongoing for the fifth EWCS to be conducted in 2010, with the questionnaire being pre-tested over the summer in both French and English. This month, Eurofound News invites its readers to assist by taking part in a survey themselves, as part of the organisation’s external evaluation. More details of the online survey are available. Eurofound is involved in a number of events taking place under the Swedish EU Presidency. These address a range of the key policy themes that Eurofound research seeks to inform, including mobility, social partnership and active ageing. In order to assist European policymakers in better understanding Sweden’s labour market situation during their involvement in the Presidency, Eurofound has produced a background paper, Sweden – A country profile (available online), which uses its research findings to outline key features of the Swedish labour market and its industrial relations system. This is an initiative that Eurofound plans to extend to forthcoming Presidencies. Jorma Karppinen Director	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-september-2009-1
EUROFOUND_UNK_1045	2009-09-06	UNK	Press release, 7 September 2009	" Eurofound publishes its 2008 annual report on pay developments across the European Union: Increase in real pay plummets in all but four EU Member States in 2008 (DUBLIN, IRELAND) The average real wage increase for European workers fell from 3.6% in 2007 to 1.3% in 2008, according to new data published by Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). The annual update on pay developments in Europe 2008 recorded sizeable differences between EU Member States, with the rate of real increase falling sharply, and the nominal rate dropping only slightly. Wide differences emerge, however, between the various groups of countries within the EU, in terms of the level of real wage increases, with a broad east-west split. 		 Collective bargaining remains one of the primary tools for setting pay levels in Europe. The new report, which covers pay developments in the 27 EU Member States (EU27) and Norway in 2008, found the average collectively agreed nominal pay increase in the EU as a whole fell from 7.0% in 2007 to 6.6% in 2008. Nominal increases in the EU15 are at much lower levels than in the EU as a whole, with the average pay rise standing at 3.2% in 2007 and 3.8% in 2008. In the 12 new EU Member States (NMS12), the average rate of nominal increase is considerably higher, at 11.6% in 2007 and 10.1% in 2008. However, the difference in pay increases between the EU15 and the NMS12 narrowed from 2007 to 2008 – average pay rises in the NMS12 were 3.6 times higher than in EU15 in 2007 and 2.7 times higher in 2008. 		 When the sharp inflation increases across the EU27 in 2008 are taken into account, the rate of real increase is seen to have fallen from 3.6% in 2007 to 1.3% in 2008. This decline in real pay increases of 2.3 percentage points compares with a decrease of only 0.4 percentage points in nominal pay increases. In the EU15, the average real pay increase stood at 1.0% in 2007 and fell to 0.3% in 2008 – and at 1.3% and 0.5% respectively, if Norway is included. In the NMS12, the average real pay increase was considerably higher than in the EU15, at 6.9% in 2007 and 2.4% in 2008. 		 In terms of trends in real pay rises, the rate of increase, following the average trend, fell between 2007 and 2008 in all but four countries: Germany, Greece, Hungary and the Netherlands. The rate of increase declined most sharply in Estonia, Latvia and Romania. The exceptions were Germany, Greece, Hungary and the Netherlands, where the rate of increase rose. 		 The report also examines collectively-agreed pay increases in three selected sectors (metalworking, banking, and local government), current wage rates and minimum wage increases, increases in average earnings, and the extent of the gender pay gap across all countries.

IN BRIEF News in pictures On 3 July, Vladimír Špidla (left), EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, met with Eurofound’s new Deputy Director Erika Mezger (centre) and Eurofound Director Jorma Karppinen (right) at the headquarters of the Irish Business and Employers’ Confederation (IBEC) in Dublin.         News in brief Easing demographic change – the role of social services       The change taking place in Europe’s demographics, although slow, is profound. With people living longer and birth rates falling, the European population is slowly ageing and consequently shrinking. An older population will require more and better care services; in addition, women are increasingly entering the labour market, boosting demand for childcare. Drawn by Europe’s still vigorous relative prosperity, migrants are coming from across the globe to the EU; intelligently applied, well-thought out social services will be required to ensure the integration of these groups into European societies. The latest issue in Eurofound’s series of Foundation Findings, entitled Demographic change and social services, looks at examples of initiatives that, for example, assist with childcare in disadvantaged communities, seek to ensure more integrated and better quality housing for migrants and attract potential employees to work in the care sector. Download the latest Foundation Findings Multinational companies and collective bargaining         Multinational companies (MNCs) are major employers and have a substantial influence in national collective bargaining systems. Their international organisation and management structures – and their capacity to move production and jobs across borders – have implications for the structure, agenda and outcomes of collective bargaining. A new report from Eurofound – Multinational companies and collective bargaining – finds that, under multi-employer bargaining arrangements, MNCs have been a major source of pressure for the decentralisation of bargaining. In single-employer local negotiations in the manufacturing sector, MNCs make widespread use of cross-border comparisons of costs and performance. This results in the implementation of cost-saving and flexibility-enhancing measures. The report also discusses the need to develop transnational mechanisms of negotiation, if collective bargaining is to remain a prominent form of labour market regulation. Read the report Minimising the impact of company restructuring       Restructuring, whether undertaken due to financial crisis, or as the result of corporate merger, is traumatic for individual workers, and can have profound economic effects on the local region. However, across Europe many enterprises have made significant efforts – often in collaboration with worker representatives and public authorities – to minimise the effects of job losses. These may include helping workers retrain or find new jobs, and consulting with them about how best to achieve longer-term goals. A report from Eurofound, ERM case studies: Good practice in company restructuring, looks at a range of in-depth company cases to analyse the elements of good practice. It finds that consultation is a key factor in minimising the effects of job losses. In the best case examples, moreover, cooperative consultation is built into the company’s operating procedures and occurs on an ongoing basis even when restructuring is not an issue. Read more on this subject Migrants in European cities – learning from experience    European cities are at very different stages in their histories of integrating migrants. As part of its ongoing work in the European Network of Cities for Local Integration Policies for Migrants (CLIP), Eurofound is publishing 25 case studies that outline the experiences of municipalities across Europe in employing people of migrant origin, and of providing municipal services that meet their needs. CLIP, a network of 35 European cities working together to support the social and economic integration of migrants, seeks to enable local authorities to learn from each others’ experience and so deliver more effective integration policies and practices.

Hitting the brakes – the car sector in crisis The ongoing recession has hit European manufacturing industry hard. And of all sectors, it is the automotive sector that has been most affected. Car manufacturing and related suppliers are estimated to make up one third of all European manufacturing jobs. Sales in the first four months of 2009 dropped by around 15% in the EU15 and around 21% in the new Member States.         A new report from Eurofound – Recent restructuring trends and policies in the automotive sector – looks at recent developments in the sector, how the car industry is responding to the ongoing economic crisis and what policy responses have been drawn up at national and European levels. Responses range from support from the EU-funded European Globalisation adjustment Fund and loans from the European Investment Bank to national car scrappage deals and the introduction of short-time work and other forms of working time adjustments. Governments seek to boost demand Since cars are a major investment for most people and are often bought on credit, the banking crisis and the disappearance of cheap loans had an immediate effect on the car industry. Overproduction and falling sales have resulted in car manufacturers across the globe being severely affected, leading to the sale or bankruptcies of several major companies. Many national governments have stepped in to provide emergency loans and create more demand – for example, introducing scrappage schemes that reward the purchaser of a new car with a cash incentive. In the case of Germany, this has boosted consumer demand. However, similar schemes in other countries have yet to demonstrate the same impact. Short-time work schemes As a consequence of falling demand, many car manufacturers have been forced to cut down on production and reduce their workforces. Many thousands of temporary workers have been dismissed or have had their contracts not renewed. However, companies are reluctant to let go of more qualified employees, and instead have instituted schemes offering short-time work. These generally consist of reduced working hours, with the state providing a salary top-up to compensate for reduced wages and ensure continued social security contributions. In Germany and France, previously existing short-time working schemes have been greatly expanded, both in terms of eligibility and time span. However, evaluations conducted in both countries to determine whether short-time working prevents dismissals have come to different conclusions. Company-level initiatives In countries without collective agreements at sectoral level, many companies have developed their own initiatives to maintain staff in the face of falling demand. These include temporary production stops combined with unpaid leave for employees, temporary lay-offs, pay freezes or pay cuts. In some cases – e.g. Bentley Motors in the UK, Toyota UK, Volvo in Sweden and Opel in Poland – the workforce is given the opportunity for training during production stops or short-time work, either to increase skills or to be better prepared in the case of potential dismissal. It remains to be seen whether such measures can help support the automotive sector until the general economic climate picks up again. Research seems to indicate that many producers will not survive unscathed and that more mergers and closures will occur.

Tackling undeclared work Despite the fact that undeclared work is an issue for all 27 EU Member States, only rarely do Member States learn from what other countries have done. This is one of the conclusions of Eurofound’s latest report on the issue, Measures to tackle undeclared work in the European Union. The report, which is intended to help social policymakers steer debate and improve policy decisions on tackling undeclared work across the Union, argues that the issue is not the same everywhere. This is particularly the case concerning the types of undeclared work, its sectoral distribution and the motives for engaging in it. Therefore, a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to the issue is not appropriate. Along with the report, a ‘knowledge bank’ of more than 80 examples of good practice from across the EU has been published online, in order to boost opportunities for the mutual exchange of experience and learning. Deterrence or incentives? Government options When targeting undeclared work, governments can essentially choose to adopt either a ‘stick’ or deterrence approach (detecting and punishing undeclared work) or a ‘carrot’ or enabling approach (encouraging compliance and the transfer to declared work). Deterrent measures usually seek to increase the actual or perceived risk of getting caught and making it more costly, by raising fines or other sanctions. The enabling approach focuses on making it easier for undeclared workers and their clients to comply with the rules and to make the transition to the formal economy; such approaches may also seek to ensure that individuals and businesses do not start out using undeclared work from the outset. In addition, some countries have started to focus on changing attitudes by raising awareness of the dangers of undeclared work and its cost to society, as well as encouraging better adherence to ‘tax morality’. Finding the best approach The report advocates tailor-made approaches, rather than ‘one-size-fits-all’ solutions. Because of the variation in undeclared work, a policy measure that is successful in one country or region may not work as well in another. Choosing the best policy tool is also made more difficult by the fact that formal evaluation of measures is often lacking. To go some way towards remedying this, the database of good practice provides a short assessment of the effectiveness and transferability of every measure described. However, as the report concludes, different policy measures must be combined in an effective way if the fight against undeclared work is to be won. Read the report and search the database of cases.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-julyaugust-2009

EUROFOUND_UNK_1051	2009-06-18	UNK	Press release, 19 June 2009	 Eurofound co-organises a EU Presidency conference on working conditions and social dialogue in Prague, the Czech Republic, on 22-23 June 2009: Social dialogue crucial for improving working conditions (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Social partners and social dialogue have a key role to play in helping to improve working conditions in Europe, according to new research from Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU agency. The research uncovered big differences between countries in their approach, definition of roles of social partners and ultimately results in improving working conditions through social dialogue. The findings will be presented and debated among European social policymakers and experts at an EU Presidency conference in Prague, the Czech Republic, on 22-23 June. Social partners and social dialogue play a key role in helping to create better jobs and improve the quality of work and working conditions through influencing policy decisions, negotiating social pacts and collective agreements as well as through participating in particular programmes and policies. However, new research from Eurofound has found significant differences in how effective social dialogue is in improving working conditions. It uncovered a broad range of roles, ranging from an approach where social dialogue and collective bargaining is a constituent element of regulating working conditions at the company level and above, to a situation where the exact role of social dialogue is unclear. The research focused on analysing the situation in Germany, France, Sweden, Spain, Austria, and the Czech Republic, addressing the exact role of social dialogue in improving working conditions at the enterprise level, in particular in the construction and health care sectors. It found that social dialogue closest to the shop floor level is most efficient in improving working conditions. Here, trade unions seem to play a very important role, as well as sectoral employer organisations, since they organise and articulate interests of company based actors and vice-versa. ‘One important message arising from our study of sectoral initiatives is that sectoral based social dialogue is a crucial element for improvements in working conditions,’ says Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director in a comment on the findings of the study. The conference ‘Working Conditions and Social Dialogue’, an event organised in cooperation with the Czech EU Presidency, is open to representatives from the media. The event will be launched by Michal Sedláček, Deputy Minister for European Affairs, Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (MoLSA) and will gather some 60 European social policymakers and experts. The event starts at 09.30 on Monday 22 June at the Diplomat Hotel (Room Prague A-D), Evropská 15, CZ-160 41 Prague 6.   More information on Eurofound’s Conference on working conditions and social dialogue is available.

New Deputy Director takes office On 1 July, Dr Erika Mezger will take up the post of Eurofound’s Deputy Director. Coming from the Hans-Boeckler Foundation in Germany, where she was head of the Research Promotion department, Ms Mezger will strengthen Eurofound’s Directorate with her commitment to and expertise in research, policy advice and communication.        ‘There is a very important role for foundations, think tanks and non-profit organisations like Eurofound to provide policymakers with sound data, findings and recommendations, and even new ideas and criticism,’ says Ms Mezger. ‘By facilitating social dialogue, we can help improve decision-making and get endorsements from all parties, which in the long run will help in implementing decisions. The key to success, I believe, lies in the close link between reliable research findings and the strategies of the decision-makers, and in the building of trust between all parties involved in the process.’ Building trust and forging partnerships Ms Mezger points to several cases in which the Hans-Boeckler Foundation (the research arm of the Confederation of German Trade Unions) facilitated constructive agreements in the fields of education, gender issues and worker participation, proposing solutions and helping broker deals with the German government, the opposition and social partners. With her previous experience of working with social partners, mainly in the UK, the US and France, Ms Mezger feels confident that her understanding of compromise and her experience in building trust will help in the new role. ‘In order to reach the right people with our work, we have to first select and strongly commit the right researchers and equip them with a clear mandate and set of goals,’ says Ms Mezger. ‘The trick is to find the right people that can do the research, and also lend a hand in communication. For that purpose, I would like to start a dialogue with national collaborators, building credibility in what we do together.’ Research and trade union background Erika Mezger has a Masters and PhD in public administration from the University of Konstanz. She has always been active in civil society movements, having been motivated from growing up during the Willy Brandt era. Her father was a strong influence, a very engaged and committed man who encouraged his daughter to attempt to understand social issues from an early age. During her academic years, she became involved in the trade union movement, frequently contributing to seminars and network meetings, and regularly talking to key social stakeholders. This kind of engagement was encouraged by the newly established school of public management at the University of Konstanz, which soon became known as ‘Little Harvard University by Lake Constance’. ‘The school encouraged us to go to people, talk to people and make up our minds on important issues,’ says Ms Mezger. ‘I thrived in this environment.’ At the Hans-Boeckler Foundation, her work focused on welfare state policies and modern governance, and active labour market policies. In line with the Hans-Boeckler Foundation’s cross-sectional approach to research projects, Ms Mezger’s research has had a horizontal approach incorporating education, gender issues and workers’ participation. A new challenge The job as Deputy Director at Eurofound attracted her immediately. ‘The job advertisement reflected perfectly my previous work, but with an added European dimension. ‘I am a very convinced European,’ continues Ms Mezger, who speaks English, German and some Russian. ‘I am excited about the step up from the national to the European level in my professional capacity, and from a more operational to a more strategic position within the organisation. From a personal perspective, I am equally excited about the prospect of living in a new environment and seeing Europe from a fresh perspective.’ A biographical note and photographs of Dr Erika Mezger are available.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-june-2009-0
EUROFOUND_UNK_1054	2009-07-01	UNK	Press release, 2 July 2009	" Eurofound publishes report and knowledge bank on measures to tackle undeclared work in the European Union Helping European social policymakers fight undeclared work Some five percent of workers in the 27 EU Member States and Norway carry out undeclared work, seriously affecting public finances by tax and social contributions, according to a new report from Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU Agency. 'Measures to tackle undeclared work in the European Union' outlines policies and strategies on how to raise awareness of the issue which exists to different degrees across all Member States. Responding to calls from the European Commission and the European Parliament, Eurofound today also presents a database with good practice examples of policies and measures which have proven to be most effective in tackling undeclared work across the EU. Informed discussion about how to tackle undeclared work in the 27 Member States of the European Union has been severely hampered by a lack of understanding of the nature of undeclared work. The new report from Eurofound, based on a Eurobarometer survey and an examination of policy measures, reveals that that some 5% of the surveyed population had carried out undeclared work during the 12 months prior to the 2007 survey. It also reveals that almost one in five undeclared jobs are found in the household services sector, which includes domestic cleaning services, as well as child and elder care provision. Across the EU, a majority (55%) of all undeclared work is conducted for friends, family and neighbours, the report found. A further 20% is conducted on a self-employed basis for other private persons or households, while just 20% related to undeclared waged employment. The remaining 5% is unrecorded or not known. There are, however, big differences between countries. On the one hand, in some countries, the participation rate is much higher, including Denmark (18%), Latvia (15%), the Netherlands (13%), Estonia (11%) and Sweden (10%). In the other countries, levels are low, for example in Germany (3%), Ireland (4%) and in Romania (4%). While undeclared workers participated in this form of work for an average of almost 200 hours during the past 12 months across the EU as whole, undeclared workers in southern Europe appear to have worked an average of 350 hours in this sphere compared with 330 hours among central eastern Europeans, 110 hours among those in Continental Europe and 60 hours in the Nordic countries. 'Undeclared work is one of the issues of common concern in the employment field in Europe, but our work shows that it is not the same everywhere, especially when looking at the types of undeclared work, its sectoral distribution and the motives for engaging in such work,' says Radoslaw Owczarzak, the Eurofound research manager behind the report. 'Our report is aimed at creating a common understanding of the size and nature of undeclared work, and to propose a platform where social partners can pool and share knowledge on how to tackle it.' In a direct response to calls from the European Commission and the European Parliament, Eurofound is also launching today an online database with 100 case studies examining effective policies tackling undeclared work. The database is an important first step in producing a comprehensive learning hub for European social policymakers on how best meet the challenges of undeclared work, review evaluations of policy initiatives and explore their feasibility and transferability to other sectors and areas.

Industrial relations and personal services Industrial relations tend to be poorly organised in the personal services industry compared to other sectors. Organising members is equally difficult for both trade unions and employer organisations, due to the small size of most enterprises and the high incidence of – often illegal – self-employment. A new report from Eurofound, Representativeness of the European social partner organisations: Personal services sector, examines social partner organisations in the sector – covering hairdressing and other beauty treatments – to determine how representative these organisations are of key industrial relations actors. Only those associations deemed sufficiently representative of the national bodies may join in European sectoral social dialogue, which takes place in sectoral social dialogue committees. The report seeks to help define the structure and workings of those committees at European level. Polarisation of collective bargaining While collective bargaining is completely absent in around half the countries for which data are available, in those countries where it does take place bargaining coverage tends to be very high, with rates approaching 100%. A clear divide is visible between the EU15 (with the exception of Luxembourg and the UK) and the new Member States (NMS). In the EU15, multi-employer bargaining settlements are prevalent and collective bargaining coverage rates are very high. By contrast, in almost all the NMS, there are no sector-related representative social partner organisations for either side of industry; not even single-employer bargaining arrangements have been set up, with the result that collective bargaining coverage is zero. Low unionisation rates 		 Despite high collective bargaining coverage in most of the EU15, both unionisation rates and overall densities of employer organisations in the sector tend to be low, even in these countries. Low unionisation rates are the result of a number of factors: the high incidence of non-standard work; very high levels of female employment (women being less inclined to organise than men); the small size of most establishments, placing them below the minimum criteria for workplace representation;  high staff turnover, weakening potential stable links to trade unions; and the limited capacity of the trade unions to effectively promote worker interests. The weakness of organised labour results in generally low pay and poorer working conditions – particularly in terms of working time, training, work–life balance and career advancement. Employer representation 	 In a number of countries – especially in the NMS – there is no employer association that meets the definition of a social partner organisation. However, in the absence of such organisations, business interests have organised themselves in the form of trade associations, bodies that deal in matters other than industrial relations. 	 The low levels of employer organisation generally is partly due, as with trade union organisation, to the small size of companies in the sector and the prevalence of self-employment: traditionally, small companies are less willing to gather in associations. Another negative influence on membership strength and density rates may be found in the high degree of fragmentation of the associational systems in a few countries, such as Belgium, Italy and Spain – particularly regarding the representation of small companies.

Director's diary Eurofound is awaiting the arrival on 1 July of its new Deputy Director, Erika Mezger. With a strong background in managing research and working with the social partners, Ms Mezger is ideally suited to help drive the four-year programme and guide Eurofound’s future development. Prior to that, a full agenda awaits. On 22 June, Commissioner for Employment, Equal Opportunities and Social Affairs Vladimír Špidla will address a conference organised by Eurofound under the auspices of the Czech Presidency. The conference will explore the relationship between working conditions and social dialogue, in particular at the level of the workplace, and with reference to the findings of Eurofound’s European Working Conditions Survey. In the same week, Eurofound will contribute to the 17th European Social Services Conference under the Czech Presidency. A special workshop will examine why increasing numbers of young people are receiving incapacity benefits, and discuss measures to retain and recruit them back into the workforce. And, in Brussels, at Employment Week, Eurofound will be contributing its expertise to discussions on skills development and lifelong learning, and the impact of restructuring on the labour market – topics particularly relevant to policymakers seeking positive responses to economic challenges. This month’s publications from Eurofound include a background paper examining the extent to which women have benefited from employment growth since the mid-1990s, and whether this has translated into better-paid, higher quality jobs. Meanwhile, preparation is intensifying for Eurofound’s flagship event, Foundation Forum 2009, which takes place in November.

IN BRIEF News in pictures Erika Mezger, Eurofound’s new Deputy Director, will take up her position on 1 July. News in brief Job growth – breaking the glass ceiling? Over the period 1995–2006, 20 million net new jobs were created in Europe. Women did well from this employment growth, getting the majority of these new jobs. A new report from Eurofound, Patterns of recent employment growth in the EU: implications for gender equality, analyses this jobs growth and examines its effect on gender equality. Of the low-paid jobs created in the EU15, considerably fewer were taken up by men than by women; however, women took many of the well-paid jobs created in the health and education sectors. In the NMS, the most significant employment expansion for women was in the highest income quartile, while for men it was in the second lowest income quartile. Despite this, however, the percentage of workers with a female manager rose overall by only 4% between 1995 and 2005, a comparatively undramatic change given the increase in female employment – including female employment in higher-paid jobs.

The rationale for these initiatives stems from the globalisation of production and of human resource strategies, and the effects of this upon industrial relations. A new report from Eurofound, European and international framework agreements: Practical experiences and strategic approaches, explores the recent phenomenon of transnational agreements, including those solely at European level, and those with a global scope of application. It finds, however, that the contribution made by these agreements to the internationalisation of industrial relations has so far been limited.  Read more on this subject Launch of new report on undeclared work On 1 July, at an invitation-only event in Brussels, Eurofound will launch a new report and a ‘knowledge bank’ of case studies, addressing policy approaches and measures to combat undeclared work in the EU and Norway. Previous Eurofound research has found that, to date, the Member States of the EU have relied heavily on a ‘deterrence approach’, which seeks to increase the actual or perceived likelihood of detection and penalties. It has also become clear that little sharing of successful approaches takes place between the Member States and that evaluation of measures is neither widespread nor coherent. This new report, together with the database of case studies, represents the first step in enabling social partners to pool their experience of how to tackle undeclared work, review evaluations of policy initiatives and explore the possibilities for transferring successful initiatives to other sectors and areas.

IN BRIEF Research in brief Retail trade both winner and loser in job creation The ERM recorded 721 cases of restructuring in the first quarter of 2009, involving 219,390 announced job losses and 89,625 announced job gains. The sectors most affected by job loss were financial intermediation, auto manufacture and the retail trade. Read the ERM quarterly News in brief Spotlight on employment in Turkey Turkey is clearly in the midst of a transition away from an agricultural economy towards one based on services, as a new report from Eurofound makes clear. The report, Quality of work and employment, industrial relations and restructuring in Turkey, maps Turkey’s current status in these respects. However, the informal economy is still hugely important, accounting for nearly 50% of all employment in 2007; moreover, until the start of this decade, Turkey had no explicit employment protection, or unemployment benefit system, in place. The report also looks at the position of women in the Turkish economy: female participation in the labour force has in fact declined slightly since 2000; women working in cities appear to be more educated than their male counterparts, while the opposite is the case in rural areas. The report also sets the context of its analysis, looking at recent political and economic developments in the country. Download the report EIRO updates highlight impacts of economic downturn An overview of some of the latest news updates from Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) illustrates the breadth of issues and national and European concerns captured by the online monitoring instrument. As might be expected, the economic downturn is strongly reflected in industrial relations through the pages of the EIRO site: in Estonia, the crisis has resulted in the minimum wage increase being postponed, following intervention by employer representatives; in the Netherlands, the proposed curbing of bonuses in banking institutions has received broader support in light of economic circumstances; and in the Czech Republic, companies are laying off workers hired during earlier economic expansion. EIRO updates are provided by a network of leading research institutes in Europe, offering news and analysis on European industrial relations. The EIRO database now contains more than 8,000 news and feature articles, as well as comparative studies and annual reviews. Learn more on EIROnline Work starts on fifth working conditions survey Work is starting on Eurofound’s fifth European Working Conditions Survey. Researchers from Eurofound, members of its Board and outside experts are in the process of finalising the questionnaire for the latest wave of the survey. Fieldwork for the survey is set to start early in 2010, involving interviews with over 30,000 workers across Europe. Eurofound has carried out four European working conditions surveys since 1991; the evolution of the survey reflects the EU’s own evolution over the last 15 years, covering just 12 countries in 1991 but 31 in 2005 (the 27 Member States plus Croatia, Turkey, Switzerland and Norway). In line with previous waves of the survey, this fifth iteration will examine quality of work and employment from a range of perspectives. It will also permit a further development of the picture that Eurofound has built up of trends in the European workplace over a 20-year timeframe.  Updates concerning the 5th survey will be posted here on an ongoing basis Joint approaches to coping with restructuring    European law dictates that when a company restructures and sheds jobs, workers and their representatives need to be informed and consulted. In some Member States, however, social dialogue extends to dealing with the consequences of such restructuring. A recently published case study, Joint social partner structures and restructuring: Comparing national approaches, looks at the role played by job security councils in Sweden and the reconversion units created in Belgium. Both structures have successfully sought to help redundant workers cope with job loss and assist them in finding new employment. Key factors for this success are the personalised support for job seekers and the close cooperation of the social partners in the running and supervision of the centres.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1061	2009-04-29	UNK	Press release, 30 April 2009	 Eurofound publishes its European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) for the 1st quarter 2009 Job losses outnumber job creations by almost three to one (DUBLIN, IRELAND) The European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) recorded a total of 721 cases of restructuring in the European Union between 1 January 2009 and 31 March 2009, involving some 220,000 announced job losses and 90,000 announced job gains. The sectors most affected by job loss were financial intermediation, auto manufacture and the retail trade. However, in terms of job creation, retail, and hotels and restaurants figured strongly, in particular discount stores and fast food outlets, which seem to be benefitting from the downturn. Evidence that the global recession is worsening and deepening is showing up in the European Restructuring Monitor. Growth forecasts continue to be revised downwards while predictions regarding the inflection point marking a potential recovery of the global economy are increasingly being moved back to 2010, in some cases later. For the first quarter of 2009, the ERM quarterly has recorded the highest number of announced job losses since it started monitoring restructuring in the EU in 2002. During the first quarter of 2009, 219,390 announced job losses were announced across the EU. The UK recorded the highest number of announced job losses (63,314), followed by Poland (38,975), Germany (17,461) and France (11,779). For the third quarter in a row, auto manufacture is the sector with the greatest reported ERM job loss (23,584 jobs). Other sectors with large restructuring-related job loss were retail (21,740) and financial intermediation (16,778) and machinery manufacture (16,432). Unemployment has also spiked up very sharply in other Member States, notably in the three Baltic Member States (up between 6-9 percentage points over the last twelve months) and Ireland (5 p.p.). While the changes are less dramatic in remaining Member States, data for the most recent three months confirm that unemployment is increasing in nearly all Member States though at a slower pace in member states such as Germany, France, Austria and the Netherlands where there has been widespread recourse to short-time working, partial unemployment and other forms of working time flexibility. One small ray of light in recent ERM data is that levels of announced job creation have grown in each of the last two quarters and are now nearly double the level they were at their recent low point in the third quarter 2008. Of the 89,625 announced job gains in the previous quarter, a significant proportion were in bargain retailers and chain restaurants whose fortunes appear to prosper as those of the economy around them deteriorates. In its latest edition, the quarterly also looks at collective redundancy notification data  as an alternative data source on restructuring and presents some data from a selection of member states (SE, SK, HU).

Director's diary Monitoring performance and progress One of Eurofound’s key strengths is its capacity to respond in a timely manner to an ever-evolving policy agenda. In part, this is due to the organisation’s harnessing its own internal expertise through its annual in-house strategic planning seminars. The next seminar, on 12 May in Dublin, will focus on plans for the 2010 work programme. While the organisation is busy looking ahead to the next steps, it is also obliged to perform regular evaluations of its programmes and activities. Work is now underway on launching an ex-post evaluation of the period 2005–2008 (the previous four-year work programme). This will assess the extent to which Eurofound achieved its objectives, review its effectiveness, impact and added value, and examine what lessons can be learned for improving the organisation’s future performance. Such evaluation is invaluable in ensuring that Eurofound maintains its relevance to current and future social policy agendas, and the coherence of its activities with those of other agencies and the European Commission. At the same time, an external evaluation of Eurofound, on behalf of the European Commission, is taking place as part of an overall evaluation of the EU agencies. This month, Eurofound is visiting its stakeholders in Cyprus, at the invitation of the Cypriot Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance. A highlight of the busy schedule will be a seminar discussing the latest developments in Europe in terms of pay and working time. Eurofound continues to look at positive responses to change, with a case study examing the benefits of cooperation between social partners in creating opportunities for workers affected by redundancy; planning on the next European Working Conditions Survey has advanced to the point that contractor bids have been evaluated; and finally a new report looks at developments in quality of work and employment in Turkey.

ERM – worst jobs results since 2002 Eurofound’s European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) has recorded the highest number of cases of restructuring – and greatest number of announced job losses – since it began monitoring European restructuring activities in 2002. The latest ERM quarterly shows that in the first quarter of 2009, cases of announced job loss outnumbered those of job creation by five to one. In total, 609 cases of announced job loss were recorded, involving around 220,000 jobs. By contrast, only around 130 cases of job creation were recorded, with around 9,000 new jobs announced. Financial intermediation, auto manufacture and the retail trade suffered most in terms of announced job loss. However, the retail trade also featured among those sectors experiencing the most job creation, along with hotels and restaurants: discount stores and fast food outlets have seen the most announced new jobs, with fast-food outlet McDonald’s – for instance – planning to create 12,000 jobs across Europe in 240 new restaurants. This latest edition of the quarterly also looks at collective redundancy notices as an alternative data source and analyses their advantages and disadvantages. Economic woes deepen The ongoing global economic downturn is being reflected in the ERM statistics across the Member States: the number of announced job losses has increased sharply over the last quarter, with around 26,000 more job losses announced than in the previous quarter. These developments are also reflected in the more general economic outlook. Growth projections are being revised downward; recent predictions from the World Bank at the end of March have forecast the first annual contraction of global output in 2009 (by 1.7%) since the Second World War. In the EU, 20 Member States recorded quarter on quarter declines in GDP in the last quarter of 2008 while four recorded increases. The greatest declines were in Ireland (-7.1%), Slovenia (-4.1%) and two of the Baltic Member States, Estonia (-4.3%) and Latvia (-3.9%). Slovakia saw the greatest increase in GDP growth, at +2.1%. Restructuring across sectors The automotive sector has been one of the sectors most affected by announced job loss, reporting the highest numbers of announced job loss for the third quarter in a row (23,584 jobs). Other sectors that have witnessed announcements of large-scale restructuring-related job loss are retail (21,740 jobs to be lost), financial intermediation (16,778 jobs) and machinery manufacture (16,432 jobs). However, of the 89,625 new jobs announced in the quarter, a significant proportion were in bargain retailers and chain restaurants whose fortunes appear to prosper as others around them deteriorate, and customers seek to ‘downshift’ their spending. Exploring new data sources The ERM takes its information on announced job loss and creation from its network of correspondents who create and update factsheets based on announcements in the national press. This method has certain limitations and drawbacks (see the ERM website for notes on the Monitor’s methodology), although there are advantages to capturing announced job losses early in the process. However, other data sources could also yield valuable, complementary information about job loss. In its latest issue, the quarterly studied collective redundancy notifications. Under EU Directive 98/59, all companies planning to lay off employees – subject to certain thresholds – are required to notify national institutions and institute a process of consultation and negotiation to mitigate the effects of the lay-offs. These notifications contain valuable information on the sector, gender, location and other variables affected by the planned redundancies. However, again, these data are limited, as this information is not collected uniformly in all Member States and not always at the same stage of the process. The ERM will continue to further explore these datasets in the future.  Download the latest European Restructuring Monitor quarterly	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-may-2009-0

IN BRIEF News in pictures Second European Quality of Life Survey launched in Prague On 25 March, the overview report for Eurofound’s Second European Quality of Life Survey was launched in Prague under the Czech EU Presidency. Shown discussing the report are (from left to right) Commissioner Vladimír Špidla, Czech Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Petr Nečas and Eurofound’s Director Jorma Karppinen. News in brief Spotlight on working conditions in sectors This month, Eurofound publishes the first in a series of 26 fact sheets, each of which gives a snapshot of working conditions in one of 26 NACE-classified economic sectors. The fact sheets are the result of a statistical analysis carried out on data gathered from the fourth European Working Conditions Survey. Each fact sheet presents a profile of the sector’s sociodemographic characteristics, and of its working conditions, based on data at NACE at 1 and 2-digit level. The first sectors to be examined include agriculture and fishing, food and tobacco, education, wood and paper, mining and quarrying and hotels and restaurants. A number of secondary analyses of the fourth European Working Conditions Survey have already been published, on such themes as gender and working conditions, work organisation, technology and working conditions, and employment security and employability. Download the fact sheets Examining wage formation While some countries in the EU have experienced strong wage growth over the last five years, particularly some of the new Member States, in many others pay moderation  is the key trend. A new report from Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory, Wage formation in the EU, examines a wide range of issues, including the main systems of wage formation, levels of collective bargaining, the key actors, the role of the state and what happens when bargaining fails. The study also examines trends at company level, and finds that there widespread use is made of individualised pay, performance-related pay and other types of variable pay elements. It also finds that while a statutory minimum wage is in place in most European countries, the level at which it is set, the mechanism for uprating it and the extent of coverage all vary substantially. The final section of this report analyses wage formation in the IT sector, a sector characterised by a lack of trade union representation and individualised pay setting. Read the EIRO report Upcoming Integration Forum Eurofound research into integrating migrants in European cities will play a role in a new initiative of the European Commission. The European Forum on Integration, to be launched on 20–21 April, will help European institutions take a comprehensive approach to integration, by bringing together representatives of civil society and of the Commission to discuss the EU’s integration agenda. Central to the Forum’s work will be the European Web Site on Integration, an EU-wide platform designed to facilitate networking and exchanging information on integration policy and practice. Among the information available on the website will be a series of case studies and reports from Eurofound’s research into integration at the municipal level, through the European Network of Cities for Local Integration Policies for Migrants (CLIP). Eurofound will also be actively involved in the Forum itself.  More information at www.integration.eu (to be officially launched on 20 April) Creating alternatives to redundancy   In a recession, the response of many businesses to falling demand is to make workers redundant. However, there are now many examples of state and company initiatives that aim to sustain employment in anticipation of an economic upturn. A new background paper from Eurofound, Europe in recession: Employment initiatives at company and Member State level, outlines three types of initiatives in operation: short-time working, paid/unpaid sabbaticals and ‘pay-for-jobs’ clauses in restructuring agreements. In some countries, temporary state assistance tops up the wages of employees working on reduced hours: around one million German workers, for instance, are benefiting from Kurzarbeit (short-time working) payments. Paid breaks are becoming more popular: in 2007, 37% of UK companies offered sabbaticals to their staff, nearly double the proportion in 2004. And concession bargaining has recently been used to protect jobs, linking withdrawal of redundancy plans to pay freezes or pay cuts.    Read the background paper	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-april-2009-2

Spotlight on the hospital sector Eurofound has just published its seventh representativeness study on sectoral social dialogue. The report, Representativeness of the European social partner organisations: Hospitals sector, examines the role of social partner associations and collective bargaining in European hospitals.  The study, compiled on the basis of individual national reports, finds that social dialogue is active in the hospital sector. At the national level, social partners are well represented, while collective bargaining coverage is higher for the sector than for the national average. At the European level, meanwhile, trade unions enjoy more wide reaching and unified representation than do employer bodies. Previous reports in the series include studies of the railway sector, post and courier services, agriculture and telecommunications. Purpose of the study The effectiveness of European social dialogue depends on whether its participating organisations are sufficiently representative of the relevant industrial relations actors. Therefore, only European social partner associations that are deemed sufficiently representative of the national bodies are allowed to join in European social dialogue, institutionalised through 36 sectoral social dialogue committees. For each committee, Eurofound regularly reviews the representativeness of social partner organisations. This information is revisited every five years and helps in defining the structures and workings of the committees at European level. European-level social dialogue The report finds that social dialogue in the hospital sector – at both European and national levels – is thriving. The social dialogue committee for the hospital committee was established in 2006 with the participation of two European-level organisations, the European Federation of Public Service Unions (EPSU) and the European Hospital and Healthcare Employers’ Association (HOSPEEM). EPSU is considered the sectoral representative for labour at European level, organising most of the largest national trade unions in the sector, and representing the majority of the sector’s unionised employees. Representation of employers’ interests is less far reaching and more diverse. While HOSPEEM is the most important voice for employers in the hospital sector, it has affiliates in only 12 Member States, the remaining 15 not being covered. In six of these countries no employer organisation for hospitals has yet been established while in the remaining nine, although employers are represented at a national level they are not affiliated to any European-level organisation. Representation in the Member States At the national level, social partners in the hospital sector tend to be well represented. On the employers’ side, more than a third of the organisations active in the sector have membership rates close to 100%. Membership in trade unions is also high, especially when compared with other service sectors; however, in many countries employees are represented by a wide range of trade unions represent employees. This diversity of trade union representation may weaken the position of employees in negotiating with employers. Overall, collective bargaining coverage in the hospital sector is higher than the national average in most Member States, indicating the significance of collective agreements and social partnership for regulating employment and working conditions in European hospitals.

Guide to company flexibility practices Corporate experience indicates that companies can most successfully implement internal flexibility measures when they do so in dialogue with employees: such dialogue can harness the adaptability of management and staff – a crucial element in creating both organisational and working time flexibility. However, there is no one way to create this dialogue, just as there is no one idea of what defines ‘flexibility’: companies need to chart their own path to meet their particular requirements. A new report from Eurofound communicates the experience of five major European firms in implementing internal corporate flexibility policies. The Good practice guide to internal flexibility policies in companies provides a detailed overview of the policy context of the wider debate on flexicurity, and draws out its implications for companies; in addition, the lessons drawn from the companies’ experience may provide inspiration and guidance for managers and employee representatives in other companies. Sharing knowledge and experience The guide draws upon the experience of three companies in manufacturing industry – GKN Autostructures, hydraulic systems producer Palfinger, and Saab Microwave systems –  and two in the services sector – Dexia Bank Belgium and Spanish express delivery provider MRW. Representatives of the five companies were key players in a Eurofound company network seminar, held in Brussels on 1–2 October in cooperation with Dexia Bank, to bring together actors to share knowledge and enable capacity building. A key aspect of the discussion was the role of flexibility policies in times of economic crisis. The information shared fed into the production of the guide. Flexibility at company level As part of the flexicurity debate taking place at EU level, an increasing amount of attention is being devoted to how flexibility is implemented at company level. The guide describes various approaches that companies might use to both boost internal flexibility and foster skills development and a better work–life balance among employees. Two key types of flexibility can be found at company level: organisational flexibility and working time flexibility. Organisation flexibility takes the form of flexible work processes and work organisation. Working time flexibility refers to the way in which firms organise their working hours and the options presented to employees for doing so (such as telework, part-time and flexitime working, and working time accounts). Benefits of internal flexibility All of the companies in the study cited very positively the effects of their flexibility policies upon six indicators: productivity, innovation, work–life balance, health, employability, and flexibility. The cases show that each company had a different understanding of the concept of flexibility, and different reasons for introducing it. The particular benefits reaped seem, perhaps not surprisingly, to be closely linked to the company’s reason for implementing flexibility measures. Belgian bank Dexia, for instance, introduced flexibility measures largely to improve their employees’ work–life balance and has seen the greatest benefits in this respect. Company experience makes clear the importance of clearly communicating within the company what is meant by the term ‘flexibility’ and the objectives sought from implementing flexibility practices, as well as the value of integrating these practices with the overall HR strategy.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1068	2009-03-30	UNK	Press releases, 25 March 2009	 Eurofound publishes its Second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS) Health, family and quality of society - the cornerstones of quality of life in Europe (DUBLIN, IRELAND) Most Europeans report health and family life as the key elements contributing to a good quality of life, according to the Second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS), carried out by Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU Agency. The survey, to be launched under the Czech EU Presidency in Prague on 25 March, also reveals that Europeans are generally satisfied with their quality of life despite big variations between both levels of life satisfaction and happiness, especially among the 12 new EU Member States. Europeans rate their life satisfaction at an average score of 7, and happiness at 7.5, on a scale from one to ten.

Director’s diary The start of April finds Eurofound well into its stride in implementing the new 2009–2012 four-year work programme. Following the successful launch of the Second European Quality of Life Survey in Prague in March, work has begun on secondary analysis of the data. The topics chosen for in-depth study include family life and work, subjective well-being, quality of society, social exclusion and quality of life trends. Meanwhile, Eurofound’s collaboration with industry continues to yield results with the publication this month of a guide to good practice in implementing company flexibility policies, as part of Eurofound’s ongoing research into the increasingly pertinent theme of flexicurity. Also in April, Eurofound will visit its stakeholders in Sweden, in advance of the country’s assuming the Presidency of the EU on 1 July. This month, Eurofound’s research into industrial restructuring takes a look at how companies are seeking ways to enable them to retain staff through the current economic downturn. In relation to Eurofound’s ongoing contribution to the CLIP project – assisting Europe’s cities to share information on the integration of migrants – its current work will form part of the European Commission’s new Forum on Integration to be launched this month. Meanwhile, working conditions feature strongly in this month’s output, in the form of a new series of sector-specific fact sheets. Last, but certainly not least, Eurofound is delighted to announce that a new Deputy Director has been appointed – Erika Mezger, a native of Germany, who since 1994 has been Department Head of Research Promotion at the Hans Böckler Foundation in Düsseldorf. Erika Mezger will take up her position in July and we look forward to welcoming her then.

Findings of 2nd EQLS launched While most Europeans are broadly satisfied with their lives, the levels of satisfaction vary markedly between social groups, between Member States and between regions, according to findings from Eurofound’s recently published Second European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS). The survey, conducted in 2007, finds that people with higher incomes, good health, secure jobs and better levels of education are generally more content. Moreover, citizens in the 12 new Member States (NMS12) and the candidate countries are considerably less satisfied with their lives than those in the EU15. The survey overview report, launched in Prague on 25 March, provides a unique insight into the quality of life in 31 European countries and highlights the social and economic challenges the European Union is facing. Since many of the questions asked in the first EQLS in 2003 were asked again this time around, the research team was able to gauge how people’s lives have changed in the intervening period. Income and deprivation The survey, which collected the views of 31,000 Europeans, highlights considerable differences both between and within countries. Income and standard of living are key elements of quality of life. However, people’s standard of living is closely related to the state of their national economy: the survey found that ten times as many people in the low-income candidate countries as in the EU15 are unable to afford most or all of a range of everyday necessities, such as having adequate heat, or being able to afford a holiday. In comparison, in the 12 new EU Member States, five times as many are forced to do without these items. The EQLS also highlights specific instances of deprivation and inequality –  for example in quality of housing or access to health services. Importance of health and family Four out of five people (81%) across the European Union say that health is ‘very important’ for their quality of life. However only 21% of respondents rate their health as ‘very good’. And people – particularly women – in the NMS12 and the three candidate countries are more likely to rate their health as ‘bad or very bad’. For Europeans, the family is still vitally important, for example in terms of caring for children or elderly relatives, and remains the first port of call for personal support in emergencies. In general, Europeans report high levels of satisfaction with their family life. However, the findings show that women still spend more time than men in caring activities and domestic duties. Wide disparities in levels of trust The perceived quality of society is another fundamental element of the multidimensional concept of quality of life. The political and economic impact of the two recent rounds of enlargement is reflected in aspects such as income distribution, trust in institutions and social relations. The level of trust in political institutions is lowest in Poland, Hungary, Lithuania and the Czech Republic among the 12 new EU Member States, and in Italy, Portugal and the UK among the EU15 countries. When asked to rate their level of trust in other people in their country on a scale from one to 10, people in the Nordic countries and the Netherlands express the highest levels of trust. People living in Cyprus express the lowest levels of trust, followed by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. This first overview report will be followed by a series of more detailed reports around key policy themes such as family life and work, subjective well-being, quality of society, social exclusion and trends in quality of life. Full details on the EQLS are available	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-april-2009-0
EUROFOUND_UNK_1071	2009-03-23	UNK	European Quality of Life Survey: Health	 Health Health is a cornerstone to Europeans; four out of five Europeans (81%) said that good health was ‘very important’ for their quality of life. Altogether, only 21% of people rate their health as ‘very good’, while 46% rate it as ‘good’. Also, more people in the 12 new EU Member States and the three candidate countries rate their health as ‘bad or very bad’; this applies in particular to women in these countries. Reporting poor health is, not surprisingly, associated with increasing age: in the EU27, fewer than 2% of people aged between 18 and 34 years report bad health, as against 18% of those aged 65 and over. Access to, and quality of, health care services are important factors for social protection. A substantial number of Europeans, however, report difficulty in accessing health care services. For instance, in the EU27, more than 25% of people report problems because they are too far from their doctor or hospital, more than 38% experience delays in getting medical appointments and more than 27% have difficulty with the expense involved in seeing a doctor.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1074	2009-03-24	UNK	Press release, 25 March 2009	 Eurofound publishes its Second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS) Health, family and quality of society - the cornerstones of quality of life in Europe Most Europeans report health and family life as the key elements contributing to a good quality of life, according to the Second European Quality of Life Survey (2EQLS), carried out by Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU Agency.

Europeans rate their life satisfaction at an average score of 7, and happiness at 7.5, on a scale from one to ten. Four out of five people (81%) across the European Union say that health is very important in determining their quality of life. On the state of their health, more than two out of three people (67%) rate their health as very good or good, one in four (24%) as fair, and one in ten (9%) as bad or very bad. More people in the 12 new EU Member States and the three candidate countries rate their health as ‘bad or very bad’, in particular the women in these countries. Reporting poor health is, not surprisingly, associated with increasing age: in the EU27, fewer than 2% of people aged between 18 and 34 years report bad health, as opposed to 18% of those aged 65 and over. The survey also reveals that a substantial number of Europeans have difficulty in accessing health care services. One in four (25%) report problems because they are too far from their doctor or hospital, while more than two in five (38%) experience delays in getting medical appointments and more than one in four (27%) have difficulty meeting the expense involved in seeing a doctor. Similarly, the survey reveals that family life is also key to quality of life with seven out of ten people in Europe (68.7%) saying a good family life is very important for quality of life. The survey shows that one in three people across the EU27 (30%) report that they are involved in childcare on a daily basis, with small differences between the NMS12 (33%) and the EU15 (29%). In terms of actual time spent, women report spending 33 hours per week, and men over 18 hours, in caring for and educating children. Women also report spending 18 hours per week cooking and doing housework, as against 10 hours per week for men. One in five (20%) in the EU15 feel that they do more than their fair share of housework, and somewhat less (18%) in the NMS12 and in the CC3 (17%). The perceived quality of society is another fundamental element of the multidimensional concept of quality of life. The dimensions of societal – and not only individual – well-being are emphasised in the Lisbon Strategy and are a focus of EU social policy. The political and economic impact of the two recent rounds of enlargement can be seen in the income distribution, trust in institutions and social relations. The level of trust in political institutions is lowest in Poland, Hungary, Lithuania and the Czech Republic among the 12 new EU Member States, and in Italy, Portugal and the UK among the EU15 countries. When asked to rate their level of trust in other people in their country on a scale from one to 10, people in the Nordic countries and the Netherlands express the highest levels of trust. People living in Cyprus express the lowest levels of trust, followed by the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). ‘The challenges arising from social exclusion, unemployment, an ageing population, changing family structures, new gender roles as well as EU enlargement have pushed quality of life issues to the fore in the EU policy debate,’ says Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director. ‘The European Quality of Life Survey documents not only living conditions and the economic circumstances of people in Europe, but also how they feel about them, and about the society in which they live.’ In the EQLS, social relations are examined in terms of tension between groups, as well as attitudes towards migrants. In the EU15, the survey shows that the highest levels of tension between men and women and between the young and the old are found in Luxembourg (23% and 25%), followed by Spain (20% and 19%) and Greece (18% and 21%). At the other end of the scale is Denmark (6% and 5%). Among the 12 new Member States, Hungary stands out in this area (20% and 30%), followed by Bulgaria, Cyprus and Malta. Enabling citizens to develop some balance between family life, personal commitments and working life has become central to the social policy debate. Still, almost half (48%) of citizens in paid employment in the EU27 say that, at least several times a month, they are too tired as a result of their work to do household jobs. The report shows that men and women in the EU27 struggle with work-life balance almost to the same extent. Some 22% of working men state that they are too tired several times a week to do household jobs, while 21% of women report the same problem. Meanwhile, 11% of men find it difficult several times a week to fulfil family responsibilities because of work, as do 10% of women. The survey shows clearly that people’s material conditions, standard of living and well-being strongly depend on income as well as the economic wealth of the country in which they live. According to the EQLS, about one in four households in the CC3 and one in five in the NMS12 were unable to pay their utility bills on time. These figures are considerably higher than for the EU15, where about one in 10 households were unable to pay their bills on time. ‘In this survey, we have face-to-face interviews with 35,000 people in 31 countries across Europe, which were carried out between November 2007 and February 2008,’ says Robert Anderson, Head of Unit, Living Conditions and Quality of Life team at Eurofound. ‘The survey offers a unique and timely insight into the multidimensional concept of quality of life in Europe and provides information about the standard of living and quality of life of Europeans which is essential for policymakers and interested groups whose aims are to seek improvements in that quality of life.’ The full report is available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef0902.htm The survey mapping tool, presenting the data from the report in an easily accessible format, is available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/qualityoflife/eqls/eqls2007/results.htm A resumé is available in all 22 official EU languages at www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef0852.htm A press pack on the Quality of Life Survey is available from http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/press/presspack/eqls2007/index.htm For further information, contact Måns Mårtensson, Press Officer, on email: mma@eurofound.europa.eu, or telephone: +353-1-204 3124 or mobile +353-876-593 507.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1075	2009-03-23	UNK	European Quality of Life Survey: Life Satisfaction	 Life Satisfaction Europeans are generally satisfied with their quality of life, but levels vary considerably across countries. On average, Europeans rate their life satisfaction with a 7, and 7.5 for happiness, on a scale from one to ten. There are, however, big variations between both levels of life satisfaction and happiness, especially among the 12 new EU Member States. Not surprisingly, the survey found that people with higher incomes, good health, secure jobs and higher levels of education are more satisfied, happy and fulfilled. People living with a partner and children also report higher levels of life satisfaction. Click on the small image to see a larger version.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1076	2009-03-23	UNK	European Quality of Life Survey: Income and Deprivation	 Income and Deprivation Income and standard of living are key elements of quality of life. Standards of living and reported well-being of Europeans are closely related to the economy of the country in which they live. The survey found that the proportion of people who suffer multiple deprivations, i.e. those who could not afford five or six of the basic necessities, is five times higher in the 12 new EU Member States than in the former EU15 countries. For the group of three candidate countries the deprivation is even up to ten times higher than that for EU15. Click on the small image to see a larger version.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1077	2009-03-23	UNK	European Quality of Life Survey: Family	 Family Results from the second EQLS emphasise the scale of family involvement in child- and eldercare, and that it remains, for most people, the first port of call for personal support in emergencies; this underlines the quality of family relationships as the most important aspect of quality of life. It is clear, however, that men and women are involved differently in the family. Responsibilities in the household, for example, are not shared equally. Women are more likely to report involvement in caring activities on a daily basis, also spending much more time on domestic duties. In the EU27, women report spending 33 hours per week, and men over 18 hours, in caring for and educating children, while women spend 18 hours per week cooking and doing housework, as against 10 hours per week for men.

IN BRIEF Research in brief Older women in NMS most subject to chronic illness While the rates of reported chronic illness rise markedly with age for all Europeans, older citizens in the NMS12 – and women in particular – are the most disadvantaged, according to the overview report for the Second European Quality of Life Survey, to be published in late March. Note: Question asked ‘Do you have any chronic (long-standing) physical or mental health problem, illness or disability?’ The data show the percentage of respondents who answered ‘yes’. Source: European Quality of Life Survey 2007. News in brief Launching the Second European Quality of Life Survey     People in the Czech Republic rate the quality of their state pension, public transport and education systems higher than on average across the twelve new EU Member States, Eurofound’s experts will tell representatives of the social partners and government in Prague on 24 March next. The tailor-made briefing coincides with the launch of Eurofound’s second European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) on 25 March at the Czech EU Presidency conference on ‘Flexicurity in times of economic crisis’. The survey is a major source of information, highlighting for policymakers and other interested groups the social and economic challenges facing the EU in the wake of the two recent rounds of enlargement. Download the full report from 25 March onwards Calls for wage moderation gather pace The current economic crisis is triggering calls for wage moderation in many Member States, notably in the NMS, which have enjoyed significant wage growth since accession to the EU, as a result of the restructuring of these economies. These are some of the findings from a new report from Eurofound, Wage formation in the EU. The report analyses the systems of wage formation in the EU and goes on to look at the main wage developments of the past five years. It also looks at the implementation of the minimum wage across Europe, and examines wage formation in the information technology (IT) sector, which generally enjoys higher wages than elsewhere in the economy. The report finds that the gender pay gap remains an issue across Europe, and that a majority of the countries studied have a minimum wage that is supported by the social partners. The EIRO report will be available shortly Relocation – someone’s gain is another’s loss? In taking location decisions, multinational companies often play the dual role of villain and hero – blamed for job loss in one location and commended for creating jobs in another. The European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) regularly records job loss and creation due to location decisions. In a recent report, Eurofound has examined 22 relocation cases, covered by the ERM, in more detail. The study aims to identify the factors that influence the location decisions of multinational companies. Most of the companies studied have shifted at least part of their production out of the EU15 countries into the new Member States. They have also built production capacity in Asia in order to seize opportunities in new, growing markets. Labour costs and access to markets are key factors. Another crucial factor appears to be the availability of suitably skilled labour. Where low labour costs are the main spur to relocation, the study concludes that production may depart from a location just as quickly as it arrives if costs begin to rise. For those cases where market access is the driving force behind location decisions, there is no necessary reason why expansion, for example in Asia, should be at the expense of jobs in Europe. Download the ERM report Slowly, but surely – the changing nature of social sectoral dialogue Sectoral social dialogue differs from the traditional sectoral-level collective bargaining in operation within the Member States. The sectoral dialogue committees were created by the Commission and the dynamics at play are of a different nature: they serve as consultative bodies that can potentially influence public policies in Europe, and also as a forum for bilateral discussions and possible agreements between employers and workers across national borders. European sectoral dialogue is increasingly taking the form of producing and adopting joint texts that have been negotiated between the social partners. A new Eurofound study on the Dynamics of European sectoral social dialogue shows that the formulation of such texts and their application is still very uneven and that this depends on a variety of factors. At the same time, however, the research shows that these texts represent subtle forms of mutual learning and dissemination of ideas.    Read the report	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-march-2009-2

Director’s diary Eurofound’s involvement with EU Presidencies has extended and deepened in recent years, and this is set to continue in 2009. During the current Czech Presidency, Eurofound will be presenting research findings at a conference at the end of March in Prague, on ‘Implementing flexicurity in times of crisis’. Just prior to the event, Eurofound will launch the overview report from the Second European Quality of Life Survey. Presenting up-to-date findings on a wide range of quality-of-life issues, the report will be followed later in the year by five reports based on analyses of the findings looking at specific topics in greater detail. In June, Eurofound will host its own conference in Prague, allied with the Presidency, on working conditions and social dialogue. Meanwhile, work begins this month on preparing for Eurofound involvement in the Swedish Presidency in the second half of the year. Fieldwork for another of Eurofound’s flagship surveys is currently underway across 30 countries. The fourth European Company Survey (ECS) 2009 is examining a range of issues, including working time arrangements, pay flexibility, work organisation and human resource management. It focuses in particular on social dialogue in companies, surveying personnel managers and – where available – employee representatives. The first findings of the survey will be published towards the end of 2009. The process of analysis of the findings of Eurofound’s third flagship survey – the fourth European Working Conditions Survey – approaches its end, with the publication of a report on the convergence and divergence of working conditions across Europe. Also this month, the latest issue in the Foundations Findings series is published, addressing the topic of childcare.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1082	2009-03-15	UNK	Press release, 16 March 2009	 Eurofound maps employment measures at company and Member State level: Signs that employers opt for alternatives to redundancy There are signs that EU governments and companies are opting for employment-maintaining initiatives, as opposed to redundancies and lay-offs, as they look to ride out the storm of the current financial chaos. A new report from Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU agency, maps innovative and good practice government and company measures to keep workers in employment. It shows how companies are using short-term working, paid/unpaid sabbaticals and 'pay for jobs' clauses in restructuring agreements and how social partners are reacting to these developments. Many EU governments have short-time compensation programmes in place whereby employers can apply for temporary state assistance to top up the wages of workers working reduced hours. Generally, these programmes are conditional and negotiated agreements between the social partners, subject to specific market conditions and declines in sales levels. The report outlines the workings of the systems in place in Germany, France, the Netherlands and Austria as well as the bill currently being discussed by the Slovenian government. Employers are also looking to retain staff through the economic turbulence: one sign of this being the increase in offers of paid career breaks. Such measures are mainly found in the UK and Ireland according to the report, mainly since company-level initiatives involving both wage and time flexibility are more likely in countries where there are no collective frameworks of agreed working time flexibility. The report also examines why companies prefer to avoid forced job cuts. One reason is certainly the financial cost of redundancies but there is also widespread anecdotal evidence that companies have been chastened by previous experience of downturns where the dismissal of trained and experienced staff undermined efforts to restore levels of production during the recovery phase. In some countries, public schemes to finance temporary layoffs and reduced working times provide an incentive for companies to use these mechanisms. Also, human resource management policy in large firms may be more focused on the medium to long term than previously was the case, where unfavourable demographic profiles in many countries will severely limit labour supply. The report clearly outlines the risks with measures intended to secure the survival of viable businesses through short-term difficulties, and that these may not be so effective in a protracted slowdown.

Spotlight on trends in working conditions In some respects, working conditions are improving across Europe, apparently as a result of a shift away from manufacturing to work in the services sector. For instance, exposure to health hazards has reduced, Europeans are working less at weekends and at night, and workers are enjoying more information and consultation about risks. However, in other respects, the picture is getting worse: in most countries, workers are not given many opportunities for learning and training at work, work intensity is increasing, more work is being carried out on shifts or without fixed schedules, and health-related absenteeism is on the rise. These are some of the findings from Convergence and divergence of working conditions in Europe: 1990–2005, the latest in Eurofound’s secondary analyses of the fourth European Working Conditions Survey. The report looks back over the four waves of the Survey, conducted every five years since 1990, to establish whether the Member States are becoming more similar in terms of their quality of work and employment. Convergence and divergence between Member States The report also looks at how working conditions compare in the new Member States (NMS) and the EU15. It finds that the EU displayed greater divergence following accession of the NMS, these new entrants having less stable working conditions; however, it finds that in the years since accession, the gap has closed somewhat. Within the EU15, working conditions are becoming more similar; however, it appears that they are converging towards an EU15 average rather than towards the optimal: in the United Kingdom and Ireland, for instance, job quality is improving; however, this is balanced by a deterioration of working conditions in the Scandinavian countries. Pointers to boost working conditions The report makes a number of recommendations to boost an overall improvement of working conditions across Europe. In particular, it calls for greater attention to be paid to training and lifelong learning. The lack of training opportunities in the workplace is of particular concern. Despite the emphasis on lifelong learning in the European discourse and policies, and the specific open method of coordination on education and lifelong learning, much progress is needed in order to reach the goals set at Lisbon in 2000. In addition, Member States must be vigilant with regard to work intensification and rising rates of absenteeism. Spotlight on quality of work The successive waves of the survey have looked at quality of work and employment through four main dimensions: career and employment, health and well-being, skills development and work–life balance. Each of these dimensions includes subtopics that together encompass all of the issues covered by the questionnaires (as well as the field of European labour and social policies as a whole). In addition to this report, earlier secondary analyses looked at the gender perspective of working conditions, the working conditions of an ageing workforce, employment security and employability, the impact of technology on working conditions, and types of work organisation.

Childcare in Europe – more efforts needed Good quality, affordable childcare is an essential building block, both in the personal development of a child, and also for parents who seek to reconcile family life and work. On a wider scale, providing decent childcare is an important prerequisite for improving gender equality and increasing employment rates, particularly of women. In its latest edition of Foundation Findings, Childcare in Europe, Eurofound research shows that investing in childcare has had an impact on the sector but that there are significant variations in Member States. Overall, the childcare sector is growing in the EU; however, working conditions vary in terms of employment practices, opening hours and coverage. Across Europe, a lack of availability, high costs and inaccessibility of services often prevail. Research shows that in Member States where the childcare workforce is highly educated and trained, the pay and image of childcare workers tend to be higher. Employment growth in the childcare sector can help to promote equality of opportunity for all children and also boost women’s labour market participation. New childcare targets established during the Barcelona summit in 2002 built on the goals set for female employment rates in the Lisbon Strategy in 2000; in 2008, the Commission’s report on Objectives concerning childcare facilities for pre-school children provided a further boost. During this time, the EU has also provided practical and financial assistance to significantly increase investment in childcare initiatives across the Member States in order to improve the quality of services. No uniform approach National family policies vary widely across Europe, despite the fact that family structures are changing in similar ways. Cultural diversity has also led to varying styles of family policy development, despite most EU Member States dealing with similar problems associated with low fertility, rising child poverty and low employment rates. With regard to younger children, pre-school childhood policies include maternity and parenting benefits. Maternity benefits are some of the oldest family benefits in Europe and exist in all Member States as a result of EU policy directives. However, policy development concerning childcare services for children, especially for school children, is urgently required. Supporting diversity The childcare sector should support a diverse workforce that reflects the diversity of the children in its care. A gender imbalance is evident in the workforce and needs to be tackled sensitively, for example, by creating incentives to recruit more men to work in the sector, and identifying role models who endorse the value of childcare as a career choice. Tackling disadvantages holistically Childcare providers in disadvantaged areas need to consider other actors and approaches. Families living in disadvantaged areas often face a number of problems that are best addressed in a holistic manner, notably by care that works in partnership with other services, such as social services, education and health. The key characteristics of successful out-of-school childcare in disadvantaged areas are public sector support, community involvement and joined-up services.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1087	2009-03-02	UNK	Press release, 3 March 2009	 Eurofound publishes its 2009 programme of work Accent on globalisation, demographic trends and climate change on living and working conditions in Europe Eurofound launches into its new four-year work programme 2009-12 with an ambitious program of high-level events, publications and research projects in 2009. Among them are the publication of the second European Quality of Life Survey, the new European Employment Trends and the first findings of the Second European Company Survey. The fourth Foundation Forum will also take place in 2009, as well as several timely events organised in collaboration with the Czech and Swedish EU Presidencies. Eurofound is set to produce comparative analysis and forward looking studies of the impact of globalisation, technological innovation, demographic trends and climate change on living and working conditions in 2009. Its aim is to help European social policy-makers tackle challenges to create more and better jobs and higher productivity through partnership, to enhance employment growth, supply and demand of labour in changing labour markets, and to promote of social inclusion and sustainable social protection. ‘Eurofound’s new work programme aims to identify practical approaches and best practices to directing changes successfully as Europe moves towards the post-Lisbon era,’ says Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound´s Director. ‘Our intention is to cement our position as a reliable source of high quality information and identify emerging issues for research and debate in Europe. We also want to strengthen Eurofound’s tripartite character and the relationships with our stakeholder organisations.’ The overarching challenge in creating employment is to ensure that the labour market adjustment to the structural change occurs in such a way that, on the one hand, it leads to employment growth and an efficient reallocation of labour to competitive activities and, on the other hand, to the improvement of working and living conditions. Under the heading of Employment growth and demand and supply of labour in changing labour markets, Eurofound will use the monitoring tools and analysis provided by its European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) to provide timely information and analysis of European employment trends with particular emphasis on restructuring and net changes in job quality and quantity. Quality of work and employment are at the heart of the European social policy agenda. The creation and maintenance of a good working environment is of high value for the workers and for the society as a whole, but also a key factor in the productivity of workers and a contributor to higher competitiveness of companies. Therefore, quality of work is also at the centre of social dialogue, especially at enterprise level. Eurofound will offer research findings and analysis from its European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) and the European Working Conditions Observatory (EWCO) in this area over the course of the year. The main thrust in area of promoting social inclusion and sustainable social protection in 2009 will be on extending opportunities for people at all ages to participate actively in both the community and the workplace. New work will pay particular attention to ill-health as a cause of exclusion from employment. The reasons for increasing numbers of young people to be in receipt of incapacity benefits will be explored.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1088	2009-03-04	UNK	Press release, 5 March 2009	 New Foundation Findings focus on ‘Older women workers in Europe’ Family responsibilities main reason for older women’s low activity rates Older women are more likely than men to carry the dual burden of both working and caring where there are care responsibilities in the family, resulting in lower labour market participation for this group according to a new report from Eurofound, the Dublin-based EU agency. It further confirms that while women workers represent an increasing proportion of the workforce, the employment rates of older women remain substantially below those of men in most of the EU Member States and tend to be concentrated in part time work and temporary contracts. Women workers are also concentrated in certain occupational groups, such as care workers, clerical workers and service and sales workers. Sweden continues to have the highest employment rate for older workers aged 55–64 in the EU. It is also the only country where the employment rate of older workers is almost on par with that of the overall employment rate (69.6% compared with 73.1%). Although there is a marked trend of shrinking differences in employment rates between men and women in Europe, the comparison found that the differences between men and women in Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Italy and Spain are still around 20%. In Malta, the difference between men and women is closer to 40%, with just one in three women of working age in employment in that country. ‘Too often, discrimination on account of both gender and age deters older women from entering the labour market’, explains Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director. ‘Companies can encourage older women to return to, and remain in, the workplace through a variety of approaches: creating training opportunities, improving health and safety at work, introducing working conditions that better meet the needs of older workers and actively combating ageism in the workplace.’ The latest issue in the Foundation Findings series, focusing on ‘Older women workers in Europe’, compares female employment structures in 27 countries. The report presents good practice examples in European companies aimed at helping to promote the integration of older people into the labour market. Foundation Findings provide pertinent background information and policy pointers for all actors and interested parties engaged in the current European debate on the future of social policy. The contents are based on Foundation research and reflect its autonomous and tripartite structure.

IN BRIEF Research in brief Announced job losses now exceed job creation Eurofound’s European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) finds that announcements of job loss due to restructuring exceeded announcements of job creation over the last three quarters of 2008. In the final quarter, announced job losses totalled 192,858, while there were 64,426 new jobs announced. As recently as the first quarter of 2008, more new jobs were announced than job losses. Note: the ERM records both the numbers of individual job losses and gains announced, as well as the numbers of cases of announced restructuring involving job loss or job creation. Source: ERM News in brief Comparing working conditions across sectors   Workers in the sectors of agriculture, transport, and hotels and restaurants face the most unfavourable working conditions of all European workers, according to the latest report to emerge from Eurofound’s secondary analysis of its 2005 fourth European Working Conditions Survey. The comparison of 26 sectors also finds that the most favourable conditions are enjoyed by those working in education, insurance and financial intermediation. This last sector also saw the clearest improvements in working conditions over the 10 years between 1995 and 2005; by contrast, unfavourable changes are evident in construction and in hotels and catering. An analysis of country clusters also finds that workers in the southern and eastern European countries experience poorer conditions than their counterparts in Ireland, the UK, Scandinavia and the Netherlands. In addition to the overview report, Eurofound will make its analysis available in 26 fact sheets each dealing with a different economic sector. Read the report Exploring future skills and employment Eurofound’s series of workshops exploring the likely future development of employment and required skills in a selected number of sectors continues in 2009. The workshops form part of a broader project, which comprises 16 studies looking at future skills needs up until 2020. The project is a collaboration between Eurofound, European employers’ and workers’ representatives, the European Commission and other EU institutions. Experts in foresight and scenario analysis and in education and training have also participated. The project aims to stimulate thinking about possible futures and so facilitate adaptation to, and anticipation of, new challenges, as well as helping industry to address skills gaps and improve the strategic management of human resources. The February workshops taking place in Brussels will look at the sectors of post and telecommunications, distribution and trade and financial services. Final results from the study will be available later in the year. Squeezing through the glass ceiling Despite decades of equal opportunity legislation, there are still considerably fewer women than men in managerial positions in Europe, although this gender ‘management gap’ is slowly closing. Where women do occupy managerial positions, they tend to work in the health and education sectors and their subordinates tend to be women; furthermore, women managers tend to occupy lower hierarchical positions than do male managers. These are some of the findings from a new report from Eurofound, Women managers and hierarchical structures in working life, which examines the situation of women in managerial positions in the EU, using data from the fourth European Working Conditions Survey. The report also questions if an individual’s working conditions are influenced by the gender of their immediate supervisor, and finds that it is the subordinate’s gender rather than the manager’s that is significant, female workers reporting less communication with their boss and less autonomy.   Download the report Spotlight on mergers and acquisitions While mergers between companies often result in job losses, the improved financial and business position of the enlarged company can result in job growth in the longer term. A new report from Eurofound’s European Restructuring Monitor, ERM case studies: the consequences of mergers and acquisitions, also finds that employee representatives are only rarely involved in either the decisions leading to a merger or acquisition, and only slightly more frequently involved in the rationalisation discussions following a merger. The report explores the consequences of mergers and acquisitions for both companies and employees on the basis of a series of in-depth company case studies in 26 EU Member States and Norway. Its case studies look at the companies’ reasons for merging, the extent of associated job loss and the actions taken to minimise this, and the subsequent extent of business expansion.    Download the study	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-february-2009-2

Director’s diary Responding to change As 2009 progresses, policymakers are having to respond to rapidly changing economic circumstances. Eurofound is being similarly responsive, reviewing its work in order to provide decision-makers with the most up-to-date and relevant data. For instance, Eurofound’s new season of internal discussion seminars – launched on 12 January – started with a debate on how Eurofound’s work should respond to the current recession; the work programme for 2009–2012 reflects the changed global situation; and the biennial Foundation Forum to be held in November will look at the challenges and opportunities for the European social model posed by current circumstances. On other subjects, the secondary analysis of the fourth European Working Conditions Survey nears completion with the publication of two further reports: a sectoral comparison of working conditions across Europe, and a study on the extent of convergence or divergence of working conditions between Member States over time. The situation of women in the labour market – a key element of EU employment policy – is high on the agenda this month, with the publication of two studies addressing different aspects of women’s working lives. The first looks at the current position of women managers in European workplaces, while the latest issue in the series of Foundation Findings examines measures that can be used to retain older women workers in employment. Finally, this month, as part of Eurofound’s ongoing mission to enhance its efficiency, the organisation is piloting a new electronic document and records management system. The initiative is a key element in developing a culture of knowledge sharing, organisational learning, innovation and creativity.

IN BRIEF News in pictures ‘Living and working in Europe’ exhibition in European Parliament On 1–4 December, Eurofound hosted its ‘Living and Working in Europe’ exhibition in the European Parliament building in Brussels. The exhibition was co-sponsored by Stephen Hughes MEP (pictured right, talking with Eurofound’s Director Jorma Karppinen) and Ria-Oomen Ruijten MEP.   News in brief Fieldwork begins for ECS 2009     In mid-January, fieldwork begins for the European Company Survey 2009 (ECS 2009). The ECS 2009 is the second large-scale organisational survey conducted by Eurofound. It will be carried out in companies in 30 countries – the 27 EU Member States, Croatia, Turkey and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). The survey will look at company policies and practices across Europe. It will also analyse company practices and their impact, focusing in particular on social dialogue. German company TNS Infratest Sozialforschung, in cooperation with a group of experts and national fieldwork institutes, will be responsible for conducting the survey. Data collection will continue over the first quarter of 2009 and the first results are due to be published in autumn 2009. More information on the new survey Asian locations still out-compete NMS      While a majority of the relocations of business from the EU15 to lower-cost new Member States (NMS) appear to be successful in terms of improving competitiveness, in some cases lower-cost Asian locations can still win out. A recently published report by Eurofound’s European Restructuring Monitor (ERM), ERM case studies in Europe: the employment impact, looks in detail at 25 cases of business relocations between Member States, including the extent of consultation with the workforce, reactions from trade unions, and the outcomes in terms of employment of the affected workforce. The report reveals that some locations in the NMS that initially appeared attractive in terms of their low wage costs proved to be otherwise over time, as wages rose following accession to the EU.   Download the study Debate on continuing vocational training in Greece Eurofound, in collaboration with its sister agency CEDEFOP (European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training), is jointly organising a seminar on 9–10 February on ‘The role of social partners in Continuing Vocational Training (CVT) in Europe: Reviewing practices and sharing challenges’. The seminar, to be held in CEDEFOP’s headquarters in Thessaloniki, Greece, will disseminate the results of a joint study between the two agencies, which looks at the contribution of collective bargaining to the development of CVT in Europe. Working sessions will focus on the current role of social partners and the challenges for continuing training provision in Europe. The event will also provide a forum for discussion among the social partners, a key topic being current features of CVT policies in relation to industrial relations models.  More information is available on the seminar Collective bargaining and temporary agency work While in some EU15 countries agency workers are organised in unions, in most Member States a combination of high turnover and minimal trade union membership means that agency workers face a double representation gap in the both the employing company and the agency firm. A new report from Eurofound, Temporary agency work and collective bargaining in the EU, reviews the use of temporary agency work (TAW) in the EU, and examines its regulation through legislation and through collective bargaining. It finds that almost all Member States have sought ways to reconcile employment protection for workers with the greater flexibility that TAW offers to employers – either by legislation, collective bargaining, or a combination of the two. The report also reviews arrangements for social dialogue and collective bargaining in determining length of assignments, the use of temporary agency workers in strikes and in determining equality of treatment in pay, training and other conditions of employment.

Keeping older women in employment Boosting job quality and sustainability, in terms of skills development, employment security and work–life balance, is vital in encouraging older women workers – in particular those aged 55 years and over – to remain in the labour force, according to the latest edition of Eurofound’s Foundation Findings series, Drawing on experience: Older women workers in Europe. In addition, this issue in the Findings series proposes: taking a more gender-equal perspective on labour market policies; the use of more diverse forms of part-time and flexible working time and care leave; and developing greater age-awareness at EU, national and company levels. It also outlines a number of case studies, derived from Eurofound research, that highlight the benefits gained from adopting age-appropriate company policies and practices in terms of training, maintaining workers’ health and capacity for work, and working time measures. Demographic situation and targets Increasing female employment rates and retaining older workers in their jobs are two of the key targets of the European Employment Strategy aimed at maintaining the competitive edge of Europe’s economies and combating the effects of an ageing population. The European workforce faces the prospect of shrinking, as more people retire and leave the labour market than join it. In this context, focusing particular policy attention (at EU, national and company levels) on older women workers is important, as this is the group with the highest proportion of early retirees, and bearing the greatest burden of family responsiblities (which may discourage them from labour market involvement). Gender gaps in employment The Findings outlines the persistence of gender gaps in the labour market across Europe. Despite equal opportunities legislation, the employment situation for men and women still differs substantially across Europe. Employment rates for women remain substantially below those for men in most of the EU Member States, although this disparity is decreasing on an ongoing basis. When employed, women are more likely to work part time, in part because women are more likely than men to take on the dual role of both paid work and unpaid domestic care responsibilities. Moreover, women in employment still earn less than their male colleagues, with this gender pay gap prevailing for both older and younger women workers. Finally, women are still retiring earlier than their male colleagues. All of these factors make employment for women more problematic and less attractive, as well as raising issues in terms of pension provision. The role of companies The findings of Eurofound’s research into good age management in companies demonstrates that many companies have already developed good practice initiatives on how to encourage older workers – both female and male – to return to and remain in the workplace, often with the support of the social partners and national policymakers. Key elements of such initiatives include fostering better job quality and sustainability over the life course. More details of Eurofound’s research into age management at the workplace are available.

Working time – a global perspective Across the industrialised world, working schedules are becoming more flexible, in part because of the growth of employment in services and the extension of operating hours by companies. This extension of working time is leading to an erosion of the demarcation between working life and personal life, especially for workers in higher managerial positions and those in low-paid, low-skilled jobs.  These are some of the findings from a new report by Eurofound, Working time in the EU and other global economies. The report explores the main industrial relations developments – in particular, the regulation and management of working time – in the EU, Japan and the US over the period 2006–2007, and in the emerging economies of Brazil, China and India. The report outlines the economic and employment trends in the context of increasing cross-border interaction, developments in legislation, collective bargaining, social partner organisations, and pay and industrial action. Comparing the EU, US and Japan The report finds that, even in a global economy in which all countries are exposed to similar competitive pressures, the regulatory framework in a country or region and the actions of the social partners still exert a significant influence on work organisation and working time. Hence, there are substantial differences to be seen between the EU, Japan and the US in terms of working time. In the EU, the working week is continuing to shorten, and the importance of working time regulation for trade unions and the demand for working time flexibility by employers have led to extensive joint regulation. In the US, by contrast, working time has been showing a rising trend since the mid-1980s and the proportion of the workforce excluded by the already limited rules on working time is substantial. In Japan, working hours and overtime remain significantly higher than in the US and EU, despite a substantial reduction in recent years and significant efforts on the part of the government and social partners to keep extremely long working hours under control. Impact of legislation The report finds only limited data for Brazil and China, hence only a few conclusions can be drawn with regard to these two economies. What is apparent is that strict legal regulations do not necessarily translate into the effective control of working hours. China has the longest working week of all of the economies under review, despite having relatively strict rules on weekly working time and rest periods. Forms of flexibility Where increasing flexibility takes the form of flexitime arrangements, this gives workers more control over their working time. However, although this is a visible trend in workplaces in the industrialised world, some new features of contemporary working time organisation point in the opposite direction. As is evident in the cases of the US and Japan, flexitime is particularly common in sectors and occupations where exemptions from working hours and overtime regulations are possible and ‘comprehensive working time’ contracts are more widespread. Under such contracts, working time is not recorded and a flat-rate compensation for overtime may be included in workers’ basic pay. Such systems are often associated with work intensification, long working hours, unpaid overtime and greater blurring of working time and personal life.

Spotlight on technology in the workplace It is the working conditions associated with technology in the workplace, rather than the technology itself, that pose risks to worker’s health and well-being. And those workers who use machinery (almost a quarter of all European workers) have less favourable working conditions than computer users or those in workplaces without any technology: such workers run a greater risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders and work-related stress symptoms. These are some of the findings from a new report from Eurofound, Use of technology and working conditions in the European Union. The report examines the relationship between the use of technology, working conditions, and the health and well-being of workers. It also finds that machinery is used more in workplaces in southern and eastern Europe, while computer technology is more widespread in western and Scandinavian countries. Worker autonomy counters stress The research broke the use of technology in the workplace down into four different categories: machinery, computers, a combination of both machinery and computers, and no technology at all. While machine users were at greatest risk, it was found that granting both workers and teams greater autonomy increased the level of learning opportunities and lowered the risk of developing stress symptoms, and hence appeared to counter the negative effects of machine use. In contrast with users of machinery, computer users enjoy better working conditions and greater job satisfaction. Trends across time The findings show to what extent the use of computers has increased across the 27 countries of the Union since 1995 and how overall there are fewer workers working in workplaces without any technology or computers than in 1995. This trend is not, however, uniform across the EU: technological development in 2005 appeared to be at an earlier stage in eastern Europe than in the Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands. Examining working conditions across Europe The report is based on research findings from Eurofound’s fourth European Working Conditions Survey. The survey questioned around 30,000 workers in 31 countries on such issues as work organisation, working time, equal opportunities, training, health and safety and job satisfaction. Following the publication of the main overview report, a series of thematic reports based on secondary analysis of the data provided more in-depth examinations of key themes from the survey. Besides the theme of technology, other reports have looked at the working conditions of older workers and those of women workers, work organisation and employment security and employability. Forthcoming reports will look at: working time and work intensity convergence and divergence in Europe sectoral perspectives on working conditions.

Better integration for migrants On 13 November, Eurofound launched a new resource pack on migration and geographical mobility at a briefing of think tanks in Brussels. The pack examines migration patterns and looks at the opportunities and challenges that migrants face abroad. It contains a series of factsheets highlighting the policy context of migration, policy responses and main findings, along with reports and résumés that examine the theme in more detail.  Organised by Eurofound in collaboration with Gisella Kallenbach MEP, the briefing – ‘Managing migration at the local level – Testing solutions for fuelling integration’ – opened a forum for representatives of EU think tanks and civil society to discuss research findings on the issue of migration with policymakers and social partners. Key areas for investigation included the integration of migrants, the working conditions of migrants, and the availability of opportunities for their career development. Policy challenges of migration Eurofound’s new resource pack, East, west, home is best? Migration in Europe, is the latest in this popular series of Eurofound publications. Part of Eurofound’s ongoing work in communicating findings from social policy research to a wider audience, the packs draw their themes from priority European policy areas. The factsheets included in the pack examine the extent of current migration into and across Europe and likely future trends; they look at where migrants work, and their employment and working conditions; and they discuss the issue of integration, describing some of the policy initiatives taken at municipal level. The resource pack also contains the latest issue of Eurofound’s magazine Foundation Focus, ‘ Should I stay or should I go?’, which is dedicated to the topic of migration. Role of cities and local authorities The economic, social and cultural integration of migrants presents both an opportunity and a challenge for all EU Member States. In particular, cities, local authorities and civil society organisations have a pivotal role to play in developing integration policies. They can benefit from sharing the experiences of Member States and cities that are already further down the road of integration, and which have adopted approaches that have proved successful. Key elements of integration include the provision of decent housing in a non-segregationist manner, an employment policy approach by municipalities to facilitate greater diversity, and the provision of municipal services that meet the particular needs of migrants. German cities exchange experiences Interest in migration and demand for practical information and advice on the issue remains strong. On 18 November, the city of Frankfurt organised a one-day seminar on diversity policy for representatives of local authorities from a number of German-speaking cities, in close cooperation with Eurofound, the Heinrich Böll Foundation (Berlin) and the Robert Bosch Foundation (Stuttgart). Policymakers, social partners and administrators in local authorities and representatives of NGOs came together to exchange experiences on diversity policy and practices.

Forging links with the Parliament Over the course of 2008, Eurofound has been strengthening its ties with the European Parliament through a range of activities – addressing committee hearings, hosting briefing sessions, and producing customised background reports on a number of topics, including migrant workers, undeclared work and flexicurity. One of the highlights of the year was a thought-provoking exhibition, which ran for four days in the Parliament’s Brussels premises in December; over the course of the exhibition, Eurofound research experts provided thematic briefings to update MEPs and staff on topical issues from Eurofound research.   The exhibition was accompanied by the publication of an overview on Living and working in Europe, which paints a unique picture of the current situation of European citizens, based on recent Eurofound research. Later in the month, representatives of a group of MEPs in the Parliament paid a visit to Eurofound’s premises in Dublin. Thought-provoking exhibition The Eurofound exhibition asked a number of pointed questions – ‘Don’t you just love your job?’ ‘Do you see enough of your children?’ ‘Seen a doctor lately?’ – all highly relevant to the lives of ordinary Europeans, to which Eurofound research provided answers based on survey results and research analysis. Open briefings, delivered by Eurofound research experts in cooperation with MEPs, provided the opportunity for discussion and exchange of views on such topics as working time, flexicurity, European Works Councils, active ageing and migration. Delivering timely information The exhibition was the culmination of a year that saw constant interaction with the Parliament – a key information user of Eurofound research – particularly in the form of Eurofound’s customised reports, occasional papers dealing with key themes and created for core stakeholders on request. Through these reports, Eurofound has provided Parliament discussions with timely contributions on a range of issues, from revisions to the Working Time Directive to violence in the education sector and the quality of work of women and men. MEPs visit Eurofound In the wake of the Brussels exhibition, on 8 December, Stephen Hughes, PSE Coordinator in the EMPL Committee and Joel Hasse-Ferreira, Member of EMPL Committee, representing the Socialist Group in the Parliament, visited the Eurofound premises. Eurofound research experts briefed them on the latest data from the key areas of restructuring and industrial change; in addition, an exchange of ideas took place on how Eurofound research can be used and targeted to reach relevant policymakers.

Director’s diary Looking ahead to a new year January sees the start of Eurofound’s new work programme for 2009–2012: ‘Europe at work: Better opportunities for all’. The programme will cover three broad research areas: ‘Employment growth and management of demand and supply of labour’, ‘More and better jobs and productivity through partnership’ and ‘Promotion of social inclusion and sustainable social protection’. In particular, it will examine the impact of the key drivers of change – globalisation, technology, demography and climate change – on living and working conditions in Europe. As part of the new work programme, Eurofound will also be introducing more ad hoc and customised research in response to emerging issues, aimed at meeting the specific information needs of key users. In the middle of January, fieldwork will begin on the European Company Survey 2009, Eurofound’s second pan-European organisational survey. Plans are being made for Eurofound’s involvement in three key conferences as part of the Czech Presidency: on the social and labour market inclusion of migrants, flexicurity and social protection, and upskilling in response to patterns of employment change. In the autumn, Eurofound plans to launch a new initiative, European Employment Trends (EET), which will look at patterns of change of employment and wage structure across the Union. Preparations are also already underway for the fourth Foundation Forum, to be held in Dublin in November as part of a wide-scale programme of events planned for 2009. In addition, Eurofound’s ongoing collaboration with other EU agencies will in the coming year be expanded to include the European Fundamental Rights Agency and the European Institute for Gender Equality.

First findings of new Quality of Life Survey How do Europeans feel about their family life? Are they able to juggle work and family commitments? Are they happy with their living conditions? Eurofound is well placed to answer these questions following the launch of the first findings of its second European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS). The survey provides a unique insight into the quality of life in 31 European countries and highlights the social and economic challenges facing the EU at the moment. The survey findings emphasise the vital role of family in the lives of Europeans: 70% state that a good family life is a crucial factor in their quality of life. The findings also highlight specific instances of deprivation and inequality both between and within countries – for example, in terms of the quality of housing and access to health services. The main results of the survey will be published in spring 2009, followed by the publication of a series of detailed reports around key policy themes. Wide differences across Europe ‘Quality of life’ takes into account a range of policy interests, and the survey set out to map and analyse the disparities associated with age, gender, health, income, social class and region. The first results of the EQLS show that differences between Member States that joined the EU before 2004 and those that joined later are still apparent, but that significant variations also exist within these country groupings and within individual countries. Family life central to Europeans As already indicated, family plays a central role in the lives of Europeans. With family being the key source of support for most people, it follows that people often report problems in reconciling their family responsibilities with the demands of employment. In this respect, there is a real need for new developments in workplace policies as well as in local services. Quality of public services In general, Europeans are more satisfied with family and personal life than with essential public services. A high proportion of people report difficulties in accessing health services and have concerns about the quality of health and care services. Older citizens in the new Member States in particular are shown to have poor health and significant levels of disability. This points to a key challenge for policy makers, particularly in the context of an ageing Europe. Social cohesion under strain The quality of society, both in the local area and more generally, is a fundamental element in quality of life. The EQLS results regarding trust in people and the perception of societal tensions emphasise the urgent need to address issues of social relations and social cohesion. While social change is generally slow and difficult, it faces increasing challenges in the current climate of economic turmoil, with the growing risk of social exclusion.

IN BRIEF Research in brief Actual working week is longer across Europe In 2007, the actual working week was longer than the average collectively agreed working week in all Member States apart from Greece and Ireland. Note:Figures for BE, IE, FI and LU are from third quarter, 2007. Source: Eurostat, based on its labour force survey for the fourth quarter of 2007, with averages calculated by EIRO. Download the study on Working time developments - 2007 News in brief Benefits of life-course policies For many European citizens, the traditional life course of finishing education, moving into employment, raising a family and – finally – retiring, no longer applies. Increasingly, people swap periods of education and work, or combine paid work with raising children or caring for elderly relatives. These new patterns of time use can, however, result in discontinuities and greater uncertainty, giving rise to the need for life-course policies, which take a long-term view and help anticipate and manage risks. A new report from Eurofound, Flexibility and security over the life course: Key findings and policy messages, lists key policy recommendations from the perspective of the individual, the company and the state and national systems and provides useful guidance for creating strategies that help citizens to synchronise and manage a variety of choices across their different life phases, while still participating in paid work. Read the full report Working conditions in Greece lag behind       Greek workers are more exposed to work intensity than their counterparts in other European countries, Eurofound research experts told policymakers during a two-day visit to Athens on 15–16 September. A high proportion of Greek workers work at very high speed and to tight deadlines (73.3% and 68.4% respectively), as against an EU average of 59.6% and 61.8%. The visit was part of Eurofound’s roadshow programme, which aims to deepen relations with Eurofound’s stakeholders and to present new research findings, data and analysis from a national perspective. Bilateral meetings with representatives of the Greek Ministry of Employment and Social Protection, the SEV Hellenic Federation of Enterprises, and the trade union GSEE focused on working conditions, policies for older workers, pay and wage flexibility. Eurofound’s next roadshow visit will be to Sweden in November. For further information, go to www.eurofound.europa.eu/events/visits.htm New flexicurity resource pack launched in Lyons On 2–3 October, at a conference in Lyons, supported by the French Presidency and hosted jointly with ANACT  – ‘Quality of work in Europe: 2010 and beyond’ – Eurofound launched the third in its series of resource packs. The resource pack, entitled Flexicurity – it takes three to tango, will be a ‘one-stop shop’ for those seeking details of Eurofound’s research into the issue. Part of Eurofound’s ongoing work in communicating findings from social policy research to a wider audience, the packs draw their themes from priority European policy areas. As with the previous packs (addressing the themes of the ageing workforce, and globalisation), the flexicurity pack contains a series of factsheets highlighting the policy context, policy responses and main findings, along with reports and résumés that examine the theme in more detail. The next pack, to be launched in November, will address the issue of migration. Access the pack at www.eurofound.europa.eu Eurofound web changes   Regular users of the Eurofound website will have noticed some changes in recent weeks, starting with a new process for logging in on the home page.

Director’s diary Eurofound has taken a decisive step towards launching its next four-year work programme, ‘Europe at work: Better life and opportunities for all’. At its recent meeting in Dublin, the organisation’s Governing Board adopted the four-year programme which will run from 2009 to 2012. The programme will closely link Eurofound’s research and communication activities to European policy responses to the major drivers of change. Since the start of the French Presidency of the EU, Eurofound has been contributing research findings and expertise at a number of events. On 13 November, Eurofound made available its research findings and expert analysis on the subject of gender equality in employment in a customised report prepared specifically for a Presidency conference in Lille. On 19 November, Eurofound launched the first findings of its second European Quality of Life Survey with a résumé of key results. The survey is one of Eurofound’s key research activities, and its findings have been eagerly anticipated. The main descriptive report will be published in spring 2009, and in-depth secondary analysis will also begin next year. Eurofound continues its ongoing collaboration with the European Parliament. On 5 November, research experts presented a recent study on liability in subcontracting in the construction sector at a public hearing in the European Parliament; on 13 November, Eurofound launched a resource pack on migration at a hearing for MEPs; and on 1–4 December, Eurofound will organise an exhibition entitled ‘Living and Working in Europe’ at the Parliament’s premises in Brussels. Meanwhile, involvement with key international players in socioeconomic research is ongoing: at the end of November, in cooperation with the OECD, Eurofound will examine issues in industrial relations, from a global perspective, in Paris.

IN BRIEF Research in brief Stark differences in deprivation across Europe The EQLS asked citizens how many items from a range of six items they were unable to afford. By this measure, substantial differences are visible. In some of the poorest countries among the CC3 and the NMS12, the higher income earners are still more deprived than the poorer citizens in some of the EU15. The disparity also varies substantially within countries: for example, in Romania, the poorest citizens are on average deprived of four of the essential items, while the richest are deprived of only one. Note: The deprivation index runs from none (for no items missing) to six (for all six items missing). Items were: adequate home heating, an annual holiday, new furniture to replace worn-out items, a meal with meat every second day, new clothes, the means to entertain guests at home). Source: second European Quality of Life Survey, Eurofound 2007 News in brief Living and working exhibition in European Parliament With the cooperation of MEPs Stephen Hughes and Ria-Oomen Ruijten, Eurofound will be holding an exhibition, entitled ‘Living and Working in Europe’, in the European Parliament on 1–4 December. The exhibition will present an overview of some of Eurofound’s key research findings from across the organisation, looking at living and working conditions, the impact of restructuring, demographic change and migration, and the role played by the social partners in these issues; it will also provide a forum allowing Eurofound to engage more fully with its stakeholders in the European Parliament. As well as the exhibition itself, a series of thematic briefings will address the issues of active ageing, European Works Councils, flexicurity and migration. Working time will also be addressed – a key theme in light of the upcoming EP debate on the Working Time Directive. More information on this event. Examining company flexibility practices Company practices in terms of workplace flexibility need to be more in tune with the macroeconomic aspects of flexibility. This was a key conclusion of Eurofound’s final company network seminar, which took place in the headquarters of Dexia Bank in Brussels on 1–2 October. The event addressed the theme ‘Flexibility policies at the company level: a common interest?’. It set out to understand the role of internal flexibility practices at the company level by exploring examples of Human Resources policies in a number of European companies. These examples concerned working time flexibility and organisational flexibility. An output of the seminar will be a guide to good practice on flexibility policies in companies, to be published in early 2009. Speakers' presentations are available Industrial relations on a global scale On 27–28 November, in cooperation with the OECD, Eurofound will host a discussion on the state of global industrial relations in the framework of its annual seminar on industrial relations in a global perspective. The event, ‘Industrial relations in the EU and other global and emerging economies’, will take place in the OECD headquarters in Paris. It will focus on the issues of minimum wages and wage flexibility, and the role played by the social partners in wage developments in the EU and in its key global competitors, including Brazil, China, India, Japan and the US. A central aspect of the seminar will be the role and importance of a sectoral approach. Representatives of the ILO, the OECD and the social partners will attend, as well as research experts from many of the countries involved.  Read more on this event Spotlight on liability in the construction sector Overall, the rules governing liability in subcontracting processes in the European construction sector appear to be largely effective in achieving their aims: preventing the abuse of employees’ rights and social dumping, ensuring adherence to regulations, and combating undeclared work and illegal or unfair business competition. In addition, the involvement of the social partners in developing and implementing the rules is a key feature of good practice across Europe. These are some of the key conclusions from research findings presented by Eurofound to the European Parliament in a public hearing on 5 November. The findings are drawn from a comparative report, Liability in subcontracting processes in the European construction sector, which sets out to analyse the legislation in place in the eight Member States that have developed regulations in this field. The report is supplemented by national reports, which analyse the aims and origins of national legislation, and the various types of existing arrangements.

Integration and diversity in local authorities Addressing the needs of migrant residents is high on the agenda of many European cities. Sefton, in the UK, has set up a forum to facilitate the reporting of racist and hate crime; Amsterdam has involved members of its migrant communities in delivering healthcare services; and Frankfurt has broadened the scope of its job advertising to target migrant communities.     These are just some examples of good practice outlined in a new report from Eurofound and the Council of Europe: Equality and diversity in jobs and services: City policies for migrants in Europe. The report looks at how European cities are working to ensure greater equality in their employment practices, and to better meet the needs of migrants in services provision. The outcome of the latest research programme by the European Network of Cities for Local Integration Policy for Migrants (CLIP), the report sets out recommendations for policymakers at EU, national and municipal level. Background to the CLIP network Launched in September 2006 by the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe, the city of Stuttgart and Eurofound, the CLIP network aims to help local authorities learn from one another’s experience and so deliver a more effective integration policy for migrants. The initiative brings together 25 European cities in a joint learning process that will continue over several years. Role of municipalities in integration process Because municipalities are often one of the largest employers in the local area, they are a key source of employments for migrants – whether first or second generation. Furthermore, because they are also responsible for the provision of many of the services most important to migrant integration, such as education, housing and health care, they have greater control over their own personnel policy and services than over other levers that may promote integration. The cities in the CLIP network have been active in launching a range of initiatives: recognising extra-EU qualifications; consulting and collaborating with partner organisations; monitoring the outcomes of their municipal employment and service provision practices; setting up mechanisms for addressing complaints; and adapting services to meet migrants’ particular needs. Recommendations for policymakers at all levels In addition to detailing such initiatives, the report also recommends a range of actions that policymakers could take to improve employment practices and service provision throughout Europe. For instance, at EU-level, there could be better guidance on the courses of action open to municipalities within the constraints of EU law, the legal restrictions on access by non-EEA nationals to municipal jobs could be reviewed, and cooperation between the institutions of the EU could be improved. National governments could require their cities to  promote equality of opportunity, and revise the processes they use for validating foreign qualifications. Cities themselves could ensure that better policies and practices are promoted as an overall strategy, set up effective monitoring systems, and improve the provision of advice, information services and language tuition to migrants.

Europe creates better jobs Creating more and better jobs is a cornerstone of the European Employment Strategy. To date, it has been difficult to verify how successful this strategy has been. While  employment rates have risen in recent years, it is difficult to determine the quality of these new jobs. The ERM annual report for 2008 from Eurofound – More and better jobs: Patterns of employment expansion in Europe – can for the first time provide insights into the quality of the jobs created.         The report concludes that, overall, most EU Member States did generate more and better jobs in the decade after 1995 (especially some of the EU15 countries), and that women benefited most from this job creation. However, many of the low-paid jobs created in the EU15 were either part time or fixed-term contract status, and over the period there was widespread loss of unskilled employment in agriculture and manufacturing in nearly all EU Member States. Job creation in the EU15 The report analyses the quality of the jobs created over the period, and investigates which groups of workers profited most and which least. Most of the ‘good jobs’ (measured in terms of pay) created in the EU15 were in knowledge-intensive services –  largely business services, health and education. The expansion of services also generated many jobs at the bottom of the employment structure. However, net job creation at the bottom was still relatively low in most countries, because so many low-paid jobs were lost in agriculture and manufacturing. Nor is the picture uniform across the EU15. Ireland, Denmark, Finland, Luxemburg and Sweden (and, to a lesser extent, Portugal) managed to generate large numbers of jobs and most of them were of above average quality. However, other countries – Spain and Greece – created substantial employment, but in the middle rather than at the top of the employment structure. Job creation in the NMS For the NMS, it is more difficult to classify patterns of job creation. In general, the NMS did not show such a clear improvement in the employment structure as was evident in the EU15, although there was no fall-off either. What does emerge, however, is that while only a few very high-paid jobs were created in manufacturing in the EU15, in central European new Member States there was quite substantial creation of jobs in this sector, but in the middle of the employment structure. Benefits not evenly spread The overall picture that emerges is certainly very positive, broadly in line with the overall objectives of the Lisbon Agenda – more and better jobs, more opportunities for women and a shift towards the knowledge economy. But not everyone has profited. For low-skilled workers, there are fewer job opportunities, as these kinds of jobs are disappearing or become more precarious. Furthermore, the gap in the middle of the employment structure also means it is difficult for those low-skilled workers to progress further in employment. Such trends highlight the need to establish policies to support these groups of workers.

Autonomy and learning at work The widespread adoption of  so-called ‘discretionary-learning’ forms of work organisation – characterised by autonomy, learning and problem-solving, task complexity, self-assessment of the quality of work carried out and autonomous teamwork – could result in workers enjoying less work intensity, less exposure to physical risks, fewer non-standard hours, a better work–life balance and less work-related ill-health. This is one of the key conclusions to emerge from a new report from Eurofound, Working conditions in the European Union: Work organisation, which recommends that greater attention be paid to the economic and social impacts of work organisation. The report maps the main forms of work organisation across the EU, examines the characteristics that define the four key types of work organisation and explores the relationships between work organisation and the various dimensions of quality of work and employment. Mapping work organisation in Europe The report, one of a series of secondary analyses of the findings from the fourth European Working Conditions Survey carried out in 2005, identifies three other key forms of work organisation. ‘Lean production’ is characterised by a high level of teamwork and job rotation, and self-assessment of quality of work and of quality norms. ‘Taylorist’ work organisation has largely the opposite characteristics of discretionary-learning forms, with low levels of autonomy, little opportunity for learning on the job, substantial external constraints on the pace of work and high levels of monotony and repetitiveness. Finally, ‘traditional’ forms are largely informal, with simple organisational structures. Benefits of learning-oriented work organisation Discretionary-learning forms of work organisation are associated with greater perceived intrinsic rewards from work, greater overall employee satisfaction with working conditions, and better social integration at work. They are also characterised by human resource management practices that emphasise employer-provided training, incentive pay systems, security of tenure, and more involvement of employees in work-related discussions and consultation. These forms of work organisation are more highly developed in the services sectors, are more prevalent among senior managers, professionals and technicians, and are most developed in Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands. Developing innovative forms of work organisation The report goes on to propose four indicators, which could be used to monitor the progress that Member States are making in developing innovative forms of work organisation: the percentage of employees learning new things in their job; the percentage of employees involved in problem solving in their job; a composite measure of autonomy at work, based on the percentage of employees exercising control over their work method, pace of work, or the order in which they perform tasks; the number of employees working in autonomous teams that can decide on the division of tasks, as a percentage of the number of all employees working in teams.

Director’s diary October is a busy month for Eurofound. On 2–3 October, the latest in Eurofound’s popular series of resource packs – this one addressing the issue of flexicurity – will be launched at a joint conference with ANACT, looking at future work challenges. On 8 October, the annual report of the European Restructuring Monitor will be launched at a working breakfast for MEPs, at which the issues of restructuring, job loss and job creation will be discussed. On 17 October, the Governing Board meets at Eurofound’s offices in Dublin; top of the agenda is the draft four-year work programme for 2009–2012. Attending the meeting for the first time will be the Board’s newest member – Anne Coleman Dunne from the Irish government’s Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. We would like to welcome her to Eurofound. October also sees the publication of findings from the second module of the CLIP network’s programme of research into the integration of migrants in cities. As with the previous report on housing, this report – which examines good practice in municipal employment and service provision – is jointly published by Eurofound and the Council of Europe, a successful collaboration that we look forward to continuing. In addition, another analysis of the fourth European Working Conditions Survey is concluded with the publication of a report looking at the relationship between the use of technology and working conditions, pointing to potential risks to the health and safety of European workers. Finally, this month Eurofound bids farewell to Timo Kauppinen, research manager in the Employment and Competitiveness unit. Timo is retiring after eight years in Eurofound, where he has worked on a range of projects including capacity building in social dialogue, and industrial relations forecasting. We wish him a long and happy retirement. Jorma Karppinen Director	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-october-2008-1

IN BRIEF Research in brief Poland is the leader in job creation In both the first and seconds quarters of 2008, Polish companies announced the creation of the most new jobs: 37,822 new jobs in more than 54 cases, according to the latest quarterly report from Eurofound’s European Restructuring Monitor (ERM). The Czech Republic (5,720), the UK (5,415) and Romania (4,960) were next on the list. Particularly significant announcements of business expansion were made by Peugeot (5,000 jobs reported created), Karbonia PL (3,000 jobs), Daimler (3,000 jobs) and Alior Bank (3,500 jobs). Note: No cases of job creation were reported in FI, LT, NL and NO; no data for BE, LU or LV. Source: European Restructuring Monitor, 1 April–30 June 2008 Download the ERM quarterly Issue 2 - summer 2008 News in brief Quality of work: looking to the future While work remains a constant for nearly all EU citizens, the way in which Europeans work has changed significantly over the last 30 years and will continue to do so into the future. Workers and managers, employer organisations and trade unions, all need strategies to meet these changes and the challenges they bring. A conference jointly organised by the French Agence Nationale pour l’Amélioration des Conditions de Travail (ANACT) and Eurofound, under the auspices of the French Presidency, will bring together social partners, public officials, human resources managers and others to debate the issues and exchange experiences. At the conference entitled ‘Quality of work in Europe: 2010 and beyond’, due to take place in Lyons on 2–3 October, speakers will address questions on the relationship of work to society and the economy, and explore the prospects for the future. More information on this event Spotlight on childcare provision for Turkish women A female employment rate of about 25%, which drops to between 16% and 18% in urban centres where childcare is less likely to be provided by the extended family, is indicative of some of the challenges that women face in Turkey. A conference jointly organised by Eurofound and the Turkish government in Ankara on 5 June, ‘Families and childcare services’, set out to compare the situation regarding families and childcare services in Turkey with that of the EU Member States. The conference report concludes that no European country has yet achieved full equality for women in terms of employment or pay. More proactive labour and social policies in favour of women, particularly in the area of childcare are needed. The Nordic countries provide good practice examples which could inspire Turkey as well as many EU Member States.    Read the conference report at  www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef0867.htm Teachers at risk from workplace violence Workers in the European education sector, particularly teachers, are exposed to higher levels of workplace violence of all types (threats of violence, actual physical violence, and bullying and harassment) than the average European worker. Furthermore, workers in the sector are also more likely to report having the psychosomatic symptoms associated with workplace violence, and to take more health-related leave. These are some of the conclusions from a new background paper from Eurofound, ‘Violence in the education sector’, drafted in response to a request from the European Trade Union Committee for Education. Data, taken principally from Eurofound’s fourth European Working Conditions Survey, indicate that a high proportion (more than 20%) of teachers in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, Luxembourg and the UK report being exposed to threats of physical violence. Find out more about Eurofound’s background papers Low levels of industrial action overall in Europe The first years of the 21st century in Europe have been characterised by relative industrial peace, according to a new study from Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO), entitled Developments in industrial action 2003–2007. However, while overall levels of industrial action were low in historical terms, there were considerable variations between countries. The most ‘strike-prone’ countries included Belgium, France and Spain, while Latvia and Lithuania were essentially strike-free. The level of action in the new Member States was only about a quarter of that in the former EU15; however, some new Member States have begun to see a rise in strike activity in recent times. Industry and manufacturing were the sectors most prone to conflict, followed by transport and communications, and the broad public sector. The most common cause of industrial action was disputes over pay. Read the full report online 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-september-2008-2

Director’s diary September marks a return to normal business after the summer holiday period. Over the summer, however, Eurofound continued to be busy, publishing a number of periodic reports on key elements of working life and socioeconomic progress. The annual update on pay from the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO), Pay developments – 2007, reports  ongoing moderation in pay increases in the countries of the former EU15, but a sharp increase in pay levels in the new Member States (NMS), average increases being almost four times those in the EU15. The summer issue of the European restructuring monitor quarterly, covering the second quarter of 2008, reveals that the motor industry is the No. 1 sector in Europe for new employment opportunities, the majority of new jobs being created in Poland and other eastern European Member States. Meanwhile, Eurofound continues to strengthen its involvement with its stakeholders in debate and discussion activities. In September it will have a significant presence in events for the French Presidency (see events listing overleaf). Furthermore, the Greek government has requested that Eurofound facilitate discussion on the themes of productivity and competitiveness as part of its first roadshow visit to Greece, on 16–17 September. Secondary analysis of the findings of the fourth European Working Conditions Survey continues, with the forthcoming publication of a report on work organisation; the report notes the extent of discretionary-learning types of work organisation across Europe, with positive implications for the quality of work and employment. Meanwhile, Eurofound continues to expand its coverage of global developments, with the publication of its report on Working time in the EU and other global economies.

Significant divide in working times There is still a substantial gap in weekly hours worked between the former EU15 and the 12 new EU Member States (NMS), according to the annual update on working time from Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). During the period under review, no significant reductions in working time took place.    The report, Working time developments – 2007, which looks at collectively agreed working times, finds that the average collectively agreed working week fell very slightly from 38.7 hours in 2006 to 38.6 hours in 2007. However, in the EU15, the 2007 average was 37.9 hours per week, while in the 12 new Member States (NMS) it was 39.6 hours. The update also finds that the average collectively agreed paid annual leave entitlement for European workers in 2007 was 25.2 days. However, this average masks large variations between countries, with workers in the EU15 enjoying better leave provision. Length of working week largely unchanged According to the report, average collectively agreed normal working time has remained static overall in five of the former EU15 countries and Norway, and has fallen by less than an hour per week in three of these. Over the period from 1999 to 2007, the length of the average agreed working week in EU15 and Norway decreased  only slightly – from 38.6 to 37.8, a reduction of 2.1%. Reductions of an hour or more have taken place in Luxembourg (1.0 hour), the UK (1.1 hours), Portugal (1.2 hours), Sweden (2.5 hours) and, most notably – working time reductions being driven by legislation – in France (4.0 hours). Since 2003, when EIRO started collecting data in eastern Europe, the 40-hour working week has persisted in a majority of countries. Exceptions to this can be found in Cyprus, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, where agreed hours are closer to the EU15 average. Slovakia remains the only country of the NMS in which considerable reductions in the working week have been recorded over the past few years. Actual working week longer in most countries Compared with the data on collectively agreed weekly working hours, statistics on actual weekly hours worked give a more accurate impression of the true length of the working week, as they include factors such as overtime and absence. The actual weekly hours worked by full-time employees are higher than the average normal collectively agreed working week in all countries (apart from Greece and Ireland). In the EU, the highest levels of actual weekly hours worked by full-time employees in their main job are to be found in Bulgaria (41.7 hours per week), Romania (41.7 hours) and the UK (41.4 hours). By contrast, the lowest are in France (37.7 hours), Italy (38.4) and Denmark (38.6). Northern European workers enjoy most holidays The average number of days of collectively agreed annual leave for workers in the Europe is 25.2 days per year, according to the report (Data is not available for all countries, it should be noted). The average in the EU15 and Norway is 26.7 days, with  a substantial gap amounting to of two normal working weeks between Sweden (with 33 days leave) and Greece (23 days). Among the NMS, figures are available only for Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Romania and Slovakia. However these indicate that even less leave is available than in Greece, the average being 21.9 days of paid annual leave.

IN BRIEF Research in brief Real pay increases falling for many European workers The average collectively agreed real pay increase for workers across Europe fell from 2.7% in 2006 to 2.3% in 2007, according to Eurofound’s forthcoming annual report on pay developments. While workers received real pay increases in 2006 in all countries except Hungary, Slovenia and the UK, inflation outstripped the nominal pay rise in 12 countries in 2007. Note: Figures are average collectively agreed pay increases (%), adjusted for inflation Source: Pay developments – 2007, to be published end of July on www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/studies/tn0804019s/index.htm News in brief Launch of new survey mapping tool Eurofound has just launched a novel way of presenting survey data online. Users can now select findings they wish to view from the fourth European Working Conditions Survey and select the display – for instance, by country or gender and in tabular, bar chart or map format. The example here shows responses to the question, ‘Do you think your health or safety is at risk because of your work?’ Darker blue shading indicates a greater proportion of respondents answering ‘Yes’. Later in the year, it is planned to make the findings of the second European Quality of Life Survey available in the same format. The survey mapping tool is available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/ewco/surveys/ewcs2005/results.htm Social dialogue in sugar industry Despite the profound economic changes that have taken place in the sugar manufacturing sector over the last decade, industrial relations structures appear to be well established. Multi-employer bargaining is widespread and collective bargaining coverage rates exceed 70% in a majority of 22 countries studied in a new report from Eurofound, Representativeness of the European social partner organisations: Manufacture of sugar. The report looks at how social partner organisations and collective bargaining function in the sector, at both national and European levels. The report also finds that the sector has unusually high density rates of employer organisations – more than 80% in all the countries studied. However, rates of unionisation are more in line with overall trade union density levels. Read the EIRO report online Recent developments in working conditions Over the course of 2007, the Presidencies of Germany, Portugal and Slovenia presented the Declaration on Equality between women and men; the European social partners signed a framework agreement on harassment and violence at work; and the European Commission issued a Communication on a Community strategy for 2007–2012 on health and safety at work, and another on combating undeclared work. These are some of the key developments detailed in a comprehensive new report from Eurofound, Annual review on working conditions in the EU 2007–2008. This fifth annual review summarises the main developments in European legislation and policymaking in the field of working conditions and quality of work and employment, as well as examining trends in the workplace. Download the EWCO report Labour shortages in European textiles and clothing sector The textiles and clothing sector is experiencing a serious shortage of skilled employees – in particular, graduates in textiles engineering. In this sector, the availability of skilled labour and up-to-date technology is as important for companies’ competitiveness as careful global sourcing. A new series of in-depth reports from Eurofound looks at what is driving change in the textiles and clothing industry. It includes four company case studies, analyses of two European textiles clusters and a special report on location decisions, which examines the issue of relocation of production to low-cost countries. Four future scenarios, which put forward possible directions for the sector, are particularly interesting when compared to earlier scenarios developed by Eurofound for the same sector in 2004.

Director’s diary Eurofound has been particularly active over the past month in creating opportunities for debate among key players in business, government and social partner organisations. At the start of June, Eurofound hosted a conference in Poznań, Poland, which explored the underlying factors that influence companies’ decisions on where to locate their business. At the end of the month, Eurofound hosted a seminar in Helsinki that projected forecasts as to the state of industrial relations in 2025, both in Europe and in Europe’s global competitors. Speakers at the seminar included Tarja Cromberg, Finnish Minister of Employment and Enterprise, and other high-level representatives from Finnish social partner organisations. Eurofound is also finalising plans for contributions to the upcoming French Presidency, which kicks off this month. These include presentations at conferences on mobility and on employment policies for older workers in September, as well as a jointly hosted conference with the Agence Nationale pour l’Amélioration des Conditions de Travail (ANACT) on sustainable work in October. Meanwhile, Eurofound continues to make its extensive research findings available. A new survey mapping tool will give policymakers and researchers access to Eurofound’s survey data in a variety of formats. Secondary analysis of the fourth European Working Conditions Survey continues, with the publication of a new report on flexicurity and work is ongoing on the next issues of Eurofound’s resource packs looking at flexicurity and at migration. As happens every year, Eurofound News will take a break for the month of August, with the next issue being published at the start of September. I take this opportunity to wish all readers of Eurofound News a pleasant summer break. Jorma Karppinen Director	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-july-2008-1

Exploring global strategies in Poznań ‘Europe should be saying: “Our labour is better, come and bring new technologies and new ways of working”’ – Michał Boni ‘The competition on labour costs is over in the EU – now what matters is competition based on skills’, according to Michał Boni, chief economic adviser to the Polish government, speaking at a recent conference hosted by Eurofound. Delegates at the conference broadly agreed that globalisation can bring many opportunities, but only if the framework is right. This means investing in education, reducing bureaucratic barriers, and, crucially, encouraging entrepreneurial thinking. A skilled workforce, an attractive environment and a business-friendly public administration were deemed equally as important as low costs in sourcing locations. The conference, ‘Global competition and European companies’ location decisions’, in Poznań, Poland, on 3–5 June, examined the factors that are important in attracting companies and outside investment, the role the EU can play in the competition for investment taking place between Member States, and European strategies for dealing with ever greater globalisation. Outsourcing and offshoring Geoff Upton of PricewaterhouseCoopers, one of Eurofound’s partners in organising the conference, argued that the majority of EU companies that relocate to central and eastern Europe do so not only to cut costs, but because it makes perfect business sense. This need not necessarily result in job losses: Donald Storrie of Eurofound made the point that despite intense media coverage, the offshoring of jobs to other countries accounted for only a small proportion (around 8%) of all jobs lost between 2003 and 2006. However, delegates still pointed to the competitive pressure from rising economic powers such as China and India; Franz Grohs of T-Systems argued that the skills level of the Indian workforce will soon rival that of European labour forces. Aiming for better regulation In terms of EU involvement, Pascal Boijmans from the European Commission’s Directorate General for Regional Policy presented the EU’s strategy in Poland as an example of how structural funds can be used to generate investment. The focus is on moving away from direct aid, and towards improving the general business environment. This requires good governance – in particular, a proactive administration, stable legal framework and efforts by Member States to reduce the administrative burden on companies. Comparing the Irish and Polish experience The Irish success story was presented by the Irish Development Agency and PharmaChemical Ireland, two organisations that have managed to attract large-scale foreign direct investment into Ireland. Entry into the EU market for US companies, a well-qualified labour force, strong government support and low rates of corporate tax were cited as the main reasons for Ireland’s success in attracting foreign companies. Polish cities and regions have equally dedicated specialists who aim to provide one-stop-shop solutions for new companies in Poland; their success was outlined by representatives from Hewlett Packard, Volkswagen and PTC Software. These companies have all invested considerably in Poland, because they value the access to new markets, the proximity of suppliers and the framework conditions offered to them.

Spotlight on employment security European workers in more insecure jobs are less likely to have opportunities for boosting their skills levels and future employability than those in open-ended contracts. Furthermore, high levels of job insecurity, vulnerability to income losses, and poor prospects for employability appear to be a particular concern for certain groups – especially women and younger workers. However, active labour market policies and social protection systems can play an important role in moderating some of these risks. These are some of the findings from a new report from Eurofound exploring the subject of flexicurity. Entitled Working conditions in the European Union: Employment security and employability, the report aims to identify those workers who are at greatest risk, and to whom policymakers should pay particular attention. It also compares Member States to see if and how flexicurity measures fit in with national and institutional arrangements. Exploring security and employability This report puts forward four key indicators to be taken into account in the discussion on flexicurity and measures how these indicators relate to each other at an individual level, as well as how they may relate to institutional factors at the country level. The four indicators are: objective job insecurity (determined, for instance, by the type of employment contract); subjective job insecurity (as perceived by the respondents); the degree of employability (determined by level of access to training, or extent of opportunities for learning on the job); and vulnerability – the inability to withstand income losses associated with such events as job loss or sickness. Clear country differences visible The data for the report’s analysis come from the fourth European Working Conditions Survey 2005, Eurofound’s pan-European survey into working conditions. The survey examined such topics as working time, work organisation, employment status, pay, work-related health risks and health outcomes, and access to training. While the survey itself covered 31 countries, this secondary analysis of the findings confines itself to the EU27. The analysis finds that, as with individuals, countries with low levels of employability also have high levels of job insecurity. Mediterranean countries are in the worst position in this regard, having low levels of employability and high levels of objective job insecurity, while the Nordic countries, by contrast, have high levels of employability and low levels of job insecurity. Women, pay and work–life balance The analysis also finds that, overall, women are in a disadvantaged position: employability is lower for working women, while gender discrimination appears to be greater in jobs that provide poor provision for employability. Women, as the report makes clear, suffer wage discrimination, as they tend to be mainly concentrated in the lower part of the wage scale. The report also finds that the more insecure a job is, the greater the probability it is poorly paid: those who are self-employed, on fixed-term contracts, in training or without contracts are more likely to be on low incomes than those on open-ended employment contracts. In terms of work–life balance, the report finds that working hours in jobs that are less insecure usually do not fit as well with family or social commitments as do working hours in permanent employment.

Director’s diary This month, the issue of globalisation features prominently in Eurofound’s work. On 3–5 June, Eurofound will host a high-level conference on the theme of ‘Global competition and European companies’ location decisions’ in Poznań, Poland. Globalisation is also the theme of this year’s first issue of Foundation Focus, entitled Small world, and is the subject of the second of Eurofound’s resource packs, Around the world in 80 ways – Today’s global market place. Increasingly, key decision-makers are asking Eurofound to contribute data and research findings to assist them in the process of policy formulation. In April, Eurofound presented data on the employment situation of women at a hearing of the Labour Market Observatory (LMO) of the European Economic and Social Committee. This month, the LMO has again requested Eurofound’s input, this time at two hearings: one on ageing workers, and another on sustainable productivity. Employment Week in Brussels in June is a key annual event for EU policymakers and experts in the social affairs arena. In keeping with its long tradition of involvement in this high-profile event, Eurofound speakers will feature prominently in this year’s programme, addressing such themes as facilitating the employment of young people, managing industrial restructuring, and boosting both competitiveness and job quality. Meanwhile, work is ongoing on the next Eurofound four-year work programme and the work programme for 2009, preparatory to the meeting of Eurofound’s Governing Board in July. In addition, analysis of data from the second European Quality of Life Survey continues, with the first findings expected in the coming months.

Job quality matters for older workers Older workers are more likely to remain in employment if they enjoy autonomy in their work, have access to training and are employed in high-performance work organisations (HPWOs) – organisations with horizontal management structures, task rotation, team work and active involvement in decision-making processes. This is one of the key findings from a new report from Eurofound, Working conditions of an ageing workforce. The report reviews the working conditions of workers approaching retirement age to determine the factors which may lead to their early exit from the labour market. Based on secondary analysis of the fourth European Working Conditions Survey, the report focuses on four key areas, all of which are significant in shaping the age structure of the workforce: ensuring career and employment security; maintaining and promoting health and well-being of workers; developing skills and competencies; and reconciling working and non-working life. Importance of good working conditions Against the background of an ageing workforce, European policymakers agree on the need to improve working conditions in order to enable older workers to remain in the workforce for as long as possible. Previous research from the OECD has found that the low participation of older people in the labour market is the result of a combination of low wages, rigidity in workplace organisation, inadequate skills, and poor health, rather than stemming from a wish to retire early. Marked age differences in working conditions The report’s findings reveal important differences in the working conditions of younger and older workers: older workers are less exposed to physical risks in the working environment, have greater autonomy in their work and experience less work intensity. However, they receive less training, are less likely to work in HWPOs and are less likely to use ‘new’ technologies, which in turn limits their career opportunities. To ensure the integration and retention of older workers in the labour market, the report recommends creating greater opportunities to permit older workers to make a more phased transition to retirement, through working part time and other flexible working time arrangements. It also proposes the more widespread employment of older workers in HPWOs, which would help ensure equal opportunities in training. Working conditions and employment rates positively correlated In order to identify the role of the different aspects of working conditions in determining older people’s participation rates, and to give a rough evaluation of how different factors facilitate or hinder the employment of older workers, the report correlated some aspects of working conditions with older workers’ employment rates. Positive correlations are found especially in relation to work autonomy, employment in HPWOs, access to learning and training. On the other hand, a clearly negative correlation emerges between employment participation and exposure to physical risks at work. Not surprisingly, the correlation between satisfaction and employment is positive. Download the full report 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-may-2008-0

Driving change in the transport sector The transport and logistics sector in Europe can successfully continue to contribute to Europe’s economic success, if a substantial investment of resources and political will is put in place to address skills needs, tackle growing traffic congestion, and steer the sector towards greater environmental sustainability. This is one of the conclusions that emerge from a new online collection of reports, entitled EMCC dossier on the European transport and logistics sector. The dossier comprises an overview report, which looks at the current state of the sector, four case studies that examine in detail the experiences of companies in the sector, two studies that look at transport clusters, and an article outlining the factors behind companies’ location decisions. In addition, a forward-looking ‘scenarios’ report explores a number of possible futures facing the sector, in the light of rising oil prices, technological change, ever-increasing demand for mobility, and growing public and political concern regarding the environmental impact of transport. Impact of transport growth Growth in transport is strongly linked to economic growth; however, the current patterns and levels of transport are unsustainable, in terms of rising CO2 emissions, pollution, and vulnerability to rising oil prices. Transport is responsible for 28% of CO2 emissions in the EU, and 84% of these come from road traffic. Decoupling economic growth from its negative side effects is a challenge for Europe: policymakers are already seeking alternatives to conventional road transport for both passengers and freight. Rail transport could play a much greater role than its relatively small (and shrinking) contribution to the European transport scene. However, this would require the prioritising of environmental sustainability, and huge investment, according to the overview report. The situation now and in 2017 The possible future scenarios outlined in the dossier derive – in part – from an extrapolation of current trends. The scenarios are based on two key variables: the direction of the global economy, and the policy priority accorded to sustainability versus mobility. Regardless of what happens in terms of these variables, some outcomes are certain. For instance, greater reliance will be placed on technological innovation, enabling better energy efficiency, the tracking of goods and vehicles in transit, better communication and navigation across dispersed transport networks, and automation of manual tasks; in turn, this will require an upgrading of the skills of the workforce. Other outcomes, however, are more dependent on political priorities. For example, liberalisation is currently high on the political agenda and should this remain the case, competition is likely to increase, demanding greater flexibility from both employers and employees, and greater competitiveness from companies. Shared challenges for companies The case studies take an in-depth look at the experience of some of Europe’s key players in the sector – companies such as Polish railways company PKP Group, German airline Air Berlin, Danish freight and logistics company Andreas Andresen, and Dutch container transport company Samskip. The companies have very diverse backgrounds, histories, and experience; however, many challenges are shared: the difficulty of attracting and retaining skilled staff, the growing constraints of traffic congestion, intense competition in an increasingly liberalised market, and the challenge of rising fuel prices. The particular importance of location to companies in the sector is outlined in two additional studies of transport companies located around a geographical ‘cluster’ – the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, and the Padborg cluster on the Danish–German border – as well as a separate article discussing factors behind location decisions.

IN BRIEF News in pictures On 17 April, European Commission President, José Manuel Barroso (pictured right) attended a reception at the offices of the European Commission Representation in Dublin, Ireland. A number of Eurofound staff met Mr Barroso at the event, including (from left to right) Donald Storrie, Bernice Turner and Mary McNeice. News in brief Companies contribute to achieving Lisbon goals ‘Attractive workplace for all’, the online database of cases accessible on the Eurofound website, is now complemented by a new report, Un travail attractif pour tous: Contributions à la stratégie de Lisbonne au niveau de l’entreprise, which brings together key findings emerging from the cases. The database showcases examples of companies in seven Member States that have implemented innovative measures to boost both the level and the quality of employment. The cases indicate that – by introducing innovative policies and practices – companies are contributing to the Lisbon goals of making Europe the most competitive knowledge-based global economy and boosting the quality and number of jobs. The cases also demonstrate that companies can succeed financially while simultaneously ensuring good working and employment conditions for their employees, in a ‘win–win’ outcome. The report will be available in English later in the year. Download the report and access the database of company cases Eurofound input to 2009 Czech EU Presidency Eurofound will bring its expertise and research findings to a number of conferences and seminars during the Czech EU Presidency in the first half of 2009. Petr Šimerka, Czech Deputy Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director, agreed on the cooperation initiative when they met in Prague on 20 May. The Czech EU Presidency will focus on competitiveness, migration of workers, flexicurity, family issues and social inclusion, under the banner ‘Europe without barriers’. The meeting took place as part of Eurofound’s two-day roadshow visit to its stakeholders in the Czech Republic, where it presented latest findings, data and recommendations from a Czech perspective. More on the roadshow visit Seminar series: developing workers’ skills A successful upgrading of the skills level of the workforce is crucial to Europe’s future economic success. The upcoming 2008 Foundation seminar series will examine the role that social partners and public authorities can play in developing skills, providing training, and recognising qualifications. The first session, to be held at Eurofound’s premises in Dublin on 23–25 June, will focus on mapping trends and initiating networking among participants; the second session, on 5–7 November, will focus on national situations and examples of company experience. The seminar series aims to provide opportunities for representatives of governments, trade unions and employer organisations from different Member States, who are involved in EU social policy, to debate and exchange experience. Attendance at the event is by invitation only. Read more on this event Ankara seminar looks at role of childcare services It is increasingly recognised that poverty and social exclusion still affect many families in Europe. One way in which families can be supported is through the provision of high-quality childcare. At a seminar jointly organised by Eurofound and the Turkish Ministry of Labour and Social Services in Ankara on 5 June, participants will discuss the contribution that the provision of childcare services can make to families and societies. Bringing its research expertise in the area of childcare to the seminar, Eurofound will focus in particular on the work it has carried out in the areas of employment initiatives in the sector and the affordability and sustainability of childcare services for children living in disadvantaged areas.

IN BRIEF News in pictures At the road show visit to the Netherlands in March, the first of Eurofound's new series of resource packs – on the theme of active ageing – was presented to Dutch high-level policymakers and stakeholders. Pictured here are Jan Piet Hein Donner, Dutch Minister for Social Affairs and Employment, and Eurofound Director Jorma Karppinen.   News in brief Gender inequalities persist in the workplace Despite an improvement in gender equality in the workplace, inequality still persists, according to a new report from Eurofound’s European Working Conditions Observatory (EWCO). Based on data from Eurostat, the report, Working in Europe: Gender differences, shows that the majority of women are concentrated in a few economic sectors and occupations. It also finds that more women are employed involuntarily in fixed-term contracts, and that fewer women engage in entrepreneurial activities. Women’s overall employment rates are also constrained by their ongoing disproportionate shouldering of domestic responsibilities. A combination of labour market policy interventions, and measures supported by the social partners (for example, more flexible working time arrangements for working parents), could go some way towards boosting gender equality in the workplace, as might the shrinking European workforce and women’s rising levels of educational attainment. Download the EWCO report Information and consultation: impact of the EU Directive The transposing of the Directive on informing and consulting employees into national legislation has led, for the first time, to a statutory system of information and consultation for employees in the UK and Ireland. There, a ‘voluntarist’ industrial relations tradition predominates, as well as in many of the new Member States. However, in countries with longstanding statutory works council systems, the Directive has had few, if any, implications. These are the key findings from a new report from Eurofound, Impact of the information and consultation directive. The report, based on contributions from Eurofound’s national correspondents in the 27 Member States and Norway, examines the impact of Directive 2002/14/EC, requiring all Member States to establish a general framework for informing and consulting employees. The report examines in detail how the Directive was transposed in the different Member States, which new systems were introduced as a result and how the social partners in the Members States view the process and its results. Read the full EIRO report Presentation to EESC on gender and employment Despite greater numbers of women entering the labour force, the pattern of occupational and vertical gender segregation at the workplace continues to be a barrier to equality. Furthermore, women are less likely to be managers and even when they are, it is likely that they will be supervising other women. These are some of the findings of Eurofound research outlined in a background paper prepared at the request of the Labour Market Observatory (LMO) of the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC). Eurofound presented the paper at an LMO hearing on ‘Women’s access to the labour market’ on 29 April in Brussels. The report reviews findings from Eurofound research, looking at differences in career development and pay between men and women. Other contributions to this hearing will focus on equality policies: in particular, social policies and provisions, such as flexicurity policies and social security schemes, will be examined to see if they contribute to improving or reducing gender equality. Find out more about Eurofound background papers Exchanging experiences of active social inclusion On 15 May, Robert Anderson from Eurofound will speak at a high-level conference in Vienna about labour market measures for active inclusion and participation in Europe. He will be focusing on strategies to enable people who have been on long-term disability to return to work, and on retaining older workers in employment. The conference, ‘Taking part and being active – How active inclusion contributes to the European Social Model’, organised by the Austrian Ministry for Social Affairs and Consumer Protection, will bring together practitioners and researchers to share best practice in this area. It will discuss how to support individuals and families through reforming social systems and coordinating measures on childcare, care of the elderly, education and housing. Three expert panels will look at the current framework for active inclusion, the points of views of the actors and the relationship between active inclusion and minimum income schemes.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-may-2008-2

Director’s diary Issues around the ageing of the European population are set to gain in importance over the next few years, particularly the implications for labour supply and social protection systems. As part of its ongoing contribution to the European policy debate, Eurofound this month publishes a report, Working conditions of an ageing workforce, which is based on findings from the fourth European Working Conditions Survey, conducted in 2005. The report is one of a series of secondary analyses of the survey – future reports will explore working conditions in relation to different sectors, employment security and employability, work organisation, working time and work intensity, new technology, and convergence across the 31 countries surveyed. The EU Information and Consultation Directive (2002/14/EC) remains high on the EU policy agenda. The Directive is the first EU measure to impose a general obligation on employers to inform and consult their employees on a range of issues. Hence it represents a substantial step towards establishing an EU-wide standard for employee information and consultation as a key element of the European social model. A new comparative report from Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO), Impact of the information and consultation directive on industrial relations, examines the impact of the Directive on the practice of industrial relations in the Member States. As part of its ongoing communications strategy, Eurofound pursues an active programme of meetings with key policymakers. Over the spring, Eurofound has welcomed a number of high-profile visitors to its premises in Dublin, including MEPs Lasse Lehtinen (Finland), and Evelyne Gebhardt (Germany). The visits provided the opportunity for an exchange of views and information and are indicative of the openness of dialogue between the organisation and its stakeholders, a process that it seeks to develop further.

Foundation Focus looks at globalisation More than just a catchphrase, globalisation is an ongoing development that affects everyone. Workers, entrepreneurs or consumers, European citizens have all felt the impact of globalisation, albeit to varying degrees and with different outcomes. In Small world, the latest issue of Foundation Focus, Eurofound examines globalisation from a number of angles, and presents policy responses to the phenomenon. Small world includes an analysis of data from the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM), which indicates the extent of offshoring of jobs; it also discusses the impact of active labour market policies in bringing workers back into employment. An interview with Romana Tomc, Slovenian Secretary of State at the Ministry of Labour, Family and Social Affairs, reveals how Slovenia is dealing with the effects of globalisation, while guest contributor Arthur van Schendel, diversity manager of the City of Amsterdam, makes the case for positive discrimination – actively recruiting migrants and other underrepresented groups into the city’s workforce. Controversy over offshoring of jobs Eurofound research indicates that the offshoring of jobs from the EU to lower-cost countries accounts for only a relatively small proportion of the overall number of jobs lost: ERM data shows that in the period between 2003 and 2006, offshoring accounted for around 8% of all jobs lost. However, even this limited extent of offshoring has had a profound impact on how Europeans perceive globalisation: over the same period, support for globalisation fell considerably. Where do the offshored jobs go and how does this compare to other industrialised countries such as Japan and the US? ERM data quoted in Small World indicates that, in Europe, half of the jobs that are lost in the EU15 to other countries are in manufacturing sectors; most of these go to central and eastern European Member States, or to Asia. In the US, most of the jobs that are offshored are in manufacturing (80%); jobs in garment assembly, automotive and aerospace go to Mexico, low-skill manufacturing and higher-end engineering go to China, while jobs in such services sectors as telecommunications, IT, finance and transportation go to India. In Japan, the main destinations for offshored jobs are China, Indonesia, Malaysia and, to some extent, the EU and the US. Globalisation of industrial relations Increasingly, companies operate their production sites in different countries. Given that industrial relations has traditionally taken place in a national context, the question arises of how the interests of workers are represented when they themselves are ‘globalised’. Representation becomes particularly complex when increased competitive pressure leads to different intra-company locations being played off against each other. Small world looks at the role that European works councils (EWCs) play in this context. EWCs facilitate the informing and consulting of workers by the management of multinational companies that are undertaking major restructuring processes. Eurofound research quoted in Small world shows that, on the whole, many EWCs do not go beyond their standard obligations. There have, however, been some examples of EWCs’ involvement in negotiations over transnational restructuring that have resulted in the establishment of joint texts. Whether or not EWCs play a major role in such negotiations seems to depend greatly on the sector concerned, on national traditions of social dialogue in the country where the company is headquartered, and on the strength of trade union influence in that country.

Potential for EU energy ‘renaissance’ Europe has the potential to benefit from a renaissance of its energy sector, with advantages for job creation, exports and economic growth. This is according to a new report from Eurofound, published as part of an online dossier charting the current state and future direction of the European energy sector. However, such an outcome is unlikely to happen unless binding international agreements on restricting CO2 emissions are reached, which could kick-start a series of technological breakthroughs in renewable energy production. The report sets out various scenarios for the future development of the sector. It concludes that – even in the absence of such international cooperation – the sector should pursue research and development in renewables and CO2-neutral technologies, to guard against resource scarcity, climate change and economic slowdown. In addition to this report, the dossier also includes an overview report that outlines the current state of the sector, as well as company case studies and studies of regional clusters. Security of supply a growing issue The dossier shows the extent of EU’s dependency on imported energy: almost 50% of its energy consumption is sourced from outside the Union. This figure is expected to rise to 70% over the next 20–30 years. At present, all Member States, with the exception of Denmark, are net importers of energy. Gas, in particular, is a politically sensitive resource: more than 70% of EU gas imports comes from just three countries – Algeria, Norway and Russia. In recent years, tensions have arisen between Russia and its neighbours, as illustrated by the ‘pipeline’ war between Russia and Ukraine. Concerns over supply security, as well as over climate change, are a powerful political stimulus to boost the development of the renewable energy sector. Emissions trading could drive change Under emissions trading schemes, CO2 emissions quotas are assigned to power plants, permitting them to emit a certain limited volume of CO2. If a power plant wants to increase its CO2 output, it can buy quotas from other companies; companies can hence reduce costs and boost revenue by reducing their carbon emissions. If the price of the quotas is raised in the future, carbon trading could – according to the European Commission – become one of the most important drivers of change towards a renewables-based, CO2–neutral energy market. A new trading scheme in greenhouse gas emissions was proposed by the Commission at the start of 2008; it is planned that the trading system will be harmonised across the Union. EU world leader in renewables Despite facing a number of challenges, such as the lack of qualified personnel and difficulty in raising the huge capital required for energy production, the EU enjoys a clear advantage over other regions: its energy sector is currently the world leader in renewables. As pressure grows internationally to limit CO2 emissions and implement technologies to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, the European energy sector is potentially in a good position to capitalise on these developments. To make an effective contribution, however, renewables need to be combined with energy efficiency and conservation.

Spotlight on mergers and acquisitions The majority of company mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the EU take place inside national borders; in fact, as many as 80% of the M&A deals during the period 2000–2006 took place between firms in the same Member State. Mergers and acquisitions contribute to lowering prices and enhancing business competition, which in turn benefits the European consumer and strengthens the internal market. However, it is estimated that around 50% of M&A ventures fail to meet the strategic objectives set in the first place for the merger or acquisition. These are some of the findings documented in a report of a recent company network seminar, entitled ‘Managing change in EU cross-border mergers and acquisitions’. Participants at the seminar stressed that the risk of failure can be minimised by ensuring that an M&A is undertaken to meet strategic goals, and that the process is entirely transparent. The importance of involving all relevant stakeholders, of respecting cultural differences and of engaging in ongoing communication with employee representative bodies were also underlined. Risks and challenges of M&A The report identifies a number of key reasons why companies engage in M&A: greater economies of scale and scope, entry into new markets, greater access to inputs (labour, raw materials and technologies), complementarity of products between merged companies, and empire-building. However, while the reasons may be compelling, the outcomes may be unfavourable: eliminating market rivals may allow the surviving companies to raise their prices and enable them to boost their profitability even in a context of shrinking sales, declining outputs and layoffs of workers. Such effects are detrimental to the interests both of consumers and employees. The process of M&A itself entails considerable risks to companies: common problems include the company’s worth being overvalued, or its indebtedness being underestimated. Other problems include the potential overestimation of management capabilities, an inability to manage change, and difficulties in integrating different corporate and national cultures. M&A activity The report offers a more detailed look at the figures on M&A activity: in the EU, companies from the New Member States are the biggest targets for acquisition by other European firms; at the global level, US and European companies show increasing interest in the potential of the Asian market. When the amount of activity is examined by sector, the report indicates that manufacturing accounts for a higher degree of cross-border M&A activity than does services. Sharing company experiences The report documents four case studies undertaken as part of the seminar, examining the experiences of four M&A activities: in the banking, manufacturing and air travel sectors. Company representatives at the seminar compared the differing experiences of M&A and shared lessons learned from the processes. A broad consensus was reached regarding the key factors for success: any proposed M&A should clearly meet the company’s strategic goals; the background to the company should be carefully researched; transparency is essential to instil an atmosphere of trust; implementation of the new company culture should begin as soon as the merger or acquisition has been finalised; and all stakeholders – shareholders, employees, trade union representatives and managers – should be involved in the process.

IN BRIEF News in pictures On 29 February, Margot Wallström (pictured centre), Vice President of the European Commission, and Commissioner for Institutional Relations and Communications Strategy, paid an official visit to the Commission Representation in Ireland. Also pictured are Martin Territt, Head of the Representation (right) and Eurofound’s Mary McCaughey, Head of Information and Communication (left). © European Commission Representation in Ireland (photo) News in brief Promoting opportunities for older workers With Europe experiencing dramatic demographic change, companies and policymakers are increasingly having to revise their attitudes towards older people – in particular, older workers. In order to minimise the shrinking of the European workforce, and protect social security systems, employment opportunities for older workers must be improved. However, to do this requires a rethinking of assumptions at company, national and EU level. To contribute to this process, Eurofound has launched an information campaign entitled ‘Working longer, living better – Europe’s coming of age’. Accompanying the campaign is an information pack that brings decision-makers up to date with the latest findings from research, and with recommendations and examples of best practice in tackling the challenges and exploring the opportunities associated with active ageing. The information pack will be distributed at a range of events dealing with the issue of ageing, and is also available on the Eurofound website. Roadshow goes to the Netherlands and France In the Netherlands, one worker in five (21.2%) aged 55 or over feels that their work affects their health. During Eurofound’s recent roadshow to the Hague, on 25–26 March, discussions centred on how recent Eurofound work on active ageing could help the Dutch government, employer organisations and trade unions ensure that older workers remain active in the workforce for longer. In Paris, on 27–28 March, talks with representatives from the French government and social partner organisations focused on Eurofound’s recent findings and analysis regarding equal opportunities between women and men, work–life balance, as well as social issues during the upcoming French EU Presidency. Eurofound is currently preparing for its roadshow visit to the Czech Republic in May. Eurofound rolls out new web features Eurofound continues to develop its web-publishing capabilities. It now offers news feeds, also known as RSS, web feeds or channels. This new feature allows users of the website to sign up to automatically receive up-to-date information tailored to their requirements. The news feeds feature is accessible on the Eurofound home page: clicking on the button (illustrated) will display all the available options. Also available shortly will be a new tool that permits the graphical display of data from the fourth European Working Conditions Survey. Users will be able to choose a map, bar chart or table to display the results from 27 EU Member States for each survey question. It is planned to offer similar facilities for future surveys, such as the second European Quality of Life Survey, the fieldwork for which has now been completed. Eurofound contributes to Slovenian Presidency events One of the priorities of the Slovenian EU Presidency in the first half of 2008 is the continuing implementation of the Lisbon Agenda in creating more and better jobs. Two events in particular look at the situation of people at different life stages. The first conference, ‘Jobs for youth – Prosperity for all’ (24–25 April, Brdo), will examine the situation of young people in the labour market. While young people are the most adaptable group in the working population, they also face particular challenges, such as difficulties in finding their first job and remaining employed. At this event, Eurofound will present findings from the 2007 Foundation seminar series on ‘Youth and work’ as well as from the EIRO study of the same title. On 28 and 29 April, a conference on ‘Intergenerational solidarity for cohesive and sustainable societies’ – again in Brdo – will look at the major demographic changes facing Europe. Eurofound’s contribution will focus on the increasing demand for long-term care and how it can and should be met.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-april-2008-2

Director’s diary Contributing to the European policy debate A major element of Eurofound’s work is facilitating and encouraging debate and discussion on key aspects of socioeconomic policy. This month, Eurofound publishes reports on two recent events tackling issues of major importance: a seminar co-organised with the European Parliament in March on the impact of globalisation, and a company network seminar examining the growing phenomenon of corporate mergers and acquisitions, hosted at the headquarters of Spanish bank Santander in Madrid, in November. In April, Eurofound will contribute to the Slovenian EU Presidency, speaking at a conference focusing on the integration of young people into the labour market. At another Presidency event, on the topic of intergenerational solidarity, Eurofound research managers will address the question of how the demand for long-term care should be met. Also in April, Eurofound will contribute to a discussion on the challenges faced by women in accessing the labour market, organised by the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) in Brussels. Finally, this month, Eurofound will publish a report and case studies on the trends and drivers of change in the EU energy sector. Crucial to Europe’s successful economic development, the European energy sector has experienced significant change over the last decade, resulting from liberalisation, technological progress and growing concern over climate change. The challenges are ongoing: while demand for energy is continually growing, the energy infrastucture requires more investment, the requirements for environmental responsibility have been strengthened and the sector faces an increasing lack of skilled labour.

Making globalisation work for EU citizens Workers, particularly low-skilled workers, in sectors undergoing structural change due to globalisation are having to adjust to a situation of lower job security. In the light of growing public scepticism about the benefits of globalisation, policymakers need to take action and present solutions, to mitigate the negative effects of the further opening up of markets and exploit the positive aspects. This was one of the main recommendations expressed at the recent joint European Parliament–Eurofound conference, ‘The impact of globalisation on structural change and employment’, held on 4 March in Brussels. It looked at trends in this area (such as the shift to the offshoring of services) and identified responses to the challenges ahead, such as increased social dialogue and further investment in education and training. White-collar workers more vulnerable Technological advances have resulted in the fragmentation of production processes, which in turn enables the offshoring of tasks across national borders and the organisation of production around the globe – both for goods and increasingly for services. The emergence of an ‘hourglass’ labour market in Europe was described as a real possibility, one that provides opportunities for very high-skilled workers and a large number of very low-skilled service jobs, but little for workers falling between the two extremes. This means that white-collar workers are increasingly among those workers whose jobs are vulnerable as a result of offshoring activities. Promoting social dialogue and training In terms of solutions, speakers and participants saw social dialogue as offering the greatest potential, given its capacity to contribute to anticipating future change. Investment in education and skills was identified as another important response. Skills development was described as a way to support the modernisation of the labour market by enhancing functional flexibility and job-to-job mobility. By way of evidence, reference was made to the system of initial education and the sophisticated, highly flexible approach to vocational training and re-training in Denmark, the cornerstone of the successful Danish flexicurity model. Globalisation as an opportunity or threat? Opinions were split on the necessity and usefulness of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), aimed to provide individual support to workers made redundant as a result of trade liberalisation. However, there was general agreement on the need to boost support among citizens for further trade liberalisation and strengthen acceptance of globalisation, particularly in light of European citizens’ growing scepticism. A recently published report from Eurofound, Perceptions of the employment impact of globalisation, states that in 2003 more than half of respondents (56%) in the EU15 saw globalisation as an opportunity for companies. However, three years later, in 2006, only 37% held the same view. At the same time, the percentage of those seeing globalisation as a threat to employment and companies rose from 39% in 2003 to 47% in 2006.

Farewell to Eurofound’s Deputy Director After five years as Deputy and Acting Director, Willy Buschak will leave Eurofound at the end of March. His departure marks the end of a long involvement with Eurofound and its work for almost two decades, first as Board member, then as Deputy Director and Acting Director. Eurofound has come a long way over the past two decades, comments Willy Buschak when looking back over the 17 years in which he has been connected to the agency. When asked to summarise the progress that Eurofound has made over that time, he says that the current four-year programme of work, Changing Europe: Better work, better life, has enabled Eurofound to deliver greater impact and assume greater importance as an information provider. ‘I believe the Foundation’s input has improved both in quality and reach, speed and professionalism, facilitating decision-making for a greater number of policymakers in Europe,’ he says. Raising the profile of Eurofound Willy Buschak first became involved in Eurofound’s work in 1991, when he became coordinator of the workers’ group in the then Administrative Board. He held this function – which demanded a great deal of hands-on involvement in the Foundation’s work – in parallel with his post at the European Trade Union Congress (ETUC) until 2000. In 2003, he was appointed Deputy Director of Eurofound. ‘I still remember one of the first exhibitions Eurofound was involved in, which took place in the European Parliament in Strasbourg in the late 1990s,’ he recalls. ‘A great deal of effort went into the event, but the MEPs took no notice of what we had to offer.’ Today, he notes, the situation is very different. Eurofound is regularly requested to provide data and analysis for the EU institutions in Brussels and for policymakers in the Member States. Promoting Eurofound’s monitoring tools Willy Buschak has been instrumental in setting up and raising the quality and profile of many of the organisation’s monitoring tools: the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO), the European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC), and the European Working Conditions Observatory (EWCO), as well as its surveys, tools that many researchers and policymakers now consider central to their work. He is especially proud of the fact that he personally contributed to expanding the European Working Conditions Survey to Switzerland. ‘A French employers’ representative who is a good friend of mine once said to me that, thanks to the Foundation’s work, he better understands social reality, which is a big compliment. The Foundation’s huge potential is to make links between living and working conditions, industrial relations and industrial change,’ says Mr Buschak. Moving to a transversal way of working For two years, from 2003 to 2005, Willy Buschak took on the role of Acting Director of Eurofound. ‘I believe one fundamental change during this period – what can be defined only as a positive step – was to implement what we now call transversality in Eurofound’, he says. ‘This means continued collaboration between the research sections, essentially bringing out the best in Eurofound’s communal expertise, something that is very much at the centre of how we do things here today.’ Speaking of his imminent departure, he concludes: ‘All of us together in Eurofound have built on the seeds sown by Clive Purkiss, Raymond Pierre Bodin, and Eric Verborgh (former Directors and Deputy Director). We have made the Foundation more useful for its stakeholders – but particularly for the social partners – and I hope very much that Eurofound makes further progress down this road.’ 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-march-2008-0

IN BRIEF Research in brief Europeans increasingly sceptical about globalisation The study 'Perceptions of globalisation: attitudes and responses in the EU', finds evidence of increased scepticism regarding globalisation in the EU15. In 2003, on average in the EU15, 39% of people said that globalisation represented a threat to employment and companies; in 2006, that figure had risen to 48%. Correspondingly, the proportion who felt that, thanks to the opening up of markets, globalisation represented a good opportunity for companies fell from 56% in 2003 to 39% in 2006. Download the study Note: Figures represent percentage of respondents who felt that ‘globalisation represents a threat to employment and companies’.

News in brief Developments in corporate governance Corporate codes of conduct are designed primarily to ensure corporate adherence to legal obligations or company values, and minimise the risks of breaking national laws. In contrast, the objective of international framework agreements (IFAs) is to create a mutual understanding of basic principles, in terms of social rights, industrial relations and social dialogue. This is one of the conclusions reached in a new report from Eurofound, Codes of conduct and international framework agreements: New forms of governance at company level. The report goes on to speculate that the fact that an IFA emerges only from a set of particular corporate conditions and social frameworks, and the fact that global union federations lack the human and financial resources to monitor a large number of agreements, makes it unlikely that the number of IFAs will increase dramatically in the future. Read more in the report Integrating migrants – sharing approaches that work European cities – in particular, major cities in strong economies – attract migrants from across the world, and therefore possess substantial experience of integrating culturally diverse populations into the local community. At an upcoming conference, ‘European cities integrating migrants – From Amsterdam to Zagreb: Fostering a dialogue about successful policies’, to be held in Brussels on 7 April, representatives of the Network of Cities for Local Integration Policies for Migrants (CLIP) will share examples of good practice in local integration policies, in providing better access to affordable housing, and in better provision of services for migrants. To coincide with the event, Eurofound is publishing a résumé of recommendations for policymakers – Housing and integration of migrants in Europe: Good practice guide. More information about the conference is available Strategies to counter undeclared work Member States of the European Union appear to rely mainly on deterrent measures in seeking to limit the extent of undeclared work, according to a new report from Eurofound. The report, Tackling undeclared work in the European Union, reviews the effectiveness of the policy measures that have been adopted in Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom. This represents a first step in developing a knowledge bank to identify what has been tried elsewhere, assess the effectiveness of different approaches and evaluate their transferability. The report also finds that there has been an increase in the use of preventive measures, such as making compliance simpler, and introducing direct and indirect tax incentives. However, measures to change public attitudes and engender a ‘tax morality’ have so far been limited.

For workers, however, it can mean the loss of jobs and the erosion of incomes and living standards. But is it to be expected that companies will abandon European countries for low-cost locations elsewhere? If not, what makes them decide to remain in the EU? To answer this question and others, Eurofound, together with PricewaterhouseCoopers, will be bringing business leaders, policymakers and social partners together in Poznan, Poland, at a conference entitled ‘Global competition and European companies’ location decisions’. Participants will examine the role that location plays in companies’ success, explore how Europe can attract inward investment and assess the role of EU policies in making Europe a more attractive location for business.

Director’s diary Tackling a key policy concern Undeclared work – work activity that is legal but is not registered with the tax authorities – is a key concern for European policymakers: such work impedes growth-oriented economic, budgetary and social policies. Member States could learn from one another in terms of tackling such work; however, to date, no shared ‘knowledge bank’ of measures exists for such communication. A forthcoming report from Eurofound, Tackling undeclared work in the European Union, takes the first step in establishing such a knowledge bank, by reviewing the effectiveness of the policy measures adopted in five Member States. A database documenting 28 initiatives taken in these countries will be available shortly on the Eurofound website. The issue of undeclared work is closely linked to the topic of economic migration into the Union. At the start of April, the CLIP (Network of Cities for Local Integration Policies for Migrants) project initiated by Eurofound will hold a high-level conference in Belgium. This will bring together representatives of European municipalities and national and regional governments, researchers, social partners and representatives of civil society, to discuss how best to implement migration and housing policies at the local level. Meanwhile, Eurofound’s regular ‘roadshow’ visits to EU Member States continue, with upcoming visits to France and the Netherlands at the end of March. Since the roadshows began in 2001, over 50 visits have been carried out, making it one of Eurofound’s key means of reaching both high-level policymakers, national stakeholders and – through the media – the general public. In 2008, eight countries will be visited as part of the programme. Jorma Karppinen Director	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-march-2008-1

Eurofound/EP debate impact of globalisation What is new about globalisation? This and other questions will be debated at 		 a forthcoming high-level conference, ‘The impact of globalisation on structural 		 change and employment’, in Brussels on 4 March. Eurofound and MEPs Stephen 		 Hughes and Alejandro Cercas have joined forces to create a forum at which 		 the impact of globalisation will be discussed and long-term strategies 		 for meeting its challenges explored. With Commissioner Špidla as the keynote speaker, the conference will examine the challenges facing businesses, regional authorities, national governments and EU policymakers and debate how the increasingly international division of labour is creating new winners and losers. In roundtable talks, participants will look at the factors that motivate companies to relocate and the role that social partners can play in these decisions, analyse the lessons that can be learnt from the new European Globalisation adjustment Fund and debate how flexicurity and active labour market policies are implemented in Member States. Focusing on losses and gains 	 Four key aspects of globalisation will be discussed in the roundtable 		 discussions between MEPs, Eurofound experts and social partners. 		 The first roundtable will focus on the current state of play. Some 		 experts 		 view the outsourcing of ever-smaller production processes as 		 just the beginning of a trend, and predict that globalisation will 		 have a substantial 		 impact on service jobs in the future. Eurofound research manager 		 Donald Storrie, together with experts from the ILO and OECD, will look 		 at the 	 gains and losses that can be expected in the short and long term. 	 Company and institutional responses to globalisation 	 Much of the current debate on globalisation focuses on the offshoring 		 of jobs to lower-cost regions of the world. However, the decision 		 to relocate business is not driven solely by considerations 		 of cost. A second roundtable 		 will looks at the factors that drive companies to relocate 		 in the face of increased competition, and assesses the role of worker 		 representatives 		 and corporate culture in such decisions. In a third roundtable, 		 experts 		 and policymakers will debate European, national and regional 		 responses 		 to globalisation. The session will look at the lessons that 		 can be learned from the European Globalisation adjustment Fund, 		 explore how flexicurity 		 and active labour market policies are being implemented in 		 Member States, and examine how regions respond to globalisation – 		 for example, through 		 economic diversification. Participants will also consider whether 		 the expectations of coherent industrial policies at EU and 		 national levels are too great. 	 Meeting the challenges of globalisation 	 The final roundtable looks to the future: it aims to identify 		 the challenges ahead and discuss strategies to cope with 		 these challenges. It will explore whether social protection 		 systems need to be 		 adapted 		 and debate the need for strategies that address major changes 		 in the financial 		 markets. It will also look at whether EU-wide corporate 		 governance is the appropriate strategy to facilitate the adjustment 		 required in the face 		 of globalisation.

Potential of biomedical healthcare Europe has the potential to create a globally competitive biomedical health sector. However, its key competitor – the US – is outperforming it in terms of revenue, in launching new products and in spending on research and development (R&D). Meanwhile, competition from China, India and Singapore is intensifying. These are some of the key conclusions of a new sectoral studies dossier from Eurofound, EMCC dossier on the European biomedical health sector (companies that use biotechnology to develop healthcare products for medical treatment). The dossier’s mapping report outlines the current situation and challenges faced by the sector. While policy support for biotechnology development and generous public funding all represent opportunities, challenges include the ‘brain drain’ of scientists leaving for the US and Asia and the administrative burden imposed on companies in the form of excessive regulation. The dossier also sets out a number of future scenarios and looks in detail at geographical ‘clusters’ of biomedical healthcare companies and individual case studies. Innovative, high-risk sector Biomedical development is a high-risk, long-term, expensive endeavour: drug development can take up to 15 years and it can cost between USD 400–900 million for a single product. The probability of a drug reaching the market is 6% or less. In Europe, the sector is dominated by young, small companies. In order to develop, the sector needs to attract investment, or else companies risk being taken over by better-funded global competitors. While EU Member States are increasingly using tax credits for R&D to stimulate the growth of innovative companies, the diversity of national schemes makes for increasing complexity, hindering trans-European collaboration. On the positive side, however, innovative regulation, such as the European policy framework for biosimilars (generic versions of biotechnology-derived drugs), is providing European companies with a potential competitive advantage. Futures hypotheses for the sector As part of its analysis, the dossier presents four scenarios of possible outcomes for the sector in 2017. These scenarios depict plausible hypotheses about the future and provide a tool for forecasting and for strategic planning in private companies and among social partners. With a scarcity of capital, and the sector tightly regulated, the worst-case scenario for the sector sees it under commercial pressure, and instead looking to opportunities in Asia, where research and development – as opposed to simply low-skilled manufacturing – is now established. At the opposite end of the scale, with capital freely available and regulation liberalised, the sector is growing and is focused on developing a wide range of products for both consumers and the healthcare sector. Company cases and geographical clusters A key element of the dossier is a detailed examination of two regions of Europe where biomedical and biotechnology companies have clustered – western Ireland and the Berlin-Brandenburg region of Germany and a profile of three European companies in the forefront of producing biomedical health products. Pharmaceuticals has become a key element of the Irish economy, employing more than 17,000 people, thanks to the availability of highly skilled staff and a supporting infrastructure. The cluster in the west of the country is informal, unlike the Berlin-Brandenburg cluster, which is the result of a federal initiative. In Germany, the establishment of networks between research and industry is felt to be vital for the competitiveness of the cluster and its companies. Despite the differences, the clusters and the three companies studied all face similar challenges: developing a culture of innovation, getting adequate funding, addressing skills gaps, facing growing competition, and dealing with changes in public regulation.

Director’s diary Taking a long-term view of flexibility Against a background of rapid change, working patterns are becoming more flexible and diversified; consequently, individual workers must adjust to a less stable work environment. In an effort to bolster the required flexibility with the security of the European social model, Member States are seeking to develop flexible working arrangements in tandem with active labour market policies and modernised social security systems. This month, Eurofound’s latest report, Flexibility and security over the life course, examines the long-term effects of greater flexibility in employment contracts and working time on individuals’ employment status, income and occupational level. It is one of the first studies to look at this issue from a life-course, or longitudinal, perspective. Also this month, Eurofound sectoral studies highlight the key role that innovation must play in helping the commerce sector meet the challenges of a more complex environment. Representatives of companies in the sector, the social partners, SMEs and public authorities took part in a workshop held in Dublin on 19–20 November 2007, at which they examined the current state of the sector, and drew up an ‘agenda for change’. The findings of the research, together with the conclusions of the participants, are available online in a new sectoral studies dossier. Lastly, Eurofound has been invited to cooperate in three events over the course of the Slovenian EU Presidency: at a conference dealing with the integration of young people into the labour market, in Brdo in April, at the ‘7th European Meeting of People Experiencing Poverty’ in Brussels in May, and at a conference on the rights of disabled persons, in Kranjska Gora, also in May.

IN BRIEF News in pictures At the end of 2007, Eurofound concluded a major process of organisational development, part of which entailed changes in the focus and personnel of its research units. Following the reorganisation, the heads of Eurofound’s research units are (from left to right), Robert Anderson (Living Conditions and Quality of Life), Agnès Parent-Thirion (Monitoring and Surveys), Stavroula Demetriades (Industrial Relations and Workplace Development) and Donald Storrie (Employment and Competitiveness). News in brief Spotlight on European commerce sector Multinational companies working in the commerce sector in Europe need to be more innovative in order to meet the challenges posed by greater competition, complex supply chains, changing consumer trends and the difficulty of attracting skilled workers to the sector. Innovation, in terms of the type of stores, operations, products and branding, is a critical factor in boosting productivity and development. This was one of the recommendations that emerged at a workshop entitled ‘Commerce at the crossroads – the future of the commerce sector in Europe’ organised by Eurofound in Dublin on 19–20 November 2007. The conference marked the culmination of a research project that investigated the present state of the sector in Europe, looked in detail at selected company and city cases, and drew up future scenarios for possible directions that the sector might take over the coming decade. The complete EMCC dossier on the commerce sector is available online New resource packs coming in 2008 As part of its ongoing work in communicating findings from social policy research to a wider audience, Eurofound is creating a new series of resource packs, the themes of which will be drawn from priority European policy areas. For each theme, the resource pack will be a ‘one-stop shop’ for those seeking details of Eurofound’s research into the subject. Each pack will contain a factsheet highlighting the policy context, policy responses and main findings, as well as reports and résumés that Eurofound has published on the subject. For 2008, four packs will be produced and launched at key events that address that pack’s theme. The topics of the packs are active ageing, globalisation, flexicurity, and migration. Top 10 web downloads in 2007 Findings from Eurofound’s three key surveys – on working conditions, working time and quality of life – and their resulting analysis are the most popular items for download from Eurofound’s website, as revealed by an analysis of the trends of web usage over 2007. The most popular item for download during the year was the descriptive report for the fourth European Working Conditions Survey. Also occupying slots in the top 10 were two publications associated with the survey: a résumé summarising key findings of the survey (3), and another résumé looking at this and previous surveys, Fifteen years of working conditions in the EU: Charting the trends (7). Two reports analysing findings from the European survey on working time and work–life balance also make it into the top 10: Working time flexibility in European companies (5) and Working time and work–life balance in European companies (2). And finally, although the European Quality of Life Survey was carried out in 2003, its descriptive report, Quality of life in Europe, is still proving popular, ranking at 4 in the list. Read more about Eurofound’s surveys Social reality discussed in Scotland On 6 December, in Edinburgh, Eurofound participated in a seminar entitled ‘Social 		 Scotland and social Europe: Do they go together?’ that compared Scotland’s 		 ‘social reality’ with that of other EU Member States. Jointly organised 		 by the European Economic and Social Committee, the European Parliament 		 Office and the European Commission, the event linked in with the European 		 Commission’s programme of social reality stocktaking, a major public consultation 		 seeking views on a range of social changes facing European citizens. The 		 seminar was one of a series that will take place throughout Europe, aiming 		 to contribute to the debate on the reality of European society today and 		 on the European Social Model. It explored how Scotland compares with other 		 European countries in terms of the following: quality of life and work, 		 social and economic inclusion, child poverty, homelessness, gender equality 		 and family policy, labour market performance and decent jobs, and health-related 	 issues."	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-february-2008-2

Flexibility and security: a juggling act The success of countries such as Denmark in instituting flexicurity practices can serve as a model for other Member States in their efforts to balance flexibility and security; however, policymakers who want to make such reforms need to take account of national characteristics and change policies gradually, according to a new report from Eurofound, Flexibility and security over the life course. The research on which the report is based looked at the long-term impact of working in flexible contracts, and of working part time, on an individual’s career over the life course. The report argues that policies are needed to strengthen the employment security and prospects of people working on non-standard contracts, in order to compensate for the long-term negative effects that such work can have on their future income, employment status and career development. The study drew on earlier Eurofound research as well as European and national panel data for its analysis. Impact on career development The study found that working in flexible contracts has the potential to hinder individuals’ later career development. However, the impact of this differs depending upon the institutional arrangements present in particular countries: workers in some countries – Ireland and the UK, for instance – move more easily from flexible contracts into permanent employment, and suffer less of a ‘wage penalty’ (a lower income compared to those who have always been on permanent contracts); this may be due to the greater level of institutionalised flexibility in these countries. Company approaches The research findings also point to ways in which companies can better synchronise the business life cycle with the career path and life situation of workers. Companies can achieve this objective by offering their workers life-course oriented flexible working time options that meet the interests of both parties. This can boost the motivation and productivity of their workers and enhance relations between the employer and employees, which can be profitable to both sides. Support for working mothers Women are particularly affected in terms of working time flexibility and employment and income security; this is because they take time out of paid work for childbirth, and are more likely to work part time than are men. The report finds that, the longer they work part-time, the less likely are part-time workers (of whom the majority are women) to move into full time employment. When women work part time, they also experience much lower levels of wage growth over a 10-year period than do women who work full-time. The report proposes the provision of better income and employment support for working mothers with young children: this would make it easier for women with caring duties to catch up, in terms of income and employment status, over the course of their career, as well as contributing to equal opportunities and improved work–life balance.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1147	2008-01-20	UNK	"Press 

        release, 5 December 2007"	 Women, men and work in the EU The working conditions of both women and men throughout the European Union are analysed in detail in a new Eurofound report Gender and working conditions in the European Union. The report explores gender in the context of occupational segregation, working conditions, working time and subjective well-being. It includes an analysis of job satisfaction, work-life balance and health outcomes and looks at possible policy orientations. While men work longer paid hours, women’s composite working time, including employment, commuting and unpaid work at home, tends to be longer than that of men. This is the case whether women are in full-time or part-time employment. Women often choose part-time work due to the pressures of juggling paid employment with unpaid work at home. Full-timers, especially men, enjoy greater autonomy at work, while women are more exposed to the risk of violence, bullying, unwelcome sexual attention and discrimination. Published as the European Year on Equal Opportunities draws to a close, the report shows that three quarters of the EU workforce are managed by men. It found that among white-collar managers and professionals, women have less autonomy and are more likely to work shifts. Women are also more at risk of being paid low wages and of poverty. High poverty rates are particularly apparent for lone mothers and retired women. However, women are only half as likely as men to be contacted concerning their work outside working hours. This applies for both full-timers and part-timers and across all occupational groups. And women in clerical jobs or lower skilled blue-collar occupations express satisfaction with the fit between their working hours and non-work life. This is also the case for professionals, both male and female. Women also tend to have more regular schedules and are less involved in evening, night or weekend working. While women are less likely to have working-time autonomy, the most satisfied workers are those with some working-time autonomy and who work full-time but not more than 48 hours a week, even though they may work unsocial hours. Most women employed part-time do not want to change the number of hours they work. Nevertheless, one in three women would like longer hours in paid employment. Fears about job security affect clerical and blue-collar workers more than white-collar workers. The report underlines the gender inequality in unpaid domestic workloads. It suggests men be encouraged to avail of parental leave and seek to adjust their working hours. It also suggests curbing long full-time working hours, thereby facilitating a more equitable pattern of paid and unpaid working time. Childcare and eldercare responsibilities also need to be addressed. The report notes that long hours make jobs incompatible with family and other commitments for both men and women.

Director’s diary Looking forward to 2008 This year, 2008, is the fourth and final year in Eurofound’s current four-year work programme. The focus of the 2008 work programme is to complete the research and communication activities started over the past three years. Moreover, Eurofound will embark on two major activities during the year: carrying out fieldwork for the second European Company Survey and publishing findings from the second European Quality of Life Survey, carried out in 2007. Another goal for 2008 will be to enhance Eurofound’s collaboration with other organisations. Over the course of 2007, Eurofound cooperated on a number of successful projects with its sister EU agencies and other European bodies. Together with CEDEFOP, it co-published a report on mobility and skills development, while it signed a cooperation agreement with the European Training Foundation. At the end of the year, in conjunction with the Council of Europe (CoE), it produced the first report of its CLIP network, a joint project aimed at supporting the integration of migrants in European cities. In 2008, Eurofound intends to forge links with other EU agencies, including the new European Institute for Gender Equality, and will be working with the European Commission on a programme of sectoral research. Looking further ahead, Eurofound will be involved in a high-level conference on the theme of global competition and the location decisions of European companies, to be held in Poznan, Poland, on 3–5 June. The conference, co-organised with Pricewaterhouse Coopers, promises to make a significant contribution to understanding the impact of globalisation on European employment patterns and working conditions.

IN BRIEF News in pictures Pictured at Eurofound’s roadshow visit to Turkey on 29 November are Ahmet Erdem (left), Undersecretary in the Turkish Ministry of Labour and Social Security and Jorma Karppinen, Director of Eurofound. During the visit, Eurofound also met with representatives from employer organisations, trade unions and officials from the European Commission Delegation to Turkey. News in brief Strategies for integrating migrants in European cities With immigration on the rise in many countries, European cities face similar challenges in terms of integrating the new arrivals. These challenges range from the mundane (finding funds to provide the necessary services) to the complex (achieving integration without loss of identity). To provide a forum for the exchange of experience in this field, Eurofound, the Council of Europe and the City of Stuttgart jointly set up the European Network of Cities for Local Integration Policies for Migrants (CLIP) in 2006. The network’s first published report, Housing and integration of migrants in Europe, outlines strategies for assisting migrants with access to good, affordable housing and presents a number of innovative policy approaches undertaken by the 20 cities involved in the first phase of the project. The next phase of the CLIP project, which will involve 25 cities, deals with the effects of spatial segregation and the implementation of local diversity policies. Read the full report Perspectives on the changing family The traditional nuclear family of the working father, homemaking mother and several children is no longer the norm in Europe. Family matters, the title of the latest issue of Eurofound’s magazine series, Foundation Focus, examines how European social policy can respond constructively to changes in the family. The articles deal with a variety of topics related to the family, such as using flexible working time as a means of improving work–life balance, the challenges facing the childcare sector and the idea of adopting a life-course perspective in employment strategies. The issue also includes an interview with Marjeta Cotman, Slovenian Minister of Labour, Family and Social Affairs, who underlines the crucial role that employers can play in assisting their employees to balance work and family life. Download the latest Foundation Focus Maximising the benefits of mergers and acquisitions European integration and the gradual completion of the internal market are two of the driving factors behind the wave of mergers and acquisitions taking place across the EU in recent years. However, many of these mergers and acquisitions fail to meet initial expectations, in terms of creating company growth and shareholder value. This was a key finding of the latest EMCC company network seminar, organised by Eurofound together with international bank Grupo Santander in Madrid on 29–30 November. The increasingly international profile of many European firms has led to a search for new alliances, partnerships, buy-outs and takeovers in an attempt to exploit economies of scale and emerging markets. Participants at the seminar concluded that the principal challenges of any mergers and acquisitions process are appropriate planning and evaluation and the effective integration of company structures and human resources. More information on the event will be available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/emcc/ Designing policies to improve work–life balance Encouraging a greater uptake of part-time work among men, shortening the current 		 48-hour per week limit of the Working Time Directive, and ensuring paid 		 parental leave for both partners are all policy changes that could improve 		 European workers’ work–life balance and contribute to greater gender equality 		 in the home and in the workplace. The latest Foundation Findings from Eurofound, 		 Work–life balance: Solving the dilemma, proposes these and other measures 		 on the basis of its research into working time, industrial relations, working 		 conditions and quality of life. The Findings also recommends an increased 		 provision of childcare for children of school age, underlines the importance 		 of guaranteeing parents returning to work after parental leave their former 		 position, and puts forward the possibility of introducing more paid leave 		 during the so-called ‘rush hour’ of life as a quid pro quo for the likely 		 future postponement of retirement.

News in brief Improving the quality of the European Quality of Life Survey Eurofound’s first European Quality of Life Survey 2003 was an important contribution to social research in the EU. It analysed key social policy issues in the 25 countries of the European Union, conducted on a consistent, empirical basis for the first time. More remarkable was the fact that so much was achieved within a limited time and budgetary framework, in comparison to similarly ambitious initiatives. In preparation for the second survey, to be conducted in 2007, Eurofound has cooperated with research experts to assess the 2003 survey exercise and formulate recommendations aimed at improving the overall quality of the survey. Fieldwork for the second European Quality of Life Survey will commence in autumn 2007. Keep track of Eurofound’s work on quality of life Strengthening links with the European Parliament A delegation from the European Parliament’s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs visited the Foundation in early March. Csaba Öry (PPE-DE), Joel Hasse Ferreira (PSE), and Sepp Kusstatscher (Verts/ALE) were briefed on Eurofound’s most recent research initiatives, findings and recommendations during the two-day visit. Hungarian MEP Csaba Öry noted that he has been using Eurofound’s work for over 15 years, both as a member of the European Parliament and as a deputy in the Hungarian Parliament. ‘I have asked and I have always received replies that are worthwhile and valuable to me in my work,’ he said. Sepp Kusstatscher from Austria said that in his recent work on migrant workers he utilised Eurofound’s extensive research and recommendations on the subject. Joel Hasse Ferreira from Portugal expressed the opinion that Eurofound ‘takes good care of its information users’, and is deservedly and regularly reported on in the European media. Europe needs not just more but better mobility Eurofound will publish five new reports on worker mobility in the coming months, dealing with the following topics: job satisfaction and labour market mobility, occupational mobility, workers’ expectations regarding forced or voluntary mobility, international and regional migration intentions, and long-distance mobility. In its work on mobility, Eurofound argues that EU policymakers have to consider three different policy agendas regarding worker mobility. First is the right of freedom of movement for all citizens within EU Member States and the right of ‘non-discriminatory’ access to employment. Second are policies that centre on the Lisbon process and the European Employment Strategy – in these, governments should eliminate obstacles to voluntary mobility and encourage employees to go for more job-to-job and geographical mobility. Finally, there is the challenge to secure on the one hand economic gains resulting from a more efficient distribution of labour and on the other to prevent permanent mass migration of the better educated and younger participants in the labour market. Read more on this topic Social partners and social security systems Social security systems in the EU have traditionally provided a partial insurance against loss of income due to unemployment. In recent years, however, the focus has shifted from protecting the unemployed to activating unemployed people into re-entering the labour market. The recent comparative overview by Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) looks at similarities between unemployment benefit systems in Europe and examines the degree of social partner involvement in the different countries. The report covers 13 of the 15 former EU15 Member States, plus six new Member States (Cyprus, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia) and Norway.

Case studies highlight best practice Eurofound’s collection of online case studies of best practice continues to expand, with the launch of the ‘Attractive workplace for all’ online database of 79 cases, accessible from the Eurofound home page. The database contains examples of companies in six Member States that have implemented innovative measures in the workplace aimed at boosting both the level and the quality of employment. As a complement to the other research available on the Eurofound website, these case studies give concrete examples of best practice, which can be assessed, and potentially emulated. In addition, Eurofound has also just launched an online database of case studies detailing initiatives in the Member States that aim to assist people with a disability or chronic illness to return to work. Making workplaces attractive The aims of the Lisbon strategy include making Europe the most competitive knowledge-based global economy and boosting the quality and number of jobs. The case studies in the ‘Attractive workplace for all’ database indicate that many companies across Europe are contributing to this goal by introducing innovative employment policies and practices. They also demonstrate that companies can succeed financially while simultaneously ensuring good working and employment conditions for their employees. In the fully searchable database, cases are grouped by type of initiative, corresponding to key elements of the Lisbon strategy: business creation and entrepreneurship, employability, pay, flexibility and boosting the employment rates of underrepresented groups or people at risk of social inclusion. The cases show that the involvement of the social partners at company and sectoral level has been crucial to the development of these policies and their outcomes. Search the database Assisting people with disabilities back into employment The number of people claiming long-term disability payments is rising and this group is particularly at risk of social exclusion. Assisting people with a disability or chronic illness back into the workplace is vital in order to ease the pressure on Europe’s social security systems. One of the key strategies for helping long-term benefit claimants to return to work is a system of effective employment guidance and counselling services. This database documents the experience in 16 Member States in assisting citizens with disabilities in returning to work. The database should be of potential interest to a wide range of people, including professionals working in employment guidance services, rehabilitation professionals, policymakers and employers. Access the database Boosting the labour market presence of older workers Eurofound’s ‘Ageing workforce’ database highlights company initiatives in 27 EU Member States aimed at retaining older workers in employment. Increasing the participation of older people in employment is a key objective of European labour policies, and is also seen as a vital measure in easing the strains that social security systems will face in the future. The measures outlined in the case studies include initiatives regarding recruitment, health and ergonomics, and training and development. Approximately half of the cases document the evolution of initiatives first introduced in the 1990s, allowing an assessment of their success over time.

In this issue: Director's diary Working time developments in Europe Life satisfaction high in Romania In brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Life satisfaction high in Romania Romanians are generally optimistic about the future and show high levels of overall life satisfaction and happiness, despite poor material conditions and an inadequate standard of housing, according to the Foundation’s European Quality of Life Survey for Romania. Two out of five Romanians are having difficulties in making ends meet, according to findings from the Foundation’s research. The report shows that living conditions and employment in Romania have improved since 2003, and the country now has a stable, functioning market economy. However, the Foundation’s research reveals large income inequalities with particular pressure on single parents, large families and the unemployed. Three out of every four Romanians cannot afford a week’s annual holiday and one household out of three has built up debts for utility bills such as electricity, water and gas over the past 12 months. Strong sense of optimism about the future Despite poor material conditions and large income inequalities, Romanians indicate very high levels of overall life satisfaction, happiness and optimism about the future, closer to the levels found in the EU15 than in either the 10 new Member States or in Bulgaria and Turkey. Surprisingly, one in three Romanians is very optimistic about the future – a significantly higher figure than in the new Member States and former EU15. Job satisfaction and confidence in the education system Romanians indicate high levels of job satisfaction, higher than in the 25 EU Member States as a whole. Romanians also rate their sense of control in their jobs and their career prospects at levels similar to those in the New Member States. Almost one in five Romanians, however, feels that they might lose their job in the coming six months – double the figure for the EU25. The research also found that a great proportion of Romanians (70.4%), have completed at least a secondary level education – higher than the average levels in the 28 countries comprising the EU25, the acceding countries and Turkey (66.4%). Romanians also rate their education system as highly as do citizens in the in the EU15, significantly higher than citizens in Bulgaria and somewhat higher than citizens in the new Member States. Presenting the findings to policy makers in Romania The findings of the Foundation’s research will be presented to government officials and social partners in Bucharest, Romania, on 20–21 September. The Foundation visit, which forms part of its ongoing regular meetings with its stakeholders, includes bilateral meetings and a seminar to meet with academics and representatives from non-governmental organisations. The seminars will compare the findings in Romania with those in Bulgaria; the aim of the comparison is to determine if the two countries are subject to the same challenges as integration posed for the states that joined in 2004, or if they face new, specific challenges.

Gender inequality in the workplace Despite the entry of more women into the European labour force in recent years, the working conditions of women and men continue to differ significantly. A new report from Eurofound, Working conditions in the European Union: The gender perspective, explores differences between men’s and women’s work in key aspects of job quality: it finds that women have less autonomy at work, are more likely to work shifts and are paid less. Men, by contrast, work longer hours, are exposed to more physical risks and are more likely to be contacted about work outside working hours. For women, three key factors contribute to their unequal position in the workplace: the poor quality of part-time work, the low pay and low status of female-dominated jobs, and the under-representation of women in managerial positions. To foster greater gender equality and a better work–life balance, the report recommends creating strategies to encourage men to avail of parental leave, curbing long full-time working hours, and finding ways to support workers with childcare and eldercare responsibilities. High gender concentration in certain sectors The report is based on a secondary analysis of data gathered in 2005 from Eurofound’s fourth European Working Conditions Survey, which was carried out in 31 countries, including the now 27 EU Member States. The report analyses such aspects of quality of work as working hours, job satisfaction, work–life compatibility and work-related health outcomes. It examines changes in working conditions over time and focuses on the extent of occupational concentration of the sexes in certain sectors, looking at how this impacts on the quality of men’s and women’s working lives. For instance, women’s concentration in service sector workplaces (such as restaurants, hotels and healthcare facilities) makes them much more likely to be exposed to cigarette smoke and waste matter, and to be required to lift people as part of their tasks. Uneven distribution of household responsibilities The survey also makes clear that the high proportion of women engaged in part-time work plays a significant role in shaping women’s working conditions. More women than men work part time, generally in an attempt to juggle employment with domestic and care responsibilities at home. However, even when they work full time, women still shoulder the main responsibility for housework and childcare. Already an established trend in the EU15, this gender gap in working hours and care duties appears to be growing in the new Member States, with the potential to undermine the greater gender equality that has been enjoyed under the former socialist regimes. Working hours influence career opportunities The findings show that men work longer hours in paid employment than women. While this carries clear occupational risks, such as greater exposure to ambient or ergonomic hazards, it is also associated with greater autonomy and with more opportunities for working on complex tasks and solving problems. Working long, unsocial hours is also often required for promotion into higher managerial roles; the fact that women often tend to work part time can eliminate such opportunities for career development.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1155	2007-12-16	UNK	Communiqué July 2006	 Important notice! If you would like to receive Communiqué by email (10 issues a year), please sign up now. In this issue: Director's diary Europe’s manufacturing sector hard hit by job losses Higher wage increases across the EU In brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Europe’s manufacturing sector hard hit by job losses Manufacturing of food, textiles and clothing are the sectors losing most jobs in the European Union, according to the first annual review from the European Restructuring Monitor, the monitoring tool of the European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC). The report also highlights the outlook for employment growth, particularly unpromising in Eastern Europe. Since 2000, eight of the top ten sectors with declining employment in the EU15 have been in manufacturing. The report attributes the decline in manufacturing to ‘developments in the former EU15 countries, while the 10 new EU Member States are “holding-up well”’. Indeed, the report shows that while the manufacture of fabricated metal products is in the top ten declining sectors in former EU15, it is one of the top ten growth sectors in the ten new Member States, evidence of a geographical relocation of production. The report also identifies health, social work and education as sectors that have contributed to much of the EU15’s employment growth in recent years. Uneven employment growth patterns According to the report, Ireland and Spain have enjoyed high employment growth during the year. Pockets of high growth are also evident in parts of France, Italy, Greece, the UK and Sweden. In the new Member States, Cyprus and Latvia show the highest employment growth, together with some areas of Poland and the Czech Republic. Hotels, restaurants and business services account for the high levels of job growth, with business services leading the way: here growth is as high as 38% in the new Member States. However, the report cautions that the overall picture in eastern Europe is ‘rather bleak’, with the most significant decline in employment found in most of Poland and eastern Germany. In France, the region of Lorraine shows the worst employment decline. A more modest decline is evident in Greece, Italy, Denmark and the UK. Good practice examples The report, Restructuring and employment in the EU: Concepts, measurement and evidence, is based on the findings of the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM), which collects and presents cases of restructuring based on media reports on a quarterly basis. The report cites many good practice examples, such as that of IFE (one of the world’s largest producers of automatic door systems for rail vehicles). In November 2005, IFE closed its factory in Waidhofen in Austria and moved production to Brno in the Czech Republic, creating 120 jobs there. Throughout the year, the ERM has cited many similar cases, involving SMEs and industry. Further slowdown in primary industries The report notes that agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining and quarrying continue their long term relative decline, leading to ‘the loss of a very substantial number of jobs in 10 new EU Member States’. It anticipates that significant job loss will continue in the agricultural sector, especially in the new Member States, ‘for many years to come’, due to their adoption of the Common Agricultural Policy, and the CAP reforms taking place throughout the enlarged European Union.

Over the next 20 years, the average age of the working population will increase and the population of working age will decline. The challenge is how to develop the skills and employability of older workers, while maintaining the health and capacities of workers as they age. The Foundation’s expertise in age-related issues comprises one of the strands of its new communication campaign ‘Your work, your life: matching company needs with worker solutions’ which will run for the first six months of the year. During this period, it will present its comprehensive research into the barriers and opportunities for ageing workers, from the perspectives of companies and workers themselves, dating from the mid-1990s to the present. The Foundation will also publish a database of case studies offering an up-to-date resource of ideas, initiatives and incentives to respond to demands for better age management at the workplace. Finally, the ageing workforce is the topic of the next issue of Foundation Focus, to be published in April. This month, the Foundation will take its roadshow on quality of life to Finland during a visit to representatives of the social partners and the government on 8-9 February. Later, it will participate and bring its expertise to the European Year of Mobility in Brussels on 20-21 February.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1159	2007-12-16	UNK	Press release, 24 September 2001	" Quality - the driving force of economic growth Quality is the driving force of economic growth and quality jobs are the basis of prosperity in the knowledge society. This was the central message to emerge from two days of high-level debate at For a Better Quality of Work which concluded at the Palais d'Egmont, Brussels on Friday afternoon (September 21 2001). ""We need an active social partnership leading to income consistent with productivity"", according to Odile Quintin (Director General, European Commission DG-Employment and Social Affairs) in the concluding session of the Belgian EU presidency conference. Defining quality is never easy. While delegates agreed that quality of work indicators are necessary to measure progress in the workplace, there remain problems of data availability, data comparability and questions over which indicators to select. As Juan Chozas (Secretary of State for Employment, Spain) commented: ""It is easy to put forward vague concepts but hard to be practical"". His recommendation was that the Union should start with a small number of indicators which are comparable across member states. Spain prepares to take over the presidency of the European Union on January lst 2002. Despite the difficulties, further progress was made at the conference towards a set of European indicators of quality of work. Pascal Paoli (European Foundation) presented the conclusions of an expert working group representing, amongst others, the Belgian ministry of employment, Eurostat, the ILO, OECD, the French ministry of labour (DARES) and the European Foundation. Detailed indicators based on existing data sources were proposed for each of the ten quality of work dimensions outlined in the recent European Commission communication (""Employment and social policies: a framework for investing in quality"" (COM (2001) 313 final): Intrinsic job quality Skills, life-long learning and career developmen Gender equality Health and safety at work Flexibility and security Inclusion and access to the labour market Work organisation and work life balance Social dialogue and worker involvement Diversity and non-discrimination Overall work performance In her concluding remarks, Laurette Onkelinx (Deputy Prime Minister, Belgium) said the work of the conference would be carried forward to the summit meeting in Laeken in December. She referred to changing economic circumstances and said that ""lower rates of growth pose problems. There are now job losses, such as in airlines, which make our debate more difficult."" She concluded that there is now a consensus that quality produces quantity and it is on this consensus that we must continue to build.

IN BRIEF News in pictures Agnès Parent-Thirion, research coordinator of Eurofound’s working conditions unit, presents the European Working Conditions Survey report to Members of the European Parliament in the EP Employment working committee, in Brussels, Belgium, on 7 February 2007. At left, Barbara da Roit, Instituto per la ricerca sociale. News in brief Improving the quality of the European Quality of Life Survey Eurofound’s first European Quality of Life Survey 2003 was an important contribution to social research in the EU. It analysed key social policy issues in the 25 countries of the European Union, conducted on a consistent, empirical basis for the first time. More remarkable was the fact that so much was achieved within a limited time and budgetary framework, in comparison to similarly ambitious initiatives. In preparation for the second survey, to be conducted in 2007, Eurofound has cooperated with research experts to assess the 2003 survey exercise and formulate recommendations aimed at improving the overall quality of the survey. Fieldwork for the second European Quality of Life Survey will commence in autumn 2007. Keep track of Eurofound’s work on quality of life Strengthening links with the European Parliament A delegation from the European Parliament’s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs visited the Foundation in early March. Csaba Öry (PPE-DE), Joel Hasse Ferreira (PSE), and Sepp Kusstatscher (Verts/ALE) were briefed on Eurofound’s most recent research initiatives, findings and recommendations during the two-day visit. Hungarian MEP Csaba Öry noted that he has been using Eurofound’s work for over 15 years, both as a member of the European Parliament and as a deputy in the Hungarian Parliament. ‘I have asked and I have always received replies that are worthwhile and valuable to me in my work,’ he said. Sepp Kusstatscher from Austria said that in his recent work on migrant workers he utilised Eurofound’s extensive research and recommendations on the subject. Joel Hasse Ferreira from Portugal expressed the opinion that Eurofound ‘takes good care of its information users’, and is deservedly and regularly reported on in the European media. Europe needs not just more but better mobility Eurofound will publish five new reports on worker mobility in the coming months, dealing with the following topics: job satisfaction and labour market mobility, occupational mobility, workers’ expectations regarding forced or voluntary mobility, international and regional migration intentions, and long-distance mobility. In its work on mobility, Eurofound argues that EU policymakers have to consider three different policy agendas regarding worker mobility. First is the right of freedom of movement for all citizens within EU Member States and the right of ‘non-discriminatory’ access to employment. Second are policies that centre on the Lisbon process and the European Employment Strategy – in these, governments should eliminate obstacles to voluntary mobility and encourage employees to go for more job-to-job and geographical mobility. Finally, there is the challenge to secure on the one hand economic gains resulting from a more efficient distribution of labour and on the other to prevent permanent mass migration of the better educated and younger participants in the labour market. Read more on this topic Social partners and social security systems Social security systems in the EU have traditionally provided a partial insurance against loss of income due to unemployment. In recent years, however, the focus has shifted from protecting the unemployed to activating unemployed people into re-entering the labour market. The recent comparative overview by Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) looks at similarities between unemployment benefit systems in Europe and examines the degree of social partner involvement in the different countries. The report covers 13 of the 15 former EU15 Member States, plus six new Member States (Cyprus, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia) and Norway.

In this issue: Director's diary Flexible working time options: a win-win situation for all Catering for better working conditions Research and news in brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Director’s diary During 2006, the Foundation will bring its research findings and analysis on employment creation, industrial restructuring, worker mobility, and work–life balance to debates and social policymakers across the European Union. As outlined in its comprehensive programme of work for 2006, it will also present the results of the 2005 European Working Conditions Survey, and contribute to the 2006 European Year of Workers’ Mobility. The third Foundation Forum, devoted to the topic of competitiveness and globalisation, will take place in Dublin in November. The Foundation’s 2006 projects will explore geographical and labour market mobility, employment creation, and managing restructuring and its effects. The links between social dialogue, working time arrangements and reconciliation of work and personal/family life, as well as the attractiveness of workplace, will be the key topics related to the work–life balance issue. Other research will analyse the Europanisation of collective bargaining, industrial relations in the public sector, wage flexibility, the integration of migrants, and the social dimension of competitiveness. In the coming month, the Life’s jigsaw campaign will be launched. The campaign is designed to give an overview of how an ageing workforce, an uneven gender division, and working time constraints challenge Europe’s social structure, the social security system, as well as family and working patterns. During the coming six months, the Foundation will offer in-depth analysis based on its surveys, reports and cases studies and present possible solutions to the problems. In my new role as Director of the European Foundation, I am looking forward to an exciting and challenging year. I trust that through our research and analysis we can provide our customers with relevant and timely information. I extend my sincere wishes to you all for a successful and fulfilling year in 2006.

Director’s diary Advancing the debate on globalisation and flexicurity in Europe As globalisation continues, European labour markets face ever greater pressure to be more competitive. To meet this challenge, employers are demanding wider deregulation and more flexible labour markets. Meanwhile, European workers are seeking greater employment security and better job quality against a background of ongoing structural change and relocation of jobs. Industrial relations are in turn having to respond to these conflicting demands and to the transformations taking place in labour markets. Eurofound has actively contributed to the debate surrounding these key policy themes of globalisation and flexibility. A wide range of publications have been produced on the issues in recent months and two new reports are currently being prepared: one on European industrial relations and flexicurity, and another on the challenges that globalisation poses to industrial relations. Furthermore, Eurofound is preparing to host a high-level seminar on ‘The challenges of globalisation for labour market policies and social dialogue: The wider perspective’ in Dublin in early November. Taking part in the seminar will be Tarja Halonen, President of Finland, Micheál Martin TD, Irish Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and social partner representatives from Finland and Ireland. During the coming month, Eurofound will present a background paper at a European Parliament hearing on 12 September on the role of the minimum wage in social inclusion, while on 13 September, research staff will address a conference in Lisbon organised by the Portuguese EU Presidency on the issue of flexicurity.

        release, 7 November 2007"	 Social capital creates jobs in rural Europe (Lisbon, 7 November 2007) Involvement in social networks in rural Europe enhances economic development, promotes entrepreneurialism, aids social inclusion and creates jobs. This is the key finding of a new report Social capital and job creation in rural Europe published by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound), the Dublin-based EU agency. The findings of the report will be presented at a conference of the same title to be held in Lisbon, Portugal, on November 8-9. Social capital is defined in the report as ‘the interaction of individuals within formal and informal networks that builds trust, communication, participation and a cultural dimension’. Building of social capital is a key resource to counter the problems in many rural parts of Europe: outward migration of young and educated people; demographic ageing; high unemployment; poor infrastructure and inadequate public services. ‘Eurofound’s report is important given the shift in recent years from an approach which focused exclusively on agriculture to one emphasising broader rural job creation,’ says Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director, ‘The new territorial approach includes other sectors like forestry, tourism, food processing and services together with existing assets like natural and cultural amenities.’ The report gives examples of how regional and local authorities, social partners and NGOs in 10 EU countries - Bulgaria, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Spain - created jobs through social capital and it makes policy recommendations for rural job creation throughout Europe. It argues that it is not enough to rely on individuals’ private actions. Instead, social capital needs to be supported by policymakers at EU, national, regional and local levels, and by social partners, public authorities and NGOs. They need to design and implement strategies to build social capital to foster rural jobs. The report identifies strategies and programmes used in 15 case studies. All focused upon existing social networks or created new ones. Partnerships were important in many of the initiatives. Some involved partnerships between government, social partners and NGOs. Others saw public-private partnerships develop policy or empower rural enterprises. Business clusters or networks were important, such as for the joint distribution of products, building on local traditions or strengthening the local tourism sector. While each rural area is distinctive and that which works in one region might not be replicated elsewhere, the report provides a helpful overview of what can be done – and demonstrates the effectiveness of social capital initiatives. The conference is being organised by Eurofound in cooperation with the European Commission’s Leader+ Observatory, the Leader+ Portuguese Network, and the Portuguese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. The event is open to journalists and takes place at the Holiday Inn, Av. Antonio José de Almeida 28-A, Lisbon 1000-044, Portugal.

The annual update from the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO), which examines wage developments in the current EU Member States, the acceding countries and Norway, reveals a trend towards moderation. It shows that the average collectively agreed nominal wage increases across the EU and Norway were 3.5% in 2002, compared to 3.1% in 2003. Taking account of lower inflation, average real income rose by 0.2% from 2002 to 2003. In the 10 acceding countries, however, the average nominal pay increases rose to 8.7% in 2003, up from 8.1% in 2002, while on average real pay increased by 3.9% in 2003, compared to 2.8% in 2002. Adding productivity into the equation Some trade unions take the total of the increase in inflation and productivity – the distributive margin – as the target for pay rises and other negotiated improvements in collective bargaining. Comparative data available for 24 countries over the past two-year period, although blurred by methodological and statistical difficulties, show that bargaining outcomes in Belgium, Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway and Romania exceeded the distributive margin. The biggest shortfalls were noted in Greece, Ireland, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia over the same period. ‘The EU’s broad economic guidelines on pay, which suggest that increases in nominal wages should be consistent with price stability and that increases in real wages should not exceed growth in labour productivity, were observed in most EU Member States,’ says Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s Acting Director, in response to the findings. ‘The results of the comparative survey suggest a definite trend towards wage moderation across Europe.’ Collective bargaining coverage While more than two-thirds of workers in the EU Member States have their pay and working conditions set by collective agreements, bargaining coverage in the acceding countries is generally lower, averaging about four out of every 10 workers. In the enlarged Europe of 25 countries, approximately two-thirds of the workforce will be covered by collective bargaining.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-2-2004-3

In this issue: Director's diary Temporary agency work in an enlarged European Union Minimum wages: a global perspective In brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Minimum wages: a global perspective The EU Member States and acceding countries, as well as Brazil, China, Japan and the USA, have in place a system for regulating pay at the lower end of their labour markets, providing a floor for wage levels across the economy. These are some of the results from the report, Key themes in global industrial relations: Minimum wages and relocation of production, from the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). The report examines in detail the operation of the minimum wage system across the different countries. Within the EU, the minimum wage in 2005 ranged from about EUR115 per month in Latvia to slightly over EUR1,500 in Luxembourg – 13 times the Latvian figure. The two acceding countries Bulgaria and Romania have even lower minimum wage rates: EUR77 and EUR86 respectively. Looking beyond Europe, the federal minimum wage level in the United States is the equivalent of EUR700 per month. That is the same as the average regional minimum wage in Japan. This places the US and Japanese economies between the higher minimum-wage Northern Europe, and the lower minimum-wage Mediterranean countries and Slovenia. The report determines the equivalent figure for Brazil as being EUR110 per month, while it concludes that is not possible to establish a minimum wage level for China. Support from trade unions In countries with a statutory minimum wage system, trade unions appear be unanimous in their support for this type of wage floor, viewing it as a potentially effective way of combating poverty and low pay. However, trade unionists in the economies studied appear to agree that the minimum wage is currently set too low – hence it fails to protect the incomes of employees. Expanding the scope of research Since 2001, EIRO has produced an annual comparative report examining industrial relations developments in the EU, Japan and USA. The report studies both the actors (trade unions and employer organisations) and the processes (collective bargaining, labour legislation and employer involvement). Each annual edition includes a thematic approach to a particular pertinent issue. This year’s edition develops the thematic approach further, concentrating on the issues of minimum wages and the industrial relations aspects of relocation of production. It also expands the geographical scope of the report, including information from two developing countries, Brazil and China. The issues of minimum wages and relocation have visible effects on the development of industrial relations in the EU, Japan and USA, and in the emerging economies of Brazil and China, as a result of globalisation and intensifying international competition.

People in Germany rate their health and social services very highly but are also found to be among the least optimistic about the future in Europe. The Foundation presented the findings of its European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) to representatives of governments, social partners and civil society in Germany and Poland in early July. The visits marked the first stop of a road-show tour, bringing the results of the survey to all EU25 and three candidate countries. Discussions in Poland focused on people in Poland reporting lower than average levels of life satisfaction, at the same time as expressing a greater difficulty in making ends meet than people in the other nine new EU Member States. In Germany, discussions centred on the report revealing that Germans are found to be the least optimistic about the future compared to the citizens in the former EU15, the new Member States and the three candidate countries. However, Germans rate their health and social services very highly, compared to the citizens in the former EU15, the new Member States and the three candidate countries. The Foundation’s research on quality of life in Europe, based on 26,000 face-to-face interviews across 28 European countries, sheds light on the living conditions, subjective well-being and individuals’ perceptions of their society. Measuring perceptions of well-being ‘ In order to foster cohesion in a larger and more diversified European Union, policymakers and civil society actors need first of all to know not only how people live, but also how they perceive their situation: how individual quality of life is measured,’ says Willy Buschak, acting Director of the Foundation. ‘The results of our European Quality of Life Survey provide a unique portrait of quality of life in the enlarged Europe and in the three candidate countries.’ 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-4-2004-2

In this issue: Director's diary Flexible working arrangements in Europe Embarking on the new work programme In brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Flexible working arrangements in Europe The highest proportion of companies and organisations offering flexible working time arrangements in Europe are to be found in Latvia, Sweden, Finland and the United Kingdom, the first findings from the Foundation’s new establishment survey on working time reveals. At the opposite end of the scale, Cyprus, Portugal, Greece and Hungary have the fewest companies offering such arrangements. The Foundation will present the findings of the survey at Employment Week 2006 in Brussels, Belgium on 17 May. Working time has long been a central element in political and social debate in the European Union. The duration, organisation and predictability of working time raise questions about the health, well-being and wider social life of workers, and about the productivity, efficiency and competitiveness of enterprises. The background to the Foundation’s new survey, however, is the Lisbon strategy’s goal of increasing employment rates across Europe. Central to this is the need to attract more people into employment and to retain them. ‘Meeting the ambitious targets of the Lisbon agenda demands a clear understanding of the dynamics of the modern workplace and the societal factors that are impacting on the way we work. This will be necessary in order to be able to develop and implement targeted strategies that will secure a leading position for the EU and its citizens in today’s global marketplace,’ says Jorma Karppinen, the Foundation’s Director. Significant differences in practice On average, flexible working time arrangements exist in about one in two (48%) establishments with ten or more employees in Europe. There is, however, a wide variety of such flexi-time schemes in operation. Some 16% of the establishments surveyed operate schemes that permit workers to only vary their starting and finishing times on the same day. More sophisticated schemes, allowing the accumulation of credit or debit hours, are found in 7% of the establishments surveyed. A further 12% of establishments offer at least some of their workers the opportunity to take full days off in compensation for accumulated credit hours. Finally, 13% of establishments offer the most advanced flexible working time option, one which permits workers to compensate for credit hours by taking longer periods off work. The impact of flexi-time arrangements The survey results confirm that both the establishments and the employees can benefit from the introduction of working-time arrangements, with satisfaction levels for employers and employees ranging from 61–73%. More than half of all managers (54%) report that flexible working time arrangements have contributed to a ‘better adaptation of working hours to the workload’. Other positive indicators include lower levels of absenteeism and a reduction of paid overtime. Negative consequences, such as communication problems or increased costs, are reported by only a minority of managers. Raising awareness under the 'Your Work, Your Life' campaign The Foundation will present the findings of the survey on working time at Employment Week 2006 in Brussels, Belgium on 17 May. The presentation of the results is part of the ‘Your Work, Your Life’ campaign, designed to raise awareness of the issues currently facing Europe and its workplaces. The campaign explores the implications for working life of demographic ageing, gender mainstreaming and new working patterns, as well as strategies for achieving a satisfactory work–life balance.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-may-2006-0

Director’s diary Tackling the low employment levels of women Just over half of women (56.3%) are employed across Europe today, well below the target of 60% set out in the Lisbon strategy. The employment rate of men is already above target (71.3%), so strategies to provide more people with jobs must necessarily focus on the particular problems facing women when entering or rejoining the workforce. The main reason for the lower female employment rate is that women spend considerably more time on family and household responsibilities, making it difficult for them to participate fully in the labour market. Adapting European jobs to become more family-friendly is, therefore, not only good for workers and their families, but vital in order to ensure progress towards the EU objective of making Europe ‘the most competitive economy in the world’. Coinciding with the 2007 European Year of Equal Opportunities, Eurofound will publish new research on gender equality in terms of working conditions, pay, and living conditions. Issue no. 3 of Foundation Focus, due to be published at the end of April, is devoted to the topic of equal opportunities. The aim of the Foundation Focus series is to explore a subject of social and economic policy importance and hence contribute to argument and debate on key issues. In April, Eurofound will contribute to a series of high-level conferences and events under the German EU Presidency. First, there is the conference on Work–life balance in Europe, organised by the German Ministry for Family, Senior citizens, Women and Youth, and the Bertelsmann Foundation in Berlin on 25 April. This is followed by the conference on the Attractiveness of the European and American social models in Berlin on 7-8 May. Eurofound will also present its Annual Report for 2006, highlighting achievements of the previous year.

News in brief Eurofound briefs European Parliament Integration of third-country migrants in Member States should be a two-way process, balancing the rights and obligations of both migrants and the host society, according to a background paper that Eurofound research staff presented to a meeting of the European Parliament’s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on 8 October. The paper, Integration of third-country migrants, based on Eurofound’s research and the experience of its network of cities for local integration policies (CLIP), also outlines key principles for successful integration and stresses the importance of joint development of polices for economic immigration and integration. Eurofound continued to brief policymakers at a hearing of the Parliament’s Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality on 21 November, where it presented research findings on women’s experience of harassment and violence at the workplace, gleaned from its fourth European Working Conditions Survey. Read the background paper Social capital can boost rural job creation Rural communities can develop economically and create jobs by focusing on social capital, according to Eurofound research presented at a conference, Social capital and job creation in rural Europe in Lisbon on 8–9 November. Rural Europe has experienced profound change in recent decades, such as job losses due to changes in the agricultural sector and the migration of young people towards urban centres. However, one resource available to rural areas is their ‘social capital’ – individuals participating in formal or informal networks, in which higher levels of trust develop. Belonging to networks can increase a person’s knowledge, employability and creativity; in local rural areas, this can in turn stimulate innovation, entrepreneurship and economic growth. Practitioners, researchers and policymakers participated in the conference, which took place during the Portuguese EU Presidency. Programme and presentations are available Out-of-school care benefits disadvantaged areas Out-of-school care facilities and services for school-age children (between five and 12 years) are often lacking or inadequate in disadvantaged areas in Europe, according to a new report from Eurofound, Out-of-school care services for children living in disadvantaged areas. The report outlines the benefits that the provision of such care can bring to both families and communities: it can facilitate women in entering and remaining in the workforce and make a substantial contribution to children’s welfare, while in disadvantaged areas, out-of-school care can contribute to tackling poverty and problem behaviour. The findings of the report will be discussed at a joint seminar organised by Eurofound, the European Commission and the OECD, on Mutual learning tools for more family-friendly policies and better childcare provision, to be held in Brussels on 28 November. Download the full report and the seminar programme Globalisation and flexicurity in the spotlight A failure by European industrial relations systems to adjust to the globalising world economy could have profound impacts, according to a new report from Eurofound, Impact of globalisation on industrial relations in the EU and other major economies. Published to coincide with the visit by Finnish president, Tarja Halonen, the report compares industrial relations systems across in the EU Member States with those in its key global competitors. Through an analysis of the various components of industrial relations systems, it attempts to identify which type of social model may survive in terms of global competition. Its companion report, Approaches to flexicurity: EU models, looks at flexicurity as a way of modernising the European social model: it compares various flexicurity options, examines models of best practice and identifies the challenges of implementing flexicurity practices, while highlighting the crucial role played by the social partners in the process.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-novemberdecember-2007-2

However, more than two in five persons (44%) who work long hours – over 48 hours a week – report being unhappy with their work–life balance. The survey found that men, particularly working fathers, report more dissatisfaction with their work–life balance than women. Standard working hours are still the norm for most workers in Europe. In the 25 EU Member States and the two EU acceding countries Bulgaria and Romania, working hours for the majority of the workforce revolve around a five-day, 40-hour week. Over 55% of all workers work the same number of hours every day, and over 70% work the same number of days every week. The proportion of people working non-standard hours (working at night or at weekends) has fallen slightly since 1995. In the coming month, the Foundation will present the first findings from its flagship survey, the fourth European Working Conditions Survey. Also in November, the third Foundation Forum will take place over three days in Dublin Castle, with close to 200 participants, including 11 Ministers from around Europe and the world. The debates will focus on the compatibility or otherwise of the European social model with the pressure for increased productivity in today’s society.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1180	2007-12-16	UNK	Background note, 12 October 2004	" THE EUROPEAN QUALITY OF LIFE SURVEY (EQLS): Czechs rate health as major factor in high life satisfaction levels Choose your preferred language option: CS (PDF, 172 KB) 	 	This survey was carried out by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in the EU25 and three candidate countries (Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey) in May-August 2003. Interviews were face-to-face and the unit of interview was the sampled individual although certain items relating to characteristics of the household were included in the questionnaire. 	 	 	 The EQLS represents an ambitious attempt to explore quality of life in a wide range of countries. It is a major source of information, highlighting the opportunities and challenges the EU faces in the light of recent enlargement. The survey enables an accurate picture of the social situation in the enlarged Union to be drawn, a picture that includes both objective and subjective elements. At the same time, it should be noted that there are some limitations to the data. While the sample sizes of around 1.000 per country provide a general population profile, they are too small to allow for detailed analysis of sub-groups, such as immigrants or single parent families. Furthermore, although the wide range of topics covered by the survey is on the one hand a clear advantage, it also means that none of the topics could be treated in great depth. Some of the dimensions of quality of life are measured with a narrower set of indicators than one would use in highly-specialised surveys. However, the strength of the survey is that it provides a synthesis of information on the main aspects of quality of life, both objective and subjective. 	 Improving health status a crucial task in the new Member States 	 	 Being in good health is an important factor for enjoying a high quality of life. In the new Member States and the candidate countries, the self-rated health status is on average worse than in the EU15. Compared to the latter, poor health status is reported 2.5 times more often by the citizens living in the new Member States, and two times more in the candidate countries, respectively. About one third of the population in the new Member States report having a long-standing illness, compared to one fifth in the former EU15. People living in post-communist countries report health problems more frequently than those living in Cyprus, Malta or Turkey. These findings for individual health correspond with widespread dissatisfaction with the quality of the health services and with reported difficulties in access to medical care in post-communist countries. 	 NMS citizens less satisfied with quality of life, but equally optimistic 	 	 The report found that subjective well-being is lower in the new Member States than in the former EU15, reflecting gaps found in objective living conditions, especially economic resources and living standards, working conditions and health. In most EU15 countries, the least satisfied groups are still more satisfied than the most satisfied groups in the new Member States and the candidate countries. Material living conditions are of paramount importance for citizens’ subjective well-being, but aspects of ‘loving’ and ‘being’ also impact on how satisfied people are with their lives. 	 More house owners in the new Member States but worse housing conditions 	 	 One in five households in the new Member States and one in three in the candidate countries lack an indoor flushing toilet or have housing problems such as rot in windows, damp and leaks, the survey reveals. Fewer than 10% of households in the former EU15 face such problems. The housing conditions confirm the general picture of poorer living conditions in the new Member States and three candidate countries. By and large, living space is smaller, homes are less comfortable, and the neighbourhood less secure. However, home ownership is much more common in the new Member States and the candidate countries. Nearly 75% live in their own dwelling compared to 60% in the EU15. 	 Strong family ties 	 	 In all 28 countries, families and friends are shown to be a crucial factor in providing social integration and support. In both groups of countries, a huge majority of the population – around 80-95% – can count on help from relatives, friends or neighbours when personal problems arise; and in all countries, people rely primarily on family members. In general, support from family members is found to be more important in the new Member States and the candidate countries than in the EU15. Strong family ties in the new Member States and the candidate countries are also indicated by a higher frequency of contacts with other family members. Here, around 85% have frequent contact with parents or children, compared to 72% in the EU15. 	 Methodology 	 	 A single standard questionnaire was used. The questionnaire was originally drafted in English by a consortium of research institutes and was then translated into the national languages of the Member States, using back-translation methods to check the accuracy of the translation. It was designed to fit into a 35 minute interview in light of the available fieldwork budget. The questionnaire covers a broad spectrum of life domains with an emphasis upon employment, housing, family, social and political participation, quality of society and subjective well-being. 	 	 	 The fieldwork was carried out by Intomart, a European private sector data collection agency, which coordinates a network of partner agencies spanning the 28 countries. Methods of sample selection varied but consisted mainly of ‘random walk’ methods to select households and random selection of individuals aged 18 and over within households. In all countries, the sampling method was designed to provide a fully randomised sample. The overall response rate was 58% but response rates varied widely, ranging from under 35% in Ireland and Spain to a reported 91% in Germany. For 23 of the countries, the achieved sample size was around 1,000 cases. For five smaller states (Cyprus, Malta, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Estonia) the sample size was approximately 600. The total achieved sample consisted of 26,257 cases. Sample data were re-weighted by age, sex and region to conform to national population patterns. After data collection the data were checked extensively by the Social Science Centre in Berlin (WZB). More than 50 macro-indicators were added at this stage in order to provide a linkage between respondents’ reports (e.g. household income) and the social situation of the country (e.g. GDP per capita). 	 Next steps 	 	 Analysis of results from the survey has begun with a review of the main findings in relation to country and demographic characteristics. This provides the basis for a descriptive report of how countries differ in some respects, and how the results are related to the characteristics of social groups. There are no extensive attempts to explain why such differences arise. More detailed analysis is underway to examine the data on more specific themes and to improve understanding of the results. Four reports are nearing completion on: 	 Quality of life, subjective well-being and perception of society; Households and family, social networks and community life ; Living standards and resources, income and employment, subsistence economy, deprivation and exclusion; Housing and local environment . Further in-depth analysis is being commissioned and papers based upon the analytical reports will be published from 2005.

In this issue: Director's diary Flexible working arrangements in Europe Embarking on the new work programme In brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Flexible working arrangements in Europe The highest proportion of companies and organisations offering flexible working time arrangements in Europe are to be found in Latvia, Sweden, Finland and the United Kingdom, the first findings from the Foundation’s new establishment survey on working time reveals. At the opposite end of the scale, Cyprus, Portugal, Greece and Hungary have the fewest companies offering such arrangements. The Foundation will present the findings of the survey at Employment Week 2006 in Brussels, Belgium on 17 May. Working time has long been a central element in political and social debate in the European Union. The duration, organisation and predictability of working time raise questions about the health, well-being and wider social life of workers, and about the productivity, efficiency and competitiveness of enterprises. The background to the Foundation’s new survey, however, is the Lisbon strategy’s goal of increasing employment rates across Europe. Central to this is the need to attract more people into employment and to retain them. ‘Meeting the ambitious targets of the Lisbon agenda demands a clear understanding of the dynamics of the modern workplace and the societal factors that are impacting on the way we work. This will be necessary in order to be able to develop and implement targeted strategies that will secure a leading position for the EU and its citizens in today’s global marketplace,’ says Jorma Karppinen, the Foundation’s Director. Significant differences in practice On average, flexible working time arrangements exist in about one in two (48%) establishments with ten or more employees in Europe. There is, however, a wide variety of such flexi-time schemes in operation. Some 16% of the establishments surveyed operate schemes that permit workers to only vary their starting and finishing times on the same day. More sophisticated schemes, allowing the accumulation of credit or debit hours, are found in 7% of the establishments surveyed. A further 12% of establishments offer at least some of their workers the opportunity to take full days off in compensation for accumulated credit hours. Finally, 13% of establishments offer the most advanced flexible working time option, one which permits workers to compensate for credit hours by taking longer periods off work. The impact of flexi-time arrangements The survey results confirm that both the establishments and the employees can benefit from the introduction of working-time arrangements, with satisfaction levels for employers and employees ranging from 61–73%. More than half of all managers (54%) report that flexible working time arrangements have contributed to a ‘better adaptation of working hours to the workload’. Other positive indicators include lower levels of absenteeism and a reduction of paid overtime. Negative consequences, such as communication problems or increased costs, are reported by only a minority of managers. Raising awareness under the 'Your Work, Your Life' campaign The Foundation will present the findings of the survey on working time at Employment Week 2006 in Brussels, Belgium on 17 May. The presentation of the results is part of the ‘Your Work, Your Life’ campaign, designed to raise awareness of the issues currently facing Europe and its workplaces. The campaign explores the implications for working life of demographic ageing, gender mainstreaming and new working patterns, as well as strategies for achieving a satisfactory work–life balance.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-may-2006-0

EUROFOUND_UNK_1184	2007-12-16	UNK	Press release, 5 February 2001	 Changing life and work patterns Traditional working patterns no longer apply in most European homes. A large majority of men want their partners to work and nearly all single working women (93%) expect to work regardless of whether they are married or have a child, according to the findings of a European-wide survey, Employment Options of the Future, carried out by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Working and Living Conditions. The findings of the survey indicate that people's preferences for how, when and where they work differ substantially from the work options that the labour market currently offers them. Overall, men want to reduce long working hours. Up to 20 per cent of employed men are interested in part time work while15 per cent of employed men (with partners) would prefer both partners to work part time yet only 2% currently do so. While single women expect to work after childbirth this may not be a realistic expectation in present circumstances. More than one third of women (aged 30-39) work part time to allow more time for child care. Serious policy considerations arise; if women work shorter hours they will earn less, have poor career paths and lesser or no social benefits. Approximately half of all women in the EU and Norway aged between 16 and 64-years are currently employed. The employment rate of women varies considerably from country to country. While 58% of the married or cohabiting working women work full-time and 38% are not in paid work. The majority of married or cohabiting working women have a partner who also works, mostly full-time, and are happy with the model of the dual wage earner family, though they would prefer part-time work, both for themselves as for their partners. Just over 70% of all men aged between 16 and 64 years are currently employed. The waste majority of married or cohabiting employed men work full-time. Men are generally more often in paid work and have longer working hours than their partners. The couples' preferences still include gender-specific differences, but to a lesser degree. Indeed, there is an increased interest in part-time work for both men and women, that means for a more equal sharing of labour market participation and working time. The findings indicate there is significant scope introduce measures which would lead to more balanced participation in paid employment between genders: enhancing part time possibilities for men; increased support for women returners and social protection system which takes into account flexible working hours. The Employment Options of the Future survey is a large scale representative survey conducted in 1998 in 15 member states of the EU and in Norway. The survey was designed to find out who wants to work and who doesn't. If people want to work the survey deals with their preferences as far as contractual aspects (dependent employment vs. self- employment), time aspects (actual and preferred weekly working hours, overtime, sabbaticals), space (work at home) and motivational aspects (reasons for taking up paid work) are concerned. The survey does not only ask for present work options but has a special interest in the future: What do people think will change over the next five years in their personal situation (marital status, children, care of elderly or ill persons), in the general economic situation, in their own economic situation and in the situation on the labour market. And - taking into account the probable changes over the next five years - what will be the work options of the people in five years time?	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/press-release-5-february-2001

In this issue: Director's diary Families, work and social networks Social partners, redundancies and redundancy costs Research and news in brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Families, work and social networks Despite challenges to the traditional concept of the family, family life and support are synonymous with what makes a good quality of life. However, the new forms of family in existence today call for a broader scope of policymaking. In its new report, Families, work and social networks, the Foundation puts forward a case for family-oriented policies. The report reveals that the traditional concept of the family is challenged by young people marrying later, increasing levels of cohabitation as a substitute for marriages, and current low birth rates, as well as other factors, such as the ageing of the population and an increased participation of women in paid work. Despite these challenges, Europeans place a high value on family support in helping to cope with everyday life, as well as it being key to social integration and inclusion. The report argues that employment, equal opportunities and education policies should take greater account of family needs and arrangements.  	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-october-2005-0

IN BRIEF News in pictures Pictured at a high-level seminar on The challenges of globalisation for the EU labour market and social dialogue, hosted by Eurofound on November 13, are, from left to right, Kieran Mulvey, Chief Executive of the Labour Relations Commission, Ireland, Billy Kelleher TD, Minister for Labour Affairs, Ireland, Paul Sweeney, Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Virve Vimpari, European Commission, Tarja Halonen, President of the Republic of Finland, Jorma Karppinen, Director of Eurofound, and Dr Pentti Arajärvi, University of Joensuu. News in brief Eurofound briefs European Parliament Integration of third-country migrants in Member States should be a two-way process, balancing the rights and obligations of both migrants and the host society, according to a background paper that Eurofound research staff presented to a meeting of the European Parliament’s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on 8 October. The paper, Integration of third-country migrants, based on Eurofound’s research and the experience of its network of cities for local integration policies (CLIP), also outlines key principles for successful integration and stresses the importance of joint development of polices for economic immigration and integration. Eurofound continued to brief policymakers at a hearing of the Parliament’s Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality on 21 November, where it presented research findings on women’s experience of harassment and violence at the workplace, gleaned from its fourth European Working Conditions Survey. Read the background paper Social capital can boost rural job creation Rural communities can develop economically and create jobs by focusing on social capital, according to Eurofound research presented at a conference, Social capital and job creation in rural Europe in Lisbon on 8–9 November. Rural Europe has experienced profound change in recent decades, such as job losses due to changes in the agricultural sector and the migration of young people towards urban centres. However, one resource available to rural areas is their ‘social capital’ – individuals participating in formal or informal networks, in which higher levels of trust develop. Belonging to networks can increase a person’s knowledge, employability and creativity; in local rural areas, this can in turn stimulate innovation, entrepreneurship and economic growth. Practitioners, researchers and policymakers participated in the conference, which took place during the Portuguese EU Presidency. Programme and presentations are available Out-of-school care benefits disadvantaged areas Out-of-school care facilities and services for school-age children (between five and 12 years) are often lacking or inadequate in disadvantaged areas in Europe, according to a new report from Eurofound, Out-of-school care services for children living in disadvantaged areas. The report outlines the benefits that the provision of such care can bring to both families and communities: it can facilitate women in entering and remaining in the workforce and make a substantial contribution to children’s welfare, while in disadvantaged areas, out-of-school care can contribute to tackling poverty and problem behaviour. The findings of the report will be discussed at a joint seminar organised by Eurofound, the European Commission and the OECD, on Mutual learning tools for more family-friendly policies and better childcare provision, to be held in Brussels on 28 November. Download the full report and the seminar programme Globalisation and flexicurity in the spotlight A failure by European industrial relations systems to adjust to the globalising world economy could have profound impacts, according to a new report from Eurofound, Impact of globalisation on industrial relations in the EU and other major economies. Published to coincide with the visit by Finnish president, Tarja Halonen, the report compares industrial relations systems across in the EU Member States with those in its key global competitors. Through an analysis of the various components of industrial relations systems, it attempts to identify which type of social model may survive in terms of global competition.

Quality of life in Croatia Raising living standards, boosting educational levels and encouraging greater social cohesion represent some of the challenges facing policymakers in Croatia, according to a new report from Eurofound. The report, which examines a range of aspects relating to quality of life in the candidate country, identifies a number of key issues with which Croatian citizens are dissatisfied. The low level of household income (and inequalities in its distribution), large regional differences in economic development, slow job creation and a high rate of long-term unemployment all give grounds for concern. Croatian citizens also express dissatisfaction with the quality of their public institutions and services and are concerned about social tensions. On the positive side, a substantial majority say they are happy with their personal health, their family life, personal relationships, the environment and national security. In addition, the level of home ownership is high. Croatia seen in a wider European context The report draws its data from a range of findings, in particular the Quality of Life Survey conducted by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Croatia in 2006. This survey used a questionnaire that Eurofound had developed for its own European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS), conducted in 2003. (Croatia was not included in that first wave of the survey). The survey provides, for the first time, data and internationally comparable indicators that paint a comprehensive picture of life in Croatia in a European context. Uphill struggle ahead While Croatians rate some aspects of their quality of life highly, other areas pose considerable challenges for policymakers. The biggest challenge is to boost living standards: with average household incomes of around €300 per month, Croatia exhibits considerable inequalities in income distribution. Moreover, average levels of educational attainment are poor, with over 40% of the population not having progressed beyond a primary level of education. Levels of trust and social cohesion are low: one third of citizens feel that caution is necessary when dealing with other people, 35% feel that tensions exist among ethnic groups, and 62% are concerned about tensions between rich and poor. Multi-dimensional and holistic approach The report makes a number of recommendations to address the challenges facing the country. Regionally balanced economic development is needed to sustain growth and create good-quality jobs; the focus on employment policy needs to shift from income support to training to encourage the unemployed into work; affordable housing needs to be provided for families who cannot afford private sector housing; incentives need to be given to enable children and young people to enrol and stay in school; and more affordable childcare is required to boost women’s labour market participation and help parents balance work and family life. The overall policy message is that promoting living standards and social inclusion should be defined as a priority across all areas of policymaking and implementation, thus ensuring a multi-dimensional and holistic approach to preventing and reducing poverty, inequality and social exclusion.

Both frequently report higher job satisfaction followed by a better adaptation of working hours to the workload as an outcome of the introduction of flexible working times. Source: Working time and work–life balance in European companies, © EF 2006 Read the full report NEWS IN BRIEF Foundation roadshows in Latvia and Lithuania Foundation research findings indicate that workers in Latvia enjoy the most flexible working time arrangements in 25 European countries, government officials and social partners in Riga, Latvia will be told on 6–7 June. The two-day visit by Foundation representatives, part of its ongoing regular meeting with its stakeholders in the roadshow, will be followed by a second two-day stop in Vilnius, Lithuania. Seminars will be held in both locations, to which will also be invited representatives from non-governmental organisations. The seminars will outline recent analysis indicating that both countries risk losing many well-educated young men and women who are migrating to other parts of Europe in search of better income and career opportunities. EU-wide coverage for EWCO The Foundation’s European Working Conditions Observatory (EWCO) has completed the planned expansion of its network of correspondents to all 25 EU Member States, plus Bulgaria, Romania and Norway. The EWCO portal provides regular updates and information about developments in working conditions at national levels, as well as regular comprehensive thematic reports and overviews – most recently on work-related stress, on the impact of training on individuals’ employability and on combining family duties with full-time work. Over the last 12 months, some 150 news updates have been published on the site. Helping SMEs succeed in the internal market Improved access to new markets in an enlarged EU is one of the prime objectives in the European Commission’s renewed approach to small- and medium-sized companies (SMEs). The Foundation’s European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) will jointly organise a company network seminar with the Confederation of German Employers’ Associations (BDA) in Berlin on 28–29 June, which will examine the challenges SMEs face when operating across European borders, and the role innovation plays in facilitating this process. The company seminar will gather representatives from SMEs as well as policy-makers to address how to best help national governments develop more coherent and coordinated policies by integrating priority actions for SMEs in their national reform programmes. More information about the seminar is available on the EMCC website Collective dispute resolution in an enlarged European Union Promoting good industrial relations continues to be a major issue in Europe. A new review from the Foundation’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) highlights the diversity of collective dispute resolution systems and practices across the enlarged European Union. The review finds that mediation is the most commonly used method for resolving conflicts; arbitration is the most readily available, but remains unpopular because of the autonomous and voluntary nature of most European industrial relations systems. The EIRO review also outlines the current roles and views of social partners concerning assessment, redesign, and progressive change in this area. It focuses particular attention on the differences between the EU15, in which only minor adjustments are needed, and the new Member States, which must create public sector regulations and more effective resolution agents.

In this issue: Director's diary Families, work and social networks Social partners, redundancies and redundancy costs Research and news in brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Families, work and social networks Despite challenges to the traditional concept of the family, family life and support are synonymous with what makes a good quality of life. However, the new forms of family in existence today call for a broader scope of policymaking. In its new report, Families, work and social networks, the Foundation puts forward a case for family-oriented policies. The report reveals that the traditional concept of the family is challenged by young people marrying later, increasing levels of cohabitation as a substitute for marriages, and current low birth rates, as well as other factors, such as the ageing of the population and an increased participation of women in paid work. Despite these challenges, Europeans place a high value on family support in helping to cope with everyday life, as well as it being key to social integration and inclusion. The report argues that employment, equal opportunities and education policies should take greater account of family needs and arrangements.  	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-october-2005-0

Keynote round-up An economy or a society: where do we live and work? Articles Focusing firmly on the year ahead Foundation forges closer ties with the EP Disability and social exclusion: Reversing the trend Europe ‘not losing jobs’ due to outsourcing of ICT services Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing The Foundation enjoys an increasingly good reputation with its stakeholders and target audiences, as a provider of quality and reliable research and information. In 2005, as Europe prepares to carry out a mid-term review of its progress towards the Lisbon objectives, this reputation will put the Foundation at the centre of the political debate, with its current and upcoming research – on quality of work and life, the ageing workforce and management of change – as outlined in its 2005 work programme. At the launch of the 2005 work programme, Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s Acting Director, said that efforts during the past four years were beginning to pay off. He added that because of the Foundation’s reputation as a provider of quality research and information, people now turn to them to hear what they have to say. ‘Equally important, the Foundation has gained a solid standing with the budgetary authorities – both the Court of Auditors and our internal auditing services – for making good and proper use of our financial resources,’ he added. Within the framework of its 2005-2008 work programme, the Foundation’s 2005 plan defines the priorities for the year ahead. This programme is structured around the three main tasks of the Foundation. Monitoring and understanding change In the past four years, monitoring instruments have been put in place for all four core areas of Foundation research: living conditions, working conditions, industrial relations and managing change. The challenge for the coming four-year period, 2005-2008, will be to extend all of these monitoring activities to all 25 EU Member States. In particular, creating synergy between the Foundation’s methods (such as surveys and network reporting), its activities (seminars and publishing) and its products (new reports, thematic analysis) will be essential in optimising output and resources in 2005. Comparative analysis will become a primary output. The European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) will, for example, continue to strengthen its analytical capacity, highlighting key issues on the policy agenda. Exploring what works There is a noticeable balance in the 2005 work programme, between projects with a new theme and projects that propose to build on the knowledge base that already exists in a particular area. Research in 2005 will cover the following topics: employment initiatives; entrepreneurship; flexibility and the inter-relationship between living and working conditions; collective bargaining; migration and labour market mobility; sustainable care services; and workplace development. Communicating and sharing ideas and experiences In the year ahead, a number of new information and communication initiatives aim to facilitate access to Foundation research, both for target audiences and the general public. A new-look Foundation website, which is planned to be operational towards the end of spring 2005, will allow for theme-based access to all research findings. Tailored information will also be made increasingly available, via e-letters and the revamped monthly version of the Foundation’s newsletter, Communiqué. Lastly, a new customer relations management system will be introduced, which aims to shorten response-times to the growing number of information requests.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1194	2007-12-16	UNK	Press release, 8 June 2001	" Swedish Minister of State welcomes the inception of the European Monitoring Centre on Change On a visit to the European Foundation yesterday Anna Ekstrom, State Secretary at the Swedish Ministry of Industry, Employment and Communications, welcomed the latest stage in the development of the European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC), one of the Foundation's principal initiatives in its current four-year programme. ""It is important that we see change in its positive as well as its negative aspects"", she said referring to the dynamic potential of technological innovation and the possibilities of the new economy. The purpose of the EMCC will be to identify, collect, assess and process relevant and reliable information which will assist key actors in companies, trade unions, public authorities and governments in their awareness, understanding, anticipation and management of industrial change. The EMCC will also identify the main drivers of change. The European social partners have set out their views as to the mission, scope and functioning of the Monitoring Centre as a ""resource centre for economic data and forward studies on economic, financial, technological and territorial and social developments in the European Union"". In an address to the first meeting of the EMCC Steering Group chaired by Raymond-Pierre Bodin, Director of the European Foundation, Ms Ekstrom emphasized the backing of the Swedish Presidency for the Foundation's work on EMCC and was pleased that the Belgian government has also indicated its wholehearted support for EMCC and will host a major gathering of the Monitoring Centre's stakeholders at a conference in Brussels during the forthcoming Belgian Presidency As part of the further evolution of EMCC, it is planned to establish a major web-based portal (EMCC Portal) with access to relevant websites and databases as well as regular analyses (EMCC Monitor) of changes affecting the living and working conditions of European citizens.

In this issue: Director's diary Working time developments in Europe Life satisfaction high in Romania In brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing   Working time developments in Europe Workers in the former EU15 countries and Norway continue to work 1.5 hours less per week than those in the new Member States, according to the annual update on working time developments in Europe from the Foundation’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). In 2005, the average collectively agreed working week was 38.6 hours, similar to the working week in 2004. Workers in the 10 new Member States work, on average, 101 hours a year (nearly 6%) longer than their counterparts in the EU15; this equates to more than two and a half weeks a year. In the EU25, the average collectively agreed annual working time was 1,748.4 hours. In the EU15, it was 1,707.8 hours, compared to 1,808.8 hours in the new Member States. However, annual working time in Greece and Ireland is similar to the average for the new Member States, while in Cyprus and the Czech Republic it is closer to the EU15 average. The longest average annual working hours in the EU are in Hungary, Latvia, Lituania, Estonia, Slovenia and Poland, while the shortest are in France, Denmark and Germany. Annual leave has increased over the past five years The EIRO overview also allows for a comparison of collectively agreed annual paid leave. The average entitlement across the EU15 and Norway is 26.8 days; this has increased slightly, from 25.6 days in 2000. The amount of annual leave recorded in the 2005 edition of the update varied from 33 days in Sweden, to 30 days in Denmark and Germany and 28 in Italy and Luxembourg. Workers in Austria, the Czech Republic, Finland and France (25 days each) had to work a full week longer than their Danish and German counterparts – and almost a fortnight longer than workers in Sweden. Meanwhile, workers in Greece (23 days) fared better than workers in Bulgaria (22 days), Slovakia (21.3 days), Cyprus (20 days) and Slovenia (20 days), where workers had to work a fortnight longer than in Germany and Denmark, and almost three weeks longer than in Sweden. Average collectively agreed annual leave exceeds the statutory minimum by at least four days in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Sweden and the UK. An overview of working time developments across the EU The EIRO report also looks at statutory working time and leave limits, actual working hours and overtime. It provides an overview of the duration of working time – as set by collective agreements and legislation – in the European Union, Norway and the two acceding countries (Bulgaria and Romania). It also documents the weekly working hours for full-time workers as set by collective bargaining in six sectors selected to represent the manufacturing industry (metalworking and chemicals), services (banking and retail) and the public sector (local government and the central civil service).

In this issue: Director's diary Europe’s manufacturing sector hard hit by job losses Higher wage increases across the EU In brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Director’s diary Managing age productively The ageing of the workforce is an issue of vital importance for everyone in the European Union. To achieve more sustainable economic and social development, the EU has set itself the target of increasing the employment rate of older people. For this to be successful, governments, social partners and organisations need to work together to develop the skills and employability of older people while maintaining the health, motivation and capacities of workers as they age. Successful age management in the workplace demands a rethinking of traditional approaches to employment, training, skills development, the organisation of time, the promotion of health and workplace design. Age discrimination and negative stereotypes of older workers must be tackled, while working conditions and employment opportunities must be adapted to an age-diverse workforce. The Foundation’s recently published report, A guide to good practice in age management, looks at case studies from a range of organisations across the EU that have introduced good practices in recruiting, supporting and retaining older workers. By presenting examples of good practice, it aims to assist all those with responsibilities for employment in ensuring that age in the workplace is managed productively. The Foundation will bring its expertise to the Finnish EU Presidency, co-hosting a conference on improving the labour supply in care services to meet the increasing demand of an ageing population, to be held in Helsinki in October.

News in brief Commerce sector winner in jobs gains A total of 95,588 new jobs were announced in Europe between 1 April and 30 June 2007, the latest issue of European restructuring monitor quarterly shows. The commerce sector leads the way with an estimated 14,300 new jobs, followed by the announcement of 12,400 jobs in the post and telecommunications sector. Over the same period, 72,051 job cuts were announced as a result of 335 company restructuring cases, with the UK recording the largest number of job losses. The majority of job cuts were due to internal restructuring (55%), bankruptcy/closure (21%) and mergers and acquisitions (15%). The report also includes a country focus on Bulgaria and Romania and a brief overview of recent restructuring activities in Malta and Cyprus. Download the ERM quarterly report European Parliament hearing on minimum wages Despite the absence of an EU policy framework on minimum wages, some form of wage floor exists in all 27 Member States – a result either of legislation or sectoral collective agreements. The minimum wage represents between 30% and 50% of the average gross wage in countries with a legally set minimum; it also tends to be higher in countries such as Germany, where rates are directly set by the social partners. These and other findings from Eurofound’s background paper, Minimum wages in Europe, will be presented on 12 September at a hearing of the European Parliament’s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the ‘Role of minimum wages/income for social inclusion in the European Union’. Read the full text of the paper Balanced flexicurity delivers benefits Measures designed to balance greater contract and working time flexibility with employment and income security can bring substantial benefits for workers, companies and national economies. However, such measures need to take into account the particular circumstances of each individual country. This is one of the conclusions drawn in a Eurofound report, Flexibility and security over the life course, which looks at the impact of increasing labour market flexibility. Using data from different sources and surveys, the report explores whether flexibility has contributed to employees’ employment and income security, and analyses the long-term career effects of working in non-standard contracts. It also looks at some examples of European companies that have successfully synchronised company goals with workers’ needs for a better work–life balance. The publication of this report has been delayed. EIRO briefing to Polish policymakers Workers in Poland spend more time at work each week than does the average worker in the 10 new EU Member States that acceded in 2004: Polish workers work 41.1 hours as against an average of 40.6 hours. Working time is one of the issues to be discussed at a forthcoming event organised by Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). EIRO research staff will also update Polish policymakers from government, trade unions and employer organisations on recent findings and recommendations on flexicurity and temporary agency work. The event will be held in the offices of the European Commission Representation in Warsaw on 28 September.

High levels of long-term illness in Finland Finland has among the highest levels of overall life satisfaction and general happiness in Europe, according to the Foundation’s European Quality of Life Survey. However, almost twice as many people in Finland (38%) report long-term illness or disability than in the former EU15 countries (20%), with particularly high levels in the 18-24 age group. Also, when comparing material conditions and economic deprivation, only a quarter of Finns in employment (24%) consider themselves well-paid, which is half the average levels (43%) in the former EU15 countries. One in five (21%) Finns reported difficulties in affording to take a week’s annual holiday. A Foundation seminar in Helsinki, Finland, on 8-9 February will discuss these and other findings in the European Quality of Life Survey with representatives from the Finnish government, social partners and civil society. Relocation of production and industrial relations By granting the social partners specific participation rights, with a certain involvement in the decision-making process, the transfer by multinational companies of production activities from one country to another can be handled smoothly, according to the latest comparative study from the Foundation’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). The study explores the role of industrial relations in the relocation of production in 23 EU Member States (excluding Luxembourg and Portugal) plus Bulgaria, Norway and Romania. It shows how best practice, where unions and employers get involved at an earlier stage and hence can manage the consequences better, is successfully employed by social partners and business in the Scandinavian countries. Read the complete EIRO study EMCC Sector Futures on performing arts The future of Europe’s live performing arts or ‘entertainment sector’, which together with audiovisual activities comprises the performing arts sector, does not look promising, according to the latest article in the EMCC Sector Futures series. Job opportunities in performing arts are likely to remain precarious and public, non-commercial funding is drying up. As a result, one likely future scenario would be conservative programming, which relies on established performing artists and formats and designs that appeal to the broadest possible audience. The sector, which employs some four million people, will have to face these challenges if it is to continue to bring culture and entertainment to citizens in Europe. Read this article on the EMCC website Promoting gender equality in the workplace Foundation research suggests that the gender equality situation in many of the new EU Member States is similar or even better than the former EU15 countries. There is a similar but smaller income gap, similar but less gender segregation, similar organisational structures at work, but with more women in management positions. On 20-21 February 2006, the Foundation’s European Working Condition’s Observatory (EWCO) will host a seminar in Sofia, Bulgaria, to raise awareness of the issue among EU and national authorities, social partners and practitioners, and to promote further research into the subject.

Articles Director's diary Policies and actions for a healthy Europe Gender equality and economic effectiveness In brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Gender equality and economic effectiveness Europe will need to offer good quality, affordable services of general economic interest that provide - above all - equal opportunities for men and women, if it is to achieve the employment goals set out in the Lisbon objectives. To allow more women to enter and remain in the labour market, Europe’s services of general economic interest need to be improved, in particular by offering affordable and good quality care facilities for children and other dependents. In the final Foundation paper, Equal opportunities for women and men in services of general interest, published late in 2004, the Foundation argues that tapping the potential of female participation is increasingly seen as both an issue of gender equality and a matter of economic effectiveness. In short, it argues that employment strategies in this domain are critical for the successful achievement of the Lisbon targets. Reviewing Europe's services of general economic interest In 2005, the European Commission will present a communication on the review and redefinition of Europe's services of general economic interest. These are described as market and non-market services which public authorities class as being of general interest, such as transport networks, energy and communication, education and care for children and elderly. The Foundation paper, which draws together research results from many years of work in the field, shows that care has historically been considered a private matter to be tackled through family arrangements. However, the Foundation's recent research on household services, covering elderly and childcare, confirms that there is a large unmet need for such services. On the basis of the rare available data, the Foundation paper shows a link between low availability of childcare and low female employment rates. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-january-2005

The study found, however, that there are large differences between levels of minimum wages across Europe. Following EU enlargement, the minimum wage issue has moved to the centre of political debate, where it has proved to be a controversial issue. Its proponents argue that it is an instrument for protecting low-paid workers, particularly in the agriculture, textiles and clothing, retail, hotels and restaurants, and personal services sectors, while its opponents maintain that it may price low-skilled workers out of jobs.

In this issue: Director's diary Temporary agency work in an enlarged European Union Minimum wages: a global perspective In brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Temporary agency work in an enlarged European Union Temporary agency work is an increasingly significant form of employment in the EU, representing the full-time equivalent of 1.3% of total employment in the former EU15 countries, according to new research from the Foundation’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). Temporary work agencies in the former EU15 countries employ the full-time equivalent of some 2.5 to 3 million people in approximately 20,000 firms – a segment with a likely annual turnover in excess of €75 billion, the report estimates. In EU15 countries, the employment levels range from 0.3% in Denmark to 2.6% in the United Kingdom; high levels also exist in the Netherlands, Belgium and France. In the new EU Member States for which data is available, employment levels range from 0.5% in Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, to 1.4% in Hungary. A growing form of employment The report, which offers a snapshot of temporary agency work (TAW) in the 25 EU Member States, as well as Norway and the acceding countries Bulgaria and Romania, paints a picture of a small but important sector with a significant growth potential. Temporary agency work has expanded rapidly in almost all countries, especially in the mid to late 1990s. By 2004, the number of agencies and workers had almost trebled, compared to the previous decade, and the number of user companies had grown to 14,341. Sectors currently expanding their use of TAW at a rapid rate include the metal and electronics industries, with respective increases of 32% and 27% in 2003–4. Regulating the sector Virtually all Member States have a regulatory framework for temporary agency work based on national legislation, which recognises it as an employment form in its own right. However, the presence and role of employer organisations and trade unions, and in particular the extent of self-regulation, varies between all Member States. All the former EU15 countries, plus Norway, have representative employer organisations and some degree of trade union organisation, almost all engaging in sectoral level collective bargaining. In contrast, none of the new Member States (NMS) employs sectoral level collective bargaining. Collaborative research The report, commissioned by the sectoral social dialogue committee on temporary agency work, is based on a comparative study covering 28 countries, and was carried out by the Foundation’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). It looks at the definition and extent of TAW, its regulation in the different countries, and the views of the social partners on developments in the sector. The new research follows the Foundation’s 2002 initiative to study the sector in the former EU15 countries before enlargement in 2004. From the outset, the social partners at both national and confederal levels (Eurociett and UNI-Europa) have contributed with further data and detailed comments on both the national and the overview reports.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1204	2007-12-16	UNK	"Background 
        note, 29 June 2004"	 THE EUROPEAN QUALITY OF LIFE SURVEY (EQLS): Higher than average life satisfaction in Poland Choose your preferred language option: PL (PDF, 207KB) Quality of Life in 28 European countries is the focus of a new survey carried out by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. More than 26,000 interviews were conducted during the summer of 2003 in the former EU15, the 10 new Member States and the three candidate countries. The survey results provide an important background for the future development of employment and social policy in Europe. In the European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS), quality of life at the objective and subjective level has been explored with reference to major life domains, which together shape the living conditions and life opportunities of individuals. Some of them – such as employment, or poverty and social exclusion – are also the focus of long-standing European policy initiatives; others – such as housing – have less of a tradition at the European policy level, but, particularly from the enlargement perspective, may become more crucial. The concept of quality of life Quality of life as a scientific concept has gained prominence in social research since the 1970s. Quality of life is understood as a broad concept, referring to the overall well-being of people living in a society. It basically means ‘to enable people, as far as possible, to attain the aims and choose the lifestyle they wish for themselves’ (Fahey, Nolan & Whelan, 2003: 63). In that sense, the quality of life concept goes beyond the living conditions approach, which tends to focus on the material resources available to individuals to manage their lives. The quality of life approach, on which this report is based, is discussed extensively in a report published by the Foundation (Fahey, Nolan & Whelan 2003). It highlighted three major characteristics of this concept: Quality of life refers to individuals’ life situation. The concept requires a micro perspective, where the conditions and perceptions of individuals play a key role. Macroscopic features on the economic and social situation of a society are important as contextual factors, relating to the findings at an individual level, but they do not take centre stage. Quality of life is a multi-dimensional concept. As noted above, the notion of quality and the consideration of several areas of life broadens the mono-dimensional perspective on income and material conditions which prevails in other approaches. Multi-dimensionality – ‘having’, ‘loving’ and ‘being’ – not only requires the description of several life domains, but emphasises the interplay between domains to achieve real quality of life. Quality of life is measured by objective as well as subjective indicators. Subjective and attitudinal perceptions are of particular relevance in identifying what are the individual goals and orientations. Individual perceptions and evaluations are most valuable when these subjective evaluations are linked to objective living conditions. Both kinds of measurement in combination will draw up a complete picture on quality of life. In general, there is a consensus that quality of life refers to a holistic perspective, where many aspects of life should be considered, although there is no common agreement on the number and weighting of life domains which have to be studied (Cummins, 1996) and the selection is often guided by the specific policy objective of the analysis. In drawing on previous studies, the Foundation selected six core domains for its European Quality of life survey. These are: employment; economic resources; family and households; community life and social participation; health and health care; knowledge, education and training. Methodology The report illustrates the results for all 28 participating countries for which data have been gathered. As far as value is added, data are displayed for all nations separately. However, to bring out the deviations between the former acceding (recently joined Member States) and current candidate countries and the old EU Member States, the complexity and amount of data needs to be reduced. For this purpose, four cross-country averages are provided: EU15 average is the population-weighted average of the former 15 EU Member States: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom. AC10 average (NMS) is the population-weighted average of the ten countries which joined the European Union in May 2004: Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia. CC3 average is the population-weighted average of the three candidate countries to the European Union: Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey. EU25 average is the population-weighted average of the 25 countries of the Community following the 2004 enlargement: EU15 and AC10. Disclaimer All analyses are descriptive, which means that tables and figures are related to frequencies and other statistical measures for two or three variables. Interrelationships are analysed on a bi-variate basis. Thus the findings should be interpreted with caution: results for one group or country may not directly be transmitted and compared with findings for other groups, because the measures are not controlled for third variables and interaction effects. The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions is a tripartite EU body, whose role is to provide key actors in social policy making with findings, knowledge and advice drawn from comparative research.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1205	2007-12-16	UNK	Communiqué, issue 4, 2004	 Articles Towards the Lisbon objectives: The new four-year programme Occupational pension systems in Europe Quality of life in Germany and Poland Focusing on Europe’s working poor ERM records high levels of job losses Living to work, working to live Life satisfaction varies but Europeans are generally optimistic about the future Challenging times ahead Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Traditional state pension systems are likely to remain the primary source of income for retired people in the future but Europe’s social partners are pushing for better occupational and individual pension arrangements in the light of future demographic trends, according to the latest comparative study from the Foundation’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). Almost all European countries have recently reformed or started to reform their pension systems with a view to ensuring the adequacy and sustainability of pensions in the future. Recent demographic developments, such as falling birth rates, an overall longer life expectancy and the ageing of the ‘baby boom’ generation, has put increasing pressure on the sustainability of current pension systems. Occupational pensions and industrial relations, the new EIRO comparative study, examines the industrial relations aspects of recent pensions developments in 18 countries. The report focuses mainly on occupational pensions, an area where the social partners often play a significant or even dominant role. Individualisation of pensions The report shows that Europe’s social partners recognise that traditional state pension systems will in the future carry the bulk of pension obligations. However, there is a clear trend among social partners to press for better supplementary state or occupational pension and more individual arrangements: defined-benefit systems are likely to be replaced by schemes based on defined contributions. Such arrangements essentially shift the risk away from the employer to the employee with regards to pensions and reflect a trend towards the individualisation of pension arrangements. The report also confirms that in many countries there has been a reversal of the trend of lowering the general retirement age and many early retirement schemes are being abolished or at least tightened up across Europe. Differences in type of coverage The trend toward the individualisation of pension arrangements could have adverse effects on certain categories of workers. The report shows that there are large differences in pension coverage among different groups of worker. Women, part-timers and unskilled workers are underrepresented in most occupational pension schemes, not to mention the self-employed and workers in various other types of non-standard employment. Although several countries have taken measures to facilitate the participation of these groups in the system, entry to the basic occupational system will not be made easier when these schemes become more individualistic in character, according to the report.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-4-2004-3

In this issue: Director's diary Laying the foundations for better monitoring Expanding business activities in manufacturing, retail and transport sectors In brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Director’s diary Reaching out to the public European agencies are called upon to play a more prominent role in communicating the idea and vision of Europe: to bridge the gap between the European Union and its citizens. In their daily work, the 24 European agencies deal with issues and tasks that touch on citizens’ lives in many different ways. Many of the agencies are currently ensuring that their communication activities contribute to the recent European Commission initiative on Debating Europe, involving people. Communicating with the general public has been central to the Foundation’s communication strategy for the past two years. In its series of visits to Member States, the Foundation has to date covered twelve countries and reached some 18 million Europeans via the media. These road shows are an ideal opportunity to present the Foundation’s current findings and data in a national perspective, as well as engage in bilateral discussions with social partners and government, NGOs and academics. The Foundation’s recently expanded network of National Outreach Centres, information relays in the Member States, also play an important role in getting the message across. The Foundation’s combined websites register more than 4.5 million user sessions per year. In 2005, the Foundation organised over 100 events which provided ample opportunities to present its findings and data. This month, the Foundation will contribute to the debate on healthy ageing at a high-profile event during the Austrian EU Presidency in Vienna on 8 March. At the same time, it will take its road show on quality of life to Luxembourg on 8–9 March and to Bulgaria 20–21 March. Later, the Foundation will launch the findings of the recently completed study on temporary agency work.

IN BRIEF Research in brief Job creation gathers pace in Europe The spring edition of the European Restructuring Monitor quarterly shows that job creation in Europe is still on the rise. Over the last three quarters, planned job creation has grown from 115,035 (October 2006) to 184,511 (April 2007). The number of job reductions announced over the same period has risen at a similar rate, now standing at 132,762 (April 2007). Source: ERM quarterly, spring 2007 News in brief Employment security instead of job security EU Member States are reflecting on how to improve flexibility in the labour market to allow companies to adapt their production methods and their workforce while at the same time providing the necessary security for workers. The key element that links flexibility and security is trust, according to a paper Eurofound presented at a recent hearing on flexicurity and the green paper on modernising labour law in the European Parliament. If people can have trust in change, they might in the future be willing and able to work under more ‘flexible’ terms, the paper proposes. A successful flexicurity model is based on employment security, accompanied by the necessary social provisions when out of the labour market. Eurofound maintains that social partners in particular have a key role to play in the design and implementation of these policies at institutional and company level. Download the report New forms of governance in European industrial relations The European social dialogue process has come a long way over the past two decades, from consultation of the social partners to involvement in European policymaking. In a new report, New structures, forms and processes of governance in European industrial relations, Eurofound looks at recent developments in European industrial relations and shows how the social partners operate from an institutional and legal perspective. It focuses on cross-sector social dialogue, sectoral social dialogue, autonomous processes which are part of the Europeanisation of industrial relations and some broader governance issues like the Lisbon strategy and the open method of coordination. The report underlines that developments in all of these areas have influenced the instruments of industrial relations at sectoral, national and European level. Read more on this topic Gender and career development Gender segregation remains a significant problem and the traditional career model still prevails in many countries in Europe, despite women’s increased activity rates. These are among the findings of a new comparative analytical report from Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). The report, which looks at the restructuring of career patterns and how organisation impacts on women’s career experiences, found that many women who work part time have limited opportunities for training and promotion. The overriding problem is the lack of legislation in practice at company level, according to the report. Looking at the social partners’ contribution, the report found that most trade unions have been proactive in campaigning on this topic, and in increasing their members’ awareness of and ability to raise such issues with employers. However, many employers appear unconvinced about the need to prioritise gender and careers. Read more on EIROnline Eurofound gears up for Employment Week 2007 Eurofound has a packed agenda for Employment Week 2007, which will take place on 5-6 June in Brussels, Belgium. The theme of this year’s event is ‘Working Europe – creating more and better jobs’ and the conference sessions will focus on issues concerning the workplace and the labour market. Eurofound will make presentations during the sessions on ‘quality of jobs’ and ‘mobility, migration and immigration’. In addition, the Foundation will promote its Fourth European Working Conditions Survey, the Eurofound website, recent research and its monitoring tools. It will also display recent publications at an exhibition stand.

Articles Director's diary Industrial relations still differ in the EU, Japan and US Working conditions and gender in an enlarged Europe Research and news in brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Working conditions and gender in an enlarged Europe The difference in working hours between women and men is much smaller in eight of the new EU Member States from central and eastern Europe than in the former EU15 countries, the Foundation’s new comparative study of working conditions for women in these countries shows. The findings also suggest, however, that women’s pay increases are not developing at the same rate as men’s despite the fact that women remain as highly educated as men. The transition to market economies in the former communist countries has brought major expansion of employment in the services sector, for both men and women, with a subsequent decline in employment levels in industry. During the past decade, the overall employment levels in services in the eight new Member States concerned has almost reached the levels of the former EU15 countries, some two-thirds of the total labour force, with the exception of Poland. While the changes have varied in proportions of men and women working in the expanding services sector, the largest increases for both men and women was noted in the Czech Republic, Estonia and Lithuania, with smaller changes in Hungary and Slovenia. Comparing income levels The report also provides information and analysis on the development and trends of the gender pay gap over time. Large differences in pay remain between men and women in all eight countries studied despite an initial decline during the start of the transition to market economies. Few countries have in fact improved on their position on women’s pay since the 1990s. The report suggests, however, that the pay gab between men and women in eastern Europe is smaller at both ends of the income hierarchy. The research found that women in the eastern European countries less likely to be in the lower end of the income distribution scale than than women in the former EU15, 27.8% versus 30.8%. For men in the former EU15, the chance of being in the same income bracket is higher than for men in the former EU15, 19.8% versus 12.6%. When comparing the likelihood of being a top earner, a similar pattern emerges. Women in the eastern European countries have a greater chance than women in the former EU15, 19.7% versus 14.8%. Men in the former EU15 are more likely to be top earners than men in the eastern European countries, but the difference is smaller, 31.9% versus 29.1%. Gender and management structures The report provides a useful insight into gender and organisational structures. The research shows that patterns of occupational segregation in the eastern European countries are quite similar to those in the EU15: women are under-represented in high level managerial positions (about 30-35% of all legislators and managers are women), and heavily represented in clerical, service and professional work. More importantly, however, is that women’s position at the top of the occupational hierarchy is not deteriorating. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-march-2005

With public healthcare systems unable to devote funds to research and thereby play a pivotal role in shaping demand for healthcare products and services, Europe’s biomedical healthcare sector is producing far fewer new cures and medicines than are potentially possible. According to the report, EU’s goals of a homogeneous supply side, increased international competitiveness and improved public trust of biomedical healthcare products and services, are not being addressed due to a lack of resources which would allow the fledgling industry to grow.

When comparing the likelihood of being a top earner, a similar pattern emerges. Women in the eastern European countries have a greater chance than women in the former EU15, 19.7% versus 14.8%. Men in the former EU15 are more likely to be top earners than men in the eastern European countries, but the difference is smaller, 31.9% versus 29.1%. Gender and management structures The report provides a useful insight into gender and organisational structures. The research shows that patterns of occupational segregation in the eastern European countries are quite similar to those in the EU15: women are under-represented in high level managerial positions (about 30-35% of all legislators and managers are women), and heavily represented in clerical, service and professional work. More importantly, however, is that women’s position at the top of the occupational hierarchy is not deteriorating. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-march-2005

Increased business confidence gives boost to Europe’s labour markets Business confidence in Europe is riding high and the possible resurgence in domestic demand is good news for the labour markets in the European Union, according to the latest European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) Quarterly. Europe’s financial media announced a total of 141,069 new jobs during the fourth quarter of 2006, the latest ERM Quarterly reports. Despite an increased number of restructuring cases and job losses during the fourth and final quarter of 2006, the number of new jobs created during the same period increased by approximately 20% over the previous quarter. The vast majority (95%) of all planned new job creations are due to expanding business activities, with the French health and social work sector leading the way with an estimated 30,000 new jobs. This is followed by the announcement of 5,000 new jobs in the Hungarian Air Forces, by 4,000 new jobs at Glasgow Airport in the United Kingdom, and 3,000 new jobs respectively at Tesco (commerce) and Natixis (financial services) in France. Favourable global macroeconomic climate With low inflation and falling unemployment figures in practically all EU27 Member States, the gloomy picture painted in the previous ERM Quarterly has given way to a more positive outlook. The seasonally adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) in the third quarter of 2006 grew by 2.7% in the eurozone area, and by 3% in the EU25, which represents an increase over previous quarters. More importantly, the previously recorded trend towards falling unemployment levels continues. Unemployment rates dropped in all EU27 countries during the fourth quarter in 2006, except in Hungary, Luxembourg, Romania and Spain. The report also highlights that the strong economic data from Germany, which has been observed for some time, has begun to have a significant impact on the labour market. The report notes the ‘extraordinary fall in unemployment’ in December 2006, down to 4.1 million unemployed from 4.2 in the previous month. Job losses mainly affect five countries During the same period, 95,661 job cuts were announced. Poland and Hungary record the largest numbers of job losses, followed by the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy. These five countries made up 63% of all announced job losses in this quarter. Similar to previous reports in the ERM Quarterly, internal restructuring (59.6%) remains the most frequent reason for jobs losses, followed by bankruptcy/closure (14.1%) and merger/acquisition (12%). Two strategic restructuring cases The latest ERM Quarterly also looks at two cases of strategic importance for European industry. The first concerns the German car giant Volkswagen, following on from previously reported cases, outlining how job cuts originally envisaged in Germany will now take place in other European countries. The second case concerns EADS, the leading European aerospace and defence group which has recently encountered severe problems with the Airbus A380.

Spotlight on the commerce and biomedical healthcare sectors Two new reports from Eurofound’s European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) throw light on the current situation in two sectors undergoing profound change: commerce and biomedical healthcare. Restructuring and developments in information technology are shaping the future of commerce – which includes wholesale and retail trade and the sale of motor vehicles – while biomedical healthcare is harnessing biotechnology to improve diagnostic methods, therapies and vaccines. The two reports, Trends and drivers of change in the biomedical healthcare sector in Europe and Trends and drivers of change in the European commerce sector, highlight the role that both sectors play in the overall European economy. The commerce sector employs almost 30 million persons in the EU, more than half of them in retail. While biomedical healthcare is a relatively small sector in the EU, it is a source of innovation for other key sectors such as the pharmaceutical industry and the food and beverage sector.. Micro-enterprises and innovation When compared with other sectors of the economy, the commerce sector has one of the highest proportions of micro-enterprises: more than 90% of all enterprises in this sector are micro-enterprises. The commerce sector represents a significant sector of economic activity, employing 24.5% of all employees in the non-financial sectors. However, it produces just 19.3% of the added value for these sectors, indicating that it has a lower labour productivity than the non-financial economy in general. Innovation has been critical to the development of the commerce sector, in terms of the type of stores, operations, products and levels of branding. The liberalisation of the European market means that it has attracted overseas retailers, resulting in increased competition for domestic companies; however, European retailers have themselves begun to expand both inside and outside the EU. A key challenge facing the sector is to invest in training in order to upgrade the skills and competeces of its workforce in order to remain competitive. Lack of communication and customer service skills as well as personal attributes are indicated as key skills shortages and major obstacles to competitiveness. Challenges facing biomedical sector Biomedical companies are involved in expensive and long-term endeavour – especially if they work with drugs. Drug development can take up to 15 years and costs between USD 400 and 900 million for a single product. The main challenge facing the European biomedical sector is competition with the industry in the United States, which is outperforming Europe both in terms of revenue and launching new products. Because of its knowledge-intensive nature, and relatively small size, the European biomedical healthcare sector is facing direct competition from players outside Europe for high-skilled labour. The report also points to other obstacles to growth, such as restrictive legislation, lack of funding for research and public scepticism towards the biotechnology industry. Several European initiatives aim to to overcome these obstacles: these focus on legislation, on increased funding for research and start-ups and on strategic alliances between companies to spread risks and boost productivity. Both reports will be available online shortly on the EMCC website, accompanied by related case studies and future scenarios for the sectors. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-october-2007-0

Articles Director's diary A positive year for working conditions in Europe 2004 Health, social services and education sectors most at risk from stress Research and news in brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué A positive year for working conditions in Europe 2004 The European social partner agreement on stress, improved employment rates and higher participation in lifelong learning initiatives all contributed to the generally positive developments in European working conditions, according to the second annual review of the Foundation’s European Working Conditions Observatory (EWCO). Stress and working conditions featured high on the political agendas in many Member States in 2004. A framework agreement was reached between the European social partners, who increasingly recognise the need to tackle work-related stress. Despite being off-target in terms of achieving the Lisbon goals, employment rates for women and older workers improved during the year, at least in the EU15. In recent years, greater focus on safety at work has resulted in a significant decline in serious and fatal accidents at the workplace. This second annual review from EWCO outlines relevant legislative and policy developments on working conditions in Europe, as well as examining trends in the workplace. It focuses on four key dimensions in working conditions and quality of work and employment: career and employment, health and well-being, skills development and work–life balance. Still large gender differences The report found that there are still large differences in working conditions between men and women. An increasing number of women are working two part-time jobs, often with a combined working week that exceeds the legal limit, in order to make a living. In many Member States, the culture of long hours in higher professions and managerial jobs continues to prevail, which, in turn, acts as a barrier to the upward mobility of women, contributing to gender segregation in the workplace. The report also found that, although participation rates in lifelong learning initiatives have increased, particularly for women, there was also a marked drop in IT-related training for workers across Europe in 2004. Looking to 2005 During 2005, the report highlights, the revision of the working time directive will remain a key topic on the agenda. In particular, the revision will focus on reaching a compromise on the opt-out provision of the 48-hour working week and, in particular, on the Europe-wide definition of working time, as well as the qualification of time spent ‘on-call’ as ‘working time’ or ‘rest time’. Secondly, the report hopes that the recent re-focus of the Lisbon Agenda and the new European Social Agenda will improve progress and further promote better work-life balance. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-february-2005-0
EUROFOUND_UNK_1218	2007-12-16	UNK	"Background 
        note, 1 July 2004"	 THE EUROPEAN QUALITY OF LIFE SURVEY (EQLS): Germans rate health and social services among highest in Europe Choose your preferred language option: DE Quality of Life in 28 European countries is the focus of a new survey of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. More than 26,000 interviews were conducted during the summer of 2003. The survey results provide an important background for the future development of employment and social policy in Europe. The European Foundation for the Improvement of Working and Living Conditions launched a survey in Spring 2003 on the quality of life in 28 countries: the former 15 EU Member States, the ten new EU Member States and three candidate countries. As with the previous joint initiative undertaken with the European Commission (see the Foundation’s ‘Quality of Life in Europe’ series) the research was based on existing Eurobarometer data. This report highlights the quality of life in European countries in some core life domains. It is a unique source of comparative data covering a broad spectrum of life circumstances in a large number of countries. It is planned that other, more detailed analysis on specific topics will follow. In the European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS), quality of life at the objective and subjective level has been explored with reference to major life domains, which together shape the living conditions and life opportunities of individuals. Some of them – such as employment, or poverty and social exclusion – are also the focus of long-standing European policy initiatives; others – such as housing – have less of a tradition at the European policy level, but, particularly from the enlargement perspective, might become more crucial. The concept of quality of life Quality of life as a scientific concept has gained prominence in social research since the 1970s. Quality of life is understood as a broad concept, referring to the overall well-being of people living in a society. It basically means ‘to enable people, as far as possible, to attain the aims and choose the lifestyle they wish for themselves’ (Fahey, Nolan & Whelan, 2003: 63). In that sense, the quality of life concept goes beyond the living conditions approach, which tends to focus on the material resources available to individual to manage their life. The quality of life approach, on which this report is based, is discussed extensively in a paper published by the Foundation (Fahey, Nolan & Whelan 2003). Three major characteristics of this concept were pointed out: Quality of life refers to individuals’ life situation. The concept requires a micro perspective, where the conditions and perceptions of individuals play a key role. Macroscopic features on the economic and social situation of a society are important as contextual factors, relating to the findings at an individual level, but they do not take centre stage. Quality of life is a multi-dimensional concept. As noted above, the notion of quality and the consideration of several areas of life broadens the mono-dimensional perspective on income and material conditions which prevails in other approaches. Multi-dimensionality – ‘having’, ‘loving’ and ‘being’ – not only requires the description of several life domains, but emphasises the interplay between domains to achieve real quality of life. Quality of life is measured by objective as well as subjective indicators. Subjective and attitudinal perceptions are of particular relevance in identifying what are the individual goals and orientations. Individual perceptions and evaluations are most valuable when these subjective evaluations are linked to objective living conditions. Both kinds of measurement in combination will draw up a complete picture on quality of life. In general, there is a consensus that quality of life refers to a holistic perspective, where many aspects of life should be considered, although there is no common agreement on the number and weighting of life domains which have to be studied (Cummins, 1996) and the selection is often guided by the specific policy objective of the analysis. In drawing on previous studies, the Foundation selected six core domains for its European Quality of life survey. These are: employment; economic resources; family and households; community life and social participation; health and health care; knowledge, education and training. Methodology The report illustrates the results for all 28 participating countries for which data have been gathered. As far as value is added, data are displayed for all nations separately. However, to bring out the deviations between the former acceding (recently joined Member States) and current candidate countries and the old EU Member States, the complexity and amount of data needs to be reduced. For this purpose, four cross-country averages are provided: EU15 average is the population-weighted average of the former 15 EU Member States: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom. AC10 average is the population-weighted average of the ten countries which joined the European Union in May 2004: Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia. CC3 average is the population-weighted average of the three countries which will join the European Union at a later date: Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey. EU25 average is the population-weighted average of the 25 countries of the Community following the 2004 enlargement: EU15 and AC10. Disclaimer All analyses are descriptive, which means that tables and figures are related to frequencies and other statistical measures for two or three variables. Interrelationships are analysed on a bi-variate basis. Thus the findings should be interpreted with caution: results for one group or country may not directly be transmitted and compared with findings for other groups, because the measures are not controlled for third variables and interaction effects. The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions is a tripartite EU body, whose role is to provide key actors in social policy making with findings, knowledge and advice drawn from comparative research. The Foundation was established by Council Regulation EEC No 1365/75 of 26 May 1975. The Foundation is located in Dublin, Ireland. More news and information from the Foundation. Back to press release.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1219	2007-12-16	UNK	Communiqué, issue 6, 2004	 Special Foundation Forum 2004 Time to re-think work-life balance: Second Foundation Forum debates key issues Do we need to work longer hours? Time and flexibility Investing in work-life balance – a win-win situation? Work and care - payback for the elderly or investment in a new generation? Keynote round-up An economy or a society: where do we live and work? Articles Focusing firmly on the year ahead Foundation forges closer ties with the EP Disability and social exclusion: Reversing the trend Europe ‘not losing jobs’ due to outsourcing of ICT services Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing ‘It would seem more appropriate to establish a balance between all the various facets of our lives: our work; our family responsibilities; our leisure interests; and our health and well-being. A good work-life balance will be one that allows us to manage all of these components together, instead of focusing on one or two aspects to the detriment of others.’ Bertie Ahern, An Taoiseach An Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, with the Foundation’s Acting Director, Willy Buschak, at the opening of the Forum Finding new ways to approach the work-life balance issue was the one of the central themes of Foundation Forum 2004, which took place on 3 and 4 November 2004 in Dublin. The aim of the second bi-annual Forum, which brought together high-level practitioners, politicians and experts from different EU Member States and beyond, was to focus on the different facets of the work-life balance issue and to provide a platform for debate and the exchange of experiences. In his opening speech, Willy Buschak, Acting Director of the Foundation, highlighted the need for re-thinking the way people balance their personal and work lives. ‘Our notion of time and how we allocate it between our work and personal lives is being challenged by two main developments,’ he said. ‘On one hand, globalisation is introducing more diverse and complex working time arrangements and organisational paradigms. At the same time, people want and need greater autonomy and choice of when they work, in order to accommodate the growing diversity of their lifestyles and family arrangements,’ he stressed. Willy Buschak added that the old notion of time being neatly segmented into work and social activities was becoming increasingly irrelevant for many people. He concluded that a more holistic approach that views time arrangements over the course of an individual’s life was required. Also speaking at this year’s Forum, An Taoiseach Bertie Ahern moved to dispel some of the misconceptions surrounding the work-life balance debate. ‘I am slightly uneasy with the way the current debate seems to imply making a choice between something called “work” and something called “life”,’ he said. ‘It’s also clear that work-life balance is not simply a case of limiting the number of hours spent at work. It is rather one of giving people a degree of autonomy as to how their working time is managed. To do this effectively will require us all – employers, workers, trade unionists and Government – to devise a long-term approach. This should take account of changes in our individual priorities as careers progress and personal circumstances alter,’ the Taoiseach highlighted. In his key-note address Vlado Dimovski, Minister of Labour, Family and Social Affairs from the Republic of Slovenia, focused on the role of ‘human capital’. ‘Human capital is the key driver of productivity in a modern, knowledge-based society. However human capital isn’t just produced in the education system, it is also produced in firms and in families. Unfortunately, a lot of this knowledge remains locked in families, due to the absence of affordable childcare, lack of working time flexibility and other obstacles,’ Mr Dimovski said. ‘Converting this personal and tacit knowledge into organisational knowledge is one of the big challenges and why reconciling work and family life is so important. Employers should find more creative ways to balance flexibility with security and social protection,’ he added. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-6-2004-5

In this issue: Director's diary Is ‘Competitive Europe’ compatible with ‘Social Europe’? Promoting flexible working time arrangements In brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing   Is ‘Competitive Europe’ compatible with ‘Social Europe’? The Foundation Forum 2006 promises to be even more lively and pertinent than ever before, with a line-up including high-profile speakers, expert participants and a very hot topic for discussion. On 2–3 November, the third Foundation Forum will attempt to find answers to the following fundamental questions: are the models of a competitive Europe and Social Europe partners or rivals? To what extent are the various European social models compatible with competitiveness? More specifically, the Forum will look at how recent trends in globalisation, new technologies and the ongoing economic integration of Europe influence the relationships between social models and competitiveness. While the Forum may not be able to give definitive answers to the questions, it should shed light on one of the most pressing issues facing Europe today. The two-day conference will be hosted by Micheál Martin TD, Irish Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Taoiseach Bertie Ahern (Irish Prime Minister) will open the conference with an address on competitive Ireland in a social Europe. Jeremy Rifkin, President of the Foundation on Economic Trends (USA) and Hans-Werner Sinn, Munich University, will then explore whether the Lisbon aim of competitiveness is feasible, appropriate or desirable for Europe. Meeting the challenges of Lisbon? Three speakers will address the central question: ‘Why are we not on target to achieve the Lisbon goals?’ Maria Helena André, Deputy General Secretary of ETUC, will look at the question from the workers’ perspective, while Thérèse de Liedekerke, Director of Social Policy in UNICE, will present the employers’ view. Rounding up the discussion, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen MEP, President of the Party of European Socialists and former Prime Minister of Denmark, will ask: ‘Do voters punish governments that implement reform policies?’ Parallel debates The five parallel debates of the Forum will propose up to three actions that could be taken to address various propositions, with a protagonist and an antagonist for each. Protagonist Elena Bonfiglioli (Microsoft) will debate with Henry Ohlsson (Economic Council of Sweden) the motion, ‘There is always a business case for companies’ investment in training’. ‘Flexicurity is the path to better European competitiveness’ is the topic of the second debate, with protagonist Raul Eamets (University of Tallinn) facing antagonist Isabella DaCosca (Centre d’Etudes de l’Emploi, France). In the third debate, Stephen Howard (AMTEK) will propose that regions must continually re-invent themselves to remain competitive, while Karen-Margrete Hansen Bager (Municipality of Bornholm) will oppose the proposition. In the fourth debate, Manfred Weiss (Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt) will argue that sustainable competitiveness needs social partnership, while Constantin T. Gurdgiev (Trinity College Dublin) will speak against the motion. The debate around the fifth proposition, that the promotion of diversity is a tool for competitive advantage, will be chaired by Rob Anderson. Is there a business case for EU social policy? On the second day, Friday 3 November, the Forum will set about to examine the business case for EU social policy. Commissioner Vladimír Špidla will address the key question: ‘Where does EU social policy meet business?’ Peter Kiss, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Social and Labour Affairs, Hungary, will consider the proposition: ‘How do Member States compete with each other for business without undermining EU social policy?’ Doing business in Europe Three speakers will explore the issue of conducting business in Europe. Maciej Mataczynski, (PKN Orlen, Poland) will pose the question: ‘Can business in the new Member States conform to the social model while making the transition to the competitive market economy?’ Peter Pelgrims (Somati Group, Belgium) will address the provocative question: ‘Is social policy the luxury of big business?’ And Catherine Glickman (Tesco, UK) will explore whether EU social policy is a help or a hindrance to businesses operating in the global marketplace.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-october-2006-0

Spotlight on the commerce and biomedical healthcare sectors Two new reports from Eurofound’s European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) throw light on the current situation in two sectors undergoing profound change: commerce and biomedical healthcare. Restructuring and developments in information technology are shaping the future of commerce – which includes wholesale and retail trade and the sale of motor vehicles – while biomedical healthcare is harnessing biotechnology to improve diagnostic methods, therapies and vaccines. The two reports, Trends and drivers of change in the biomedical healthcare sector in Europe and Trends and drivers of change in the European commerce sector, highlight the role that both sectors play in the overall European economy. The commerce sector employs almost 30 million persons in the EU, more than half of them in retail. While biomedical healthcare is a relatively small sector in the EU, it is a source of innovation for other key sectors such as the pharmaceutical industry and the food and beverage sector.. Micro-enterprises and innovation When compared with other sectors of the economy, the commerce sector has one of the highest proportions of micro-enterprises: more than 90% of all enterprises in this sector are micro-enterprises. The commerce sector represents a significant sector of economic activity, employing 24.5% of all employees in the non-financial sectors. However, it produces just 19.3% of the added value for these sectors, indicating that it has a lower labour productivity than the non-financial economy in general. Innovation has been critical to the development of the commerce sector, in terms of the type of stores, operations, products and levels of branding. The liberalisation of the European market means that it has attracted overseas retailers, resulting in increased competition for domestic companies; however, European retailers have themselves begun to expand both inside and outside the EU. A key challenge facing the sector is to invest in training in order to upgrade the skills and competeces of its workforce in order to remain competitive. Lack of communication and customer service skills as well as personal attributes are indicated as key skills shortages and major obstacles to competitiveness. Challenges facing biomedical sector Biomedical companies are involved in expensive and long-term endeavour – especially if they work with drugs. Drug development can take up to 15 years and costs between USD 400 and 900 million for a single product. The main challenge facing the European biomedical sector is competition with the industry in the United States, which is outperforming Europe both in terms of revenue and launching new products. Because of its knowledge-intensive nature, and relatively small size, the European biomedical healthcare sector is facing direct competition from players outside Europe for high-skilled labour. The report also points to other obstacles to growth, such as restrictive legislation, lack of funding for research and public scepticism towards the biotechnology industry. Several European initiatives aim to to overcome these obstacles: these focus on legislation, on increased funding for research and start-ups and on strategic alliances between companies to spread risks and boost productivity. Both reports will be available online shortly on the EMCC website, accompanied by related case studies and future scenarios for the sectors. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-october-2007-0
EUROFOUND_UNK_1225	2007-12-16	UNK	"Background 
        note, 1 July 2004"	 THE EUROPEAN QUALITY OF LIFE SURVEY (EQLS): Germans rate health and social services among highest in Europe Choose your preferred language option: DE Quality of Life in 28 European countries is the focus of a new survey of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. More than 26,000 interviews were conducted during the summer of 2003. The survey results provide an important background for the future development of employment and social policy in Europe. The European Foundation for the Improvement of Working and Living Conditions launched a survey in Spring 2003 on the quality of life in 28 countries: the former 15 EU Member States, the ten new EU Member States and three candidate countries. As with the previous joint initiative undertaken with the European Commission (see the Foundation’s ‘Quality of Life in Europe’ series) the research was based on existing Eurobarometer data. This report highlights the quality of life in European countries in some core life domains. It is a unique source of comparative data covering a broad spectrum of life circumstances in a large number of countries. It is planned that other, more detailed analysis on specific topics will follow. In the European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS), quality of life at the objective and subjective level has been explored with reference to major life domains, which together shape the living conditions and life opportunities of individuals. Some of them – such as employment, or poverty and social exclusion – are also the focus of long-standing European policy initiatives; others – such as housing – have less of a tradition at the European policy level, but, particularly from the enlargement perspective, might become more crucial. The concept of quality of life Quality of life as a scientific concept has gained prominence in social research since the 1970s. Quality of life is understood as a broad concept, referring to the overall well-being of people living in a society. It basically means ‘to enable people, as far as possible, to attain the aims and choose the lifestyle they wish for themselves’ (Fahey, Nolan & Whelan, 2003: 63). In that sense, the quality of life concept goes beyond the living conditions approach, which tends to focus on the material resources available to individual to manage their life. The quality of life approach, on which this report is based, is discussed extensively in a paper published by the Foundation (Fahey, Nolan & Whelan 2003). Three major characteristics of this concept were pointed out: Quality of life refers to individuals’ life situation. The concept requires a micro perspective, where the conditions and perceptions of individuals play a key role. Macroscopic features on the economic and social situation of a society are important as contextual factors, relating to the findings at an individual level, but they do not take centre stage. Quality of life is a multi-dimensional concept. As noted above, the notion of quality and the consideration of several areas of life broadens the mono-dimensional perspective on income and material conditions which prevails in other approaches. Multi-dimensionality – ‘having’, ‘loving’ and ‘being’ – not only requires the description of several life domains, but emphasises the interplay between domains to achieve real quality of life. Quality of life is measured by objective as well as subjective indicators. Subjective and attitudinal perceptions are of particular relevance in identifying what are the individual goals and orientations. Individual perceptions and evaluations are most valuable when these subjective evaluations are linked to objective living conditions. Both kinds of measurement in combination will draw up a complete picture on quality of life. In general, there is a consensus that quality of life refers to a holistic perspective, where many aspects of life should be considered, although there is no common agreement on the number and weighting of life domains which have to be studied (Cummins, 1996) and the selection is often guided by the specific policy objective of the analysis. In drawing on previous studies, the Foundation selected six core domains for its European Quality of life survey. These are: employment; economic resources; family and households; community life and social participation; health and health care; knowledge, education and training. Methodology The report illustrates the results for all 28 participating countries for which data have been gathered. As far as value is added, data are displayed for all nations separately. However, to bring out the deviations between the former acceding (recently joined Member States) and current candidate countries and the old EU Member States, the complexity and amount of data needs to be reduced. For this purpose, four cross-country averages are provided: EU15 average is the population-weighted average of the former 15 EU Member States: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom. AC10 average is the population-weighted average of the ten countries which joined the European Union in May 2004: Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia. CC3 average is the population-weighted average of the three countries which will join the European Union at a later date: Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey. EU25 average is the population-weighted average of the 25 countries of the Community following the 2004 enlargement: EU15 and AC10. Disclaimer All analyses are descriptive, which means that tables and figures are related to frequencies and other statistical measures for two or three variables. Interrelationships are analysed on a bi-variate basis. Thus the findings should be interpreted with caution: results for one group or country may not directly be transmitted and compared with findings for other groups, because the measures are not controlled for third variables and interaction effects. The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions is a tripartite EU body, whose role is to provide key actors in social policy making with findings, knowledge and advice drawn from comparative research. The Foundation was established by Council Regulation EEC No 1365/75 of 26 May 1975. The Foundation is located in Dublin, Ireland. More news and information from the Foundation. Back to press release.

In this issue: Director's diary Is ‘Competitive Europe’ compatible with ‘Social Europe’? Promoting flexible working time arrangements In brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing   Is ‘Competitive Europe’ compatible with ‘Social Europe’? The Foundation Forum 2006 promises to be even more lively and pertinent than ever before, with a line-up including high-profile speakers, expert participants and a very hot topic for discussion. On 2–3 November, the third Foundation Forum will attempt to find answers to the following fundamental questions: are the models of a competitive Europe and Social Europe partners or rivals? To what extent are the various European social models compatible with competitiveness? More specifically, the Forum will look at how recent trends in globalisation, new technologies and the ongoing economic integration of Europe influence the relationships between social models and competitiveness. While the Forum may not be able to give definitive answers to the questions, it should shed light on one of the most pressing issues facing Europe today. The two-day conference will be hosted by Micheál Martin TD, Irish Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Taoiseach Bertie Ahern (Irish Prime Minister) will open the conference with an address on competitive Ireland in a social Europe. Jeremy Rifkin, President of the Foundation on Economic Trends (USA) and Hans-Werner Sinn, Munich University, will then explore whether the Lisbon aim of competitiveness is feasible, appropriate or desirable for Europe. Meeting the challenges of Lisbon? Three speakers will address the central question: ‘Why are we not on target to achieve the Lisbon goals?’ Maria Helena André, Deputy General Secretary of ETUC, will look at the question from the workers’ perspective, while Thérèse de Liedekerke, Director of Social Policy in UNICE, will present the employers’ view. Rounding up the discussion, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen MEP, President of the Party of European Socialists and former Prime Minister of Denmark, will ask: ‘Do voters punish governments that implement reform policies?’ Parallel debates The five parallel debates of the Forum will propose up to three actions that could be taken to address various propositions, with a protagonist and an antagonist for each. Protagonist Elena Bonfiglioli (Microsoft) will debate with Henry Ohlsson (Economic Council of Sweden) the motion, ‘There is always a business case for companies’ investment in training’. ‘Flexicurity is the path to better European competitiveness’ is the topic of the second debate, with protagonist Raul Eamets (University of Tallinn) facing antagonist Isabella DaCosca (Centre d’Etudes de l’Emploi, France). In the third debate, Stephen Howard (AMTEK) will propose that regions must continually re-invent themselves to remain competitive, while Karen-Margrete Hansen Bager (Municipality of Bornholm) will oppose the proposition. In the fourth debate, Manfred Weiss (Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt) will argue that sustainable competitiveness needs social partnership, while Constantin T. Gurdgiev (Trinity College Dublin) will speak against the motion. The debate around the fifth proposition, that the promotion of diversity is a tool for competitive advantage, will be chaired by Rob Anderson. Is there a business case for EU social policy? On the second day, Friday 3 November, the Forum will set about to examine the business case for EU social policy. Commissioner Vladimír Špidla will address the key question: ‘Where does EU social policy meet business?’ Peter Kiss, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Social and Labour Affairs, Hungary, will consider the proposition: ‘How do Member States compete with each other for business without undermining EU social policy?’ Doing business in Europe Three speakers will explore the issue of conducting business in Europe. Maciej Mataczynski, (PKN Orlen, Poland) will pose the question: ‘Can business in the new Member States conform to the social model while making the transition to the competitive market economy?’ Peter Pelgrims (Somati Group, Belgium) will address the provocative question: ‘Is social policy the luxury of big business?’ And Catherine Glickman (Tesco, UK) will explore whether EU social policy is a help or a hindrance to businesses operating in the global marketplace.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-october-2006-0
EUROFOUND_UNK_1227	2007-12-16	UNK	Communiqué, issue 6, 2004	 Special Foundation Forum 2004 Time to re-think work-life balance: Second Foundation Forum debates key issues Do we need to work longer hours? Time and flexibility Investing in work-life balance – a win-win situation? Work and care - payback for the elderly or investment in a new generation? Keynote round-up An economy or a society: where do we live and work? Articles Focusing firmly on the year ahead Foundation forges closer ties with the EP Disability and social exclusion: Reversing the trend Europe ‘not losing jobs’ due to outsourcing of ICT services Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing ‘It would seem more appropriate to establish a balance between all the various facets of our lives: our work; our family responsibilities; our leisure interests; and our health and well-being. A good work-life balance will be one that allows us to manage all of these components together, instead of focusing on one or two aspects to the detriment of others.’ Bertie Ahern, An Taoiseach An Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, with the Foundation’s Acting Director, Willy Buschak, at the opening of the Forum Finding new ways to approach the work-life balance issue was the one of the central themes of Foundation Forum 2004, which took place on 3 and 4 November 2004 in Dublin. The aim of the second bi-annual Forum, which brought together high-level practitioners, politicians and experts from different EU Member States and beyond, was to focus on the different facets of the work-life balance issue and to provide a platform for debate and the exchange of experiences. In his opening speech, Willy Buschak, Acting Director of the Foundation, highlighted the need for re-thinking the way people balance their personal and work lives. ‘Our notion of time and how we allocate it between our work and personal lives is being challenged by two main developments,’ he said. ‘On one hand, globalisation is introducing more diverse and complex working time arrangements and organisational paradigms. At the same time, people want and need greater autonomy and choice of when they work, in order to accommodate the growing diversity of their lifestyles and family arrangements,’ he stressed. Willy Buschak added that the old notion of time being neatly segmented into work and social activities was becoming increasingly irrelevant for many people. He concluded that a more holistic approach that views time arrangements over the course of an individual’s life was required. Also speaking at this year’s Forum, An Taoiseach Bertie Ahern moved to dispel some of the misconceptions surrounding the work-life balance debate. ‘I am slightly uneasy with the way the current debate seems to imply making a choice between something called “work” and something called “life”,’ he said. ‘It’s also clear that work-life balance is not simply a case of limiting the number of hours spent at work. It is rather one of giving people a degree of autonomy as to how their working time is managed. To do this effectively will require us all – employers, workers, trade unionists and Government – to devise a long-term approach. This should take account of changes in our individual priorities as careers progress and personal circumstances alter,’ the Taoiseach highlighted. In his key-note address Vlado Dimovski, Minister of Labour, Family and Social Affairs from the Republic of Slovenia, focused on the role of ‘human capital’. ‘Human capital is the key driver of productivity in a modern, knowledge-based society. However human capital isn’t just produced in the education system, it is also produced in firms and in families. Unfortunately, a lot of this knowledge remains locked in families, due to the absence of affordable childcare, lack of working time flexibility and other obstacles,’ Mr Dimovski said. ‘Converting this personal and tacit knowledge into organisational knowledge is one of the big challenges and why reconciling work and family life is so important. Employers should find more creative ways to balance flexibility with security and social protection,’ he added. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-6-2004-5

EUROFOUND_UNK_1229	2007-12-16	UNK	Background note, 9 October 2003	 LIVING AND WORKING CONDITIONS, AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, IN AN ENLARGED EUROPE In the coming months, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the Dublin-based EU-agency providing socio-economic knowledge and research findings to EU-level policy makers, will launch a series of publications related to living and working conditions in an enlarged Europe. First Survey of Working Conditions in the Acceding and Candidate Countries The survey provides a unique comprehensive overview of working conditions in the twelve candidate countries, using the same methodology as in the previous Foundation working conditions surveys in the European Union (1992, 1995, 2000). It addresses a wide range of issues related to the quality of work and employment, such as physical risk factors (i.e. noise, vibrations), working time patterns (i.e. working hours, shift and night work), and occupational health outcomes (i.e. stress). The survey was carried out in June 2001 and is based on face-to-face interviews with a representative sample of a total of 11,000 workers: 1000 workers in each country, apart from Malta and Cyprus where 500 persons were interviewed. The report will be published on 23 October 2003 Quality of life in Europe What is your quality of life? This was the question that was asked answered by citizens of 28 European countries in a Foundation survey to took place in May and June of this year. The survey on living conditions and quality of life in the 15 Member States, the 10 Acceding countries and the three candidate countries, focuses on employment, economic resources, family life, community life, health and education looking at the views and experiences of Europe’s citizens. The first findings from the quality of life monitoring initiative will be published in early 2004. EU policy focus on living conditions has grown considerably in the wake of the Maastricht Agreement in 1992 with the European Commission White Papers on European Social Policy and on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment and the Communication on the Social Policy Agenda. The Foundation’s quality of life monitoring initiative is a resource that can provide data and analysis and to assess new and emerging issues on living conditions for EU policymakers. Monitoring industrial relations in Europe The European Industrial Relations Observatory’s (EIRO) network of correspondents has been expanded to also cover the 10 acceding countries to the European Union, offering news and analysis on industrial relations from 25 countries across Europe. 'We aim to collect, analyse and disseminate high-quality and up-to-date information on key developments in industrial relations in the acceding countries, in the same way we have in the current EU Member States during the past five years,' says Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s Acting Director. 'The EIRO cross-country comparisons will be further developed to cover topics on the EU political agenda.' The second Industrial relations developments in Europe report, a joint effort between the Foundation and the European Commission presents a comparative overview of the most significant industrial relations developments in 2003, is already in the production pipeline. The annual review entitled Industrial relations in the EU, Japan and USA, which examines the key issues such as pay, gender pay inequality, working time, new forms of work, leave, training and skills development, is due to be published before the end of the year. Several comparative reports on topics such as collective bargaining on occupational pensions, on childcare and parental leave, and on tripartism in the acceding countries and industrial disputes will also be published on EIRO. The European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) was set up more than five years ago, following a request by the European Commission and the social partners. The aim is to regularly provide national and European level social partner and governmental organisations, and EU institutions, with news and analysis of industrial relation developments in Europe. EIRO recorded an average 170.000 user sessions per month during the first six months of this year, which represents an increase of more than 120% compared to the first six months in 2002.

It will also take some time before European Work Councils emerge as a key player in the labour market. The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the National Labour Market Board and the Swedish Business Development Agency are organising a conference 25-26 October in Stockholm on “EMU and EURO: The future of Industrial Relations”. Some of the questions to be addressed are: How has the process of EMU affected relations between employers, trade unions and employees? What will the introduction of the EURO mean for the future of industrial relations in Europe? The conference is based on Foundation research on the impact of EMU on industiral relations, employment and working conditions at European, national, sectoral and company levels. The findings reveal that while EMU has had a great impact on the restructuring of companies and the public sector, it has had very limited impact on industrial market relations. Three main changes in the public sector since the mid 80s are: decentralisation, devolved autonomy and privatisation. Outsourcing is another trend. Taken together these trends have had a radical effect on employment relations and industrial relations The boundary lines between the private and the public sector have become blurred in these 15 years. In the future they will become even more blurred, noticed Rien Huiskamp, (the Netherlands) who has made a study, focusing on the public sector. He also points out: The pressure on the public sector will increase. Tax payers will watch very carefully what they pay and what they will get for the money. Denmark, Sweden and the UK will be watching the introduction of the single currency for clues as to whether their own governments will agree to join in the future, says Timo Kauppinen, research manager at the Foundation, Further information: Timo Kauppinen, European Foundation for the Improvements of Living and Working Conditions, Dublin, phone +353+1+204 3143 or mobile +353 87 919 2191.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/press-release-25-october-2001

Research data and findings on working conditions and an ageing workforce will be presented during the year, as well as new work contributing to the European Year of Mobility. The second external evaluation of the Foundation’s work will be carried out, and the Foundation Forum 2006 will focus on competitiveness. The gathering of the Foundation’s stakeholders also marks the introduction of a new set of governing regulations, primarily to accommodate the sheer size of the Foundation’s decision-making body following enlargement of the European Union. While maintaining its tripartite structure, the former administrative board is now called the governing board and it will meet once a year, apart from the annual group meetings. The bureau has been enlarged to take on its widened responsibilities. These changes have its basis in a Council regulation which updates and amends the Foundation’s original regulation (EEC) 1365/75. Also amended and updated are the Foundation’s staff regulations, realigning the rights and obligations of its staff with those of the other EU institutions and European bodies. Next month will see the launch of the new thematic magazine Foundation Focus and the first case studies on the ageing workforce will be published on EuroFound.

Building on interagency cooperation Plans for wide-ranging cooperation in research and information exchange have been outlined by Eurofound and the European Training Foundation (ETF). At a meeting held on 18–19 June in Dublin, representatives of the two agencies agreed to build on the expertise of both EU agencies, putting in place cooperation initiatives looking at the areas of migration, employment and labour market issues, social dialogue and social partnership. Concrete measures proposed for each of these areas included establishing research cooperation to look at migration from the EU’s neighbouring countries into the Union, initiating mutual invitations to both agencies’ seminars on social dialogue, and devising joint research on the relationship between skills development and foreign direct investment (FDI). Follow up visit EU agencies face increasing budgetary pressure and growing demands to more effectively serve Europe’s citizens. In an effort to meet this challenge proactively, the agencies are moving to engage in greater cooperation in all areas of their work activities. June’s Dublin meeting follows a kick-off meeting between the two sides held at the ETF offices in Turin in February, which outlined a range of possible areas for cooperation. This latest meeting narrowed the focus to three areas – migration, employment and social dialogue – and in collaborative workshops drew up practical measures for cooperation between the two agencies. Following the final plenary session, a provisional outline of the future cooperation agreement between the two agencies was drawn up. Mission of the ETF Founded in 1994, the ETF advises and assists the EU partner countries in developing vocational education and training systems and putting them into practice. Working on the premise that education and training can help raise levels of prosperity, assist growth and encourage social inclusion in developing economies, the ETF also assists the European Commission with its investment activities in education and training reform in the partner countries. (Partner countries and regions include the Russian Federation, the western Balkans and countries in Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa.) The ETF’s experience with these regions and its substantial country intelligence complements the experience of Eurofound and other agencies in the EU27. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-july-2007

In this issue: Director's diary Strong link between restructuring and job creation Lack of training opportunities among non-permanent workers Research and news in brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Strong link between restructuring and job creation The number of new jobs created through restructuring activities in Europe is almost equal to the number of jobs lost during the second quarter of 2005, according to the latest European Restructuring Monitor Quarterly. The number of job announcements in the EU in the period between April and June 2005 has almost doubled compared to the first quarter of the year, according to the summer edition of the ERM quarterly, published by the Foundation's European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC). Some 213 restructuring cases resulted in 120,000 new jobs during the second quarter, from 1 April to 30 June. These jobs were mainly created in the manufacturing and wholesale and retail industries. Similar to the findings in previous ERM reports, the majority of these new job announcements were found in the new EU Member States. The new job creations almost balanced the announcements of 142,000 job losses during the same period. Among the 27 countries covered by the ERM, Romania reported the highest number of job losses (35 job losses per 10,000 workers), followed by Hungary (17), Finland and Sweden (10 each), and the United Kingdom (9). The ERM quarterly also presents in-depth analysis of job restructuring in Spain and in the European retail sector. New job creations ‘This new data from the European Restructuring Monitor shows a positive trend,’ says Barbara Gerstenberger, research coordinator for the Foundation’s European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC). ‘We are recording an increasing number of cases where companies announce expansion and the creation of additional jobs.’ The lion’s share of these new job announcements were found in the new EU Member States, with Poland attracting some 24,500 new jobs, Romania 20,600 and the Czech Republic 10,000. The highest number of restructuring activities were recorded in Poland (70 cases), the United Kingdom (64), Germany (63) and Romania (59). Focus on EU retail sector The ERM quarterly provides in-depth analysis on company restructuring in 27 countries across the European Union. In its country focus, it puts the spotlight on Spain, with its modest 2 job losses per 10,000 workers during the last quarters. The European retail trade sector, which employs 9% of all Europeans, is examined in the quarterly’s sector focus. It also examines two cases of business expansion in more depth: BMW's decision to open a new factory in high-cost Germany and Tesco’s expansion in Poland.

Articles Director's diary Policies and actions for a healthy Europe Gender equality and economic effectiveness In brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Policies and actions for a healthy Europe With Europe’s ageing population and declining rates of fertility, the need for health and social services is set to increase dramatically. The role of the European Union in determining a long-term strategy takes on ever more importance in this respect. Health and social services in all EU Member States face similar challenges in adjusting to demographic ageing, changing employment and family patterns, evolving technological opportunities and funding issues. To meet these challenges, reform of the health and social care funding systems is essential, first and foremost to increase efficiency, according to the most recent series of Sector Future articles from the European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC). Currently, there is a tendency to rely on market mechanisms as a means of increasing efficiency. These come in the form of replacing standard reimbursement services with strategic and proactive purchasing. In essence, providers are selected according to new cost-effectiveness criteria, among them performance-related payment systems, which have resulted in European purchasers being able to influence the behaviour of providers. But also recent advances in information and communication technology, and in genomics and other biotechnologies, have had positive effect on the efficiency of healthcare services. Many commentators still believe, however, that the greatest benefits will come from policies aimed at encouraging healthier lifestyles to reduce the burden of disease. Awash with initiatives Despite the many and difficult challenges that face Europe’s health and social care system, the report revealed that there are many and varied initiatives to improve health care across the Member States. At their simplest, these initiatives focus on the exchange of knowledge and good practice between Member States. More ambitious efforts, however, address the issues of eHealth standardisation, the mobility of health care professionals and patients, and the support for high-tech innovation in biotechnology start-ups. The series found that European national policymakers broadly agree on the core objectives for their health care systems. The list is strikingly straightforward: universal access for all citizens, effective care for better health outcomes, efficient use of resources, high-quality services and responsiveness to patient concerns.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-january-2005-0

Spotlight on gender and career development Women’s work is changing, but not fast enough. Few active measures to improve women’s working lives are being taken; meanwhile, it seems that traditional patterns of working and living are being slowly eroded. These are some of the outcomes presented in Eurofound’s new Industrial relations developments 2006, which reviews significant developments in social dialogue at European and national levels over the past year and takes an in-depth look at broader issues. This year’s review focuses on how the restructuring of career patterns and work organisation impacts on women’s career progression. It underlines that gender sectoral segregation is still prevalent, with many women working in such sectors as health or education, and often employed in part-time jobs with few opportunities for training or promotion. The findings suggest that more legislation, adequately applied at company level, may help in closing the gender pay gap, increasing skills levels and enabling women to break through the glass ceiling into management. Awareness among the social partners Although trade unions are aware of the importance of gender equality and have been campaigning actively for improvements, many employers remain unconvinced of the need to tackle the issue. While examples of innovative practices exist, these often occur in isolation. Even in sectors with a majority of female workers, women are underrepresented in management positions. Ongoing discussion on working-time flexibility The annual review also looks at key collective bargaining issues over the past year in the different countries, for example working-time flexibility. Here the focus was on ‘time-savings accounts’ or ‘banks’ and on overtime hours. The national agreement for 2007–2008 reached at the end of the year in Belgium, for example, cut the pay for overtime in order to facilitate more flexible working, and introduced new rules on flexible working-time agreements at company and sector level. In Finland, according to the current central incomes policy agreement, the trade union and employer confederations will inform their member organisations about the possibilities of using working-time ‘banks’ and encourage their promotion through sectoral agreements. Employers push for longer working hours Reductions in working hours appeared infrequently on the bargaining agenda in 2006, as agreed normal weekly hours have been fairly static across western Europe since the late 1990s. Although the issue has more prominence in central and eastern European Member States, where working time tends to be longer, there was little change in 2006. Rather than working-time reductions, attempts by employers to increase working hours were a more notable feature of the 2006 bargaining round in some countries.

Vlado Dimovski, Minister of Labour, Family and Social Affairs, Republic of Slovenia ‘Human capital is the key driver of productivity in a modern, knowledge-based society. However human capital isn’t just produced in the education system, it is also produced in firms and in families. Unfortunately, a lot of this knowledge remains locked in families due to the absence of affordable childcare, lack of working time flexibility and other obstacles. ‘Converting this personal and tacit knowledge into organisational knowledge is one of the big challenges and why reconciling work and family life is so important. Employers should find more creative ways to balance flexibility with security and social protection.’ Bernhard Jansen, Director, DG Employment and Social Affairs, European Commission ‘For many people the working day doesn’t finish when they get home from their paid employment: they start a second working day, including housework, educating their children and caring for dependent relatives and the elderly. When formulating strategies, this additional time has to be taken into account, as does the fact that this double workload is rarely distributed equitably between men and women.’ Micheál Martin, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Ireland ‘The fight against unemployment is universally seen as one of the most important ways to improve economic and social conditions for families. Member States that have achieved high overall employment rates have in common policies that take into account the need to reconcile work and family responsibilities. ‘We also need to keep an eye on the quality of work. Research (in Europe) has found that a good job is considered the most important factor in ensuring a good life.’	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-6-2004-0
EUROFOUND_UNK_1237	2007-12-16	UNK	Background note, 31 May 2004	" EU Presidency conference on ‘Improving living conditions and quality of life in rural Europe', Westport, Co. Mayo, 31 May - 1 June: High quality of life in rural Europe 	 	‘Quality of Life’ can be defined as the general well-being of the people living in a society. However, well-being depends not only on actual living and working conditions, but also on the way people feel, view and respond to their lives in a very large number of domains in a complex manner. An increase in income is usually considered to have a positive impact on quality of life. If it goes hand in hand with higher working hours or more stress, the overall effect on quality of life may be negative. 	 	 	In 2002, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions identified twelve such domains relevant to people’s quality of life. They are: 	 Economic resources Health and health care Employment and working conditions Knowledge, education and training Families and households Community life and social participation Housing Local environment and amenities Transport Public safety and crime Recreation and leisure activities Culture and identity, political resources and human rights, including the European dimension. 	 	The important issue of ‘time use’ is considered to be of a transversal nature relevant for most of the twelve domains. Similarly, the emerging issue of ‘social capital’ relates to a number of domains, especially around community life, political resources and knowledge. 	 Quality of life and rural development For this purpose the Foundation’s monitoring system is useful; and the new representative questionnaire-based survey on quality of life is of particular relevance. Monitoring quality of life in Europe In 2002 the Foundation launched an extensive monitoring system based on the following main activities Development of an interactive online database based on existing data sources in the EU (former EU-15, new Member States as well as candidate countries) around approximately 20 indicators in each domain. A representative, questionnaire-based survey in 28 countries with emphasis on the core domains listed above (sample size: 1000 per country). The results of this work are currently being analysed and disseminated. Analysis of a similar type Eurobarometer survey in the new Member States and EU-15 and the three candidate countries, jointly with the European Commission, published in 2004 (European Foundation/European Commission, 2004). 	 	 	The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions is a tripartite EU body, whose role is to provide key actors in social policy making with findings, knowledge and advice drawn from comparative research. The Foundation was established by Council Regulation EEC No 1365/75 of 26 May 1975. 	 More news and information from the Foundation.

In this issue: Director's diary Working time developments in Europe Life satisfaction high in Romania In brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Director’s diary Greater labour mobility fits with the Lisbon objectives Analysis by the Foundation of the 2005 Eurobarometer survey on geographical and labour mobility reveals that European citizens are indeed willing to move to another region or another Member State for the purposes of employment. Greater mobility is good news for Europe in terms of achieving the objectives of the Lisbon Agenda, which require a skilled and adaptable labour force and a more open and more accessible labour market. However, the process of integrating new migrants into host societies must be planned and managed. Increasingly, it is local authorities who are charged with the task of effectively implementing integration policy to ensure that the benefits of immigration are experienced by all. It is important for the local authorities to be able to exchange views and share experiences on successful integration policy. The Foundation will be contributing its expertise in migration and labour mobility at the launch of the newly created European Network of Cities for Local Integration Policy for Migrants (CLIP) in Dublin on 11 September. The CLIP action research project brings together representatives from some 30 cities from across the European Union, with the aim of analysing good practice in sustainable integration policy on a variety of issues. Further afield, also in September, the Foundation will present its recent findings in industrial relations at the 14th World Congress of the International Industrial Relations Association in Lima, Peru. And at the start of October, at a conference organised under the auspices of the Finnish Presidency in Helsinki, the Foundation will gather experts from across Europe to discuss policy recommendations on how demands for staff in social care can be met.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1239	2007-12-16	UNK	Press release, 22 January 2001	 22 January 2001 Small firms have a big role in job creation More than 90% of all companies in Europe employ fewer than ten people and employ more than 25% of European workers. While these companies offer great job creation potential, quality of employment in microfirms needs careful policy consideration, according to Filomena Oliveira, research manager at the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the European agency based in Dublin. Commenting on the findings of Jobs in EU Micro Firms: the trade-off between quantity and quality, a Foundation project investigates the relationship between job creation and job quality, she said: 'It is important to design and implement policies which can simultaneously encourage adaptability and the modernization of the smallest enterprises, improve security for workers, and develop initiatives of potential entrepreneurs.' According to Filomena Oliveira, the case study of the pilot project revealed that micro firms provide fewer permanent contracts, hold less consultation with employees over change and are less likely to ensure support schemes such as child care or training for their employees. On the other hand, workers in micro firms are less likely to be absent from work, are given more time to complete their tasks, have greater job autonomy and less direct control by their boss. Filomena Oliveira stressed that to develop the full potential of microfirms, more than just financial support is needed: 'We need to know what kind of support is best and how it should be managed, so that we really get more jobs, better jobs, and more profitable companies. There is an indication that, compared with the United States, uncertainty and risk in Europe and Japan have a stronger effect on job quality for workers and can restraint entrepreneurship for potential employers.'

Monthly user sessions on Eurofound increased from 160,000 to 230,000, with a record number of 340,000 noted in March. The EIRO portal experienced more than a tripling in its user sessions, rising from 120,000 to 400,000 per month over the same period. The EMCC and EWCO portals have, similarly, recorded increases, albeit smaller, averaging around 35,000 user sessions per month. The role of local authorities in integrating migrants In association with the Council of Europe and the City of Stuttgart, the Foundation will launch an action research project on the social and economic integration of migrants. The work will take place within the remit of a newly created network of some 30 cities from inside and outside the European Union, and will analyse good practice in sustainable integration policy on a variety of issues. The project has been developed in close consultation with the European Parliament, the European Commission, the Economic and Social Committee, and the Committee of the Regions. It seeks to fill a gap in the analysis and evaluation of recent efforts by local authorities to coordinate their activities and learn from each other. The launch of the network, as well as the first conference on the subject, will bring mayors from the cities involved together in Dublin over 11–12 September 2006. A concept paper, setting out the scope of the project, is available. Call for a European childcare policy A comprehensive European childcare policy is needed to ensure that out-of-school childcare for school-age children is a positive experience for parents and children alike, the Foundation argues, in a report based on research into employment initiatives in childcare for 5–12 year olds in Europe. The report, Employment developments in childcare services for school age children, found that, while the sector is expanding, the majority of jobs are not well paid. Childcare also suffers from unattractive working conditions and a poor image which discourages potential new entrants into the profession. The Foundation hopes that the report will help to raise awareness of the importance of childcare for all children, and so contribute to the Barcelona targets of providing better childcare to facilitate women’s entry into, and retention in, the workforce. The report will be published in August. Six more national visits planned for the autumn The Foundation plans to present new research findings, data and recommendations to its stakeholders and other policy-makers in the Netherlands, Belgium, Romania, France, Malta and Italy during autumn 2006. The national visits are part of the Foundation’s strategy of meeting with its stakeholders and audiences on a regular basis, which presents the opportunity to highlight current research from a national perspective. Recent findings on working conditions, working time and work–life balance, migration and quality of life are issues that will be in the spotlight during these visits.

Her plans for the future include devoting time and energy to projects in her local Dublin community. When Wendy O’Conghaile came to the Foundation in 1977, she was on leave of absence from the European Commission, where she had been working on information systems related to the social aspects of agriculture. Little did she know that she was to remain for almost three decades and was destined to play a pivotal role in shaping the work programmes and operations of the EU’s oldest decentralised agency. Initially, her work involved research into working conditions. She then moved on to tackle issues of unemployment and social cohesion. In latter years, as highly-regarded advisor to the Directorate, Wendy O’Conghaile put her considerable talents and experience to the task of developing the Foundation’s four-year rolling programmes and annual programmes of work. She was also responsible for executing and overseeing the first external evaluation of the Foundation in 2001-2. Putting the Foundation on the map The improvement of living and working conditions is not a new concept in the European arena, according to Wendy O’Conghaile, since this goal was a founding aim of the European Community, enshrined in the 1957 Treaty of Rome. However, the Foundation plays a special role in the building of a social Europe, not by being directly involved in the EU decision-making process but rather as a provider of essential information and a promoter of new ideas. ‘The Foundation has played an increasingly important role over the past three decades in drawing attention to the problems faced by EU citizens, workers and companies, and in highlighting opportunities for the social actors to improve quality of life and work,’ says Wendy O’Conghaile. ‘Without the skills and strong commitment of the people at the Foundation, it would not be possible to carry out this complex and fascinating task. I am happy to have been part of the good work we have done and continue to do here.’ Working in tandem with the European Social Agenda Wendy O’Conghaile asserts that while the Foundation’s regulation has remained unchanged since its inception, the scope of its work, its networks and activities have altered radically. The social partners have always played a central role in the work of the Foundation and, together with the Commission and the Member State governments, they have given it a greater capacity to achieve its mandate. With the knowledge, experience and contact networks accumulated over time, the Foundation’s reputation has increasingly broadened its target audiences. The establishment of the EMCC in 2001, for example, brought on a stronger company dimension and a more direct link to the actual workplace. ‘The Foundation has turned from a being a research body to a knowledge centre, where research is a key tool enabling the Foundation to monitor, analyse and anticipate change,’ says Wendy O’Conghaile. ‘The result is a more timely, more interactive, more relevant response to current issues and future challenges facing an enlarging Europe.’ A challenging working environment ‘It has been a privilege to work, with the ongoing support of my colleagues in the staff, the Administrative Board and the research community, on issues and goals that are close to one’s own personal values,’ concludes Wendy O’Conghaile. ‘I will miss the Foundation’s cross-cultural environment, and the feeling of being part of a movement that can make a difference.’	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-2-2004-5

Articles Director's diary Continued wage moderation across Europe High levels of life satisfaction in Spain Research and news in brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing High levels of life satisfaction in Spain In Spain, levels of satisfaction with life and optimism about the future are somewhat higher than the European average, the Spanish government, social partners and NGOs were told at a presentation of the findings of the Foundation’s European Quality of Life Survey in Madrid on 25-26 April. Despite this, however, the survey reveals some economic deprivation and hardship, especially among women and older people, reflecting slightly lower household income levels in Spain, in comparison with other former EU15 Member States. Older people in Spain tend to be less satisfied and are markedly less optimistic about the future. Tension between men and women in Spain also appears higher: 17% of Spanish men report a lot of tension compared to the EU25 average of 10%, while 22% of Spanish women say this compared to the EU25 average of 13%. Spain is also the country in the EU15 where the highest proportion of both men and women report work-life problems. Nearly half of Spanish women report that several times a week, they are too tired to carry out household tasks after they come home from work, compared with a quarter of women in the former EU15. The corresponding figures are 35% for Spanish men and 21% for men on average in the EU15 countries.

Extended and unusual working hours A new analysis of extended and unusual working hours in 21,000 companies and organisations across Europe confirms that while night work, weekend work, working at a varying schedule, and shift work in particular, may make business sense, it must be balanced against the adverse health effects and low motivation among workers, and high staff turnover. More companies and organisations in Cyprus, France, Ireland and the United Kingdom are open for business on Saturdays than elsewhere in Europe, according to Eurofound’s Establishment Survey on Working Time (EWST). Regular Sunday work is most prevalent in Finland, Latvia Sweden and the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom also figures among the countries where regular night work is most common, together with the Czech Republic and Sweden. Regular work at changing hours is most prevalent in companies and organisations in Finland, Poland and Sweden. Extended and unusual working hours are widespread in sectors such as the hotels and restaurants sector, the health/social work sector and personal services: these sectors have a high degree of Saturday and to Sunday work. Regular night work is most common in the utilities, health/social work, and hotel and restaurant sectors, and the incidence of regular work at changing hours is most prevalent in hotels and restaurants, followed by the health and transport sectors. Finally, the report also found that the size of the company or establishment is an important factor. By and large, the smaller the company or establishment, the less common are non-standard hours. Absenteeism and problems retaining staff The ESWT is an establishment, not an employee survey, which means that it does not provide data on workers’ preferences and considerations, but rather that of managers and employee representatives. In order to analyse the consequences of non-standard working hours, it investigated the outcomes of unusual working hours in terms of sickness rates, motivational problems, and difficulties in retaining staff. Managers in companies and organisations that often operate at night and changing hours were 1.6 times more likely to report difficulties with sickness and absenteeism than managers in companies and organisations not working such hours. Likewise, managers of establishments working at nights and on Saturdays were 1.5 times more likely to report motivational problems of staff compared to managers in establishments with standard working hours. Difficulties in retaining staff were perceived in particular in companies and organisations that work at weekends: 1.7 times higher than in companies and organisations not working at weekends. Compensation in money not enough, nor is early retirement The ESWT data show that early retirement is still very common among companies and organisations that regularly operate at unusual and changing hours. The report found, however, decreasing numbers of early retirement in companies and organisations that do business at unusual and changing hours in France and Germany, which could be interpreted as early signals of a turn of the tide. The findings also indicate that the traditional method of sweetening the pain of night and shift work by extra pay is still practised in many companies and organisations. However, in loght of an ageing workforce, compensatory pay alone will perhaps not be enough in the future. The same may apply to the only widespread non-pay benefit for night and shift work, namely early retirement. At any rate, the question of other potential working-time related benefits may gain importance in the future as early retirement is debated in the public arena.

Accurate and useful information and analysis on trends and prospects are essential in order to anticipate such changes. While the EMCC has consistently scored points with its stakeholders for its work, last month heard a cross-section of members of the European Parliament applaud its efforts specifically in the restructuring arena. As always in early July, the Foundation’s three stakeholder groups – the government, worker and employer representatives – will arrive in Dublin for informal preparatory discussions on the proposed work programme for 2006. This year’s discussions will also focus on how to put into practice the recently adopted Council regulation amending the Foundation’s founding regulation.

Despite EU-wide statutory rights to parental leave, big differences still exist In Europe’s diverse and fast-changing economic climate, both companies and workers need flexibility. Working time arrangements can have a significant bearing on the efficiency, productivity and competitiveness of companies, not to mention the health, well-being and motivation of their employees. Although the right to parental leave has been established in all EU Member States, important differences continue to exist between countries with regard to policy provisions and patterns of take-up of such leave by parents. Just over half of Europe’s companies and public authorities with 10 or more employees have had staff on parental leave in the past three years, a new analysis of the Foundation’s European Establishment Survey on Working Time 2004-2005 has found. In the 21 countries surveyed – the former EU15 countries plus the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Hungary, Latvia, Poland and Slovenia – the proportion of establishments with employees on parental leave varies from 45% to 60%. Parental leave – as well as other forms of extended leave, such as leave to care for sick children or other adult family members – constitutes a major policy component for promoting work–life balance for employees with caring responsibilities. Although the right to parental leave has been established in all EU Member States through the transposition of the 1996 EU directive on parental leave, the report found that large differences continue to exist between countries, especially with regard to details of policy provision and patterns of take-up levels by parents. Clear north–south divide Sweden, with some 89% of establishments making use of the option to take parental leave, is the clear leader among the surveyed countries. Finland is ranked second at 80%, followed by Slovenia (63%) and Belgium (61%). At the other end of the ranking, Poland comes in third last (45%), then Portugal (44%) and, at the bottom, Spain (25%). These differences, the report points out, may be explained by national variations in statutory provisions, in addition to other societal differences such as public childcare provision and labour market conditions. The key components of parental leave schemes in all countries surveyed are a statutory entitlement part and a financial provision part; the latter provides for either moderate or high earnings replacement levels. Not surprisingly, the take-up rates of parental leave are high in the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland and Sweden) where the existing schemes are flexible and underwritten by high earnings replacement levels. In these countries, most women choose to benefit from parental leave and return to employment afterwards, with comprehensive childcare services and other reconciliation measures as support. Take-up rates are more moderate in France, the Netherlands and Spain where between one third and two thirds of mothers make use of their parental leave entitlement. Elsewhere, take-up rates of parental leave by mothers are much lower, including in five of the countries – Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and the UK – where parental leave is unpaid, but also in Belgium where a flat-rate payment is available. In Luxembourg and Austria, parental leave take-up is at best moderate. In the majority of the countries surveyed, less than 10% of fathers use their parental leave entitlement, the report found, again with a similar division between the north and south of Europe as for women. Difficulties faced by companies The survey set also set out to examine the companies’ attitudes to parental leave. It found that just 11% of the establishments with recent experience of parental leave reported having encountered problems as a result. However, over half of the establishments reported difficulties in finding replacement staff for those on parental leave and half of them also mentioned continuity of staff and work problems. Uncertainty about if or when the employees on parental leave will return to work represented a problem in 44% of companies while a sizeable proportions of establishments mentioned having problems with too many staff absent on leave (24%) and reintegration difficulties with staff returning to work (22%).

In this issue: Director's diary Temporary agency work in an enlarged European Union Minimum wages: a global perspective In brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Director’s diary Making work more attractive Against the background of the Lisbon strategy goals of increasing employment rates, the Foundation carried out a company survey on working time arrangements and work–life balance in late 2004 and early 2005. This comprehensive, pan-European survey of 21,000 workplaces set out to explore what types of working time arrangements companies put in place for their employees. At EU policy level, the priority is the need to make work more attractive, in particular for women and elderly workers, and to implement policies which make it possible to combine work with other aspects of life. At a briefing to members of the European Parliament on 18 March, the Foundation presented the first findings of the survey. According to the findings, flexible working time arrangements are viewed as beneficial by both the employer and the employee, with more than half the workplaces in the survey reporting a higher degree of job satisfaction among workers, and a better arrangement of working hours to match the workload. About one third of the companies also reported reduction of paid overtime and lower absenteeism. This joint positive approach to flexi-time arrangements is good news for job creation in Europe. In the coming month, the Foundation’s Annual Report 2005 will be published. The Foundation will also share its expertise at an Austrian EU Presidency conference on social services of general interest and visit government and social partner representatives in the United Kingdom as part of its roadshow initiative.

NEWS IN BRIEF Spotlight on quality of life in Bulgaria One in five Bulgarians reports that they have difficulties in fulfilling family responsibilities because of the amount of time spent at work, according to the 2003 Quality of Life in Europe Survey. The Foundation will present the findings and recent analysis from the survey to government officials and social partners at a seminar in Sofia on 20 March. During the two-day visit, the Foundation will host bilateral meetings with their Bulgarian stakeholders. The findings from the survey paint a stark picture of living conditions in the country but the Foundation hopes the analysis can contribute to the current process of macroeconomic and structural reform in the run-up to full membership of the European Union in 2007. Read more on this topic Healthy ageing essential for Europe Good health and sufficient income are regarded by older people in Europe as key determinants of the quality of life, according to unpublished research findings which the Foundation will present at a conference on Healthy ageing in Europe. The conference, organised by the European Federation of Older Persons (EURAG) under the auspices of the Austrian EU Presidency, will take place in Vienna on 8–9 March. While the majority of older people are fit, active, and living independently, people in the ten new EU Member States report both more poor health and longstanding illness or disability than people in the former EU15 countries. While developing initiatives to support a healthy lifestyle and behaviour are important, the Foundation argues for more attention to the mental well-being of older people and to opportunities for involvement in community life. Support measures for business creation after restructuring Governments, social partners and enterprises across Europe are increasing their joint commitment to support more business creation as a consequence of restructuring, a new report from the Foundation’s European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) reveals. There is limited evidence for this support, however, and practices are not widespread, mainly due to existing legal and administrative barriers, and the limited access to finance and seed capital. The report maps and analyses existing support measures, regulatory initiatives and collective agreements that foster business creation and entrepreneurship following restructuring. It argues that raising awareness of good practise of business creation is vital in order to change the negative perceptions about restructuring. It shows how restructuring can be turned into an opportunity for creating jobs by presenting five case studies. The full report will be available on the EMCC website later in March Changing social security structures Existing ‘flexicurity’ arrangements in the EU Member States are an essential part of an effective mobility and adaptability policy. A new report by the Foundation on Working time options over the life course: Changing social security structures indicates that the Netherlands and Sweden provide the most innovative and integrated working time and related income support over the working life. Measures in these two countries support effective social security arrangements for the individual and their family, but not at the expense of the financial sustainability of the social security system. The report provides a detailed analysis of three main issues in relation to social security: breaks in employment careers, reduced working hours and flexible working time schemes.

Ambitious new work programme for 2007 The Foundation’s annual programme of work for 2007 outlines a series of activities that provide added value to its stakeholders and information users. Among the highlights in 2007: fieldwork for the second European Quality of Life Survey, expansion of the Network of European Observatories (NEO) to 28 countries, and on-going contributions to the 2007 European Year of Equal Opportunities. For the third year in its current four-year work programme, entitled Changing Europe: better work, better life, the Foundation has put together a comprehensive yet focused work programme that reflects European policy agendas and the priorities of its stakeholders. It is the first annual work programme under Jorma Karppinen’s directorship, and a considerable amount of time has been allocated during the course of 2006 to reflect on the Foundation’s longer term future. For this purpose, the Foundation’s mission, vision and values have been redefined and action plans to achieve them have been developed. Two-pronged strategic approach to research The Foundation will continue to use a variety of research strategies in carrying out its work. Large-scale representative surveys provide unique data on the economic and social situation in Europe, marked in 2007 by the second European Quality of Life survey. Strategic research will focus on the four research themes outlined in the four-year work programme, under which a number of research projects are reaching maturity while at the same time many new projects are being introduced. While the main focus will be on the EU, the work will also touch on the candidate and neighbouring countries, and to some extent also involve comparisons of the EU vis-à-vis global competition. The thrust of the research will include social, economic, legal and competitiveness factors to study the improvement of living and working conditions. In 2007, the skills and resources of the Foundation will be developed to meet the new objectives: more forecast-oriented work, including some global comparisons, innovation, productivity and competitiveness. The Foundation expects to have a staff of 94 persons and a budget of EUR 20.2 million. Increased coverage and collaboration In 2007, the Foundation will build on its Network of European Observatories (NEO) through which national correspondents in 28 European countries provide news and information on developments in the fields of industrial relations, working conditions and restructuring. It is also intended to intensify cooperation and links with other European agencies and institutions. In this respect, the Foundation will collaborate with the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) in Thessaloniki in Greece, in forecasting the employment and skills gap in Europe. With the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) in Bilbao, Spain, the Foundation will carry out joint dissemination activities. New strategic research projects The four strategic research themes – employment and restructuring, working conditions and work–life balance, industrial relations and partnership, and social cohesion and quality of life – altogether encompass 25 research initiatives. Eleven of these are new in 2007, including sectoral employment level forecasts, undeclared work, the role of micro-companies in employment growth, the self-employed, working conditions and social dialogue, industrial relations at global corporate level, and regional-level developments and business creation. Communicating and sharing experiences During the course of the year, the Foundation’s communication efforts will be focused on better understanding its customers’ needs, more tailor-made information products, better timing of contributions to the public debates, with the overall aim of increasing its visibility and intensifying the Foundation’s impact on decision-makers.

Articles Director's diary Industrial relations still differ in the EU, Japan and US Working conditions and gender in an enlarged Europe Research and news in brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Industrial relations still differ in the EU, Japan and US Collective bargaining remains the dominant method of settling pay and working time in Europe, covering approximately two-thirds of workers in the European Union of 25 countries. This contrasts against one fifth of the workforce covered by collective agreements in Japan and only one eighth of the US workforce, the Foundation has found in its new report, Industrial relations in the EU, Japan and USA 2003-4. Collective bargaining remains almost entirely decentralised in Japan and the US, while bargaining in the EU is conducted at all levels, from the national intersectoral to the individual workplace, depending on national systems. There are, however, signs that in a number of countries - most notably France and Germany - collective bargaining is becoming even more decentralised, moving from the sectoral to the company level. Against a background of rising healthcare costs, the single most important issue in US collective bargaining is still health insurance. In Japan, there were some signs of diversification beyond pay in the regular annual spring bargaining rounds. The bargaining agenda in some EU Member States, mainly in the former EU15 countries, continued to encompass a wide and varying range of issues beyond pay and working hours. Decreasing trade union membership levels force mergers and collaboration The already comparatively low level of trade union membership and density continued to fall in the USA and Japan. In the EU (where overall union density is considerably higher than in Japan and the USA), 2003-4 is likely to have witnessed a continuation of the trends of the past decade. This includes rising membership in a substantial number of countries, but an overall fall in union membership across the EU, mainly because of major membership losses in some central and eastern European countries and significant losses in large countries with high absolute numbers of union members, such as Germany and the UK. Against this backdrop, union mergers continued in Japan and many EU countries, while proposals for a radical merger and restructuring process raises questions for the USA's AFL-CIO confederation. Another common theme has been for unions to reach out to new groups outside their traditional constituencies. On the employer side, a number of organisations restructured or merged in some EU Member States during 2003-4. Low levels of industrial action In Japan and the USA, labour disputes and industrial action remained at relatively low levels compared to previous years. In the EU15, the picture was more mixed, but the data available again indicate that a general trend towards less strikes and similar activities have been maintained in most countries in recent years. Seeing the trends Since 2000, the Foundation has conducted a project comparing aspects of industrial relations in the European Union, Japan and the USA on an annual basis. The aim of the project is to compare the basic structures and current developments, not least to help illuminate what makes the European social model distinctive. It assists with 'benchmarking' the EU against its major competitors in an era of increasing economic globalisation. This year the report also examines how the rising level of international migration (particularly labour migration) and pension provision (particularly occupational pensions) are tackled in the different industrial relations systems.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-march-2005-0

The European Commission has called on the Foundation to come up with suggestions as to how to raise awareness and increase understanding of EU-level social policy in the EU Member States, a problem identified by the High Level Group on Industrial relations and change in the European Union. The answer is the Foundation Seminar series, which consists of participatory knowledge exchange seminars, aimed at actors at national level working to bring their countries’ labour markets in line with the Lisbon criteria. Sharing knowledge and experiences With its tripartite structure, the Foundation is well placed to explain EU-level social policy issues. Banking on the Foundation as a forum for frank and open exchange, the formula is to let participants share experiences and debate how to implement them at national levels. The Foundation will add its wealth of knowledge from all core research areas, aided by experts from the European employers’ and workers’ organisations, and the European Commission. Focus on age and work The theme, ‘Age and work: connecting the generations’, provides the main focus for the seminars. Specifically, the emphasis will be on the challenges to the European labour market arising from demographic trends, as well as the opportunities offered by combining the skills and competences of various generations at the workplace. There are two Foundation seminars planned for 2004: 9-11 June in Dublin and 11-13 September in Bonn.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-2-2004-0

Of particular importance is our work on how to improve the quality of life of the disadvantaged and to support the reintegration of more vulnerable groups into the labour market. Also this month, the second annual review of working conditions in Europe is due to be published and an EMCC company seminar will gather representatives from business and public authorities in Tallinn, Estonia, to look at the effects of outsourcing in business-related service industries. In addition, following the presentation of the European Quality of Life Survey findings in Austria, earlier this year, the road show will go to Hungary, where a visit takes place in Budapest, on 1 March 2005.

In this issue: Director's diary Is ‘Competitive Europe’ compatible with ‘Social Europe’? Promoting flexible working time arrangements In brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Director’s diary Social policy – a tool for productivity and competitiveness Social cohesion has been a founding principle of the European Union since its inception. Over the past 50 years, Member States have strived to reconcile economic and social goals – with varying degrees of success. However, over the same period, the global economic environment in which Europe operates has changed dramatically: the Union’s global competitiveness depends more than ever on a highly motivated and well-educated labour force. In such an environment, the potential for policy to promote greater productivity and competitiveness has never been greater. But is a highly developed social model a luxury that only affluent nations can afford, and only when times are good? Or is it a vital element in a well-functioning, competitive market economy? Research suggests that a high degree of competitiveness is compatible with an extensive (even an expensive) social model. Most of the new EU Member States cannot currently afford to adopt the extensive social models of the Nordic countries or Germany; they can, however, make choices according to their own strengths and limitations. The challenge is to apply the principles of the European social model to their individual social, economic and institutional circumstances. We hope that the work of the Foundation and the discussions at the upcoming Foundation Forum 2006 in November can provide some guidelines and recommendations as to how this be can achieved. This month, the Foundation’s Governing Board will meet to adopt its programme of work for 2007. On 17 October, in a joint initiative with the European Parliament, the Foundation will present its qualitative and quantitative research on working time and work–life balance to high-level policymakers in Brussels.

The recent enlargement is an event of unprecedented historical importance, resulting in the integration of countries from all corners of Europe to become equal partners in building a new Europe – and this by entirely peaceful means and on the basis of self-determination. ‘An enlarged European market enhances the prospects for economic performance and thus implies more employment prospects,’ explains Bernhard Jansen, Director at the Employment and Social Affairs DG of the European Commission. ‘However, enlargement involves both additional opportunities and additional challenges for the European social policy agenda, where we must strive to match improved economic performance with an increase in the standard of living for everyone.’ Opportunities of enlargement Bernhard Jansen has been the European Commission’s representative in the Foundation’s Bureau and on the Administrative Board since 2001. A German national and a lawyer by profession, he expounds on the topic of social Europe with exactitude, experience and a clear vision, clearly spelling out the main challenges and solutions for achieving a better future for all citizens. He is convinced that enlargement offers new impetus for the Union and a better chance for a more positive economic development. Bernhard Jansen affirms, ‘We should take up this challenge and turn it to our advantage. In order to be successful, policymakers need to be forward-looking and to set themselves ambitious, but credible targets, and the Foundation is instrumental in this process.’ Prior to taking up his current position as Director of Directorate D of DG Employment and Social Affairs, with responsibility for adaptability, social dialogue and social rights, Bernhard Jansen worked in a variety of posts at European and international level, from legal advice in agriculture, competition and merger law to external trade relations. Laying foundations for policymaking Bernhard Jansen is of the opinion that EU agencies have the advantage of being less directly subject to the political priorities of the day, and this can result in a higher degree of credibility and trustworthiness. The success of the Foundation is, in his opinion, a combination of high levels of performance and anticipating what are likely to be tomorrow’s themes in policymaking. ‘The Foundation is meant to act as a think-tank and as such has an important role in preparing the ground for well-adapted policies in the socio-economic field,’ claims Bernhard Jansen. ‘The Foundation was created in 1975 for that purpose and I see no reason why this should change in the foreseeable future.’ 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-4-2004

Director’s diary Communicating and sharing ideas on socioeconomic change in Europe One of the key ways in which Eurofound shares experiences and ideas on socioeconomic change and social policy is through face-to-face discussion and debate. Over recent years, the scope of this role has amplified: research staff are participating to a greater extent in high-level conferences, seminars and workshops around Europe, while Eurofound’s own events are gaining a higher profile. The Foundation seminar series is a Eurofound initiative that aims to provide opportunities for knowledge-sharing, and so facilitate decision-making; it also aims to assist social actors in meeting the Lisbon goals at national level. The second seminar in the 2007 series on ‘Youth and work’ will take place later this month in Madrid, giving participants an opportunity to present their national policies and country situations. In addition, Eurofound is organising a high-level conference to be held this month in Lisbon to discuss the most widespread of occupational diseases: musculoskeletal disorders. The event is being organised under the auspices of the Portuguese EU Presidency. On 19 October, Eurofound’s 77th meeting of its Governing Board will take place in Dublin. Foremost among the items to be discussed and decided upon is the 2008 work programme, details of which are currently being finalised.

In this issue: Director's diary Is ‘Competitive Europe’ compatible with ‘Social Europe’? Promoting flexible working time arrangements In brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Director’s diary Social policy – a tool for productivity and competitiveness Social cohesion has been a founding principle of the European Union since its inception. Over the past 50 years, Member States have strived to reconcile economic and social goals – with varying degrees of success. However, over the same period, the global economic environment in which Europe operates has changed dramatically: the Union’s global competitiveness depends more than ever on a highly motivated and well-educated labour force. In such an environment, the potential for policy to promote greater productivity and competitiveness has never been greater. But is a highly developed social model a luxury that only affluent nations can afford, and only when times are good? Or is it a vital element in a well-functioning, competitive market economy? Research suggests that a high degree of competitiveness is compatible with an extensive (even an expensive) social model. Most of the new EU Member States cannot currently afford to adopt the extensive social models of the Nordic countries or Germany; they can, however, make choices according to their own strengths and limitations. The challenge is to apply the principles of the European social model to their individual social, economic and institutional circumstances. We hope that the work of the Foundation and the discussions at the upcoming Foundation Forum 2006 in November can provide some guidelines and recommendations as to how this be can achieved. This month, the Foundation’s Governing Board will meet to adopt its programme of work for 2007. On 17 October, in a joint initiative with the European Parliament, the Foundation will present its qualitative and quantitative research on working time and work–life balance to high-level policymakers in Brussels.

Time and flexibility Investing in work-life balance – a win-win situation? Work and care - payback for the elderly or investment in a new generation? Keynote round-up An economy or a society: where do we live and work? Articles Focusing firmly on the year ahead Foundation forges closer ties with the EP Disability and social exclusion: Reversing the trend Europe ‘not losing jobs’ due to outsourcing of ICT services Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Employees, employers and society as a whole can benefit from greater flexibility in working hours, this workshop concluded. Higher productivity and increased job satisfaction, for example, are two of the advantages of increased flexibility, the workshop participants agreed. According to evidence presented at the meeting, companies save up to €16 for every euro they invest in flexitime, parental leave schemes and other employee assistance programmes. Further research, outlined at the workshop, revealed that such initiatives not only increased productivity and staff retention rates, but also led to lower levels of absenteeism and work-related illnesses. In the UK alone, for example, stress-related sick leave is estimated to cost businesses over £ 7 million a week. It was also outlined how several major corporations have already generated significant savings by giving staff greater freedom to decide when they work. In the UK, for example, British Telecom reports that its ‘flexi-work’ philosophy has encouraged 98% of women to return to work after maternity leave, thus reducing its recruitment and induction costs by £3 million a year. In addition to the benefits to employers, greater flexibility in working hours can also benefit employees, the workshop concluded. Studies indicate that it leads to higher job satisfaction, greater opportunities for staff to develop their professional skills and careers, and less stress and ‘burn-out’. ‘The high-performing organisations of the future will be those that are flexible enough to meet the demands of a competitive global market while accommodating the needs of a changing workforce,’ commented one of the workshop participants. However, it was pointed out that the need for a more enlightened approach was still largely unmet. According to a recent study by the Irish Forum on the Workplace of the Future, nearly one-in-five staff return home too exhausted to do anything else. ‘You have to wonder how effective these individuals are at work the next day,’ observed one workshop participant. One of the difficulties, the workshop noted, is that SMEs, which constitute the bulk of businesses in Europe, are usually reluctant to introduce ‘work-life-balance’ schemes as these types of initiatives are perceived to be too costly and complicated to implement in small businesses. However, as one participant commented: ‘There are lots of ways to increase flexibility; you don’t always need sophisticated solutions. Simply allowing a parent to arrive 10 minutes late for work, for example, could encourage that member of staff to stay with the business. Think “smart and simple”.’ Workshop 3 key issues 18% of employees return home from work too exhausted to do anything else. Stress-related illnesses cost UK businesses over £7 million a year in lost productivity and other expenses. Staff who can no longer cope and leave companies cost businesses millions of pounds a year. Typically it costs 50-100% of an employee’s annual salary to replace them. Research has shown that companies that implement ‘work-life-balance’ schemes save €16 for every euro invested. In the UK, Xerox claims to have saved £1million over the last five years by introducing flexible working time and parental leave initiatives. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-6-2004-6

Dublin, on Friday 5 May 2006. NEWS IN BRIEF Spotlight on working conditions in 2005 The new annual review from the Foundation’s European Working Conditions Observatory (EWCO) highlights the start of negotiations between the European social partners on the issue of workplace violence and harassment as one of the milestones of 2005. The review, which gives an overview of the main developments in the areas of working conditions, quality of work and employment at EU level, also found that gender equality, in the context of the Lisbon targets of higher employment levels for men and women, received considerable attention in many EU policy documents. Other issues that received attention during 2005 were training, life-long learning and skills development. Sharing knowledge and experience on social policies Flexicurity and employability will be the topics of discussion during the Foundation seminar series 2006, which kicks off on 22 May in Dublin. This follows on from the two previous series, ‘Towards a sustainable and flexible work organisation’ in 2004 and ‘Age and work – connecting the generations’ in 2005. The Foundation’s seminar series is aimed at providing opportunities for knowledge-sharing that can facilitate a better decision-making process in European social policy. They also provide representatives – from the social partners and public authorities in the EU Member States – with an opportunity to discuss European social issues and deepen their understanding of the implications at national level. The second Foundation seminar series event will take place in Vienna, Austria, in October 2006. Employee financial participation yields benefits Foundation findings indicate that financial participation can deliver real benefits for employees, enterprises and national economies. However, despite this potential, the Foundation argues, it remains under-used in most Member States, and is very unevenly distributed across the EU. During the years 1999–2004, the Foundation carried out research into the nature and extent of financial participation in the EU. The research examined national-level policies and the attitudes of key actors in relation to the development and implementation of financial participation schemes. It found that governments and central social partner organisations play a pivotal role in implementing financial participation practices at national level, albeit to varying degrees. The research also pointed to the need to develop forms of financial participation that would make it more attractive to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Read more on this topic Expanding business activities in the manufacturing, retail and transport sectors A total of 120,468 new jobs were announced in Europe’s financial media as a result of 203 company restructuring cases, the Foundation’s European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) Quarterly, for the first three months of 2006, will report. Almost three quarters (91,817) of these announced new jobs are the result of expanding business activities in the new EU Member States, with Poland and Romania attracting 42,695 and 28,325 new jobs respectively. For the same period, some 133,638 job cuts were announced, representing an increase in job losses of 23% over the previous quarter. The majority of job losses were as a result of internal restructuring, bankruptcies and closures, with manufacturing, transport and telecommunications being most affected.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1266	2007-12-16	UNK	Press release, 1 March 2001	 Full-time or part-time work? Working women in the European Union represent a crucial bridge between the labour market and the family system, according to the findings of the Employment Options of the Future survey. Analysis of the survey data, focusing on people in dependent employment, looking at both their present situation and their preferences for the future, provide valuable insights into the working time issues for the future employment scenario in Europe. Gender is the single factor that most influences people's working time patterns though age, education and personal economic situation are significant variables in relation to different working time issues. The part-time/full-time aspects of the survey indicate the continuing importance that part-time work holds today, especially for women employees. In most European countries, approximately three-quarters of part-timers are women. A quarter of those currently working full-time state that they would prefer a part-time job, either on a permanent basis (11%) or for a given period (12%) but only 14% have ever tried to change to part-time employment. The survey data suggests that part-time work performs different functions respectively for women and men. For women it seems to act as a major instrument in combining paid work with family duties, particularly in the case of women and children. Male part-time workers on the other hand are more interested in using part-time work as a means to combine study and work better as well as allowing them more time for themselves and their leisure activities. Nearly half of those interviewed were of the opinion that part-time work would damage their career prospects. There were, however, significant differences in the breakdown of these figures on a national basis. Furthermore, less than one-third of those in full-time employment feel that their employer would view their request to reduce working hours favourably. The summary report of the survey findings, Full-time or Part-time work: realities and options, concludes that part-time employment should not be viewed simply as a 'neutral' alternative to full-time employment as it covers a range of employment situations and does not preclude the quality/stability of the employment relationship. The Employment Options of the Future survey is a large scale representative survey conducted in 1998 in 15 member states of the EU and in Norway. The survey was designed to find out who wants to work and who doesn't. If people want to work the survey deals with their preferences as far as contractual aspects (dependent employment vs. self-employment), time aspects (actual and preferred weekly working hours, overtime, sabbaticals), space (work at home) and motivational aspects (reasons for taking up paid work) are concerned. The survey does not only ask for present work options but has a special interest in the future: What do people think will change over the next five years in their personal situation (marital status, children, care of elderly or ill persons), in the general economic situation, in their own economic situation and in the situation on the labour market. And - taking into account the probable changes over the next five years - what will be the work options of the people in five years time?	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/press-release-1-march-2001

In this issue: Director's diary Employment initiatives for an ageing workforce Investigating labour market mobility In brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Investigating labour market mobility Future labour migration from the new Member States to the former EU15 countries will be limited, but it will vary significantly, new Foundation research findings suggest. However, the report warns, in the medium- to long-term, the greatest challenges will be posed by ‘youth drain’ and ‘brain drain’ to those countries experiencing net migration. Well-educated men and women of 25–43 years of age, from Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, are four times more likely to migrate to another EU Member State than their equivalents from the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia, according to a new Foundation report that assesses EU policies concerning labour mobility across Europe. Citizens from the former EU15 countries with the highest mobility (Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Ireland) are twice as likely to migrate for work reasons as the citizens in the low-mobility countries of the new Member States. Finding the right balance Geographical labour mobility remains a policy challenge for Europe: too little mobility may result in reduced adaptability and competitiveness; however, too much mobility between poorer regions in Eastern Europe and richer parts of central and northern Europe could have distorting effects on national labour markets for both parties. The European Commission has designated 2006 as ‘European Year of Workers’ Mobility’ to promote greater mobility by raising awareness of the rights of workers interested in changing job or moving abroad and by highlighting the opportunities that it offers, such as better career and income prospects. For the European economy, greater mobility can be a way of relieving skills shortages and unemployment. Reasons for migrating The findings indicate that there are different reasons why people would want to migrate. In the new Member States, work-related factors – higher household income (59%) and better working conditions (57%) – feature high in the list of priorities; however, the opportunity for discovering new things is also an important factor (30%). In the former EU15 countries, however, ‘fun’ factors play an important role in encouraging people to migrate, such as discovering new environments (64%) and meeting new people (39%); moreover, a quarter of respondents from the former EU15 countries indicated that ‘better weather’ was a serious reason to migrate. Research findings indicate, however, that fear of losing one’s social network is a compelling reason not to migrate. Almost 60% of respondent in the former EU15, and 37% in the new Member States, would not migrate for this reason. Least important in this regard are housing conditions and health care facilities.

Pay trends differ across Europe Average European wages increased significantly between 2005 and 2006, Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) reveals in its annual update of pay trends, Pay developments – 2006. However, considerable differences remain between the former EU15 and the 12 new Member States, both in terms of trends and the level of pay increases. The average collectively agreed nominal increases across the EU rose from 4.9% in 2005 to 5.6% in 2006. When adjusted for inflation, the real wage increase across the EU27 rose from 1.9% in 2005 to 2.7% in 2006. In the EU15, the average nominal increase had risen from 2.8% in 2005 to 2.9% in 2006, while the rate of real increase rose from 0.6% in 2005 to 0.8% in 2006. However, the average increase in the 12 new Member States was higher, rising from 7.5% in 2005 to 9.1% in 2006, with the rate of real increase climbing from 3.5% to 5.2%. New Member States top wage increases ‘The overall figures for the EU27 indicate a continued moderation in pay increases. However, the findings for the twelve new Member States tell a different story,’ said Jorma Karppinen, Eurofound’s Director, commenting on the report’s findings. ‘These findings are good news for workers in the twelve new Member States: it seems that the pay gap between them and their fellow citizens in the EU15 is closing rapidly.’ According to the findings, the overall picture in the EU27 is of a continuing moderation in real and nominal pay increases in the former EU15, but of an upward trend in the twelve new Member States. In these new Member States, the average real pay increase was 6.5 times higher than in the former EU15. Clear trends hard to spot In the new Member States, real pay increases in 2006 varied from -1.4% in Hungary to 16% in Latvia. For the former EU15, the range of real pay increases in 2006 was between -0.1% in Germany and 2.6% in Greece. Over a five-year span from 2000–2006, however, only a few countries display a clear trend in real pay increases. Most fluctuate from year to year, although in many of the new Member States pay increases dipped until 2004, and then began to rise (after these countries joined the EU). There was also a fairly consistent downward trend in Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary and Slovenia. Providing a snapshot of wage developments in Europe This annual update from EIRO aims to provide a broad, general indication of trends in pay increases across the EU Member States and Norway. It also looks at collectively agreed pay increases in metalworking, banking and local government, increases in minimum wages, increases in average earnings and the gender pay gap.

A number of interesting questions were raised on the second day of the Foundation Forum, in a discussion chaired by journalist and broadcaster John Bowman. Director of the ILO London office, Lord Brett, acknowledged the difficulties of balancing career and family life, citing his own personal experience; however he also asked the question whether politicians and others participating in the work-life debate were being realistic enough about the issue. ‘This is a privileged discussion in a privileged part of the world by privileged people,’ he said. Also taking part in the discussion was Director of an American law firm, Jeannine Rupp, who questioned the policy-oriented nature of many of the discussions, adding that ‘although policies provide a wonderful framework, they won’t be implemented, unless society supports the notion that there should be a sensible work-life balance, at both a societal and organisational level.’ Supporting her point, Lord Brett said that one of the most practical things that governments can do to improve life-balance is to provide affordable childcare. He also exhorted the audience to escape the mindset that says people have one employer or type of job for most of their lives.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-6-2004-1

Report calls for active labour market policies Despite its high profile, offshoring of employment is currently responsible for only 8% of job losses in the EU. However, developments in international trade in services could in the future impact considerably on employment in the EU, given that service-sector jobs account for 70% of employment in the Union. This is one of the findings outlined in the forthcoming 2007 annual report from the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM), Restructuring and employment in the EU: The impact of globalisation. The report goes on to argue, however, that imposing protectionist measures to address the challenge of globalisation would hamper free trade and limit the benefits it can deliver to society as a whole, while wage subsidies could simply result in other workers becoming displaced. Instead, the report recommends the application of active labour market policies, especially greater support for displaced workers in the form of assistance with jobseeking. Potential for significant job losses While globalisation in itself is not a new phenomenon (international trade having existed for centuries), developments in information and communications technology have led to services being coded and transmitted digitally, which in turn increases the potential for greater international trade in services: in particular, functions and tasks within firms. If this potential were realised, it could have huge implications for the European service sector which has, to date, been largely exempted from international trade, and as stated above, accounts for 70% of employment in the EU. Limitations of wage subsidies Widespread concerns over globalisation have resulted in the creation of the new European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), which is designed to compensate workers who have been made redundant through trade liberalisation. The report looks at the experience of the comparable US initiative, the Trade Adjustment Act (TAA), and concludes from this that that it is difficult to direct assistance solely at workers who have been displaced as a result of trade. Such assistance could also be seen as unfair where workers displaced for reasons other than trade do not receive similar assistance. The report recommends not using the EGF to provide temporary wage subsidies: these tend to have no effect, with subsidised applicants being recruited who would have been recruited anyway, or else they result in the displaced worker getting a new job at the expense of another worker. Instead, the report promotes the concept of an intra-EU mobility grant, which would help displaced workers who are looking to improve their situation by covering some of the high costs of moving between Member States. Good examples of dealing with globalisation The report looks at examples of Member States that have taken alternative approaches to addressing the challenges of globalisation. In Denmark, for example, the emphasis on vocational education and training for adults makes a substantial contribution to the re-skilling of the workforce, with many commentators stating that the tripartite involvement of government and social partners in the scheme’s design and implementation is a key part of its success. Meanwhile, in Sweden, the Swedish Union of Technical and Clerical Employees in Industry (SIF) is deeply involved in engaging with management in attempting to pre-empt restructuring measures and to deal constructively with the consequences, should it occur. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-novemberdecember-2007

Source: EIRO and Eurostat NEWS IN BRIEF Social dimensions of housing In its analysis of the European Quality of Life Survey, the Foundation argues that harmonising housing conditions across the EU is a necessary precondition for meeting the European targets of improving quality of life, combating social exclusion and discrimination and strengthening social cohesion. While housing issues do not lie specifically within the EU’s scope of core responsibilities, the report found evidence in all countries surveyed (the EU25, along with Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey) that a good standard of housing is, along with an adequate level of income, an essential component of quality of life and a valid indicator of a household’s material conditions. Download the report Foundation involvement at the 14th IIRA World Congress The Foundation is hosting two seminars during the 14th World Congress of the International Industrial Relations Association in Lima, Peru, on 11–14 September. The first seminar aims to benchmark European industrial relations models against those in other countries – the discussion will form the basis of a framework for drawing up country profiles for Australia, Brazil, China, India, Japan, South Africa and the United States. In the second seminar, the Foundation will address the impact of globalisation on industrial relations systems, in particular from the perspectives of management and union representatives. The future of employment in social care in Europe With the ageing of the population in Europe, there is increasing pressure on health and social care systems across the European Union. There is clearly a need for more and better quality employment in care services to meet this increasing demand. The Foundation will discuss this topic during a major conference entitled ‘The future of employment in social care in Europe’, under the auspices of the current Finnish Presidency of the European Union. The conference will draw on experiences and lessons learned from initiatives from across the EU25, Bulgaria and Romania, in order to identify key pointers for the creation of good quality jobs in social care over the next five to 10 years. It will address such issues as improving the working conditions of care workers and their qualifications, as well as changing the gender and age balance of the sector. The conference will take place in Helsinki on 2–3 October 2006 and is organised by the Foundation in cooperation with the National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health (STAKES) and the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health (FIOH). Foundation Focus looks at age and employment If Europe is to maintain its current standard of living ‘it is crucial that people work longer… governments, social partners and individuals must share the responsibility for making it happen’, argues Commissioner Vladimir Špidla in an interview in the latest issue of Foundation Focus, which investigates the subject of Europe’s ageing workforce. Based on recent results of Foundation research, this issue examines the topic from different angles, underscored by the European policy perspective. Findings from the Fourth European Working Conditions Survey on working conditions illustrate the importance of adapting working conditions to suit an ageing workforce. Case studies on successful age management show how companies can introduce age-adapted schemes and training for older workers. Other articles examine the incidence of both phased and early retirement schemes across Europe, the need for better care services for the older population and the quality of life experienced by older people.

Director’s diary Quality of life survey in Turkey As EU enlargement continues, Eurofound has been gradually extending its monitoring tools and analysis of quality of life to acceding and candidate countries. Recently, Eurofound presented the findings of its study into quality of life in the candidate country Turkey, drawing on the European Quality of Life Survey, and national data from Turkey. As well as highlighting key quality of life dimensions in Turkey, the research compared objective and subjective living conditions in this country with those in both the older and new EU Member States. The report looks at the main factors determining social inclusion or exclusion in Turkey, such as education and training, economic status, income, social and health services. This month marks the 10th anniversary of the creation of Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). Over the past decade, EIRO has provided up-to-date information and analysis of industrial relations developments in the European Union to a growing audience of European, international and national level policymakers, specialists, commentators and the general public. Also in June, Eurofound, in association with the European Commission, will present its annual report on Industrial relations developments in Europe 2006. The Foundation will also make presentations on the quality of jobs, and on mobility and migration at Employment Week in Brussels, as well as hosting an exhibition stand and presenting findings and analysis from the fourth European Working Conditions Survey during a roadshow visit to Belgium. The first tripartite conference of the Foundation Seminar Series 2007 will take place in Dublin on 6–8 June, focusing this year on ‘Youth and work’.

In this issue: Director's diary ‘Your work, your life: matching company needs with worker solutions’ High level of business creation activities in the new Member States In brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing High level of business creation activities in the new Member States More than half of all new job announcements in the European Union during the previous quarter were related to expanding business activities in the new EU Member States, according to the latest European Restructuring Monitor. Some 360 company restructuring cases were recorded by the Foundation’s European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) during the previous quarter, from 1 October to 31 December. Across the 27 countries monitored by the ERM, 215 cases involved announcements of a total of 101,106 job losses, and 145 cases reported the creation of 80,485 new jobs. ‘The recorded number of job losses and job creations in the previous quarter are in line with the previous quarter and 2005 as a whole,’ said Jorma Karppinen, the Foundation’s Director. ‘The new data also confirms the trend that the majority of job losses are found in the old EU15 countries while job creations largely occur in the new EU Member States.’ Majority of new jobs in the new Member States According to the ERM, it is Poland, Romania and Slovakia that stand to gain the most planned new jobs, attracting 18,002, 13,195 and 12,929 jobs respectively. Most job creations are planned in the sectors of manufacturing, transport and telecommunications, and wholesale and retail. Hungary and Slovakia are also highlighted in the report with their 2,400 and 1,700 new job creations respectively during the last three months of 2005. Among the EU15 countries, the quarterly report shows that the trend of business expansion in Germany and the United Kingdom, as witnessed during previous quarters, appears to be broken. During the previous three months, only six restructuring cases resulted in 6,235 announced new jobs in Germany, and four cases recording 1,671 new job announcements in the United Kingdom. Significant job losses in four Member States The labour markets in Germany, the United Kingdom, Finland and Slovenia were affected with huge job cut announcements. The new data from ERM shows that Germany leads the way with 35,300 job loss announcements, an increase from 25,405 during the previous quarter, followed by the 20,420 publicised job losses in the United Kingdom, down from 26,577 in the preceding three-month period. When comparing the number of job losses to the size of the respective economies, the Slovenian and Romanian labour markets stand out with 26.04 and 17.48 job losses per 10,000 people employed. The ERM Quarterly also reports that the car manufacturing sector in Slovenia has experienced a set-back, when 450 jobs in the production of car seat covers will move to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Morocco and Moldova for cost reasons. Spotlight on Sweden’s booming economy This issue of the ERM Quarterly also offers a country focus on Sweden, highlighting the country’s continued economic growth, its favourable rank on the Global Competitiveness Index, and sluggish labour market performance. The report also analyses challenges facing Europe’s chemical sector, and it looks at the performances of Electricité de France (EDF) and Hankook Tyres.

Also present were MEPs Stephen Hughes (Socialist group/UK) and Richard Falbr (Socialist group/ Czech Republic). NEWS IN BRIEF Working conditions in Estonia and Finland Summaries of national working conditions survey findings have been published by the European Working Conditions Observatory since 2003: to date over twenty have been published. Results from these surveys provide an interesting complement to the results of the Foundation’s own working conditions survey and are an important source of comparative data. The most recent reports deal with survey data from Finland and Estonia and cover trends over the period 1998–2005. They look at aspects such as working time, pay, employment contracts, intensification of work, violence and harassment and work–life balance. Workers in Estonia report an increase in work intensity while in Finland, where levels of work demands in general appear to be stabilising, increased mental demands at work are reported by twice as many workers as increased physical demands. However, employees in the local government sector in Finland report deteriorating working conditions.Read more on this topic Accessing Foundation research The Foundation is making available the datasets of its recent research via the Economic and Social Data Service (ESDS) International, a UK-based data centre. The aim is to ensure that the Foundation’s European survey datasets are professionally preserved, and to promote third-party use of the surveys. It is the Foundation’s policy to make its datasets and accompanying documentation available for third-party use, after publishing its own work. (Survey data is available two years after the Foundation begins its analysis phase). Currently, the datasets of the first European Quality of Life Survey and the third European Working Conditions Survey are available free of charge to all registered users for non-commercial purposes. Access the ESDS Archive Flexible, part-time working in the UK More than half (56%) of all private companies and public organisations in the UK with more than 10 employees have flexible working time arrangements in place, the Foundation’s new report Working time and work–life balance in European companies has found. The findings, based on the Foundation’s Company Survey 2005, also indicate that the UK labour market is part-time friendly: UK companies and public organisations rank first in Europe when it comes to easily switching from full-time to part-time work. A Foundation seminar in London on 5 April will discuss these findings, and others from the report, with representatives from the UK government, the social partners and civil society. The report will be published in May. See also: More on the survey results Press release: High levels of flexi-time arrangements in the UK compared to Europe Working time over the life course In recent years, the Foundation has examined the issue of time and income distribution in the context of a life course policy perspective. This approach takes a holistic view of the entire life path, rather than viewing specific events or phases separately. A new report looks into the current state and development of time options, time arrangements and income over the life course, relating current working time options and arrangements over the life course to the prevailing societal and institutional framework. In doing so, the report aims to highlight the need for implementing time policies that take a life course perspective and that eliminate the potential for gender, social or age discrimination.Read the complete report	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-april-2006-2

Flexible working can boost performance Flexible working time arrangements are more likely to be found in organisations operating in Nordic countries, in large organisations and in the areas of commercial services, public administration, health services and transport. While establishments with such arrangements perform somewhat better and show higher rates of employment growth, the type of flexibility implemented in the establishment appears to be as important as the extent of flexibility offered. These are some of the findings of a recently published Eurofound report, Working time flexibility in European companies. The report is one of a series using data from Eurofound’s Establishment Survey on Working Time 2004–2005, which aimed to analyse working time arrangements in the European workplace by interviewing personnel managers and (where available) employee representatives. This report focuses on the combinations of different working time practices at establishment level and looks at the effects of different arrangements on company performance. Types of flexibility The report stresses that various forms of, and reasons for, flexibility exist: an establishment may put in place working time flexibility to benefit the company’s production needs or to improve the work–life balance of employees, or for a combination of both reasons. The report distinguishes six types of establishment, according to their combinations of different flexible arrangements. The report stresses the importance of this more nuanced analysis of flexibility, rather than using a simplistic ‘high–low’ continuum or axis. A company or country might have high levels of flexibility, but might have forms of flexibility in place that meet only companies’ needs. Differences between Member States While 36% of all companies surveyed in Europe can be categorised as high-flexibility organisations, the proportion is much higher in Finland and Sweden, where 59% and 57% are of the high-flexibility type. By contrast, in Belgium, the Czech Republic, France and the UK many companies have high levels of flexibility oriented towards benefiting the company. Meanwhile, the southern Mediterranean countries along with Belgium, Hungary, Luxembourg and Slovenia have high proportions of companies with little in the way of flexible arrangements. Sectoral differences When sectoral differences were examined, it was found that public administration, financial intermediation, real estate, renting and business activities, electricity, gas and water supply were among the sectors with high levels of worker-oriented flexibility. By contrast, the construction sector has an above-average number of low-flexibility companies, while the health and social work sectors have high levels of company-oriented flexibility. The report also finds that other company characteristics are associated with type and extent of flexibility. For instance, establishments that can reliably predict variations in workload and that have a greater proportion of high-skilled employees are more likely to have high levels of worker-oriented flexibility. By contrast, establishments that have little variation of workload, and have fewer young employees, are more likely to be of the low flexibility type.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1287	2007-12-16	UNK	Press release 29 November 2001	" PRESS RELEASE Health ""an absolute priority"" in Ireland and the European Union Health remains the social policy issue at the heart of citizens' concerns not just in Ireland but in the European Union as a whole. When asked about the main factors affecting their quality of life, the majority of European citizens rank health as their number one priority ahead of income and family life. This was just one of the findings of the European Commission's second annual report on The Social Situation in the European Union which was launched at the Commission offices in Dublin this morning. Details of the European Foundation's new initiative on Monitoring Living Conditions and the Quality of Life in the EU were also announced. Constantinos Fotakis (European Commission, DG-Employment / Social Affairs) gave a presentation of the results of the Commission's broad-ranging overview of social trends in the Union. Key messages, Ireland Low level of satisfaction with health service % of persons satisfied with country's health care system is below the EU average. Only the Greeks, Portuguese, Italians and Spanish are less satisfied. Net migration rate nearly three times the EU average In 1995-1999, Irish rate was 4.8 per 1000 population per annum compared to EU-15 average, 1.7. Large income disparities persist The richest 20% of the population have an income 5.6 times higher than that of the poorest 20%. High level of satisfaction with life in general 88% declare themselves to be fairly or very satisfied with life in general. Comparatively young population but ageing There was a rapid decline in fertility rates in 1980s and early 1990s. While Ireland still has the youngest population and the highest fertility rates in Europe, the number of very old individuals (80+) will increase by a quarter in the next 15 years. Key messages, European Union Disability-free life expectancy continues to rise. Women can now expect to live for 74 years and men 69 years without any severe disability. Fertility rates... ... are no longer falling to the extent they were a few years ago but rates remain very low and the main group of Europe's working age population (25-54) is predicted to decrease by 3% over next 15 years. Net migration rather than natural population growth... ...is the main component of population growth in the EU and accounted for 70% of population growth in the last 5 years. Income disparities 80% of Europeans agree that income differences are too high and that ""large differences in income are not good for society"". Educational attainment 74% of 25-29 year olds now have a post-compulsory education. The report on the Social Situation in the European Union for 2001 provides quantitative and qualitative analysis about the every day issues affecting the citizens of the EU and is complemented by a set of harmonised social indicators covering virtually all of the main social policy domains: economy, demography, education, employment, social protection, income and poverty, gender equality, health and safety. A statistical index provides additional data by member state."	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/press-release-29-november-2001

Youth and work Youth unemployment and the need to integrate young people in society is a pressing global issue. In Europe, the proportion of young people aged 15 to 24 years is set to decline by a quarter – from 12.6% to 9.7% – between 2005 and 2050, while the 65-years plus group will increase from 16.4% to 29.9%. Yet it is often difficult for young people to get started on the employment ladder. The rate of youth unemployment is 20% or higher in 12 of 26 European countries. Eurofound’s report on Youth and work acknowledges the increasingly complex role of policymakers in grappling with this issue, due to the ‘great variety of needs and assets’. Moreover, within each country there are regional differences, which necessitates action at a local level, involving all the social actors, particularly the social partners and public authority representatives. However, youth employment and unemployment rates are highly susceptible to cyclical economic change. By the time policies for individual industries or sectors are designed, economic circumstances have often changed. Complexity, according to the report, should not be a cause for discouragement. Both the inclusion of young people in society – especially in employment – and the continuing inclusion of the ageing workforce are of crucial importance: ‘This wider context has become an integral part of ensuring workers’ employability, company competitiveness, social cohesion and economic sustainability in Europe.’ Education and skill demand mismatch While education and training are the most important factors in addressing unemployment among young people, the social partners in most countries confirmed that the educational level, skills composition and work experience of the labour force do not correspond to the requirements of a rapidly changing labour market. In Estonia, for example, the social partners stated that the educational system has not been able to adapt sufficiently to respond to the rapid changes in labour demand. Ineffective programmes The report found that the effects of youth employment programmes varied considerably, depending on the objective pursued or the context and method used to evaluate them. For instance, the UK TUC said one such programme had failed to generate any long-term employment or to achieve equal results for people from different ethnic groups. The Youth and Work report claims that ‘sometimes policies achieve the opposite outcome to the pursued objective’. In some cases, involvement in such programmes led to young job-seekers’ withdrawing from the labour market. The report criticises the fact that ‘evaluations and studies tend to highlight the few positive effects that youth employment policies have had in enhancing the employment opportunities of participants’. But it concluded: ‘Nevertheless, these gloomy perspectives and analysis should not overshadow the fact that it is essential to act against youth unemployment, as the first labour market experience is of vital importance for young workers.’ Limited market value of school-acquired skills The report claims that the market value of the skills acquired in secondary school depreciates quickly if the skills are not put to use. Moreover, a period of unemployment can leave potential employers uncertain of the productivity potential of the job applicant. Experiences of being unemployed may ‘diminish young people’s feelings of attachment to the labour market’. If they spend their time primarily with other young, unemployed people this may eventually ‘reduce the stigma of unemployment and thus also the incentive to work’.” Download the report 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-march-2007-1

Director’s diary Further developing the European Social Model The German EU Presidency takes seriously the underlying premise of the European Social Agenda: that social, employment and economic policies do not have to compete with each other but are mutually complementary. During the first six months of 2007, the Foundation will bring its experiences, research and data to four ministerial and international events as well as several smaller ones in the framework of the Presidency. The overall aim will be to highlight the positive interaction between the three policy areas of economy, employment and social affairs. In this context, the Foundation will also show the social impact of European legislation, in improving quality of work, strengthening workers’ mobility, and raising the public profile on the economic potential of older people. Within the framework of the 2007 European Year of Equal Opportunities, the Foundation will help the European Commission present to its stakeholders and the general public the significance of diversity as a factor in competitiveness. During the year, the Foundation will also engage in the debate on equal pay for work and equal value, as well as gender stereotypes. In the coming month, the Foundation will publish the latest European Restructuring Monitor, and a study summarising the research on European Work Councils carried out over the past decade. Readers will note that this issue of the Foundation’s newsletter has been renamed as Eurofound News.

Director’s diary Further developing the European Social Model The German EU Presidency takes seriously the underlying premise of the European Social Agenda: that social, employment and economic policies do not have to compete with each other but are mutually complementary. During the first six months of 2007, the Foundation will bring its experiences, research and data to four ministerial and international events as well as several smaller ones in the framework of the Presidency. The overall aim will be to highlight the positive interaction between the three policy areas of economy, employment and social affairs. In this context, the Foundation will also show the social impact of European legislation, in improving quality of work, strengthening workers’ mobility, and raising the public profile on the economic potential of older people. Within the framework of the 2007 European Year of Equal Opportunities, the Foundation will help the European Commission present to its stakeholders and the general public the significance of diversity as a factor in competitiveness. During the year, the Foundation will also engage in the debate on equal pay for work and equal value, as well as gender stereotypes. In the coming month, the Foundation will publish the latest European Restructuring Monitor, and a study summarising the research on European Work Councils carried out over the past decade. Readers will note that this issue of the Foundation’s newsletter has been renamed as Eurofound News.

Turkey at the crossroads For countries applying for membership in the European Union, quality-of-life issues are the social complement to the political and economic criteria upon which they are evaluated. In its new report on Quality of life in Turkey, Eurofound has identified clear differences in quality-of-life indicators between Turkey and the EU Member States. The report finds that the majority of Turks are satisfied with their life. Turkish citizens tend to be most satisfied with those life domains over which they have some control, such as personal health and family life. They are least satisfied with those domains for which the state is directly responsible, such as health services, education and standard of living. The most important determinants of overall life satisfaction in Turkey are, as in EU Member States, health, trust in other people, satisfaction with public policies and income. A comprehensive picture of life in Turkey The new report is based on the findings from the European Quality of Life Survey, and is supplemented by national data, academic surveys and related social-science studies. The research compares the social circumstances of people in Turkey with those of citizens in the ‘old’ EU15 Member States, the 10 new Member States admitted in 2004, and with Turkey’s neighbours Bulgaria and Romania. Turkey’s still-rising population will surpass Germany’s (currently the highest in the EU) in just over a decade, and is projected to exceed 90 million by 2023 and 100 million by 2050. Its income per head is lower than any EU Member State and although its annual growth rate of GDP is much greater than the EU15 average, its GDP per capita is far below the average for the EU as a whole. Increasing the supply of jobs The biggest demographic challenge facing Turkish policymakers is to increase the supply of jobs. Almost 50% of Turks report that they have had trouble during the previous year in paying for at least one household necessity. More worryingly, the report points out, is that gender differences in employment are great: more than five times as many men as women are in paid employment. The majority of women are unpaid homemakers and are much less likely to be entitled to any social security benefits. Turkey’s potential claim to EU cohesion funds Combining Turkey’s low average national income and its large population could make its potential claim on EU social cohesion funds far greater than other countries. In the present EU of 27 Member States, the new entrants with strong claims on EU funds already constitute more than one fifth of the Union’s total population. The addition of Turkey could raise the proportion of the population claiming EU funds to 50%. The report concludes that the opening up of discussions about EU accession creates opportunities, incentives and requirements for Turkey to converge with EU standards. The EU is not negotiating on the substance or conditions of accession but rather is asking Turkey, as a candidate country, to adjust to the EU’s laws and policies. This requires ongoing discussions, since many requirements are not fixed and precise, and because the form, methods and pace of adjustment are negotiable.

In this issue: Director's diary Flexible working time options: a win-win situation for all Catering for better working conditions Research and news in brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Catering for better working conditions Working conditions in the hotels, restaurants and catering sector in the EU are characterised by low wages, long hours, poor career structures and often weak enforcement of equality policies. High staff turnover, high levels of absenteeism and poor commitment discourages employers from investing in staff, according to new research published by the European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) in its Sector Futures series. The 7.5 million workers in Europe’s hotels and catering sector have seen their fair share of changes and challenges in the past, and the first of three EMCC Sector Futures articles on the sector does not envisage a much brighter future. Some of the changes result from the inevitable effects of globalisation, enlargement and low-cost travel, encouraging the flow of migrant workers, and others are the consequence of changing lifestyles, more informed and flexible customers, the ageing workforce, and stricter legislation and human rights awareness. The growth and development of Europe’s hotel and catering sector depends largely on the uptake of new technology: greater overall use of information technology and new kitchen and production technologies. Micro-enterprises predominate Europe’s hotel and catering sector is dominated by small enterprises. Despite the success of chains and franchises, more than 90% of firms are micro-enterprises, with 10 or fewer employees. These generated over 40% of the sector’s turnover and employed almost half its workforce in 2001.The labour force is much younger and less skilled than that of other sectors, with a higher percentage of women workers: in 2004, women accounted for 55% of jobs. However, most senior positions are held by men. The sector embraces hotels, restaurants, camping sites, youth hostels, fast-food outlets, take-aways, pubs, canteens, and catering. Over half of the sector’s enterprises in 2001 were in France, Italy and Spain, and the sector is generally considered to be underdeveloped in the new Member States. Huge challenges ahead The sector has been under pressure by recent legislation on consumer and human rights, working conditions and the marking, quality and safety of food. Small businesses find it hardest to conform to the new legislation. With the growth in health problems like diabetes and obesity, it is thought that health-related taxes on food may be introduced. However, it is generally acknowledged that the smoking ban introduced in some countries has improved overall conditions for workers and customers. On a broad scale, the sector is challenged by globalisation which can involve an influx of better-skilled labour from other countries, hence operating as a threat to existing workers. Also, while low-cost air travel brings more tourists and migrant workers, it also leads to stiffer competition. Positive signs of development There are, however, some positive signs of development in the sector. EU enlargement offers a larger labour pool with lowering employment costs. Closer to the day-to-day operation of the sector, information technology is heralded as a tool for better resource management and flexibility. While the Internet has already had a profound effect on the sector, the downside is that security fears are hindering online bookings. New kitchen and production technologies are a positive development but these can lead to outsourcing, with negative effects for workers.

Much industrial restructuring activity across Europe Research and news in brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Director’s diary Workers in the 10 new EU Member States work on average 112 hours - or almost three working weeks - more per year than workers in the EU15. This is according to the Foundation’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) in its annual update on working time developments. While collective bargaining still plays a key role in determining the duration of working time in most of the countries in Europe, less than half of all workers in the new Member States are covered by these agreements. While around three-quarters of the EU15 workforce are still covered, the trend across all EU Member States is that of increased decentralisation of collective bargaining. This is a challenge to social dialogue, if current employee protection and participation levels are to be maintained. June will see the launch of the newly redesigned Foundation website Eurofound. Providing easy access to Foundation research for an average of 160,000 users every month, the new site will also offer one unique gateway to the individual websites of EIRO and the European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC).

To understand the European system of industrial relations, it is necessary to have a sense of how it grew, how it is shaped, and what its current and evolving structure looks like. The Foundation will launch its European industrial relations dictionary, an online glossary of industrial relations terms, in Brussels on 30 November. The dictionary is the Foundation’s response to increasing demand for an up-to-date, easily accessible and useful resource on European industrial relations. The Foundation will also be launching Foundation Focus, the new twice-yearly magazine focusing on a topic of critical social and economic importance in the European Union, during the month. The first issue is devoted to the theme of industrial restructuring, which has in recent years become a characteristic feature of the European industrial landscape. At the end of the month, the Foundation will bring together experts to gather and exchange information on the state of affairs of industrial relations in the EU, Japan and USA. The seminar findings will contribute to the annual publication on the progress of industrial relations in these three economic blocs early next year.

IN BRIEF News in pictures Jorma Karppinen, Director of Eurofound, with Leonard Orban, European Commissioner for Multilingualism, at Eurofound’s recent roadshow visit to Ljubljana, Slovenia.   News in brief New Foundation Findings discusses mobility This month, Eurofound launches the first issue in a new publication series – Foundation Findings. Taking an in-depth look at a particular area of Eurofound’s research, these will consider the policy implications of research findings for European decision-makers. The first issue, Mobility in Europe: The way forward, reviews Eurofound’s analysis of the 2005 Eurobarometer survey of geographical and job mobility and draws a number of conclusions. The publication stresses that policies on mobility must be developed with a balanced approach: while geographical mobility brings clear benefits, excessive emigration from one country of young, well educated workers could result in that country experiencing a ‘brain drain’. Similarly, while moving from job to job translates into upward mobility for many workers, it can result in a downward spiral of precarious employment for those who are less skilled. Download the report Finnish president to visit Eurofound Dealing with the social consequences of globalisation has become one of the key concerns of the European social partners. On 13 November, Eurofound will host a high-level seminar on The challenges of globalisation for labour market policies and social dialogue: The wider perspective. Addressing the seminar will be Tarja Halonen, President of Finland and Michéal Martin TD, Irish Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Social partner representatives from both Finland and Ireland will also participate. Ms Halonen will provide a global perspective on the challenges of globalisation for labour market policies and social dialogue. Participants will also discuss the approaches that have been taken in Finland and Ireland to strengthen the positive aspects of globalisation, and minimise any negative social effects. High levels of collective bargaining in EU agricultural sector Although union density is low among workers in the agricultural sector, collective bargaining coverage is still extensive, according to a new report from Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) on Representativeness of the social partners: Agricultural sector. The report reveals that this extensive coverage is due to the predominance of multi-employer bargaining in the sector, strong employer organisations, and the frequent extension of the scope of collective agreements to other employers. In 14 out of the 21 Member States studied, more than half of all employees in the sector are covered by a collective agreement. However, multi-employer agreements are not found in Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, Poland and the UK. In countries that lack multi-employer bargaining, collective bargaining coverage is very low: single-employer bargaining is not feasible, given the sector’s low degree of economic concentration and unionisation. Download the report Musculoskeletal disorders: No. 1 workplace disease Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are the most widespread occupational disease, according to a new report, Managing musculoskeletal disorders, from Eurofound’s European Working Conditions Observatory (EWCO). Such disorders include backache, shoulder and neck pain, and pain in the limbs. The report, based on analysis of the fourth European Working Conditions Survey, indicates that while MSDs related to strenuous working conditions are declining, those related to stress and work overload are increasing. Interestingly, job rotation and team-working are both associated with a higher incidence of MSDs. In contrast, greater learning opportunities, and being consulted about changes to organisational and working conditions, are associated with a lower incidence of MSDs. The findings of the report will be presented at a conference being organised by Eurofound in Lisbon, Portugal, on 11–12 October.

Policymakers across the 25 countries of the new European Union are increasingly faced with the challenge of creating more and better jobs, while dealing with the pressing issues of flexibility and work, pension reform, time management and labour market restructuring. The Foundation’s recent European Quality of Life survey reveals that an average of one in four EU citizens complains they are too tired to carry out household jobs when they come home from work. More worryingly, around one in six persons in the new Member States declares they have difficulties in fulfilling family responsibilities because they are required to spend too much time at work. Tomorrow’s work-life balance The second biennial Foundation Forum, entitled Living to work – working to live, focuses on how we will live and work in the coming decade. The 2004 Forum takes place in Dublin on 3-4 November next. High-level European representatives from the social partners, governments and civil society, as well as experts in the field, will provide an overview of the challenges and probe the most radical ideas on the key issues that lie ahead for the new Europe in dealing with the topic of work–life reconciliation. Speakers during the two days include Bertie Ahern, Ireland’s Prime Minister; Vlado Dimovski, Slovenian Minister for Labour, Family and Social Affairs; Katalin Levai, Hungarian MEP; and Lord Bill Brett.

Articles Director's diary A positive year for working conditions in Europe 2004 Health, social services and education sectors most at risk from stress Research and news in brief What route for Europe’s road transport sector? Outsourcing of Europe’s business-related services sector Increased number of web users Gender mainstreaming in industrial relations European survey on working time Increase in staff in 2005 Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Research in brief: What route for Europe’s road transport sector? Reduced economic growth, together with increased environmental concerns and growing traffic congestion, are three major factors that could devastate Europe’s transport sector. The volatile price of oil is regarded by many as the major factor restricting economic growth of the sector, but environmental concerns could also halt major infrastructure projects, necessary to enable the growth in the ‘business as usual’ scenario. Most important of all, perhaps, has been the failure to establish a European transport market, despite efforts during past decades. More information on the EMCC website News in brief: Outsourcing of Europe’s business-related services sector Globalisation and increased competitiveness, improved information and communication technologies, and the around-the-clock-business model are all factors forcing the business-related services sector to outsource parts of their operations. However, little is known about the effects outsourcing will have on job creation and employment across the EU. On 17-18 March 2005, participants at an EMCC Company Network Seminar in Tallinn, Estonia, will address whether offshoring is contributing to further competitiveness and business growth, or if it is characterised by low labour costs and poor working conditions. Increased number of web users User sessions are on the increase for all of the Foundation’s websites. Some 150,000 user sessions are regularly recorded for Eurofound 		each month, and the number of user sessions for the specialist portal of the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) also continue to rise. Some 200,000 sessions were recorded for EIRO in January 2005, an increase of 30% from October 2003. The number of user sessions for the European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) is now in excess of 25,000 per month, and the European Working Conditions Observatory (EWCO) has some 20,000 user sessions per month. Gender mainstreaming in industrial relations Although most countries have introduced measures to promote equality, the latest survey from the Foundation’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) found that only 11 out of 18 countries have processes in place that require social partners to enact them or empower them to do so. The study found that gender mainstreaming is primarily a matter for government regulation and policies, and that not many connections are made between the governmental regulatory/institutional framework and collective bargaining. The latest EIRO comparative study analyses the state of gender mainstreaming in industrial relations in 17 of the 25 EU Member States and in Norway. European survey on working time How is the EU working time directive put into practice by Europe’s small- and medium-sized enterprises and public authorities? This is a question that will be answered in the Foundation’s European survey on working time, which looks at how European companies and public sector enterprises with more than 10 employees, make use of full- and part-time work, overtime, flexi-time, shift work, phased and early retirement and childcare leave arrangements. The survey covering some 20,000 companies in the former EU15 countries has been completed and is about to be expanded to the 10 new EU Member States. The initial results of the complete survey will be made available towards the end of the year. Increase in staff in 2005 The Foundation intends to increase its workforce with eight new staff during 2005. This will include support administrative roles, research managers, head of information and communication technologies, and a customer relations manager. The process of recruiting a new Director is also underway, and it is hoped that this post will be filled by the second half of 2005.

IN BRIEF News in pictures Robert Anderson, research coordinator of Eurofound’s Living Conditions team, speaks at a conference on ‘Demographic change as opportunity: The economic potential of the elderly’. The conference was organised by the German Ministry for Social Affairs in Berlin on 17–18 April under the auspices of the German EU Presidency. On the left is conference rapporteur Gerhard Naegele of the University of Dortmund. News in brief Social capital vital for rural development Profound changes are affecting rural Europe: farm jobs are disappearing, younger, educated people (especially women) are migrating to the cities, and the rural population is ageing. A new report from Eurofound, Social capital and job creation in rural Europe, identifies social capital as a vital resource for rural development and job creation. Social capital is the term used to describe how people interact in networks – such as local authorities, businesses, NGOs or clubs – and so build trust and communication locally. Previously, rural policy focused exclusively on the agricultural sector; now, the focus is shifting to include forestry, tourism and service industries at regional level. Stressing that local decision-making is crucial, the report presents detailed case studies of social capital initiatives that have resulted in job creation. It highlights challenges and makes practical recommendations on fostering the conditions to encourage social capital-based rural development. Download the report Out-of-school childcare benefits families The provision of out-of-school childcare can benefit both parents and children substantially. A recent study from Eurofound, looking at childcare for children aged five to 12, finds that the provision of such childcare can help parents take up employment, improve their financial situation, balance work and home life, reduce their stress levels, increase their confidence and improve their social interaction. Children benefit through better educational attainment, greater social development opportunities, better health, a safe, secure environment and from the improved household finances. Eurofound research manager Gerlinde Ziniel will chair a workshop on developments in out-of-school childcare in disadvantaged areas of Europe at a conference entitled ‘Opportunity for all: The challenge for social and health services in a diverse Europe’, organised by the German presidency in Berlin on 18–20 June. Download the executive summary Social dialogue in shipbuilding restructuring Member States that have invested heavily in their shipbuilding and ship repair industries are facing increased global competition, resulting in cyclical fluctuations in demand. Becoming sufficiently flexible to respond to such fluctuations without losing essential skills and expertise presents a challenge. A new study from Eurofound’s European Centre on Monitoring Change (EMCC), commissioned at the request of the European Sectoral Social Dialogue Committee of the shipbuilding and ship repair industries, finds that those countries in which the government brings the social partners together to cooperate in creating solutions have the most innovative and successful outcomes: product diversification, flexible working-time arrangements, reorganising production processes, and raising workers’ skills levels through training schemes. The combination of social dialogue and internal measures may lessen the impact of any outsourcing carried out in order to externalise the risks of fluctuating demand. Download the report Focus on working conditions in Belgium and France Work–life balance, working time and job satisfaction levels will be top of the agenda when Eurofound presents findings and analysis from its recent fourth European Working Conditions Survey in Belgium. During the visit to Brussels on 15 June, Eurofound experts will meet with representatives of government, employer organisations, trade unions, civil society and academia. The visit is part of Eurofound’s series of national roadshows, aimed at facilitating closer collaboration with its stakeholders and showcasing recent Eurofound research, data and recommendations. A Eurofound speaker will also present findings from the survey at an event organised by the French national outreach centre in Paris on 27 June.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1306	2007-12-16	UNK	Press release, 1 June 2001	 Working conditions in small firms Workers in micro firms are more likely to have unsocial working hours, less training and job security and be more exposed to health risks, according to the conclusions of research carried out by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, the European agency based in Dublin. Comparisons between working and employment conditions in micro firms (1-9 employees) and other sized enterprises within the SME sector in four selected countries (France, Greece, the UK and Sweden) show that while job autonomy is higher in micro firms they rate significantly lower in other selected criteria of working conditions: working hours, unsocial hours payment, provision of training, participation and consultation, physical health and job security. Company size does not appear to be related to job quality in the areas of family support systems, control over the physical work environment, the degree of physical discomfort, pressure of work, monotony, effectiveness of work and job satisfaction. Company size does influence significantly job autonomy (tasks, breaks and holidays), the number of unsocial working hours, unsocial hours compensation, provision of formal training, participation and consultation within the company. Conclusions from the research, Jobs in micro firms, show that while sector has the most significant potential for job creation, currently representing 40% of EU enterprises and employing a quarter of the workforce, highlight the need for tailored strategies and policies for improving working and employment conditions while simultaneously encouraging the adaptability and modernisation of enterprises. Public policy can address the basic needs of higher education, modern training and the socio-economic environment however quality of work is an area that requires innovative approaches for policymaking. Currently, competition, lack of expertise and overlapping of agencies that support the smallest of enterprises create confusion and lack of effectiveness of these services. At the outset of the project remarkably little was known about the sector due to the difficulties of assembling authoritative data yet micro firms and the project shows there is clearly a need to make more effective use of a combination of qualitative and quantitative data that is available. A summary of the findings will be published by the Foundation.

In this issue: Director's diary Strong link between restructuring and job creation Lack of training opportunities among non-permanent workers Research and news in brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Research in brief Juggling work and family Europeans are under increasing pressure to fulfil their family responsibilities because of the amount of time they spend at work. Foundation research has found that in all EU25 countries, women spend almost twice the amount of time as men on caring for children, the elderly and people with dependent needs. Family policies are currently outside the scope of EU policymaking. Yet, many EU policies affect the way households and families are organised and function. The report highlights, therefore, that this has increased the need for strategies to improve the work–life balance across the EU.

The latest EIRO comparative study examines 	 industrial relations in the steel sector. It reveals that while the largest job losses took place in countries of the former central and eastern Europe, reductions 	 have also been significant in the EU15 countries. However, one industrial 	 relations trend that seems to be emerging is finding solutions rather 	 than encouraging confrontation, a trend reflected in the fact that there 	 has been 	 no major industrial action in the sector over the past 10 years. Governments 	 too have played a role in ensuring that restructuring has led to the 	 least social hardship. In most countries, following a sometimes difficult 	 process 	 of rationalisation and change, the steel industry now seems to be in 	 better shape to face the future. Read more about this topic Swedes are happy with life and local environment Sweden recorded among the highest overall life satisfaction and general happiness levels in Europe, although lower than Danes and Finns. However, at 30% Sweden has the second highest declaration of long standing illness or disability in the former EU15, which averages at 20%. The Foundation's European Quality of Life Survey also found that Swedes seem to be happy with their housing and the quality of local environment: only 3% have two or more complaints about noise, air pollution, lack of access to recreational or green areas in the immediate neighbourhood, which compares to 19% in the former EU-15 countries. A Foundation seminar in Stockholm, Sweden, on 19-20 September will discuss these and other findings of the European Quality of Life Survey with representatives from the Swedish government, social partners and civil society. Read more about the survey Creating quality jobs in quality childcare The Foundation is currently publishing a series of reports on work, family relationships and integration in the labour market of specific groups. During the summer, a new research project on this theme was launched, focusing on ‘out-of-school’ childcare services for children aged 5–12, including day care centres and before- and after-school facilities in private, public and third sector settings. The aim of the project is to outline the general situation in the EU25 and provide examples of good practice and policy developments in six Member States. The report, which will be published in 2006, will document implications for policies on the creation of formal employment in ‘affordable high quality childcare’. Read more about this topic Fieldwork for Working Conditions Survey begins Fieldwork for the Foundation’s Fourth European Working Conditions survey commences on 19 September and will be completed over the ensuing six weeks in 31 countries. Working with the Foundation, Gallup-Europe will be coordinating interviews with over 25,000 individual workers. Earlier surveys were carried out in 1990–1, 1995–6 and 2000. The countries covered in the 2005 edition of the survey are the EU25, Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Croatia, as well as Norway and Switzerland. The latter two countries are participating on a self-financing basis. Preliminary results from the survey will be available from 2006 and should provide a useful insight into workplace trends in Europe.

In this issue: Director's diary Employment initiatives for an ageing workforce Investigating labour market mobility In brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Employment initiatives for an ageing workforce The Foundation’s forthcoming report, Developments in employment initiatives for an ageing workforce, will provide an overview of national policy, and of actions taken by social partners, in tackling the challenges and reaping the benefits of an ageing labour force. As the issue of ageing of the labour force moves up the European policy agenda, the new report has found that organisations’ approaches to age management have become more complex. The Foundation first studied the issue in the mid 1990s: the project Combating age barriers in employment examined good practice in over 100 companies in 11 of the former EU15 countries. The new report follows up these case studies to assess how governments and employers are responding to workforce ageing, and to find out which factors affect how the issue is perceived. ‘There is, however, very little evidence to suggest that we are witnessing a profound shift in the treatment of older workers,’ says Jorma Karppinen, the Foundation’s Director, in a response to the findings. ‘In fact, developing and implementing good practice is more commonly triggered by the direct business needs of companies, rather than pressure from public policy or age-awareness campaigns’. Big differences in approaches across Europe Good practice in age management involves specific measures to combat age barriers or promoting age diversity. The case studies point to a range of benefits for the organisation and for staff: improved health and well-being; more work satisfaction; better relations with co-workers and managers; better retirement prospects; and, specifically for the organisation, greater security of labour supply and improved industrial relations. The report identifies a number of approaches that organisations are taking to manage their ageing workforces. Training and development is by far the most common measure, followed by flexible working arrangements. The report suggests that recruitment and redeployment have decreased in importance as approaches over time, while measures to improve employees’ health and well-being have grown in importance. When comparing countries, flexible working practices seem to be one of the key measures taken in Austria, Germany and the Netherlands. The Nordic countries place a greater emphasis on improving employees’ health and well-being, while organisations in Belgium, France, Greece, Italy and Spain focus more on training and development. However, unless the organisation clearly communicates the purpose of such age-management measures and establishes a comprehensive policy framework that involves all parties and demonstrates clear value for money and impact, any such measures are unlikely to succeed. An overview of policy and actions in place The report attempts to answer the fundamental question: will employers use older workers for their future staffing needs, given the increased globalisation of labour supply and the ongoing restructuring of European industry? To do so, it reviews national policy and actions taken by the social partners. The report finds government policy regarding age management continues to develop, driven in particular by concerns over the sustainability of pensions systems. However, employers still fail to show support, often because of an absence of a ‘strategic vision of the importance of implementing age management as opposed to opportunistic policy making’. And many employees are still preoccupied with early retirement, as a result of decades of public policy and general attitudes in Europe.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1314	2007-12-16	UNK	Communiqué November 2006	" Important notice! If you would like to receive Communiqué by email (10 issues a year), please sign up now. Research highlights low level of EU mobility Only 4% of EU citizens have ever moved to another country in the EU and less than 3% to another country outside the EU, according to the Foundation’s latest publication, Mobility in Europe. While European policy stresses the importance of mobility, the research findings point to a very low level of mobility overall in recent times.		 Geographical mobility is generally perceived as a ‘good thing’ for European integration by a solid majority of 62% of respondents, according to research findings documented in the report. Most people also view it as a good thing for the labour market and the economy generally, as well as for the individual. However, Europeans generally view geographical mobility as having a negative impact on families. While people believe that changing their place of residence would be good for European society at large, they do not feel that this would be a desirable action at an individual level. Moderate rate of mobility The survey results confirm the overall moderate rate of mobility in Europe: only 4% of EU citizens have ever moved to another country in the EU and less than 3% to another country outside the EU. Despite alarmist reports in the press in the run-up to the 2004 enlargement, referring to a potential tidal wave of migration from eastern Europe, evidence from this report points to a very low level of migration over the past two years. Asked about their intentions to move in the future, only 3% of all EU citizens indicate that they might move to another EU country in the next five years. However, there are considerable variations in the nature and extent of mobility from one country to another. ‘Geographical mobility of labour remains a major policy challenge for Europe,’ says Jorma Karppinen, the Foundation’s Director. ‘On the one hand is the concern that too little geographical mobility between regions and Member States will have negative consequences due to reduced adaptability and competitiveness. The concern on the other hand is the impact on the national labour market, both on the giving and receiving ends, arising from geographical mobility between poorer regions in Eastern Europe and richer parts of central and northern Europe.' Labour migration from the ten new EU Member States The pattern of future labour migration from the new Member States to the former EU15 countries is predicted to vary widely, while its overall extent will remain limited, according to the report. In the medium- to long-term, however, the greatest challenges will be the impact of youth and ‘brain drain’ for the sending rather than the receiving countries. The research examines the different reasons why people would want to migrate. In the new Member States, work-related factors such as higher household income (59%) and better working conditions (57%), but also the opportunity to discover new things (30%), feature high on the list of priorities. In contrast, in the former EU15 countries, the reasons why people would want to migrate fall into the ‘fun’ category: discovering new environments (64%) and meeting new people (39%). A quarter of respondents from the former EU15 countries mentioned ‘better weather’ as a serious reason to migrate. 2006 Year of Mobility The European Commission has designated the year 2006 as the ‘European Year of Workers’ Mobility’, with the objective of raising awareness and spreading information about the rights and opportunities of workers who work in another country. It also aims to promote job mobility as a way to improve people’s career and income prospects. Geographical mobility is also viewed as an opportunity for the European economy to overcome skills shortages and unemployment in certain countries and sectors. The Foundation’s Mobility in Europe report is based on a descriptive analysis of the data collected by the Eurobarometer Survey (2005) and examines two key aspects: geographical mobility and job mobility. It takes a life-course approach to the subject, tracing mobility patterns at key points in an individual’s life: leaving the parental home, starting a household/family, first job, combining work and childcare, career moves and retirement.

Entitled Labour mobility in a transatlantic perspective, the seminar brought together policymakers and researchers from Europe and the United States to look at the policy debate regarding the mobility and flexibility of employees on both sides of the Atlantic, the actual levels of mobility, and the effects of mobility on individuals and on regions. Jointly organised by Eurofound and the German Marshall Fund of the United States, the seminar drew a number of conclusions, including the recognition that continuous long-distance mobility can have the potential to result in a ‘brain drain’ and a ‘youth drain’ for those regions and countries whose citizens emigrate. The seminar coincided with the publication of the first of Eurofound’s new series of Foundation Findings. The first issue, Mobility in Europe: The way forward, reviews Eurofound’s analysis of the 2005 Eurobarometer survey on geographical and labour market mobility. Perspectives of social partners At the seminar, social partner representatives concluded that social dialogue had a vital role to play in the drawing up and implementation of mobility policy, not least because social partners had direct knowledge of the experience of companies and employees dealing with mobility. And, to complement the right to free movement of European citizens, social partner representatives also stated that citizens should be equally free to remain in their home town, region or country. Surprising findings Central to the discussions were the data gathered from a Eurobarometer survey (64.1) carried out in 2005 on geographical and labour market mobility in Europe. The data, which Eurofound analysed in cooperation with the European Commission, shed light both on the extent of geographical mobility to date, and of future intentions to move between regions or countries. For instance, it found that citizens in four of the NMS10 (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland) had the highest intentions among the EU25 of moving in the next five years. However, their fellow citizens in the other four eastern European NMS (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia) had less intention of moving than citizens in Denmark, Ireland, Finland and Sweden. Eurofound research on mobility and migration The seminar is the latest venture from Eurofound in its exploration of the issues of mobility and migration. Last year, it produced the descriptive report of the findings of the Eurobarometer survey, complemented in 2007 by five analytical reports which looked in greater depth at the two issues of geographical mobility and labour market mobility, and their interrelationship. In addition, Eurofound has just published the first in its Foundation Findings series, which provides information and policy pointers on both forms of mobility.

As outlined in our recently published Annual report 2004, the Foundation’s profile has improved greatly as a result of more focused and timely research and dissemination to all 25 Member States. Findings of the European Quality of Life Survey presented in seven EU Member States during the second half of 2004, for example, have reached an estimated 10 million people through reports in national media. This month will see the launch of the comprehensive public tender notice for the supply of information, editing and dissemination services for the Foundation’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO), the European Working Conditions Observatory (EWCO), the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) and the Foundation’s National Liaison Centres (NLCs). It is hoped the new initiative will help boost the Foundation’s efforts to optimise the communication and dissemination of its work.

Director’s diary Focus on achieving the Lisbon goals Social inclusion, the fight against poverty and the reconciliation of work with personal and family life are the priority themes for the Portuguese EU Presidency during the coming six months. During the Presidency, Eurofound will contribute to five high-profile events, covering such issues as social capital and job creation in rural Europe, gender equality and work-related musculoskeletal disorders. In the coming six months, Eurofound will also focus its activities on supporting the EU’s efforts to relaunch the Lisbon Strategy in 2008. A key aspect of EU policy is boosting employment growth. One way to achieve this is to facilitate the entry of more women into the labour market, particularly into those sectors with a predominantly male bias. In July, Eurofound publishes a report from its European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) on Innovative gender equality measures in the transport industry, which looks at initiatives taken in eight European companies to make their workplaces more attractive to female workers. Another report from EIRO to be published this month, Employee financial participation in the new Member States, reveals that the initial progress made in employee financial participation (EFP) schemes in the countries that made the transition to market economies in the 1990s has since faltered. As in previous years, there will no August issue of Eurofound News. The next issue will be published at the start of September.

Download the report (soon available here) News in brief New approaches to integrate migrant workers There is no single European model on how to integrate a highly diverse and culturally rich immigrant population into the local community, according to Eurofound’s new report Local integration policies for migrants in Europe. The report states that cities and municipalities cannot afford to make mistakes in integrating migrant workers into their community, and can usefully learn from successful local integration practices which have taken place in Europe’s larger cities. The report describes the historical and institutional factors which have shaped migration policy in 12 EU Member States and analyses local integration policies in 14 European cities. While it points to the very different migration histories and patterns in different European countries and cities and the distinctive ways of implementing concrete integration measures, it identifies areas of common experience and practice.

Representatives from the Danish government and social partners will receive a presentation on the survey’s main findings during a visit to Denmark by Eurofound on 28 February and 1 March. During the two-day visit, bilateral meetings with Eurofound’s stakeholders in Denmark will be coupled with a half-day seminar on the fourth European Working Conditions Survey. The visit is part of Eurofound’s series of visits to its stakeholders to allow for closer collaboration and to present recent Eurofound research, data and recommendations. Strengthening the competitive edge of the biomedical health care sector Strengthening the competitiveness of Europe’s biomedical health care sector is vital if value-creating research, development and jobs are to remain in Europe, Eurofound’s European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) argues. In order for Europe’s biomedical health care sector to meet the challenges of reducing costs, new skills requirements, product innovation, compliance with new and complex regulations, and development of sustainable growth strategies, Eurofound has contacted the Danish Technological Institute to map the current and future challenges facing the sector. Other concerns are finding ways to address the lack of funding and the insufficient supply of qualified employees in Europe. The study is aimed at ensuring that company strategies, employee competences, and the regulatory framework meet future challenges. Foundation seminar series on youth and work Youth and work is the focus of the Foundation Seminar Series (FSS) in 2007. The FSS brings together social partners and government representatives from all EU Member States to promote the sharing of knowledge, ideas and practical implementation. The past two Foundation Seminar cycles in 2005 and 2006 have proven to be a good incentive for action at national level. The first session in this year’s series on 6–8 June in Dublin will outline the macro economic challenges and the European strategies on how to promote more and better work opportunities for the young, and how to keep them in employment. The second session, foreseen for 15–17 October, will allow participants to present their national policies and country situations. At the second session, company representatives will be invited to present their actions and policies at company level.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-february-2007-2

One in five of workers on low pay in the EU is in the category of ‘working poor’, according to the Foundation’s report, Working poor in the European Union, the first European analysis of this hitherto relatively under-researched and neglected area. Data at EU-level confirm that 17% of the self-employed and 6% of employees in the former EU-15 fall below the standard poverty threshold. These figures are likely to be higher in the new Europe of 25 countries, given the higher incidence of relative poverty in the new Member States. A new issue at EU-level Working poverty is an issue that has attracted considerable attention in the United States since the 1970s but has only recently begun to be addressed at EU-level. Indicators started to appear in Europe in 2003 in the Open Method of Coordination (OMC) processes for both social inclusion and employment. The working poor may be defined as workers living in a household in which at least one member works and where the total income of the household is still below the poverty line. Opening a pan-European debate The report was launched in Brussels on 1-2 July, at a seminar organised by the Foundation which brought together experts from the European institutions, policymakers, researchers, representatives from civil society, and the social partners. The seminar examined in detail who are the working poor, which categories of workers are most at risk and what is the extent of working poverty in the European Union. The objectives of the seminar were to contribute to a better understanding of the issues at stake and their interrelationships, to look at the approaches that are already available or could be made available to tackle these issues, and to promote debate on these issues at European level.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-4-2004-6

Across the EU, fixed-terms contracts were held by over 20% of non-EU nationals in 2001, compared with 13% of EU nationals. The sectors where migrant workers are employed tend, across the EU, to be generally labour-intensive and low skilled. In the EU as a whole, foreign workers enter the full spectrum of occupations, but seem to be concentrated largely at the top and bottom of the labour market. Many migrant workers are in professional or skilled occupations, some 23.3% of non-EU national workers are in high-skilled non-manual occupations. However, the largest group of migrants is found in unskilled manual work, accounting for 33.7% of non-EU national workers.

For almost a decade, Europe's regions and local authorities have developed policies aimed at economic growth, employment and social inclusion, in a bottom-up approach to meet the Lisbon goals. But little is known about the role of resources necessary for capacity-building, networking and trust, commonly referred to as social capital. In an effort to highlight good practice cases and propose strategies that make better use of the concept, the Foundation examined six disadvantaged regions that face employment and social exclusion problems. The report is a first inroad into the regional dimension of socio-economic research, a new area in the Foundation's new four-year work programme 2005-2008. Later this year, the research on 'Promoting quality of life in rural areas' will take this regional approach forward. ^Back to top of page A guide to employment initiatives for an ageing workforce The Foundation will produce a set of guidelines to improve the employment situation for Europe's ageing workforce and to help extend working life. By reviewing about 100 company cases, some of which were part of the Foundation's research on 'Combating age barriers in employment' a decade ago, this project will create an understanding of current company policies and the changing situation of older workers. The research will cover company cases in 10 former EU15 countries, six of the new Member States plus Romania and Bulgaria. An analytical report on developments in age management and an open database of current good practice examples, highlighting programmes that incorporate gender issues, the life course perspective, collective bargaining and transferability, will complete the results of this project by the end of the year. Follow progress in the population and society area. ^Back to top of page Young, male and self-employed in Turkey Turkey's labour market is dominated by young, male and self-employed workers, with few signs of achieving equal opportunities similar to those in the European Union, the Foundation told a public hearing at the European Parliament in Brussels on the role of women in social, economic and political life in Turkey. At the event, organised by the Parliament's Committee on women's rights and gender equality on 16 March, the Foundation presented key indicators on the situation of women workers in Turkey. ^Back to top of page Outsourcing services: Balancing opportunities and threats Outsourcing is becoming common business practice across Europe as it offers opportunities for companies' efficiency gains, participants were told at the EMCC company network seminar held in Tallinn, Estonia, on 17-18 March. With recent advances in information and communication technologies making it possible for a vast range of business services to trade internationally, the issue of outsourcing has become increasingly central to the work of Europe's social partners. While representatives of employer organisations and businesses highlight the financial gains offered by outsourcing, trade union representatives argue the need for labour agreements to protect against job losses caused by outsourcing. Both parties, however, acknowledge the increasing use of outsourcing as a tool for business optimisation and, more importantly, the need for both sides to adapt their attitudes and identify the opportunities of this growing trend. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-march-2005-2
EUROFOUND_UNK_1322	2007-12-16	UNK	Press release, 10 February 2001	" Useful but unused - the fate of group work in Europe Only about 4% of all organisations in Europe take group work seriously despite compelling evidence that significant economic benefits accrue to organisations which introduce work practices whereby formal work groups have the right to make decisions on how their work is performed. This is one of the key findings of a report - , published by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in Dublin. According to the report, Dutch enterprises are the most committed in Europe to the use of some form of direct participation. However, while 90% of enterprises use direct participation of employees in the workplace, only 48% have delegation of responsibility to groups of employees and only 7% of enterprises in the Netherlands use the more highly developed forms of group work while less than 4% is the European average. Overall, the Netherlands and Sweden have the highest levels of group delegation, while France, Ireland and the UK are above the European average, and Denmark and Germany are just below the average. The three countries in the south - Italy, Portugal and Spain - were found, on the basis of the report's comparisons, to be at the bottom of the league. The report is the first European overview of the implementation, scope, and effects of work group. Group work is seen as a means of decentralising decision making on a range of agreed issues so as to increase workplace flexibility and fully utilise the skills of employees. Its conclusions are clear; group work is useful but it remains unused or under utilised despite the gains it promises in the fiercely competitive global market. Economics are the main motive for introducing group work in enterprises, according to the report's findings. While ""quality of working life"" was mentioned frequently it is generally mentioned in conjunction with productivity/economic motives. Furthermore, the findings indicate that the more intensely group work is practised the greater the economic benefits. Reported economic effects included reduction of production costs and throughput time, quality improvement and increase of output. Associated to these economic effects was a reported improvement in attendance and a decrease in sickness levels of up to 50% in European organisations with highly developed group work. Forms of group work may differ but a number of trends are clear. A group's decision making rights are generally limited, with a clear hierarchy in the topics about which the group may take decisions. On average, about half the work groups were engaged in the decision making on allocation of work, scheduling of work and improving the work process while just over a quarter had decision making rights in relation to attendance and absence control and job rotation. In the majority of cases, the appointment of team leaders is a managerial prerogative. Management decide the composition of the team in almost 40% of European workplaces - in only 15% of cases do the group members alone decide who may become a member of the group. While group work may require additional skills to facilitate co-operation, the findings indicate that enterprises provide a modest amount of training. Less than a third of employees involved in groups receive any form of training though managers do receive more training than other employees. While team work is often associated with skill-based payment systems and use of team bonuses, the reports findings are that changes in payment/wages systems in organisations which adopt group work are the exception rather than the rule - in only one in five cases were payment systems changed. In the Netherlands 11% of companies changed their payment system after introducing group work. Bonuses for team output are the most popular change of remuneration while skill-based pay is the second most popular option. The report was written by Jos Benders (Nijmegen Business School NL), Fred Huijgen (Nijmegen Business School NL), Ulrich Pekruhl ( Institut Arbeit und Technik, Germany ) and Kevin P O'Kelly, research manager at the Foundation. It is based on an analysis of the findings of the EPOC (Employee direct Participation in Organisational Change) survey (1996) in which 5,800 managers in 10 European countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the UK) were interviewed about the nature and extent of direct employee participation in their workplace. Group work is defined as rights and responsibilities granted to groups of employees to carry out their common tasks without constants reference back to managers.

In this issue: Director's diary New Director appointed for the Foundation Focusing on a limited number of relevant policy themes Research and news in brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Research in brief Industrial relations in the construction sector The challenges for the European social partners in the construction sector are influenced by some of the industry’s particularities: low productivity; and weak industry image among customers and potential new workers. In the past three months, however, 35 restructuring cases totalling the creation of 9,630 jobs and the loss of 4,038 jobs were announced in the sector. In most cases, these jobs result from booming expanding markets in eastern Europe, rather than from company relocations. Access the report on the EMCC website. Employment effects in Europe's construction sector in the 3rd quarter per type of restructuring Source: ERM quarterly, Issue 3 - Autumn 2005 News in brief Four future scenarios for the chemical industry The European chemicals industry has to accelerate the pace of innovation to stay in the lead, due to substantial foreign investments in chemical production in the booming market of Asia, according to the EMCC Sector Futures report on the chemicals industry. Four scenarios have been developed for the sector: the ‘Sunny’ scenario refers to a positive market situation and, though unrealistic, would result in a continued growth in the chemical sector; in the ‘Cloudy’ and ‘Rain’ scenarios the market weakness would lead to a deterioration of competitiveness and profitability levels; finally, the ‘Storm’ scenario is characterised by a very discouraging macro political environment, which would end up in a rapid loss of the global market share. Read the full report on the EMCC website. Life's jigsaw puzzle campaign: connecting generations, gender and time A new campaign, focusing on current challenges to the social and working patterns encountered across European countries, will be launched next January by the Foundation. Within the 2005–2008 work programme, Changing Europe: Better work, better life, the new project aims at contributing to raising awareness of three current top priority issues: employment initiatives for an ageing workforce; gender-based inequalities in family and working life; arrangement of working time over the life course. The campaign, which will run over six months, will feature a series of conferences as well as printed publications and online information. Read more on this topic How competitive is Europe? Europe runs the risk of missing the goal of becoming the world’s most competitive knowledge-based economy. Is business paralysed by red tape and stringent regulation and cannot exploit its full potential? Or is it that governments have not acted, perceiving the necessary reforms as being unpopular with their voters? The third Foundation Forum, taking place in Dublin Castle on 2–3 November 2006, will address these questions in its unique open debate format aimed at Europe’s political leaders, social partners, business people, and academics. Participants will find out how to increase competitiveness and reform the European social model at the same time. New information will be posted on www.eurofound.europa.eu/events/forum.htm. More effort needed in fighting undeclared work Undeclared work has dramatic effects on workers’ incomes, fair competition, security, and working conditions. Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom report the lowest rates of undeclared work in Europe, with the highest found in Bulgaria, Hungary, Greece and Slovenia. The latest EIRO overview on ‘Industrial relations and undeclared work’ looks at efforts to try and tackle the problem. Trade unions in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and the UK, for example, are attempting to organise people who are working in this underground economy. Employers’ organisations in the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden have introduced certification systems for bona fide companies which comply with tax and social security obligations. However, there is a need for more integrated approaches, with multilateral and binding initiatives, which will call for greater efforts by social partners and government, according to the report.

In order for Europe’s biomedical health care sector to meet the challenges of reducing costs, new skills requirements, product innovation, compliance with new and complex regulations, and development of sustainable growth strategies, Eurofound has contacted the Danish Technological Institute to map the current and future challenges facing the sector. Other concerns are finding ways to address the lack of funding and the insufficient supply of qualified employees in Europe. The study is aimed at ensuring that company strategies, employee competences, and the regulatory framework meet future challenges. Foundation seminar series on youth and work Youth and work is the focus of the Foundation Seminar Series (FSS) in 2007. The FSS brings together social partners and government representatives from all EU Member States to promote the sharing of knowledge, ideas and practical implementation. The past two Foundation Seminar cycles in 2005 and 2006 have proven to be a good incentive for action at national level. The first session in this year’s series on 6–8 June in Dublin will outline the macro economic challenges and the European strategies on how to promote more and better work opportunities for the young, and how to keep them in employment. The second session, foreseen for 15–17 October, will allow participants to present their national policies and country situations. At the second session, company representatives will be invited to present their actions and policies at company level.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-february-2007-2

Tensions in privatised postal sector Deteriorating employment conditions in Europe’s increasingly privatised postal sector risk causing industrial conflict, according to a new comparative report from the Foundation’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). The report, Industrial relations in the postal sector, indicates that poorer pay and conditions in these emerging private companies are also expected to spark conflict in large national postal services. The report describes the growing private postal sector as frequently characterised by employment conditions and labour costs ‘different from, and inferior to, those of the main providers’. Moreover, liberalisation of the sector has resulted in extensive closures of post offices across Europe. The report, which covers Norway and all 27 EU Member States except Sweden, recommends sectoral collective agreements as the best alternative to worsening employment conditions and industrial unrest. Changes across European postal sector The European postal sector had been due for complete liberalisation by January 2009; however, this will probably be delayed to December 2010 or later. So far, change has been far-reaching, with ‘extensive consequences for the organisation of services and for the employment conditions of workers’. For example, in Austria, 1,000 of the country’s 2,300 post offices closed between 2000 and 2005, while in Ireland, 400 of the 2,000 rural sub-post offices across the country closed within a few years. In Norway, the 2,300 post offices operating in the 1990s were reduced to only 300 branches by 2002. In Germany, the number of post offices was cut by a quarter in 10 years and the proportion of branches owned by the monopoly holder declined from 82% to 44%. Differences in working conditions and pay In many countries, liberalisation has led to the ‘contractualisation’ of employment relationships in the main postal operators: a shift has taken place from public-law employment contracts to private-law contracts. Dissatisfaction is reported among, for example, newly-hired workers on private-law contracts in France, whose employment conditions are inferior to those of employees hired previously. Moreover, pay increases within the sector tend to be below average; and in all 27 countries studied in the report, a pay gap exists between the main and alternative service providers. Uneven development among social partners Trade unions are active in the main national providers. In contrast, little or no trade union representation exists in the new alternative providers – a result of the small size of these companies and the instability and precariousness of workers’ employment conditions. Meanwhile, employers tend not to have organisations coordinating their interests, despite the liberalisation of the sector. This hampers the harmonisation of employers’ positions, which in turn hinders multi-employer collective agreements.

In this issue: Director's diary ‘Your work, your life: matching company needs with worker solutions’ High level of business creation activities in the new Member States In brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing ‘Your work, your life: matching company needs with worker solutions’ The Foundation launches an information and communication campaign aimed at creating awareness of how the changing demographics and demand for flexible working patterns are challenging Europe, and to offer practical contributions to policymakers’ decisions and actions. The ‘Your work, your life’ campaign aims to show how key Foundation research findings can contribute to some of the critical issues facing the EU. These include the ageing of the workforce; combining family and full-time work; and working time options from the point of view of social security structures and company strategies to develop new work patterns. ‘To achieve the Lisbon goals of improved employment rates and productivity, workplaces in the EU must undergo fundamental change,’ says Jorma Karppinen, the Foundation’s Director. ‘In order to ensure the presence, abilities and competencies of women at work, companies will need to make working hours more conducive to the family responsibilities of workers.’ How ageing and time impact on work–life balance With an ageing workforce, more effective policies are needed to promote employment opportunities for older people. Employers and governments need to devise strategies to retain and reintegrate older workers in the workplace. The ‘Your work, your life’ campaign is a Foundation project that aims to present an overview of the main challenges taking place in the social structure, in the social security system, as well as in family and working patterns. The campaign focuses on different but strongly correlated topics; it shows how an ageing workforce and working time constraints all affect negatively on employees’ work-life balance. During the campaign, some six major publications will be published. The Foundation's strategy is to promote its research findings and analysis at EU Presidency level and other high-profile events around Europe. A timely response to critical questions European workers ask for policies specifically addressed to their needs and aiming to give them a greater work–life balance. In this context, the campaign represents a combined approach to these issues: it brings together a series of surveys, reports and case studies and presents possible solutions. By providing an in-depth analysis of this context, the campaign is a comprehensive and timely response to questions of vital importance to EU citizens and is intended to inform policymakers’ future actions. Creating awareness of the gender dimension At present in the EU, women are finding it difficult to juggle their family responsibilities – where they still tend to be more involved than men – with paid work commitments. Research shows that families, and especially women, also tend to do the bulk of caring for elderly people. But in the future with the decline in the traditional family and the increased participation of women in the workplace, it is clear that appropriate care strategies need to be devised by policymakers. The ‘Your work, your life’ campaign will show that a major priority in the EU today is how to reconcile better the demands of paid work with family and care responsibilities.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-february-2006-0

Director’s diary Tapping the potential of the ‘silver economy’ The intense debates taking place across the Union on how to tackle the demographic challenges of the future focus primarily on employment rates, labour supply, the costs of health and long-term care, and the sustainability of pensions. While all these issues are crucial, little attention is given to one positive aspect of the demographic seesaw: that the majority of older people possess sufficient money, time and good health to be able to enjoy leisure goods and services. In Germany, for example, the over-50s own half of the country’s wealth. Manufacturers and retailers are quick to appreciate the potential of this new, important market, and policy-makers must follow. A related issue is the question of where the affluent, healthy and time-rich older Europeans wish to spend their retirement. A recent Eurofound study concluded that 15% of European citizens are thinking of retiring to a Member State other than their own: almost 45% of Swedes are thinking of moving, mostly south to warmer countries. 32% of Britons and 20% of Germans are also considering this idea. Eurofound will bring its knowledge and expertise to two events on the ‘silver economy’ in the coming month. The first is a webcast with the Conference Board on ‘The impact of Europe’s greying population on business’ which takes place in March, and the second is a German EU Presidency event on ‘Demographic change as opportunity: the economic potential of the elderly’ which takes place in Berlin in April. Also in the coming month, Eurofound will contribute to a European Parliament hearing on flexicurity and active labour market, as well as women’s rights and gender equality.

Director’s diary Positive developments in European working conditions 2006 saw considerable progress in working conditions in Europe, Eurofound’s European Working Conditions Observatory (EWCO) notes in its annual review. The European Commission published its Roadmap for equality between men and women 2006–2010, which takes Europe’s already ambitious targets for gender equality far beyond the workplace domain; at the same time, a first-phase consultation was launched on the reconciliation of professional, private and family life. Similarly, the new services Directive can be viewed as establishing a good balance between competition and social protection; together with the social partners’ agreements to combat violence and harassment in the workplace, these developments represent a step forward for Europe’s labour market as a whole. However, despite the extensive debate that took place regarding the working time Directive in 2006, no EU-level legislative progress was made. With a view to making an ever-more effective contribution to policymakers, preparations are already underway at the Foundation for its annual work programme for 2008, as well as for the next four-year work programme for 2009–2012. Internal consultation and brainstorming have produced a number of innovative research ideas, as well as furthering already established research initiatives. All these proposals will now be brought to the stakeholder group meetings in Dublin in July, where decisions will be taken regarding the focus and scope of research activities. May will be a busy month for Eurofound: in conjunction with its usual activities, it will contribute to a high-level conference under the German EU Presidency on the issue of demographic change. Forthcoming publications, meanwhile, will include a timely report investigating quality-of-life issues in Turkey.

In this issue: Director's diary Flexible working time options: a win-win situation for all Catering for better working conditions Research and news in brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Flexible working time options: a win-win situation for all Almost half of all companies and organisations in Europe, with ten or more employees, have put in place flexible working time arrangements, although there are substantial differences across EU Member States in the type of options available. The Foundation’s recently completed survey on working time and work–life balance reveals that managers and employee representatives alike view flexible working time arrangements positively. The benefits include a higher degree of job satisfaction, better adaptation of working hours to the workload, and lower absenteeism rates. The representative sample survey of 21 European countries set out to question both employers and workers about the use of working time arrangements. The survey found that less than one in three companies or organisations in Cyprus, Greece and Portugal offers any flexibility with regard to working hours, while about two-thirds of companies in Finland, Latvia and Sweden do so. The survey also found considerable variation in the degree of flexibility. In companies and organisations in the Scandinavian countries, Austria, the Czech Republic and Germany, a flexible working time arrangement generally means the opportunity to accumulate hours in a ‘working time account’. However, in many southern European countries, flexibility is often limited to a variation in the start and end times of work on a daily basis. Comprehensive survey The large-scale representative sample survey, covering the former 15 Member States, and the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Hungary, Latvia, Poland and Slovenia, elicited the views of personnel managers and employees in over 21,000 private and public companies and organisations on their working time arrangements and strategies for work–life balance at the workplace. ‘This survey provides unique knowledge about working time arrangements in Europe. It paints a representative picture of practices at the workplace, and gives the views of both managers and worker representatives,’ says Jorma Karppinen, the Foundation’s Director. A comprehensive descriptive report on the findings of the survey will be published in April 2006. Increased job satisfaction Some 61% of all managers reported that higher job satisfaction was a key effect of the introduction of flexible working time. Other reported benefits of flexible working time include enhanced adaptation of working hours to workload, reduction in paid overtime and lower absenteeism rates. Employee representatives regard the introduction or extension of flexible working time arrangements as the most desirable initiative for improving work–life balance. Part-time work, overtime and parental leave The survey also looked at the incidence of part-time work, overtime, parental leave and the availability of on-site childcare facilities. It found part-time work prevalent in middle and northern European countries but much less widespread among southern European countries. Career prospects for part-timers were seen as worse in more than a quarter of the companies and organisations surveyed. Almost four out of five managers saw no difference in the motivation of part-time employees compared to full-time workers, while one in ten regarded part-timers as being more motivated.

Denmark, Germany, Italy, Malta and the Netherlands also have a high numbers of leave days per year, while other notably low-leave countries include Belgium, Hungary, Ireland and Latvia.

The results also revealed that Slovenia is closer to the quality of life standards in the former EU15 than in the new Member States, with similar levels of economic deprivation and perception of housing standards. However, Slovenes aged 65 and over report lower subjective well-being and somewhat more material deprivation than younger people. The visit was part of the road show presenting the first results of the Foundation’s European Quality of Life Survey to all 28 countries surveyed. 	 	 More on: www.eurofound.europa.eu/press/presspack/qualityoflife/index.htm Focus on training and employability Workers with permanent employment contracts are more likely to receive training (35%), which is paid for by the employer, than workers on fixed-term contracts (31%) or temporary agency workers (23%), according to Foundation research. As skills and occupational competencies are fundamental to employability, it is thus more difficult for employees with non-permanent work contracts to make the transition to the regular labour market or access new jobs and opportunities. A Foundation conference, organised in collaboration with the Luxembourg EU Presidency, on 21-22 June will explore this relationship between training and employability, focusing on fixed-term and temporary agency workers and the importance of training for work and for social inclusion. More information can be found on www.eurofound.europa.eu/ewco Changes in national collective bargaining systems 	 The decentralisation of collective bargaining processes over the past 15 years might lead to declining levels of coverage, and employee protection and participation, the latest EIRO comparative study argues. The report, which looks at changes in national collective bargaining systems since 1990, shows that two widely different models have emerged. On the one hand is the ‘European model’ with its strong multi-employer bargaining institutions in the former EU15 countries, characterised by its sectoral or intersectoral bargaining and relatively high bargaining coverage. On the other hand is the ‘American model’ with its comparatively weak bargaining institutions, which has the company as the predominant bargaining level and low bargaining coverage. This is present in the UK and to a somewhat less extent the new Member States. The report argues that employee protection and participation is at risk if countries do not develop comprehensive collective bargaining systems and that associations and trade unions thus need a supporting legal and political framework to do so. 	 	 Read the EIRO report online at www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/comparativestudies.html. 	 Promoting productivity and quality of work with workplace innovation 	 Innovation within companies has traditionally focused on product development and cost saving. However, the emergence of a knowledge economy will require employers and employees to develop new organisational work concepts, which are conducive to continuous learning and innovation across the entire organisation. The next EMCC company network seminar, which will be held in Bologna, Italy, on 27-28 June 2005 and will be co-hosted by the Fondazione Instituto per il Lavoro, will explore the relationship between new work organisational models in companies and their impact on productivity levels and human resources developments. EMCC argues that companies must realise that fostering human creativity, as well as investment in human resources and involving employees in strategic business developments, are key elements in guaranteeing sustainable business success.

In this issue: Director's diary Laying the foundations for better monitoring Expanding business activities in manufacturing, retail and transport sectors In brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Expanding business activities in manufacturing, retail and transport sectors The Foundation’s European Restructuring Monitor Quarterly reports continued net job losses across the 27 countries it monitors. More than half of the new jobs announced are located in the new EU Member States. A total of 80,485 new jobs were announced in Europe’s financial media as a result of 146 company restructuring cases reported in the latest European Restructuring Monitor Quarterly for the last quarter of 2005. In total, the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) recorded 360 cases of company restructuring across the area it monitors: the former EU15, the 10 new Member States and two acceding countries, Bulgaria and Romania. Over half of the planned new job creations – 44,126 – related to expanding business activities in the new EU Member States. Poland (18,002), Romania (13,195) and Slovakia (12,929) expect to create the new jobs, mainly in the manufacturing, retail, and transport and communication sectors. During the same period, some 101,698 job cuts were announced. The majority of job losses were as a result of internal restructuring, bankruptcies and closures, with manufacturing, the financial sector, and public administration being most affected. Trend in line with previous quarter The overall number of job losses and job creations due to business restructuring and expansion over the last three months of 2005 are in line with the third quarter of 2005. The highest number of announced restructuring cases are once again located in the UK (54 cases), followed by Poland (46), Germany (45), Romania (28), the Czech Republic (22) and France (21). However, the figure for job losses in Romania doubled in the last three months of 2005, amounting to 16,226 compared with 8,585 job losses in the third quarter. In Germany and the UK, the number of announced job losses remains high at 21,533 and 20,456 respectively. In Poland, the number of job losses has increased during the last quarter of 2005, up from 1,957 to 5,470 announced job losses. A closer look at Sweden The latest European Restructuring Monitory Quarterly also provides a country profile of Sweden, exploring the economic and labour market issues related to company restructuring. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Swedish labour market was only lightly affected by restructuring, with some 1.96 job losses announced per 10,000 employees. The Quarterly also provides an insight into the EU chemicals sector. Read more on the EMCC website	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-march-2006

In brief IN PICTURES Geographical and labour market mobility in Europe During the 2006 European Year of Workers’ Mobility, the Foundation produced several reports and extensive analysis on geographical and labour market mobility in Europe. At the end of the year, the Foundation presented its latest findings to a group of MEPs at the European Parliament in Brussels. From left, Hubert Krieger, Foundation research manager with Willy Buschak, the Foundation’s Deputy Director, MEP Sepp Kusstatscher and Jorma Karppinen, the Foundation’s Director. NEWS IN BRIEF Foundation websites integrated into one site The Foundation’s three specialised websites have been brought under the umbrella of the new look Eurofound website. The revamped site offers improved search facilities using integrated Google search technology, and improved accessibility for users with a disability. The decision to move to one single site came as a result of user testing on the main site which showed significant improvements in usability following the redesign in 2005. During 2006, the web usage of the Foundation’s corporate website Eurofound increased by 36% to 2.6 million users. This increase was in line with the increases experienced by both the European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) at 28% and the European Working Conditions Observatory (EWCO) at 24%. It was, however, the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) that showed the biggest increase of 54%. Access the Foundation’s websites at www.eurofound.europa.eu Foundation research on European Works Councils The primary role of European Works Councils (EWCs) across Europe is that of communication or consultation, as stipulated in the EU Directive, according to Foundation research into the functioning of EWCs over the past 12 years. Its latest work in the area involves case study research and analysis in the four new EU Member States the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. It found that many EWCs in the New Member States are ill-equipped to deal with challenges arising from growing intra-company competitiveness, relocation and restructuring, due to a weak labour relations culture. Download the new report Role of teamwork in work organisation Teamwork is not always a successful form of work organisation, the new study, 'Teamwork and high performance workplace organisation', from the Foundation’s European Working Conditions Observatory (EWCO) reveals. The report set out to find out to what extent teamwork influences the learning environment in an organisation, whether teamwork has developed in any significant shape or form in recent years, and whether teamwork is the key to greater autonomy and job satisfaction. The research found that working in a team often requires a higher work tempo and increased work intensity, with similar levels reported in former EU15 countries and in the new EU Member States. The report does, however, also highlight instances where teamwork has been introduced successfully, bringing greater autonomy to workers, as well as better access to training and a greater chance of learning new things. Read the report Demolishing the myth of the rural idyll People in Europe’s rural areas perceive their quality of life as worse than people in urban areas, the Foundation’s latest analysis of its first European Quality of Life Survey reveals. The new report, ‘First European Quality of Life Survey: urban-rural differences’, explores the concept of quality of life from a rural–urban perspective. It found that rural peoples’ experiences and levels of satisfaction regarding quality of life components such as income, housing, employment and education, access to work, work-life balance, school, family, friends and subjective well-being, are lower than those in urban areas and is not compensated for by the mor pleasant aspects of rural life. In a wider perspective, it also found that EU policy-makers are faced with a major challenge in finding ways to promote stronger economies and quality of life in the poorer areas of rural Europe.

Low levels of migration predicted Most Europeans have no intention of moving to another country or to another region within their own country, according to a forthcoming report by Eurofound which sets out workers’ possible intentions regarding migration. Less than 10% of the working age population intends to move to another region within the next five years and just 5% intends to move to another country. In most – if not all – EU Member States, the public debate is focused on whether or not borders should be opened to allow the free movement of workers, and on the effects of the free movement of workers. Will there be a massive migration of people all over Europe, particularly from new Member States to the former EU15 countries, signalling a geographical shift from eastern to western Europe? Mobility intentions higher in the new EU Member States Eurofound’s forthcoming report, Determinants of international and regional migration intentions in Europe, finds that only 8.6% of the working-age population intends to move to another region within the next five years, while 5.4% intends to move to another country. The report, based on data from a Eurobarometer Survey carried out September 2005, sets out to map the possible plans of Europeans to move to other EU Member States and investigates the main factors behind the intention to migrate. The research shows that mobility intentions are greater in the new Member States – compared to the former EU15 countries – although the variations between countries are large: Poland and the Baltic States display higher levels of migration intentions than other countries. The report concludes that mobility intentions have increased in the new Member States, compared to that in the former EU15 countries, between 2001 and 2005. Educated and qualified persons most likely to migrate The persons most likely to migrate within the EU are the highly educated, the well-qualified and students, according to the report. The potential risk of ‘brain-drain’ from countries like Poland and the Baltic States, since these countries display the highest levels of migration intentions, is relatively high. Given the large populations of some of the countries with relatively high levels of migration intentions, such as Poland, the report states that ‘it is conceivable that large numbers will indeed cross the borders’. Improving labour market opportunities at home Not everybody who expresses the intention to migrate will actually do so. Existing social ties and socio-cultural differences are major barriers to cross-border migration, even if less so in new Member States. Moreover, fertility rates in the new Member States have declined in the past decade, while mortality rates have increased, leading to better labour market opportunities at home. The report suggests this might result in a reduced readiness to migrate to the former EU15 countries. Also, increased foreign direct investment in the new Member States, coupled with regional and structural funds will result in improved working and living conditions and, thereby, reduced incentives to migrate. The report will be published later in the month. Download the report (forthcoming) 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-april-2007-0

Based on secondary analysis of the European Quality of Life Survey, the study highlights what proportion of the population is pessimistic and how many people feel left out of society or complain about the complexity of life in general. Access the report Alienation in Europe (1 = least, 5 = most) Source: European Foundation 2005 News in brief Europe’s farmers earn below the national average Average pay rates in Europe’s agriculture sector are below the overall national average, often considerably so, according to the latest comparative study by the Foundation’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). Charting trends in industrial relations in the agriculture sector, which accounts for 13.3 million people or 6.6% of total employment in Europe, the study finds that industrial relations in the agriculture sector are different than in other sectors, not least because of the high level of self-employment and generally low proportion of employees. Farmers and other workers in this sector are represented by bigger unions or federations, which also represent workers in, for example, the food industry, rather than by sector-specific, free-standing trade unions. The number of agricultural trade union members is usually relatively small and the coverage rate below the national average. Read the complete EIRO study Job creation almost on par with job losses A total of 102,106 job losses were announced as a result of 242 restructuring cases, which occurred across Europe from July to September 2005, the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) Quarterly records. The highest rate of planned job creation is found in the new Member States, where 63,506 out of 99,557 new jobs are related to expanding business activities as a result of 169 restructuring cases. According to the ERM, most of the restructuring cases announced are found in Poland, followed by the UK and Germany; and the third quarter of 2005 shows a decrease of 28% in announced job losses compared to the previous quarter’s figures. The ERM provides news and analysis on company restructuring activities in 27 countries across Europe: the former EU15 countries plus the new Member States, as well as Bulgaria and Romania. More information will be available on the EMCC website Self-employment for restructured workers One out of three European employees is tempted by the idea of running their own business in the next five years, according to a background paper to the company network seminar on business creation organised by the EMCC (see external events). Against the background of widespread company restructuring across Europe, increased emphasis is given to supporting new enterprise creation, in order to mitigate the negative effects for restructured workers. Nevertheless, restructured employees are more likely to be pushed into entrepreneurship by the lack of other options for work rather than by a perceived business opportunity. Currently, only 2% of Europeans are taking steps to start a new business. Read more on this topic Employment initiatives for older workers Keeping older workers in employment is an important objective not only of labour market policies but also of social protection reform. The Foundation has collected and analysed cases of good practice in age management, aimed at improving job opportunities and working conditions for older workers. Each case study describes what initiatives were taken by the organisation and what the results were in the medium to long term.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1338	2007-12-16	UNK	Communiqué, issue 2, 2004	 Articles Less satisfaction with health services in the ACC Moderate pay increases across Europe in 2003 Stable year for industrial relations Advisor bids farewell to the Foundation 71st Administrative Board meeting Promoting EU-level social policy Major differences in collectively agreed holidays across Europe Increase in number of web users Living to work – working to live Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing A number of new national-level agreements with general pay and employment conditions were concluded last year, according to the new EIRO 'Comparative overview of industrial relations in Europe 2003' (available online soon). With regard to the scope and coverage of bargaining, the overall picture seems relatively stable in the EU Member States. The overview examines the key issues covered by collective bargaining – pay, working time, job security, equal opportunities and diversity issues, and training and skills development – as well as legislative developments, the organisation and role of the social partners, industrial action, employee participation, stress at work, undeclared work, and new forms of work. Some EU Member States, and almost all the acceding countries, are reported to be in the process of implementing the EU Directive on information and consultation (no. 2002/14/EC). In addition, the acceding countries have been busy transposing the various pieces of EU legislation relating to employee involvement and participation. The EIRO overview indicates that some countries experienced a relatively high level of industrial action in 2003. Challenges ahead The overview also provides an outlook of the main challenges for European industrial relations in 2004. It looks at changes taking place in the labour market in many EU Member States, among them, the transitional arrangements implemented in the majority of countries in the lead-up to the opening of borders to workers from the 10 new EU Member States on 1 May 2004. Pension reform is another major issue in many countries, as governments and social partners grapple with the problems of an ageing population and falling birth rates. Following on from 2003, pension reform will feature high on the agendas in Austria, Finland, France, Italy, Latvia, Malta and Sweden. Finally, there is likely to be considerable activity in terms of collective bargaining at national and intersectoral levels especially in Belgium, Finland, Greece and Spain. The overview will be available online soon.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-2-2004-2

Low levels of migration predicted Most Europeans have no intention of moving to another country or to another region within their own country, according to a forthcoming report by Eurofound which sets out workers’ possible intentions regarding migration. Less than 10% of the working age population intends to move to another region within the next five years and just 5% intends to move to another country. In most – if not all – EU Member States, the public debate is focused on whether or not borders should be opened to allow the free movement of workers, and on the effects of the free movement of workers. Will there be a massive migration of people all over Europe, particularly from new Member States to the former EU15 countries, signalling a geographical shift from eastern to western Europe? Mobility intentions higher in the new EU Member States Eurofound’s forthcoming report, Determinants of international and regional migration intentions in Europe, finds that only 8.6% of the working-age population intends to move to another region within the next five years, while 5.4% intends to move to another country. The report, based on data from a Eurobarometer Survey carried out September 2005, sets out to map the possible plans of Europeans to move to other EU Member States and investigates the main factors behind the intention to migrate. The research shows that mobility intentions are greater in the new Member States – compared to the former EU15 countries – although the variations between countries are large: Poland and the Baltic States display higher levels of migration intentions than other countries. The report concludes that mobility intentions have increased in the new Member States, compared to that in the former EU15 countries, between 2001 and 2005. Educated and qualified persons most likely to migrate The persons most likely to migrate within the EU are the highly educated, the well-qualified and students, according to the report. The potential risk of ‘brain-drain’ from countries like Poland and the Baltic States, since these countries display the highest levels of migration intentions, is relatively high. Given the large populations of some of the countries with relatively high levels of migration intentions, such as Poland, the report states that ‘it is conceivable that large numbers will indeed cross the borders’. Improving labour market opportunities at home Not everybody who expresses the intention to migrate will actually do so. Existing social ties and socio-cultural differences are major barriers to cross-border migration, even if less so in new Member States. Moreover, fertility rates in the new Member States have declined in the past decade, while mortality rates have increased, leading to better labour market opportunities at home. The report suggests this might result in a reduced readiness to migrate to the former EU15 countries. Also, increased foreign direct investment in the new Member States, coupled with regional and structural funds will result in improved working and living conditions and, thereby, reduced incentives to migrate. The report will be published later in the month. Download the report (forthcoming) 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/eurofound-news-april-2007-0

Director’s diary Reaching out to a wider audience In an attempt to cast its information net over a wider area, Eurofound has recently produced a video that serves the dual purpose of both showcasing its work and highlighting the issue of access into employment for young people. The new video was launched during the second seminar in the Foundation’s seminar series for 2007, on the topic of ‘Youth and work’, held in Madrid last month. As a way of stimulating debate at the seminar, the video gives young people the opportunity to describe their experience of unemployment, job-seeking and work. The video will also be used in communication activities over the coming months and run on Eurofound’s own channel on the online video portal YouTube. For the remainder of 2007, Eurofound continues its work of facilitating debate and discussion. On November 13, Eurofound hosted a high-level seminar examining the impact of globalisation on social dialogue, attended by Finnish President, Tarja Halonen. At the end of November, Eurofound’s roadshow visits Turkey to present research findings to representatives of government and the social partners, and – at the ILO headquarters in Geneva – Eurofound research staff will compare the current state-of-play of Europe’s industrial relations with those of its global competitors. Finally, it was with great sadness that Eurofound learned of the sudden, tragic death of its esteemed colleague Henrik Litske on 24 October in Jamaica. Henrik had worked in Eurofound for the past 19 years, and was committed to Eurofound’s role in achieving better living and working conditions across Europe. He will be greatly missed by all who worked with him, both in Eurofound and in the organisation’s wider tripartite network.

New chairperson of the Foundation's Administrative Board Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Research in brief: Small differences in working time in Europe The average weekly working time in the European Union currently stands at 38.6 hours. In the former EU15 countries plus Norway, the average working week is 0.7 hours shorter than the EU25 average. In the 10 new Member States, the average collectively agreed weekly working time is 0.9 hours longer than the EU25 average. Source: EIRO 2005 News in brief: 2004 - A crucial year for the Foundation The Foundation has published its Annual report 2004, outlining the work carried out to wrap up the four-year work programme 2001-2004. One positive indication of the quality and efficiency of the Foundation’s activities was the 100% disbursement of its budget during 2004 and the clean bill of health provided by the EU court of auditors during its visits throughout the year. The process of integrating the new Member States into the Foundation’s main activities continued throughout the year, with representatives from the new Member States attending as full members of the Administrative Board for the first time in July. Work also continued towards consolidating the steps taken during previous years to include increasing the numbers of these countries within the scope of the monitoring tools and research. The Annual report 2004 is available at www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef0513.htm Women still lag behind men in terms of pay The average gender wage gap in the expanded EU25 stands at 17.5%, according to new figures on collectively agreed wages from the Foundation’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO). In the EU15 and Norway, the gender wage gap averages 17.4%, with its largest differences between pay for men and women in Austria (26%) and it’s smallest in Luxembourg (11%). Among the new Member States, the Czech Republic records the largest difference at 25.1%, and Malta the smallest at 3.6%. Although the differences are still large, the new figures confirm a downward trend. In 2003, the difference in pay between men and women in the former EU15 countries was 18.6% on average, down from 19.2% in 2002 and 20.4% in 2001. The full report is available from EIRO - scroll down for gender data. The future of the telecommunications sector - still in Europe? The most positive future scenario for Europe’s telecom sector depends on stable consumer demand, a level competition and fair regulation, thus giving stable employment opportunities within the sector. However, a more negative scenario is emerging, which risks lay-offs and the loss of business and innovation, based on the continued low demand for new consumer telecom solutions in Europe. In particular, commentators increasingly claim that even if Europe achieves its goal of a fully developed knowledge society, pressure will mount on regulators to intervene to maintain a level marketplace for small and big business in the sector, and for increased consumer rights, risking lay-offs and loss of business. The future of Europe’s telecom sector will be discussed at an EMCC workshop in Montpellier, France, on 26-27 May 2005. Professionals, experts and decision-makers will gather to identify and discuss trends and changes in the sector. The workshop will present the EMCC’s work on the telecom sector, including scenarios, case examples and mapping reports.

Working conditions in Europe – what workers say European workers are satisfied with their working conditions, mainly on account of improved job security, a positive working atmosphere and good opportunities to learn and develop, the first findings of the fourth European Working Conditions Survey indicate. However, working conditions vary considerably between individual Member States, between the ‘old’ and ‘new’ Member States and also between sectors and women and men in different age groups. The services sector continues to grow in importance on the European labour market, employing around 66% of workers in the 25 EU Member States and in Bulgaria and Romania, the two EU acceding countries. The percentage of workers employed in both manufacturing and agriculture continues to decline: manufacturing now accounts for 29% of employment and agriculture just 5%. The proportion of workers who use computers at least a quarter of the time in Europe has increased from 31% in 1991 to 47% in 2005. There is still a large proportion of EU workers who do not use computers in their work at all (44%). In this respect, the difference between workers who never use computers in the former EU15 countries (42%) and the ten new Member States (60%) is striking. ‘These first results from the European Working Conditions survey show that although there is real scope for increasing productivity in Europe, policy-makers are continuously challenged to reach the goals of improved employment levels and quality of work as laid out in the Lisbon criteria,’ says Jorma Karppinen, the Foundation’s Director. ‘A majority of European workers report that work is interesting and offers new opportunities to learn, but access to training has not increased, particularly not among older workers, which indicates a lack of lifelong learning’.	 Snapshot of the European labour market Over the last 15 years, the percentage of workers in high-skilled white-collar occupations has risen from 32% to 38%. Such jobs now account for 40% or more of the jobs in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. By contrast, there have been slight decreases in the proportion of high-skilled blue-collar jobs (from 21% to 17%) and of low-skilled blue-collar jobs (19% to 20%). There are, however, substantial differences in the levels of training that employers provide, ranging from 6%–10% in the ten New Member States and the new EU acceding countries to around 40% in northern Europe. More women in managerial roles but gender pay gap persists The survey shows that while women continue to gain employment in certain categories of occupations (medium- or low-skilled service jobs like clerks, service and sales workers and elementary occupations), the proportion of workers whose immediate boss is a woman has risen consistently over the last 10 years. In the ten new Member States, the proportion of female bosses is higher than in the EU15 (29% compared with 24%). The gender pay gap show no signs of closing, however, with around half of all women in the EU25 countries firmly positioned in the lower third of the overall income scale.	 European working conditions in a 15-year perspective The Foundation’s European working conditions surveys, conducted every five years, have been providing a comparative insight into quality-of-work issues 	 since 1990. The Fourth Working Conditions Survey presents the views of workers on a wide range of issues including work organisation, working time, equal 	 opportunities, training, health and well-being and job satisfaction. The interviews were carried out in late 2005 with nearly 30,000 workers in 31 countries (the 	 EU25, the two acceding countries of Bulgaria and Romania, as well as Croatia, Turkey, Switzerland and Norway). The full report of the Fourth European Working Conditions Survey will be available in mid-February 2007.

IN BRIEF Research in brief Sharp contrast in days’ leave across EU             Source: EIRO Working time developments – 2006 On average, workers in the 12 new Member States work more than two and a half working weeks longer each year than their EU15 counterparts. The total of agreed annual leave and public holidays varies from the upper level of 43 days in Sweden to 26 days in Estonia – a difference of nearly three-and-a-half working weeks. Other ‘high-leave’ countries include Germany (40 days), Italy (39 days), Luxembourg and Denmark (38 days each). ‘Low-leave’ countries include Latvia (27 days), Hungary (28 days) and Ireland (29 days). Download the report News in brief Recognising the benefits of workplace diversity While an increasing number of European companies are realising the potential business benefits of a more diverse workforce, raising awareness of the issue of diversity remains a challenge. Companies must also find the best way of aligning diversity measures with their overall business objectives. These are the conclusions reached at the recent EMCC company network seminar, ‘Managing diversity in the workplace: competitive advantages for companies’, held in the Paris headquarters of Schneider Electric, on 14–15 June. One of the key drivers for the implementation of diversity measures is the need to bring company practice into line with EU legislation introduced to end workplace discrimination on the grounds of age, gender, disability, sexual orientation, belief and ethnicity. However, companies are also competing for skilled workers and markets; increasingly, having a workforce that mirrors the diversity of the marketplace is seen as a competitive advantage. Download more information on the seminar Website statistics under the spotlight As part of the ongoing redesign and update of the website, Eurofound has recently integrated a new tool to better pinpoint which web pages, downloads and services are most popular. Feedback on the changes will be gathered through a user survey to be launched in September which will allow Eurofound to better customise its services for different user groups. As well as having a more unified look, the redesigned site now offers better access to Eurofound’s observatories (EIRO, EWCO and EMCC). The website is the main access point for Eurofound’s publications, all of which can be downloaded free of charge.

Employee financial participation (EFP) – in particular, profit sharing – could make a positive contribution to tackling some of the socioeconomic problems of the NMS; however, the report concludes that the low policy priority currently being given to EFP in these countries indicates that it is unlikely, for the time being, to develop into standard employment practice. EFP, especially employee share ownership schemes, became popular in the NMS during the privatisations of formerly state-owned companies in the early 1990s. Since then, however, recessionary trends and low levels of profits have discouraged the development of EFP schemes.

But what are the obstacles that are still in the way? Are businesses so paralysed by red tape and regulations that they cannot reach their full potential? Or is it that governments have failed to act, perceiving the necessary reforms as potentially unpopular with their electorates? Over 2–3 November of this year, the third Foundation Forum will address these issues and dilemmas, looking at ways of simultaneously increasing competitiveness and reforming the European social model. The Foundation has established this biennial event as an arena for Europe’s political leaders, social partner representatives, business leaders and academics to engage in open debate. One of the Forum’s distinctive – and successful – features is the lack of division between speakers and listeners: all participants are expected to engage in the debate. During June, the Foundation will be active both with its own work and contributing to external events. This month, preparations will be completed for the Foundation’s programme of work for 2007. At the end of June and at the beginning of July, the annual group meetings of representatives from government, employer organisations and trade unions will take place in the Foundation’s premises in Dublin. And Foundation experts will contribute to a conference on Young and old in a changing Europe: The demographic challenge for social care and health, organised by the European Social Network under the auspices of the Austrian EU Presidency, on 19–21 June, in Vienna.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1351	2007-12-16	UNK	Press release, 22 February 2001	 Supporting older workers European governments should reverse their policies on early retirement and promoting policies which support older workers to remain in employment, according to the conclusions of a report - Active Strategies for an Ageing Workforce - published by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in Dublin. European governments and the social partners need to rethink policies for the ageing workforce because of the implications for funding of pensions and early retirement, together with the need for a competitive workforce and an adequate supply of labour. Robert Anderson, research manager at the Foundation, says that in the coming decade the major challenge facing policy makers will be to reverse the trends from exit and exclusion of older workers towards strategies to improve employment prospects of the many different groups in the ageing workforce. 'This will demand multi-disciplinary and co-ordinated approaches involving governments and especially the social partners, as well as workers themselves. There are signs of change and signals about the necessary measures; but significant investment in the ageing workforce requires a fundamental re-orientation of policies, concepts and attitudes,' says Anderson. The promotion of skills, competitiveness, and working capacity of the ageing workforce demands action throughout the whole of working life. Active policy approaches should be preventive, avoiding age-specific employment problems by combating risks in earlier phases of working life. Specific measures such as opportunities for self-employment, are both necessary and effective in improving prospects for unemployed older workers. The report, Active Strategies for an Ageing Workforce, stresses that a systematic co-ordination of measures is required, and achievable, at both enterprise and public policy levels. A close co-ordination of public and workplace policies is warranted; there is also a need to link enterprise initiatives with use of local community services such as social security, education and care. While the report emphasises policy initiatives, it also points out that effective measures depend upon worker involvement from the start, not only as 'experts in their own matters', but also in realising integrated actions at the workplace level. Demographic changes are rapid in both the workplace and the wider community. There should be a means to monitor developments in national, local and workplace policies in the years ahead; this should consider impacts not only for the ageing workforce but also for intergenerational solidarity. Evaluation, though difficult, is essential to inform effective practice and to avoid unintended consequences. Economic evaluation is particularly lacking, and there is a general need for research to support the development and implementation of policies. The report was written by Gerhard Naegele, Professor of Social Gerontology and Director of the Institute of Gerontology at the University of Dortmund.	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/press-release-22-february-2001

In this issue: Director's diary Flexible working arrangements in Europe Embarking on the new work programme In brief Latest events and publications Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Embarking on the new work programme The publication of the Foundation’s Annual Report 2005 marks the end of the first year of the Foundation’s 2005–8 four-year work programme. The highlight of the year was the appointment of the Foundation’s new Director, Jorma Karppinen, who took up office in December. In 2005, the Foundation arranged six national visits under the European Quality of Life roadshow programme, aimed at reaching out to its stakeholders across the EU. Findings from the European Quality of Life survey were presented to government and social partner representatives in Austria, Hungary, Ireland, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden; bilateral discussions were also held with these stakeholders on other current topics in which the Foundation is involved. Through targeted press activities during these visits, up to 7.5 million people were reached through newspapers, TV and radio, bringing the total reached since the roadshows began in 2004 to over 14.3 million people. Flagship publications of 2005 included the online European Industrial Relations Dictionary, comprising 300 cross-referenced terms concerning employment and industrial relations policy, and the EurLIFE online database, which provides easy access to indicators on living conditions in Europe. Indeed, as many as 178 reports were published by the Foundation in 2005, representing an increase of 10% over 2004’s output. When translated publications are included, the total rises to 332. Meanwhile, the Foundation’s websites (Eurofound, EIRO and EMCC), saw a 25% increase in user sessions in 2005 over 2004. One reason for the increase was the redesign of the Eurofound website, which introduced a topic-based information architecture. Monitoring and understanding change Some 40% of recorded cases of business restructuring were of expansion, resulting in new jobs. However, more than 520,000 job losses as a result of restructuring activities were announced, compared to the creation of 370,000 new jobs. These are among the findings of the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM), which was extended to monitor all 25 Member States and the acceding countries Romania and Bulgaria. As many as 31 countries, including all EU25 Member States, participated in late 2005 in fieldwork for the fourth European Working Conditions Survey. Almost 30,000 European workers were interviewed and the scope of the survey was expanded to include place of work, the extent to which work is conducted outside of working hours and the satisfaction derived from work. Preliminary results are expected shortly. Also in 2005, the Foundation put in place a new methodology for information reporting and analysis in the fields of quality of work and employment, industrial relations and restructuring. A new network of researchers, covering 30 countries in Europe, will feed information and news to the Foundation’s three monitoring observatories. Exploring what works As part of its four-year programme framework Changing Europe: Better work, better life, the Foundation explored what works under the four priority themes of: creating more and better employment, balancing work and life, supporting participation and partnership, and building social cohesion. It explored new topics within these broad themes and built on previously gathered knowledge, looking at such issues as: the innovative management of restructuring, new business creation and entrepreneurship after restructuring, an attractive workplace for all, employment initiatives for an ageing workforce, labour supply and job creation in care services, working time options over the life course, new forms of governance in industrial relations, capacity-building for social dialogue in the new EU Member States, labour market mobility and access to social rights for migrants, and the promotion of quality of life in rural Europe. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-may-2006

IN BRIEF News in pictures Agnès Parent-Thirion, research coordinator of Eurofound’s working conditions unit, presents the European Working Conditions Survey report to Members of the European Parliament in the EP Employment working committee, in Brussels, Belgium, on 7 February 2007. At left, Barbara da Roit, Instituto per la ricerca sociale. News in brief Improving the quality of the European Quality of Life Survey Eurofound’s first European Quality of Life Survey 2003 was an important contribution to social research in the EU. It analysed key social policy issues in the 25 countries of the European Union, conducted on a consistent, empirical basis for the first time. More remarkable was the fact that so much was achieved within a limited time and budgetary framework, in comparison to similarly ambitious initiatives. In preparation for the second survey, to be conducted in 2007, Eurofound has cooperated with research experts to assess the 2003 survey exercise and formulate recommendations aimed at improving the overall quality of the survey. Fieldwork for the second European Quality of Life Survey will commence in autumn 2007. Keep track of Eurofound’s work on quality of life Strengthening links with the European Parliament A delegation from the European Parliament’s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs visited the Foundation in early March. Csaba Öry (PPE-DE), Joel Hasse Ferreira (PSE), and Sepp Kusstatscher (Verts/ALE) were briefed on Eurofound’s most recent research initiatives, findings and recommendations during the two-day visit. Hungarian MEP Csaba Öry noted that he has been using Eurofound’s work for over 15 years, both as a member of the European Parliament and as a deputy in the Hungarian Parliament. ‘I have asked and I have always received replies that are worthwhile and valuable to me in my work,’ he said. Sepp Kusstatscher from Austria said that in his recent work on migrant workers he utilised Eurofound’s extensive research and recommendations on the subject. Joel Hasse Ferreira from Portugal expressed the opinion that Eurofound ‘takes good care of its information users’, and is deservedly and regularly reported on in the European media. Europe needs not just more but better mobility Eurofound will publish five new reports on worker mobility in the coming months, dealing with the following topics: job satisfaction and labour market mobility, occupational mobility, workers’ expectations regarding forced or voluntary mobility, international and regional migration intentions, and long-distance mobility. In its work on mobility, Eurofound argues that EU policymakers have to consider three different policy agendas regarding worker mobility. First is the right of freedom of movement for all citizens within EU Member States and the right of ‘non-discriminatory’ access to employment. Second are policies that centre on the Lisbon process and the European Employment Strategy – in these, governments should eliminate obstacles to voluntary mobility and encourage employees to go for more job-to-job and geographical mobility. Finally, there is the challenge to secure on the one hand economic gains resulting from a more efficient distribution of labour and on the other to prevent permanent mass migration of the better educated and younger participants in the labour market. Read more on this topic Social partners and social security systems Social security systems in the EU have traditionally provided a partial insurance against loss of income due to unemployment. In recent years, however, the focus has shifted from protecting the unemployed to activating unemployed people into re-entering the labour market. The recent comparative overview by Eurofound’s European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO) looks at similarities between unemployment benefit systems in Europe and examines the degree of social partner involvement in the different countries. The report covers 13 of the 15 former EU15 Member States, plus six new Member States (Cyprus, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia) and Norway.

EUROFOUND_UNK_1354	2007-12-16	UNK	Communiqué, issue 6, 2004	 Special Foundation Forum 2004 Time to re-think work-life balance: Second Foundation Forum debates key issues Do we need to work longer hours? Time and flexibility Investing in work-life balance – a win-win situation? Work and care - payback for the elderly or investment in a new generation? Keynote round-up An economy or a society: where do we live and work? Articles Focusing firmly on the year ahead Foundation forges closer ties with the EP Disability and social exclusion: Reversing the trend Europe ‘not losing jobs’ due to outsourcing of ICT services Previous issues of Communiqué Contents listing Families are struggling to cope with the conflicting demands of policies, designed to enable Member States to hit the targets outlined in the Lisbon Strategy. One of the core problems, members of the workshop concluded, is that policymakers want more women to enter the labour market, while at the same time they expect them to have more children, to stem Europe’s population decline. Theoretically, it was outlined in the workshop, it should be possible to reconcile these two ostensibly conflicting goals with measures such as parental leave and flexible working arrangements that enable both parents to share childcare and household responsibilities. The reality, however, is that men are not always willing to take part in childcare and household duties. Very few men take parental leave, for example, and an equally small proportion share in the housework: according to the Foundation’s European Quality of Life Survey, only 12% of men do an hour or more of housework each day, compared to 63% of women. 'Flexible working arrangements can help parents juggle the demands of working and looking after a young family, but unless they are taken up by fathers as well, they reinforce the traditional gender stereotype of the mother as the homemaker'. ‘The absence of suitable solutions to this problem, coupled with the paucity of affordable childcare, is likely to exacerbate Europe’s population difficulties,’ another participant commented. ‘Women will continue to reduce their fertility to avoid children interfering with their employment, unless the State provides affordable, good quality alternatives to family care, and ensures that leave and working arrangements do not disadvantage women with young children,’ they added. The workshop concluded that the diversity of the EU does not allow for a one-size-fits-all solution. Account has to be taken, for example, of the historical legacy of welfare regimes in different countries. Overall, members of the workshop agreed, Member States need to take a more holistic and coordinated approach to policy development, where the voices of families are listened to, and where their changing situations and needs are recognised. Workshop 2 key issues According to the Foundation’s Survey on Working and Living Conditions, only 12% of men do an hour or more of housework each day, compared to 63% of women. 	https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/news/news-articles/other/communiqu-issue-6-2004-3
