This document provides a wide-ranging overview of the objectives and activities of the EFCA for next year and on that basis, the allocation of resources granted by the European Union to the agency. The activities planned by the Agency span from the operational coordination of fisheries control across the EU, to tasks relating to the international obligations of the Union, from the assistance to Member States to improve the culture of compliance with the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), to the European Cooperation on Coast Guard function. EFCA\u2019s work also supports the EU in the international dimension of the Common Fisheries Policy, ensuring the compliance to the international provisions, the assistance to the implementation of the Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) Regulation and the direct cooperation with third countries, when requested. The budget for 2022 adopted by the Administrative Board is of EUR 35,6 million. For 2022, EFCA has received additional resources which will provide the Agency with the necessary operational capacity for assisting the Member States and the European Commission in the monitoring, control and surveillance of fisheries as required by CFP, including the measures entailed by the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) with the UK. In addition, this work programme also includes the projects assigned to EFCA by DG MARE and subsidised by grants under the European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF). Through all these activities, EFCA helps achieving the environmental and socio-economic objectives of the CFP. These activities are now also firmly embedded in the European Green Deal through their contribution to sustainable food systems and safeguarding biodiversity as well as by contributing to a Sustainable Blue Economy. \u201cThe Agency has a pivotal role in fostering close cooperation between EU Member States, in the framework of the Monitoring, Control and Surveillance measures of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), contributing to a culture of compliance by fostering an efficient and uniform implementation of the rules\u201d, said Susan Steele, EFCA Executive Director, who was for the first time participating in an Administrative Board meeting since she took office on 1 September 2021. \u00a0 \u00a0 Background EFCA is a European Union agency that promotes the highest common standards for the control, inspection and surveillance under the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). EFCA was established to organise operational coordination activities by the Member States and to assist them to cooperate so as to comply with the rules in order to ensure its effective and uniform application. The added value of the work of the agency lies in its contribution to sustainable fisheries by enhancing compliance with conservation and management measures and to a European-wide level playing field for the fishing industry. The Administrative Board is the governing and controlling body of EFCA. It is composed of six members of the European Commission and one representative per Member State.

It was coordinated by Guarda Nacional Republicana (GNR/PT), within the role of leader, having EFCA and Guardia Civil (ES) as co-leaders, teaming up with EU Agencies (Europol, Eurojust and Frontex) and Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, France, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Sweden). It aimed to contribute to the overall objective of identifying, deterring and disrupting illegal fishing activities and related crimes, led by organised crime groups. For this purpose, EFCA virtual coordination centre was activated. Built on the results achieved and lessons learned during its first edition, organised in 25 September 2019, the second edition, which was supposed to be held in 2020, was postponed to 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Law Enforcement and Fisheries Control communities joined synergies by prioritising multipurpose and multiagency operations. As a testimony of the righteousness of this option, the results speak for themselves: Means put together: 3162 Inspectors (Police, Fisheries, Customs, Agriculture and Health); 260 vehicles; 189 vessels; 18 aerial assets; 2 explosive detection dogs; Main results: 2248 persons, 12 vehicles and 194 vessels checked; 64 crimes detected; 185 administrative infringements; 8 arrests; 9 seizures (10 tubes of plastic explosives, 124 detonating caps and 20 m of wick, 4,5 T of trout, high-tech equipment, computers and documents, 167 illegal fishnets and 20 other illegal tools, 80 kg of fine clams, 31 kg of Norway lobsters, 6 T of sardines, 50 kg of immature fish and 48 kg of Bluefin Tuna). All the participants were urged to foster sector bridging activities, involving Law Enforcement and Fisheries Inspections/Controls, to better understand idiosyncrasies of each community dealing with prevention and fight against illegal fishing activities at EU level, as well as to organise events to share lessons learned and best practises, serving as reference point to improve cooperation. \u201cThe outcomes of this enhanced and coordinated approach with EFCA\u2019s support, involving fisheries control and law enforcement authorities as well as EU Agencies, is a concrete example of the interagency cooperation, attempting to address food security, biodiversity, illegal fishing and related challenges our oceans and seas are facing at the moment.

The Handbook will be made available as an online platform operated by EFCA in close cooperation with EMSA, Frontex and the Commission and updated with Agencies\u2019 and Member States information. . It contains guidelines, recommendations and best practices for the exchange of information on coast guard functions. The three EU agencies, EFCA, EMSA and FRONTEX, work closely together under the inter-agency cooperation framework, with the direct support of the European Commission. They provide enhanced support and assistance to the national authorities performing coast guard functions at national and EU level and, where appropriate, at international level. This handbook is a concrete achievement of the EU cooperation on coast guard functions. The recommendation establishes the handbook as a practical guide for EU civilian and military authorities when carrying out coast guard functions, facilitating close cross-border and cross-sector collaboration among them. The handbook provides a transparent compilation of services and information available through the three agencies. It helps to create synergies and avoid duplication and/or redundancy of effort in the cooperation between Member States and the three agencies, resulting in economies of scale. The handbook focuses on the five inter-agency cooperation areas: information sharing; surveillance and communication services; capacity building; risk analysis; and capacity sharing. The handbook is mainly limited to cross-sector subjects and covers EU Member States and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) States. The main end users of this handbook are the national authorities for each coast guard function in each Member State, aiming to support them when planning and coordinating activities. EFCA is leading the inter-agency cooperation areas for capacity building and risk analysis and will ensure in cooperation with EMSA and Frontex sound implementation of this important recommendation to all coast guard functions community.", "url": "https://www.efca.europa.eu/en/content/pressroom/handbook-european-cooperation-coast-guard-functions-has-been-adopted"}, {"id": "EFCA_NEWS_0006", "date": "2021-06-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Annual European Coast Guard Event 2021 : Use of digital age technologies in Coast Guard functions", "text": "The Annual European Coast Guard Event for 2021 under the theme of \u201cUse of digital age technologies in Coast Guard functions\u201d was held virtually on 29 June 2021. The event was hosted by EFCA at the end of its turn as chair of the tripartite cooperation in support of the European coast guard initiative with the other two maritime EU Agencies, EMSA and Frontex. The Annual Event provides a platform for national authorities, the EU agencies involved and the European Commission to exchange views on matters related to cooperation on coast guard functions. The three agencies took stock of the achievements of the year, with a highlight on the preparation of the EU Coast Guard Handbook and the activities in support of national authorities during 2021. This event allowed to overview the available digital age technologies and discuss their relevance to enhance the \u201cEuropean common maritime situation awareness pictures\u201d and the support to the European Union Member States authorities, in line with the EU Maritime Security Strategy.\u00a0 Particular focus was placed in the implementation of the different EU Coast Guard functions in the context of the post-pandemic era, with affected economic and civil activities in all areas of the maritime domain. The Coronavirus crisis offered the opportunity to embrace technologies to foster an adequate operational response. With a view to benefit from the experience gained during the pandemic crisis, digital tools available are key to combine the shared MS information and the data made available through the EU Agencies. An example would be the development of an \u201cearly bird awareness\u201d based upon a robust geographical information system [GIS]. Exploring the way forward, the maritime agencies and all participating Member States as well as the European Commission assessed the challenges related to the integration of different sources of information, evaluating solutions such as the automated analysis and monitoring of behaviours, as well as the possible assistance of Artificial Intelligence to process and analyse high volume of data. \u00a0 Background: Under the framework of the European Coast Guard Cooperation, Frontex, EFCA and EMSA support Member States with information sharing, surveillance and communication services, capacity building activities as well as risk analysis and information exchange on threats in the maritime domain.

The evaluation covered plaice, in addition to the species already included in the previous analysis, which were cod, Atlantic salmon, herring and sprat. Three different methods were implemented for evaluating compliance with the Landing Obligation, on the basis of Last Haul (LH) inspections, together with the estimates obtained from scientific bodies such as the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), and data compiled by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) of the Commission, and the trends in the number of suspected infringements. Although an overall good compliance level with the LO was observed in pelagic gear herring and sprat fisheries over the study period, the trend in other demersal segments in the Baltic Sea remains preoccupying as a lower level of compliance with the LO appears in the\u00a0fixed and towed gears catching plaice, as well as\u00a0towed gear fleet segments targeting cod during 2017 and 2018. The evaluation concludes by recommending on one hand, the continuation of the LH programme, particularly for certain species and fleet segments combinations, and on the other hand, encouraging alternative methods to monitor compliance with the LO, such as control observers or Remote Electronic Monitoring (REM), which would help deter illegal practices while enhancing the reference data available for evaluating compliance. An updated evaluation covering the period 2019-2020 is already in progress. \u00a0 Background: The Landing Obligation in the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) Discarding is the practice of returning unwanted catches to the sea, either dead or alive, because they are undersized, due to market demand, the fisherman has no quota or because catch composition rules impose this. The reform of the\u00a0Common Fisheries Policy (CFP)\u00a0of 2013 aimed at gradually eliminating the wasteful practice of discarding through the introduction of the landing obligation. This radical change in fisheries management aims to improve fishing behaviour through improvements in selectivity. There are some exemptions to the landing obligation. Catches, from species regulated by catch limits (TACs) or by Minimum Size can still be returned to the sea if they are covered by exemptions such as\u00a0de minimis\u00a0and high survivability (defined in the\u00a0discard plans) or damaged fish (by predators, disease or any other potential contamination). These catches are not counted against the quota, but they must be documented in the logbook. The article 15-13 of the CFP Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 reads:\u00a0 \u201cFor the purpose of monitoring compliance with the landing obligation, Member States shall ensure detailed and accurate documentation of all fishing trips and adequate capacity and means, such as observers, closed-circuit television (CCTV) and others. In doing so, Member States shall respect the principle of efficiency and proportionality.\u201d", "url": "https://www.efca.europa.eu/en/content/pressroom/efca-has-carried-out-evaluation-compliance-landing-obligation-selected-fisheries"}, {"id": "EFCA_NEWS_0011", "date": "2021-05-26", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "New Real Time Closure (RTC) established by Denmark", "text": "Denmark has established a Real Time Closure in their waters of the Skagerrak from the 26 of May 2021 to the 15 of June 2021 at midnight.

The ongoing pandemic obliged the Agency to adapt its business model to the new circumstances. Nevertheless, in close collaboration with the national control authorities, EFCA successfully implemented the legal and operational instruments, through which the Agency carries out the operational coordination with the Member States, namely the six Joint Deployment Plans (JDP) covering all EU sea-basins and international waters under NAFO and NEAFC. In total there were 38 452 inspections (at sea and ashore) reported within the JDPs framework that led to 1787 suspected infringements. In close cooperation with the Commission and the Member States, the Agency carried out important preparatory work to face the possible consequences for fisheries control deriving from Brexit in the North Sea and in the Western Waters of the Atlantic. By the same token, the Agency was able to continue assisting Member States Control Expert Groups, in relevant areas such as risk assessment, compliance evaluation, and specific provisions relating to the Landing Obligation and emerging monitoring technologies. Although the constraints impeded travelling within the Union and to third countries, the Agency continued to offer its support to the Commission to discharge the commitments of the Union in Regional Fisheries Management Organisations, as well as to contribute to the fight against IUU fishing, including through the implementation of the EU funded development project PESCAO in West Africa. For most of the year, EFCA also led the cooperation derived from the Tripartite Working Arrangement between Frontex/EBCGA, EMSA and EFCA, in the framework of the European Cooperation on Coast Guard (EUCG). This also involved the Member States and the Commission. The Agency was notably involved in the delivery of the first version of the Practical Handbook on EUCG, highlighting its key role in the area of Capacity Building and Risk Assessment. The EFCA chartered vessel Lundy Sentinel remained on task during all the year. It provided a significant part of the Union commitment of control and inspection platforms in the North Atlantic Regional Fisheries Management Organisations NAFO and NEAFC. These activities were instrumental to ensure compliance with the rules of the CFP and hence for achieving its environmental, and socio-economic objectives. These activities are now also firmly embedded in the European Green Deal through their contribution to sustainable food systems and safeguarding biodiversity as well as by contributing to a Sustainable Blue Economy.", "url": "https://www.efca.europa.eu/en/content/pressroom/efca-administrative-board-appoints-new-executive-director-and-adopts-agency-annual"}, {"id": "EFCA_NEWS_0017", "date": "2021-03-31", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "New Real Time Closure (RTC) established by Denmark", "text": "Denmark has established a Real Time Closure in the context of\u00a0Commission Regulation (EC) no 724/2010.

EFCA provides capacity building and shares expertise in control operations gained in the EU context. \u00a0 Control technologies are critical to combat IUU fishing. Good examples of this are the use of EFCA Integrated Maritime Services and shared capacities of other EU Agencies, such as Copernicus, as well as Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) operations to enhance fisheries monitoring, control and surveillance. \u00a0 Finally, the EFCA-chartered Lundy Sentinel is the EU Agency-led fisheries inspection platform that, together with other Member States assets, patrols the oceans and seas ensuring a culture of compliance where no illegal fisheries activities are allowed, both in EU and international waters.", "url": "https://www.efca.europa.eu/en/content/pressroom/international-day-fight-against-iuu"}, {"id": "EFCA_NEWS_0029", "date": "2020-05-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EFCA\u00b4s turn to lead the EU Coast Guard cooperation for the next 12 months", "text": "On 28 May 2020 and for one year, the European Fisheries Control Agency took over the rotating chairmanship of the European cooperation on Coast Guard functions, formalised through a Tripartite Working Arrangement between the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA), the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex). The EU cooperation on Coast Guard functions focus on further enhancing operational support to European national authorities carrying out Coast Guard function at national and Union level, and where appropriate, at international level. In particular, during this period, the Practical Handbook on European cooperation on coast guard functions will keep a high profile. This is a key guidance document being developed under the coordination of the three EU agencies in close cooperation with the relevant\u00a0competent national authorities. The handbook consists of a catalogue of services and training opportunities for Member States made possible through the cooperation, best practice guidelines and manuals, a compilation of regional cooperation mechanisms and fact sheets identifying the Member State authorities.

The agency supported the Member States and the European Commission in the implementation of the Control regime of the Common Fisheries Policy through the coordination of the Joint Deployments Plans, the development of specific projects related to assessment of compliance with the landing obligation (LO) and new technologies such as Remote Electronic Monitoring (REM) and the implementation of capacity building operations in the framework of the international dimension. The European Cooperation on Coast Guard functions enhanced EFCA\u2019s capacity to contribute to an effective and uniform implementation of the CFP. During 2019, the agency extended operational cooperation with EUROPOL and EUROJUST in the framework of the European Multidisciplinary Platform against Criminal Threats, in the fight against illegal fishing activities. \u00a0 These were the main highlights: \u00a0 The new Specific Control and Inspection Programme (SCIP) Commission Implementing Decision introduced some new areas and species[1]. Subsequently it was necessary to widen the scope of the Joint Deployment Plans, through which \u00a0\u00a0EFCA provided assistance to Member States and the European Commission in the area of control, inspection and surveillance. In 2019, the cooperative efforts led to 32 381 coordinated inspections, an increase by 20,28% in comparison to 2018 (26 922), and to 1 487 suspected infringements detected, an increase by 108,26% in comparison to 2018 (714). It was carried out without additional EFCA resources. \u00a0 EFCA contributed to the work of the Member States Control Expert Groups (CEG), focusing on the implementation of the Landing Obligation, in particular on the Risk Assessment and Compliance evaluation. In response to a joint request from the North Sea (Scheveningen) and North Western Waters CEGs, EFCA finalised the compliance evaluation exercise focused on the landing obligation and certain key species. The evaluation was performed over the period 2015-2017 for mackerel fisheries and over 2016-2017 for North Sea fisheries targeting cod, plaice and sole and for North-western waters (NWW) fisheries targeting haddock, hake and whiting. Similarly, in response to a request from the Baltic Sea Control Expert Group (BALTFISH), EFCA commenced a compliance evaluation exercise on the LO in the Baltic Sea in 2017 and 2018. Moreover, during the second half of 2019, EFCA worked with CEGs on the development of a REM pilot project template. \u00a0 EFCA used the framework of the JDPs to enhance the standardisation of inspections, in particular, last haul observation procedures during inspection at sea in all EU JDP areas. The publication of specific technical guidelines was another important milestone in EFCA\u2019s work for standardisation. Particularly, in 2019 EFCA finalised and published guidelines on REM and, in collaboration with Member States, on risk assessment and compliance indicators. To level the playing field, the secondment of EU inspectors to multinational inspection teams contributed to the standardisation of inspection procedures among Member States. More than 1000 staff from EU and non EU countries are now registered in the EFCA e-learning platform. \u00a0 EFCA also assisted the European Commission in the framework of international organisations dealing with fisheries, in particular to strengthen operational coordination and compliance in Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (namely, NAFO, NEAFC, ICCAT and GFCM). \u00a0 In accordance with the MEDFISH4EVER Declaration, EFCA continued to cooperate with Member States and third countries partners in the Mediterranean to effectively promote a level playing field in the area. The JDP control activities in the Strait of Sicily were implemented in cooperation with Algeria, Tunisia and Libya. In the Black Sea, EFCA led an initiative in the framework of the interagency cooperation, in order to support Bulgarian and Romanian authorities in their fisheries control activities. \u00a0 In the fight against IUU activities, EFCA assisted the European Commission with the analysis of 378 catch certificates and 122 processing statements for Panama, Ivory Coast, Ecuador, Vietnam and Maldives. \u00a0 In the framework of the five-year EU funded PESCAO project, including a component aiming to improve the fight against Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) fishing activities in Western Africa, EFCA continued to provide technical assistance to the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission (SRFC), the Fisheries Committee for the Western Central Gulf of Guinea (FCWC) and their member countries, in a coordinated manner, using the experience gained in the EU context. A report was drafted on the review of the SRFC and the FCWC member countries\u2019 national legal frameworks related to fisheries control and enforcement. \u00a0 Moreover, in the framework of PESCAO, EFCA organised three national trainings on fisheries control and inspection in the Republic of Guinea, Nigeria and The Gambia and two sub-regional courses for FMC operators were organised in Cabo Verde (for Cabo Verde and Guinea Bissau), and one in Abidjan, for Senegal, Guinea, Mauritania, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Benin and Togo. In addition, the SRFC organised three joint control campaigns during 2019 and EFCA supported all of them.In the framework of the European Coast Guard cooperation, the cooperation with Frontex and EMSA further developed in the area of capacity building with EFCA coordinating the overall drafting process of the Practical Handbook on European Cooperation on Coast Guard Functions. Moreover, EFCA has led the process to coordinate the follow-up by the three agencies of the European Coast Guard Functions Academies Network. Also, EFCA supported the third workshop of the European Coast Guard Functions Forum (ECGFF) on \"Multipurpose Maritime Operations\" (MMO) held in Catania, Sicily, Italy from 3 to 5 June 2019 and participated in the Coastex drill. \u00a0 EFCA\u2019s chartered Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV) was operational for 308 days and provided a robust platform for fisheries inspections leading to a total of 247 inspections and 136 suspected infringements detected. Enhanced capacity sharing with EMSA enabled the EFCA chartered OPV Lundy Sentinel to be upgraded for multipurpose missions; to carry pollution response equipment as well as a Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS).\u00a0 \u00a0 EFCA\u2019s information systems enabled the collection of data from each Member State providing details of their fishing vessels, catches and other such information. Overall, EFCA was sent Electronic Reporting System-logbook data from 4 564 vessels in 15 Member States and Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) data from different vessels, throughout all Member States. The volume of VMS messages received by the EFCA VMS was 39.2 million messages. \u00a0 Through the meetings of its Advisory Board and of the advisory councils remained abreast of the concerns of the stakeholders. The agency made additional efforts to make the European citizens more familiar with their objectives and undertakings.\u00a0 During 2019, EFCA has effectively contributed to the implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and to the European Coast Guard cooperation. The effective implementation of the CFP is a necessary condition for having healthy and sustainable oceans, at the heart of the EU New Green Deal.

The evaluation was performed over the period 2015-2017 for mackerel fisheries and over 2016-2017 for North Sea fisheries targeting cod, plaice and sole and for North-western waters fisheries targeting haddock, hake and whiting. The evaluation implemented up to five different methods for measuring the compliance with the Landing Obligation, also mitigating the low availability of reference data obtained during sea inspections where the catch composition is assessed. The overall results suggest that non-compliance with the LO appears to have been widespread during the evaluation period. Moreover, detection of non-compliance with the Landing Obligation remains difficult when only depending on classical monitoring based on inspections due to the fleeting nature of discards at sea, which may occur at any time of the fishing trip by day and by night. The evaluation concludes that Remote Electronic Monitoring (REM) systems, encompassing Close Circuit Television (CCTV), ensure a continuous observation of the fishing gear and catch processing activities on board the fishing vessels, and would be instrumental in the efficient monitor, control and surveillance of compliance with the Landing Obligation. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Link to the Executive Summaries \u00a0 \u00a0 Background: The Landing Obligation in the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) Discarding is the practice of returning unwanted catches to the sea, either dead or alive, because they are undersized, due to market demand, or because the fisherman has no quota. The reform of the\u00a0Common Fisheries Policy (CFP)\u00a0of 2013 aimed at gradually eliminating the wasteful practice of discarding through the introduction of the landing obligation. This radical change in fisheries management aims to improve fishing behaviour through improvements in selectivity. There are some exemptions to the landing obligation. Catches, from species regulated by catch limits (TACs) or by Minimum Size can still be returned to the sea if they are covered by exemptions such as\u00a0de minimis\u00a0and high survivability (defined in the\u00a0discard plans) or damaged fish (by predators, disease or any other potential contamination). These catches are not counted against the quota, but they must be documented in the logbook. The article 15-13 of the CFP Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 reads: \u201cFor the purpose of monitoring compliance with the landing obligation, Member States shall ensure detailed and accurate documentation of all fishing trips and adequate capacity and means, such as observers, closed-circuit television (CCTV) and others. In doing so, Member States shall respect the principle of efficiency and proportionality.\u201d", "url": "https://www.efca.europa.eu/en/content/pressroom/evaluation-suggests-non-compliance-landing-obligations-certain-fisheries-north-sea"}, {"id": "EFCA_NEWS_0035", "date": "2019-11-20", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EFCA participated to the European Coast Guard Functions Forum (ECGFF)\u00a0plenary conference in Venice", "text": "More than 90 delegates from the European Coast Guard Functions Forum (ECGFF) gathered in Venice for the plenary sessions of the Heads of Coast Guard Functions Organisations.

The priority risks for non-compliance were identified in accordance with these methodologies. In particular, a joint exercise with the Member States on risk assessment of non-compliance with the Landing Obligation; mis-recording of catches and illegal gears was conducted for all areas. \u00a0 In relation to efforts to promote an effective and efficient implementation of the Landing Obligation, EFCA, at the request of the Control Expert Groups and the European Commission, created a Technical Working Group (TWG) focusing on the definition of Remote Electronic Monitoring (REM) systems requirements and technical guidelines to monitor the implementation of the LO across EU waters. \u00a0 Concerning the support to national authorities in coast guard functions, EFCA hosted the first Annual European Coast Guard event in La Toja, Spain. The event brought together the three agencies\u2019 Administrative Board members and related experts to identify potential areas of synergy and future cooperative activities among the agencies in support of Member States performing coast guard functions. The cooperation with the other European agencies EMSA and Frontex to support Member States national authorities carrying out coast guard functions, is reflected in the fact that the EFCA chartered means, when operating in the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea, were also available for multipurpose operations in cooperation with EMSA and Frontex, \u00a0 Regarding the international dimension of the Common Fisheries Policy, EFCA has assisted the European Union in cooperating with developing countries and with international fisheries organisations to help to combat illegal fishing. In 2018, the five-year EU funded development project PESCAO kicked off, including a component aiming at improving the fight against Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) fishing activities in Western Africa, contributing to sustainable fisheries management and the reduction of food insecurity in the region. As part of this project, EFCA provides technical assistance to the Regional Bodies and thirteen countries in the area. \u00a0 Moreover, EFCA assisted the Commission to cooperate with third countries and international organisations dealing with fisheries such as the Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (NAFO, NEAFC, ICCAT and GFCM), to strengthen the operational coordination and compliance.\u00a0 In line with point 40 of the MEDFISH4EVER Declaration, EFCA has continued to cooperate with third countries in the Mediterranean to promote an effective level playing field in the area. The cooperation in the Strait of Sicily involving the Mediterranean Member States was implemented in cooperation with Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt and Algeria. \u00a0The agency coordinated an enhanced cooperation involving Romania and Bulgaria with Ukraine, Turkey and Georgia in the Black Sea. \u00a0 Another important area in EFCA\u2019s work is training, as a capacity building tool. A total of 1,496 inspectors and experts from EU and third countries were trained by EFCA. EFCA through participation in training events and through e-learning. \u00a0 In relation to EFCA\u2019s information systems, these enabled the collection of data from each Member State providing details of their fishing vessels, catches and other such information. Overall, EFCA exchanged Electronic Reporting System-logbook data from 3,557 vessels. The volume of Vessel Monitoring Vessels (VMS) messages exchanged by the EFCA VMS increased by 13.7% from 2017 reaching 34.7 million messages. \u00a0 \"The EFCA granted an effective and robust support to the Member States and the Commission for the implementation of the control regime applying to the Common Fisheries Policy encompassing the fight against IUU fishing, ranging from the coordination of the Joint Deployment Plans to Earth Observation technologies including development of standardised methodologies, training and capacity building.\u00a0 Moreover, the assistance to the Union in the international dimension of the Common Fisheries Policy increased as the cooperation with the EMSA and Frontex in the framework of the EU cooperation on Coast Guard intensified, \u201csaid Pascal Savouret, EFCA Executive Director.", "url": "https://www.efca.europa.eu/en/content/pressroom/efca-administrative-board-adopts-its-annual-report-2018"}, {"id": "EFCA_NEWS_0049", "date": "2019-03-18", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Fisheries Committee for the West Central Gulf of Guinea (FCWC) Extension of deadline for supply contract", "text": "The\u00a0Fisheries Committee for the West Central Gulf of Guinea (FCWC)\u00a0intends to award a supply contract of Equipment for a Regional Fisheries Monitoring, Control and Surveillance Centre (RC MCS) incorporating the pooled data of the FCWC Member States (Benin, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Nigeria and Togo), Third Countries and other parties, from their Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), Automatic Identification Service (AIS) and other sources such as Vessel Traffic Systems (VTS), Earth Satellite Observation (EO) etc.\u00a0The system will be provided at the FCWC Headquarters in Tema, Ghana, with financial assistance from the Project titled \u201cImproved Regional Fisheries Governance in Western Africa (PESCAO)\u2019\u2019, under the 11th\u00a0European Development Fund (EDF).

The implementation of joint deployment plans (JDP) that will shortly cover most EU regulated species in the European Union will remain the core task of the agency and will encompass the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, the Western Waters, the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. The agency will also coordinate the JDPs implementing the Union obligation in the NAFO and NEAFC areas. Moreover, the enforcement of the landing obligation will still be a priority for EFCA as it will keep its commitment and support to the Member States including the assistance to the Regional Control Expert Groups. Further support will be provided through the Capacity Building activities such as training, the harmonisation of inspection procedures, risk management, compliance evaluation and other specific projects. EFCA will maintain its contribution to the assistance to the Union in the international arena. The contribution of the agency to the cooperation project \u2013 PESCAO \u2013 will be the main capacity-building instrument for fighting illegal fishing in West Africa. The EFCA will also maintain its efforts for implementing the commitments made by the European Union the ministerial declarations Medfish4ever and Blacksea4ever in the Mediterranean and Black Sea respectively both in the context of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM). Finally, the delivery of EFCA's tasks in the framework of the Coast Guard function, including fostering collaboration with both FRONTEX and EMSA, will remain high on the Agency's agenda with the cooperation in the agreed main five areas: sharing information, surveillance services, capacity building, risk analysis and capacity sharing. Next year, a practical Handbook on European cooperation on coast guard functions will be drafted. \"The approved document depicts how EFCA\u00b4s operational activities contribute to a European wide level playing field and its significant contribution towards sustainable fisheries by enhancing compliance with existing conservation and management measures,\" said Pascal Savouret, EFCA Executive Director.", "url": "https://www.efca.europa.eu/en/content/pressroom/efca-adopts-its-programming-document-2019-keeping-its-current-commitments-and"}, {"id": "EFCA_NEWS_0056", "date": "2018-10-10", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EFCA celebrates its 10th anniversary in Spain", "text": "The European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) celebrates this week its first decade in Spain in the city of Vigo on 9 October 2018. The EFCA moved its headquarters from Brussels to Spain (Vigo), in July 2008 in accordance with its founding regulation. EFCA\u00b4s primary role is to organise coordination and cooperation between national control and inspection activities so that the rules of the CFP are respected and applied effectively. European Union governments agreed to establish the agency in the 2002 reform as part of the drive to instill a culture of compliance within the fisheries sector across Europe. In April 2005, the Council adopted the founding legislation with Council Regulation (EC) No 768/2005. After its amendment in 2016, the Agency, in cooperation with the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) and the European Maritime Safety Agency, each within its mandate, supports the national authorities carrying out coast guard functions. During this very intense decade, the Agency has proven its European added value and fulfilled the objectives that have guided its work. The added value of the work of the agency lies in its contribution to a European-wide level playing field for the fishing industry so that European obligations are observed by everyone and everyone in the sector is treated equally, wherever they might be operating.Moreover, it contributes towards sustainable fisheries by enhancing compliance with existing conservation and management measures to the benefit of present and future generations. What have been EFCA main milestones during these years? In ten years, EFCA joint deployment plans (JDPs), the legal and operational vehicle through with EFCA organises operational coordination, increased their coverage. In 2019, the JDP may encompass nearly all the regulated EU species, widely covering now commercial species of both demersal and pelagic fisheries in EU and international waters.EFCA has been a service provider to Member States supporting them through training programmes and risk management, pooling assets and intelligence, leading to strategic planning of the control campaigns and ensuring the cost-efficiency in the deployment of means and the control effort. EFCA is a recognised honest broker that can steer discussions and provide a platform for exchange for technical solutions in this ever-evolving landscape of fisheries control. The success of EFCA\u00b4s operational cooperation model, sharing assets and intelligence and with mixed teams of inspectors extended to multipurpose operations in cooperation with Frontex and EMSA in support of national authorities carrying out coast guard functions. Developing risk management processes, compliance monitoring, harmonised inspection procedures, assisting the dialogue with the industry, exploring the feasibility of Remote Electronic Monitoring, and operational concept, as the specific actions have been the building blocks of EFCA support of the Member States and the Commission in the implementation of the landing obligation.\u00a0\u00a0 EFCA has supported the European Commission in its international dimension and especially in its fight against illegal unregulated and undeclared fishing (IUU). The cooperation model that EFCA has initiated for the European Union inspired the European Programme PESCAO in West Africa with a view to reinforce fisheries management and reduce food insecurity in the region with EFCA yielding capacity building and training. A recent pilot project in the Strait of Sicily demonstrated that enhanced cooperation among the Mediterranean actors was achievable that paved the way for the establishment of an international control scheme concretising the political commitments made at the MedFish4ever declaration. A second pilot project has been carried out now in the Black Sea EFCA has provided tangible tools such as the production of manuals (core curriculum) and training programmes that have been crucial for the harmonisation of fisheries control measures, the creation of a level playing field and an increased transparency among the Member States With 68 staff members and their families living in Vigo, EFCA has taken roots in the country and city that hosts it. Every week there are several trainings and workshops organised in EFCA that bring to Vigo experts and officials from all over Europe and third countries. EFCA also takes part in city initiatives that reach out to citizens such as sponsoring a street art mural or organising workshops on ocean sustainability for children at Vigo Sea Fest.

The pilot project coordinated by EFCA, also represents the first tangible result towards the commitment made at the Malta Medfish4ever ministerial declaration, in particular to develop a culture of compliance and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in the area and supporting the GFCM in the development of control systems and where appropriate, Joint Schemes of International Inspection. The Malta Declaration acknowledged that control and inspection are essential elements for the success of conservation and management measures in the Mediterranean. Indeed, this unique basin which provides jobs for over 300 000 people and in which about 90% of assessed stocks are over-exploited, requires that the different states in the area cooperate as fish do not understand about borders. A cooperation between all the basin countries is a precondition for a culture of compliance in the area. The objective of the pilot project was to explore the possibilities for implementing cooperation in the GFCM area among its contracting parties and to highlight the need for an International Control Scheme in the area to ensure compliance and a level playing field for all the fleets operating in international waters. The pilot project aimed at promoting regional cooperation and integrated control measures and providing the tools and experience to GFCM in order to support and enhance their conservation and management measures. It has been implemented on request of the European Commission, in full consultation with Member States and with the involvement of some non EU countries concerned, namely Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia. In the framework of the EU Coastguard cooperation with the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and the European Boarder and Coastguard Agency (FRONTEX), the EFCA has made use of the sharing of assets and information that this synergy provides. The project has focused on the following activities: training, data exchange, the joint inspections at sea and the use of new technologies.\u00a0 At the end of the year, common implementation rules and infringement procedures will be explored. In summary, the following results should be highlighted: Control operations and joint inspections were undertaken in the area from August to September during the period of closure for fishing activities. Two patrol vessels and one aircraft operated by EFCA in cooperation with EMSA and FRONTEX were operative in the area with presence of inspectors from Egypt and Tunisia, and from Member States, as Malta, Greece and Italy. A total of 70 inspections at sea were implemented with around 30% of possible non-compliance cases detected. Exchange of information and a joint coordination was ensured from EFCA during all the operational activities. Three training sessions have been delivered for 34 inspectors and trainers from third countries. \"The pilot project sets a precedent in demonstrating that cooperation is possible among the GFCM contracting parties and shows their will to concretise the political commitments made at the MedFish4ever declaration,\" said Pascal Savouret.", "url": "https://www.efca.europa.eu/en/content/pressroom/positive-results-pilot-project-coordinating-fisheries-control-mediterranean"}, {"id": "EFCA_NEWS_0072", "date": "2017-09-07", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EFCA engaging EMSA\u2019s response vessel for fisheries control in the Mediterranean", "text": "Interagency cooperation between EFCA\u00a0and the European Maritime Safety\u00a0Agency (EMSA) was taken a step further following a request for an inspection vessel by EFCA.

Inter-regional cooperation was also enhanced. EFCA has devoted a special attention to making fisheries controls in Europe more uniform through the development of an e-learning application based upon the Union Inspector Core Curricula (CC) and its involvement in the training of more than 550 inspectors.\u00a0Specific emphasis was also put on the standardisation of the inspection processes related to the monitoring of the landing obligation. 2016 marked the opening of a new chapter for EFCA: its involvement in the European Coast Guard Function.

Sixty years ago, recovering from the tragedy of two world wars, we decided to bond together and rebuild our continent from its ashes. We have built a unique Union with common institutions and strong values, a community of peace, freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law, a major economic power with unparalleled levels of social protection and welfare. European unity started as the dream of a few, it became the hope of the many. Then Europe became one again. Today, we are united and stronger: hundreds of millions of people across Europe benefit from living in an enlarged Union that has overcome the old divides. The European Union is facing unprecedented\u00a0challenges, both global and domestic: regional conflicts, terrorism, growing migratory pressures, protectionism and social and economic inequalities. Together, we are determined to address the challenges of a rapidly changing world and to offer to our citizens both security and new opportunities. We will make the European Union stronger and more resilient, through even greater unity and solidarity amongst us and the respect of common rules. Unity is both a necessity and our free choice. Taken individually, we would be side-lined by global dynamics. Standing together is our best chance to influence them, and to defend our common interests and values. We will act together, at different paces and intensity where necessary, while moving in the same direction, as we have done in the past, in line with the Treaties and keeping the door open to those who want to join later. Our Union is undivided and indivisible. In the ten years to come we want a Union that is safe and secure, prosperous, competitive, sustainable and socially responsible, and with the will and capacity of playing a key role in the world and of shaping globalisation. We want a Union where citizens have new opportunities for cultural and social development and economic growth. We want a Union which remains open to those European countries that respect our values and are committed to promoting them. In these times of change, and aware of the concerns of our citizens, we commit to the Rome Agenda, and pledge to work towards: A safe and secure Europe: a Union where all citizens feel safe and can move freely, where our external borders are secured, with an efficient, responsible and sustainable migration policy, respecting international norms; a Europe determined to fight terrorism and organised crime. A prosperous and sustainable Europe: a Union which creates growth and jobs; a Union where a strong, connected and developing Single Market, embracing technological transformation, and a stable and further strengthened single currency open avenues for growth, cohesion, competitiveness, innovation and exchange, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises; a Union promoting sustained and sustainable growth, through investment, structural reforms and working towards completing the Economic and Monetary Union; a Union where economies converge; a Union where energy is secure and affordable and the environment clean and safe. A social Europe: a Union which, based on sustainable growth, promotes economic and social progress as well as cohesion and convergence, while upholding the integrity of the internal market; a Union taking into account the diversity of national systems and the key role of social partners; a Union which promotes equality between women and men as well as rights and equal opportunities for all; a Union which fights unemployment, discrimination, social exclusion and poverty; a Union where young people receive the best education and training and can study and find jobs across the continent; a Union which preserves our cultural heritage and promotes cultural diversity. A stronger Europe on the global scene: a Union further developing existing partnerships, building new ones and promoting stability and prosperity in its immediate neighbourhood to the east and south, but also in the Middle East and across Africa and globally; a Union ready to take more responsibilities and to assist in creating a more competitive and integrated defence industry; a Union committed to strengthening its common security and defence, also in cooperation and complementarity with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, taking into account national circumstances and legal commitments; a Union engaged in the United Nations and standing for a rules-based multilateral system, proud of its values and protective of its people, promoting free and fair trade and a positive global climate policy. We will pursue these objectives, firm in the belief that Europe's future lies in our own hands and that the European Union is the best instrument to achieve our objectives. We pledge to listen and respond to the concerns expressed by our citizens and will engage with our national parliaments.

The landing obligation (LO) is a provision of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) which forbids fishermen to discard at sea any unwanted catches of these species, including all catches below minimum conservation reference size. The workshop took stock of the first two years of the LO in the Baltic Sea, as well as the reporting obligations and recording of catches, compliance issues, discard data and scientific advice, the current situation and future needs. It also dealt with the main issues encountered, such as the recent introduction of plaice, the handling and storage of catches onboard and their landings, focusing on difficulties.The technical measures and possible ways of reducing unwanted catches, including an overview of the gear trials in the Baltic Sea, were thoroughly discussed by both representatives of the industry and NGOs. The meeting agreed that for the efficient and speedy implementation of the LO, it is necessary to speed up the adoption of the Technical Measures Framework Regulation. Baltfish recognised the promising efforts made by some Baltic Sea Member States to design innovative selective trawl gears which will dramatically reduce catches below minimum conservation reference size. The participants at the meeting noted that a certain discarding level was still prevailing in the Baltic Sea and concluded that any improvements would depend on an increased engagement of the industry as well as the possibility to develop innovative gear. Mr. Hermann Pott, chair of the Baltfish Control Expert Group, declared: \u201cThis joint workshop is a good example of cooperation between the stakeholders and the Member States, with the support of the European Fisheries Control Agency to get closer to the satisfactory implementation of the landing obligation.\u201d", "url": "https://www.efca.europa.eu/en/content/pressroom/joint-workshop-landing-obligation-baltic-sea"}, {"id": "EFCA_NEWS_0097", "date": "2017-02-22", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "The Committee on Fisheries of the European Parliament visit EFCA", "text": "Mr Werner Kuhn, Vice-Chair of the Committee on Fisheries (PECH) of the European Parliament, has visited the European Agency for Fisheries Control (EFCA) for a two-day meeting (20-21 February 2017).

With EFCA\u2019s support, the European Union is much better prepared to reduce unwanted catches for the years ahead. \u00a0 Multiannual work programme 2016-2020 and Annual work programme for 2016 The EFCA\u2019s new Multiannual work programme 2016-2020 and the Annual work programme for 2016 provide a comprehensive perspective of the Agency objectives; priorities and activities for the next years in accordance with its mandate and the ambitions of the Administrative Board.\u00a0 The legal and operational framework of the Joint Deployment Plans (JDP) will continue to be the mainstay of the operational coordination but may be amplified with the new Specific Control and Inspection Programme (SCIP) decision made by the European Commission for Western Waters and the North Sea. The JDP provides the Member States with cooperation opportunities which beyond coordination and the pooling of inspection platforms offer incentives for improving best practices, risk management and harmonization. According to its mandate and the priorities set by its Administrative Board, the EFCA will keep on its effort to assist the Member States and the European Commission in the implementation of the control measures applying to the Landing Obligation as new species will be subject to this requirement in 2016. It will be materialized in the range of support activities mentioned above including training with a specific attention to the Omnibus Regulation. Without prejudice of its commitments within the European Union boundaries, the Agency will support the Union in the international dimension of the Common Fisheries Policy and the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities. The EFCA\u2019 involvement will encompass the support to the European Commission and of the European Union delegation before and during the Regional Fisheries Monitoring Organisation meetings (RFMOs) when requested, the training of third countries and/or RFMOs\u2019 CPCs on Commission\u2019s request, the contribution to capacity building missions in countries with a Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement and the participation to dialogue missions in Third Countries.

The new features require the adaption of the inspection and control regime in order to meet new policy obligations. Within its mandate, the Agency will retain the objectives of achieving a level playing field and a culture of compliance of the Common Fisheries Policy in the most cost-efficient way.\u00a0 These objectives are all the more relevant for the implementation of the new provisions, such as the obligation to land all catches of specific species and to ensure detailed and accurate documentation. In its unique role as facilitator, the Agency will help develop simple and cost effective methods for monitoring and making technical recommendations. Moreover, on the international stage, the European Fisheries Control Agency will cooperate with third countries and RFMOs to strengthen compliance with measures, especially those to combat IUU fishing, in order to ensure that measures adopted by such international organisations are strictly adhered to. 2013 results The European Fisheries Control Agency continued its pivotal role of contributing to an effective and uniform implementation of the current policy by brokering operational coordination and giving assistance to the European Commission and Member States. In order to be perfectly equipped for the new policy, EFCA has been building control capacities, namely the development of a new data management system, to enable electronic control tools to work in the most cost-efficient, consistent and effective way within the European Union. Moreover, in the field of Training at the end of 2013, the first Core Curricula courses Inspection at Sea (handbook and manual) have been completed and circulated to the Member States and the European Commission and will contribute\u00a0 to\u00a0 a more uniform application of the rules and increase the effectiveness of control. Once more this year, the joint deployment plans (JDP) have been the key vehicle through which the agency coordinates control operations. During 2013, all five JDPs of the Agency were successfully implemented. In addition, through the creation of Focus Groups, EFCA devised a cost evaluation model for JDPs operations and drafted guidelines for compliance evaluation. This work is paving the way for enhancing control operations and contributing to compliance assessment in the near future. The move to regional JDPs this year has been conclusive. Against a background of a revised Specific Control and Inspection Programme model, EFCA has made further progress towards the implementation of Regional Control Areas, aligning the way the Agency works with one of the key features of the reformed CFP:\u00a0 regionalisation. \u201cThe Agency is a crucial player for ensuring transparency and effectiveness in the implementation of the policy whilst taking into consideration the views of the fisheries stakeholders represented in its Advisory Board,\u201d said Pascal Savouret, Executive Director of the European Fisheries Control Agency.", "url": "https://www.efca.europa.eu/en/content/pressroom/efca-adopts-its-annual-report-2013"}, {"id": "EFCA_NEWS_0124", "date": "2014-01-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EFCA coordination of new CFP provisions", "text": "The European Fisheries Control Agency organised a seminar which was hosted by Croatia in Dubrovnik on January 15th and 16th 2014.

For the period 2014-2018 period, the European Fisheries Control Agency will be dedicated to supporting the Member States and the Commission in the implementation of the new features of the Common Fisheries Policy in accordance with our core tasks. The main two tasks are the various Joint Deployment Plans, for which we will need to succeed in the evolution towards regional, multispecies and continuous Joint Deployment Plans in force (North Sea, Baltic Sea, Mediterranean Sea, North Atlantic and Western waters), and the support to Member States and the European Commission. This support entails the development and completion of IT projects that ensure the good functioning of data monitoring and networks, training, horizontal support activities to the Member States and the European Commission, and to the new Common Fisheries Policy, in cooperation with third countries and Regional Fisheries Management Organisations on Commission request.

The EFCA seminar for 2013, entitled \u201cCompliance Evaluation\u201d took place in Vigo on 26-27 June 2013. The seminar was attended by representatives from Member States, the European Commission, scientific institutions, RFMO representative and stakeholder representatives (Regional Advisory Councils - RACs). The discussions were organised around the need, methods and process for compliance evaluation. It was recognised that the new CFP would raise new challenges in compliance that would have to be addressed. The seminar agreed to the following statement:\u00a0 On compliance dynamics and fisheries management measures: Compliance dynamics depends on different and interdependent factors such as management measures, control and enforcement policy, industry acceptance of the regulatory framework, economic incentives, level playing field, and degree of involvement of different stakeholders. Different fisheries management measures call for different control and enforcement strategies and thus has implications in terms of costs and compliance levels. Compliance and controllability should be considered both when developing and assessing fisheries management measures and sustainability measures. Increased cooperation between scientific bodies and control authorities on compliance evaluation and compliance dynamics can bring mutual advantages. In addition to control and inspection activities, compliance could be addressed through complementary measures e.g. self-management, sharing of responsibilities and codes of practice in order to promote the commitment of stakeholders, leading to better acceptance of the rules by the industry.\u00a0 On promoting a \u201cresult-based\u201d approach to joint control operations: The risk basis, effectiveness and costs are important considerations when deciding what control strategy should be developed and what control effort should be deployed. Control operations should be informed by a measure of results compliance and level playing field and a measure of costs.\u00a0\u00a0 On methods for compliance evaluation: It is of utmost importance to develop robust, simple and cost-effective methods for the evaluation of compliance levels on a regional / fishery basis. Compliance evaluation methods could be combined into a regional \u201ccompliance index\u201d. In this context, estimation of the level of \u201cunder-recorded\u201d catches may be explored, as the most representative indicator to which different types of non-compliant behaviour ultimately lead.", "url": "https://www.efca.europa.eu/en/content/pressroom/efca-evaluates-compliance"}, {"id": "EFCA_NEWS_0128", "date": "2013-05-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "The control campaign of the blue fin tuna kicks off", "text": "For the sixth year, the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) coordinates the Joint Deployment Plan (JDP) for the Blue Fin Tuna fishery in the Mediterranean Sea and the Eastern Atlantic waters for 2013. Under this JDP, Member States pool their control and inspection means, both material and human, in order to carry out jointly control, inspection and surveillance of fishery activities both at sea and ashore. All these activities are coordinated by a team of national coordinators and EFCA coordinators based in the premises of the EFCA. The joint control, inspection and surveillance activities carried out under the JDP are coordinated by a special Technical Joint Deployment Group (TJDG) consisting of national coordinators and EFCA's own coordinators which is based in the EFCA premises in Vigo during the duration of the fishing campaign. The TJDG decides both the overall inspection and surveillance strategy and issues daily recommendations for control, inspection and surveillance activities by national and EU means, on the basis of the daily data and information received by national enforcement authorities and from ICCAT (International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna). The plan bringing together the European Commission, Member States and the EFCA, counts on the resources of the seven Member States involved in the fishery - Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u201c. Croatia will participate to the JDP from the 1 July 2013, date of its accession to the European Union, and a national expert will participate as observer to the TJDG in June. Inspection and surveillance at sea is carried both in EU waters and international waters and applies to EU and non-EU vessels. In 2013, Member States and the EFCA are mobilising six high seas patrol vessels, twenty two coastal patrol vessels and eleven aerial patrol means to ensure that the management measures of the Bluefin Tuna recovery plan are respected. In total, 179 days of sea activity, 159 days of ashore activity and 184 flight hours are scheduled to take place throughout the campaign. The EFCA also carried out several trainings directed to prepare the EU fisheries inspectors that will be deployed during the campaign. A seminar for national inspector trainers was organized in Split (Croatia) and assistance is being provided to Cyprus, Italy, Malta and France for their national training sessions.EFCA organised additionally a specific training for inspectors deployed during the on-going BFT campaign on board patrol vessels. At its annual meeting (Agadir, November 2012) the ICCAT adopted a recommendation with new provisions for the bluefin tuna Recovery Plan.

Indeed, in the context of the new policy being designed, the EFCA, within its mandate, is ready to contribute to the success of the new CFP and the key features of regionalisation and discard ban and develop the necessary tools. During 2013, while addressing its core tasks coordinating operational control activities in the European Union, the EFCA is focusing on new developments that shall enhance the culture of compliance and level playing field across the fisheries sector in Europe. In this regard, there are particular tools that will allow for new impetus towards this objective, ensuring that there is a level playing field across Europe and that fisheries control is done in the most cost-efficient way: Regional Joint Deployment Plans (JDPs): The Agency applies its budgetary resources towards JDPs as the vehicle through which the Agency organises the deployment of the national human and material means of control and inspection pooled by the Member States. JDPs promote the cost-effective use of human and material resources of Member States in a coordinated way and the Agency has started to extend JDPs to cover regional, multispecies joint deployment plans (NEAFC, NAFO and Pelagic species in Western Waters). EFCA wishes to move to regional, multispecies and permanent fisheries in a very near future. Discard ban control strategies: The measure would be preferably implemented through the regional JDPs, enabling strategic decisions to be taken at steering group level, and then EFCA can help monitor it effectively. Depending on the characteristics of the fishery, different methods could be applied and available tools would be used and tested. Cost-effectiveness and Compliance evaluation Focus Groups: Two focus groups have been set up to evaluate compliance and cost effectiveness in control operations. Core curriculum: The near completion of a core curriculum for the training of the fisheries inspectorate of the Member States for the first time ever will contribute to and apply the Common Fisheries Policy effectively and in a uniform manner. EFCA ICT Systems: They are designed to complement individual national systems. These are unique systems developed by the Agency and made available to Member States to support control of the CFP at the EU level. These electronic tools allow for a continuous real time exchange of data and intelligence, thereby restricting the possibilities for the manipulation of information and helping in limiting non-compliant behaviour. \u201cEFCA model has been successful in improving compliance through the coordination of actions and assets. The 5 year external evaluation of the EFCA confirmed the relevance, efficiency, and effectiveness of its activities,\u201d said Pascal Savouret, EFCA Executive Director. \u201cThe EFCA, in its coordination and assistance role, will be a strong driver of compliance.\u201d", "url": "https://www.efca.europa.eu/en/content/pressroom/tools-develop-culture-compliance-reformed-cfp"}, {"id": "EFCA_NEWS_0130", "date": "2013-03-05", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "The EFCA adopts its Annual Report for 2012", "text": "The EFCA has adopted its annual report for 2012 at the meeting of the Administrative Board held on 5 of March. The annual report comprised all the activities undertaken by the EFCA during that year and marks a consolidation and strengthening of the core activities on which the success of the Agency has been constructed to date. Within its mandate, the EFCA will be deeply involved in the effective implementation of the new rules of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy to be adopted, and in particular the key feature of the regional approach. This will be a year of great challenges in this respect.\u00a0 2012 results During 2012, five JDPs were successfully implemented: Cod fisheries in the North Sea and Western Waters, Cod and salmon fisheries in the Baltic Sea, Pelagic Fisheries in Western Waters, NAFO & NEAFC and Bluefin Tuna in the Mediterranean Sea and Eastern Atlantic Ocean. The EFCA has focused on improving the quality of the cooperation by fully taking on board the move towards the regional control areas.\u00a0 During the last three years, the days of activity of JDPs have been reasonably constant. In 2012 the slight increase of days of activity was followed by a more significant increase of number of inspections at sea. The total number of inspections coordinated in the framework of the JDPs during 2012 is approaching 9,000 in the JDPs coordinated by EFCA. Overall, there has been a decrease in the ratio of suspected infringements detected per inspection made, with the exception for the cod and salmon in the Baltic Sea JDP and pelagic in Western Waters JDP. The Administrative Board decision of creating two focus groups for assessing compliance levels will help EFCA better assess these figures as well as the general trends in compliance with the Common Fisheries Policy in the EU. There have also been advances in the pursuit of a level playing field. Training is a key aspect in this regard and it also contributes to improvements in the quality of the coordination and of the inspections. During 2012, a total number of 295 inspectors from Member States participated in EFCA training actions.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Beyond the regional workshop training actions, the Agency coordinated and facilitated the elaboration of Core Curricula courses for the training of trainers of national fisheries inspectors and Union inspectors. With respect to training workshops in support of regional cooperation, 13 training workshops were organized by the EFCA with Member State officials. The assistance to the Member States and the Commission has been of special importance this year especially in the area of data monitoring and networks. Much progress has been made in the development of the EFCA information management systems with the enhancements of the EFCA Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), the development of the EFCA Electronic recording and Reporting System (ERS) and the definition of the EU Electronic Inspection Report (EIR). Moreover, during the Bluefin Tuna Joint Deployment Campaign, and in close cooperation with the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), a pilot project was set up with regards to Maritime Surveillance. It assessed the added value of enriching the existing global picture of the EFCA-VMS system with additional layers of information with a view to create an integrated maritime picture.\u00a0 Proposed Draft Budget for 2014 The proposed draft budget for 2014 is the same as the final budget for 2013: \u20ac9,216,900. \u201cThe close cooperation between the Member States and the European Commission thanks to the coordinating role of the EFCA has been very fruitful with regard to the promotion of a culture of compliance that can ensure a level playing field and a more effective and uniform application of the Common Fisheries Policy.

The JDP has put all the necessary measures in place to ensure that the EU fishing fleet and fleets from other ICCAT Contracting Parties fully respects the rules not only during the main fishing season for purse seiners but until the end of the campaign. The EFCA will still coordinate the fishery for the remainder of the year.\u00a0 During the JDP for bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean and Eastern Atlantic in 2012 there have been up to 84 days of activity on land carried out, 122 at sea and 168 hours of aerial surveillance. In total, there were 343 inspections carried out. There have been 32 possible non compliances detected up to now. Besides brokering cooperation between Member States, the EFCA has been the catalyser of a maritime surveillance pilot project supported by European interagency cooperation involving EFCA, EMSA FRONTEX and ESA and providing for an integrated maritime picture.

The annual report highlighted all the activities undertaken by the EFCA during that year. The meeting took place following a seminar on the five year independent external evaluation of the EFCA which conclusions have helped the Board in the issuing of recommendations to the European Commission. This General Report has been adopted in the context of the ongoing CFP reform in the year in which the Council and the European Parliament will have their say in the legislative proposal of the Commission. In this framework, the Agency with its facilitator role, brokering operational cooperation between Member States and the Commission and giving assistance to them, is in the best position to make a tangible contribution towards the objectives of EU fisheries control policy: establishing and developing a culture of compliance and a level-playing field.\u00a0 2011 results According to the annual work programme, the four JDPs implemented were the cod fisheries in the North Sea and Western Waters, cod fisheries in Baltic sea, regulated species in NAFO and NEAFC, bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean Sea and Eastern Atlantic Ocean and as for the 5 September 2011, a JDP for Pelagic in Western Waters through the adoption of a Specific Control and Inspection programme by the Commission. In particular, this JDP has been the first regional and multispecies JDP operating in European Union waters, and has the characteristic of being permanent, with continuous exchange of information as well as having full communication of results and intelligence in real time basis. During the last three years, the days of activity of JDPs have been reasonably constant. In 2011, whilst the days of activity remained constant, there was a significant increase of the total number of inspections from last year. The total number of inspections coordinated in the framework of the JDPs during 2011 is approaching 10000 in the JDPs coordinated by the EFCA. It can be observed that the ration of infringements at sea and ashore has been decreasing in the past years. This decrease can be observed against a scenario of increased number of inspections, and the progressive introduction of a risk assessment approach with an increased infringement detection rate for target vessels. Based on this figures, it is difficult to conclude if compliance levels are increasing, as many other factors could be involved in this issue. Yet, this trend is certainly encouraging for all parties involved in fisheries control. One of the key aspects in the promotion of a level playing field is the creation of joint teams of inspectors of different nationalities and the training of inspectors. During 2011, approximately, 1600 man/days were deployed in joint teams and a total of nearly 300 staff members from Member States received training for regional JDPs. In the area of Capacity Building to apply the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy by Member States in a uniform way, the agency has worked in the areas of data monitoring and networks, training and pool capacities.\u00a0 Seminar on the five year independent external evaluation of the EFCA The day before the Administrative Board meeting, a seminar was organised on the five year independent external evaluation of the EFCA.

In fact, joint deployment plans are the vehicle through which the CFCA organises the deployment of national human and material means of control and inspection pooled by Member States, thus ensuring European Added Value in the Union monitoring control and surveillance efforts. During a control operation on the 8th November, for which the French fisheries monitoring centre (FMC) at CROSS A Etel was in charge, the French inspection vessel Themis entered Belgian waters with French European Union inspectors on board, to inspect a Dutch beam trawler. When the inspector approached the vessel, the skipper ran off the warps from the winches dumping the beam trawls on the sea bed. In a coordinated action, the Dutch inspection vessel Barend Biesheuvel went to the location and, as the captain of the fishing vessel was not willing to be cooperative in bringing the gear above the surface, requested the Dutch coastguard vessel Arca to dredge the net; an operation which lasted two days. In addition, Belgium contributed to the operation, by having their fishing patrol vessel Zeehond dredging and finding the first net. As a result of the operation, the inspectors found out the utilisation of \u2018blinders\u2019, illegal gear attachments which obstruct the mesh opening and reduce the selectivity of the net, contravening Commission Regulation EEC 3440/84.

Moreover, it will contribute to a level playing field by implementing regional joint deployment plans based on specific and control and inspection programmes. All in all, these tasks are essential so as to promote sustainable exploitation of marine living resources and Integrated Maritime Policy. The Agency will carry on doing the coordination work it has been doing in important fisheries such as cod in the Baltic Sea and in the North Sea and Western Waters; bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean and Eastern Atlantic, Pelagic in Western Waters and NAFO and NEAFC Regulatory Area. In addition, it will progressively extend this cooperation to regional joint deployment plans based on multispecies, and it will continue to support the fight against IUU fishing. In 2012, the Agency will assist the Commission and Member States in the cooperation with third countries within the JDP areas. In addition, the JDP for pelagic fisheries in Western Waters of the North East Atlantic will continue. It will be the first one carried out in a continuous and permanent manner and applied to a multispecies fishery and will serve as a first experience on the concept of regional joint deployment plans based on multispecies. This approach may also offer synergies for saving on public expenditures of Member States concerned by several Member States. In helping to build the control and inspection capacities of Member States, the Agency will facilitate the elaboration of core curricula for training of national fisheries inspectors, promote the exchange of best practices and develop harmonised standards of inspection. It will also foster Integrated Maritime Surveillance in cooperation with the European Commission, Member States and other EU agencies.

Under this JDP, Member States pool their control and inspection means, both material and human, in order to carry out jointly control, inspection and surveillance of fishery activities both at sea and ashore. All these activities are coordinated by a team of national coordinators based in the premises of the CFCA. The plan bringing together the European Commission, Member States and the CFCA, counts on the resources of the seven Member States involved in the fishery - Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal and Spain \u2013 as well as an EU inspection vessel chartered by the CFCA and covers all stages in the market chain. Inspection and surveillance at sea is carried both in EU waters and international waters and applies to EU and non-EU vessels. Before the first bluefin tuna Joint Deployment Plan in 2008, control, inspection and surveillance activities carried out separately by each of the Member States concerned were not well coordinated and not evenly spread over the different fleets targeting bluefin tuna. Since then, there have been three JDPs in the Mediterranean, with very positive results. In them, national inspectors from Member States involved in the fishery are on duty during all the control campaign. This year, the CFCA will participate with its new EU inspection vessel for the control campaign, the Tyr, which, together with the Member States means, will enhance the inspection activities in the area. The EU offers this vessel, for enhancing cooperation with other Mediterranean states involved in the bluefin tuna fishery. The joint control, inspection and surveillance activities carried out under the JDP are coordinated by a special Technical Joint Deployment Group (TJDG) consisting of national coordinators which is based in the CFCA premises in Vigo as from 1 May 2011 and will remain operational until the end of November. The TJDG is supported by the CFCA's own coordinators. The TJDG decides both the overall inspection and surveillance strategy and issues daily recommendations for control, inspection and surveillance activities by national and EU means, on the basis of the daily data and information received by national enforcement authorities and from ICCAT (International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna), in particular VMS data (Vessel Monitoring System, a satellite based control system) and catch information. In 2011, Member States and the CFCA mobilize 22 vessels and 9 aerial patrol means to ensure that the Blue Fin Tuna recovery plan is respected. In total, 232 days of sea activity, 150 days of ashore activity and 198 flight hours are scheduled to take place throughout the campaign. At its annual meeting (Paris, November 2010) ICCAT adopted a recommendation amending the recovery plan, with a special focus in reinforcing the provisions regarding transfer and caging operations. The European Union is committed to implement the new provisions already throughout the 2011 fishing season. These provisions include testing of an improved methodology to determine the quantities transferred to cages in which bluefin tuna is retained. \"The Joint Deployment Plan ensures a uniform and effective control of all fishing vessels (EU and third country vessels) participating in the bluefin fishery in the Mediterranean. It has also very successful in brokering cooperation between all national services involved in control, inspection and surveillance.

The annual report highlighted all the activities undertaken by the CFCA during that year. Moreover, at the meeting the Board discussed the multiannual work programme for 2012-2016 as well as the annual work programme and draft budget for 2012. This General Report has been adopted a few months before the forthcoming Communication on the Reform of the Common Fisheries Policy by the Commission. The reformed CFP will aim at ensuring a viable fishing sector based on the sustainability of available biological resources. The reformed CFP will then be adopted by the European Parliament and the Council by 2012. New regulations on fisheries control and the fight against Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (so-called \u2018IUU\u2019) have already entered into force last year. Now there is a clear set of rules established to ensure that the law is applied in an equal, efficient and transparent manner. \u201cWith these rules adopted, the focus moves to the implementation by the Member States.

The CFCA also assisted the Member States and the Commission in the application of the EU regulation against IUU fishing. \u2022 Several measures were adopted to enhance the quality and relevance of the control activities and hence ensure that Member States contribute in a satisfactory manner to the success of the Joint Deployment Plans. In this regard, Member States pooled an adequate number of means, a new Regional Risk Analysis was developed to facilitate the long term planning of joint campaigns, and steps have been taken to promote European Added Value at all stages of the JDP cycle (planning, implementation and assessment). \u2022 The total number of inspections coordinated in the framework of the JDPs was more than 7000 in the four areas of operation. \u2022 Approximately 1600 man days were deployed in joint teams; highlighting the cooperation between Member States through the creation of joint teams of inspectors of different nationalities. This is one of the main tools to foster cooperation, increase transparency of activities, exchange best practices and build confidence between the different national authorities. \u2022 Periodically, there have been training seminars for the Community inspectors which work under the Joint Deployment Plans and training activities for the authorities involved in the fight against IUU fishing.

In doing so, the CFCA will continue to undertake its activities around its two main strategic axes: Operational Coordination and Capacity Building. In its multi annual work programme, this means: \u2022 The application of the provisions of the new regulation to prevent the Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing: the CFCA will organise progressively operational coordination between Member States of the national control activities and provide support to the Commission and participate in audits to third countries. \u2022 The extension of the current Joint Deployment Plans to regional control areas based on multispecies (to which end, current legal basis may need to be adapted) and the examination of Regional Control Areas covering all relevant fisheries and activities of the CFP in order to trigger a more cost-effective, rational and complementary joint deployment of human and material resources. \u2022 In the area of Capacity Building, the availability of uniform data on fishing and inspection and surveillance activities on European level and enhanced interoperability of national ICT systems are main priorities for Operational Coordination. The CFCA team will be dedicated to the execution of the tasks listed in the Work Programme. The implementation of these activities will have a significant contribution to the uniformity and effectiveness of control, increased transparency of the control activities and thus to a level playing field for the European fishing industry. \u201cIn times where public expenditure is cut, the CFCA together with the national enforcement services have a common challenge in ensuring cost- effectiveness through enhanced regional cooperation and pooling of means under joint deployment plans (JDP).

The CFCA coordinates training of fishery inspectors in Member States and favours exchange of best practices. To this end it aims at setting up of cooperation with all Member States concerned. The agreement between the CFCA and France is the first of its kind. Uniform and effective application of the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy by Member States is at the heart of the CFCA mission. Indeed, it is of utmost importance that Member State's inspectors are trained in the same way and according to the same high quality standards. The CFCA provides access to the French administration to its web based training collaboration platform promoting remote cooperation between Member State's control experts and trainers and facilitating the exchange of information and expertise between them.

The plan brings together the Commission, Member States and the CFCA, counts on the resources of the seven Member States involved in the fishery - Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal and Spain - and covers all stages in the market chain, including controls at sea, ashore, and at fattening farms. \"Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Malta and Spain join forces by pooling their control means (inspection vessels and aircraft as well as inspectors) under the JDP adopted by the CFCA in order to ensure a uniform and effective control of all fishing vessels (EU and third country vessels) participating in the BFT fishery in the Mediterranean. The EU is a front runner in enhancing control and inspection activities targeting this fishery serving as a good example towards the rest of contracting parties in the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). It is a major contribution to the protection of the bluefin tuna fishery that has been overfished for decades,\" said Harm Koster, Executive Director of the CFCA. The JDP for this fishery is the third of its kind after the experience of the two previous years which have proven the improvement in the control of this fishery through the JDPs. The great novelty this year is that during the purse seiners peak season the CFCA will charter an EU inspection vessel for the control campaign that, together with the Member States means, will enhance the inspection activities in the area. The EU offers this vessel for enhancing cooperation with other Mediterranean states involved in the BFT fishery. Building on the know-how acquired in the previous years, the campaign will be based on a risk analysis process. On another point, training of inspectors in order to improve the quality of the inspections is one of the priorities. The results of the JDP in 2009 have been very positive. The CFCA coordinated joint inspection and control activities involving 11 high seas patrol vessels, 18 coastal patrol vessels and 9 airplanes/helicopters. There were 202 days of control campaign on land, 267 at sea and 218 hours of aerial surveillance and more than 700 hundred inspections were undertaken. Most of these inspections were carried out by joint inspection teams composed of different Member States. It should be noted that the number of apparent infringements detected in 2009 slightly decreased. In addition, an important achievement of the 2009 JDP was the absence of spotting airplanes during the 2009 purse seine season. The joint control, inspection and surveillance activities carried out under the JDP are coordinated by a special Technical Joint Deployment Group (TJDG) which is seated at the CFCA premises in Vigo from 1 April and will remain operational until the end of July, period of the core fishing season. The TJDG is composed of national coordinators designated by the Member States concerned and supported by the CFCA's own coordinators.

Compliance with recovery measures applicable to stocks of cod in the Baltic and North Sea areas, the eastern Atlantic blue fin tuna and regulated species in the NAFO and NEAFC Regulatory Areas have been the focus of the Agency's work in 2009. In particular, six Joint Deployment Plans (JDP's), giving effect to Specific Control and Inspection Programmes adopted by the Commission and RFMO Schemes for joint international inspection and surveillance, have been adopted and implemented by the CFCA. As result, the level of control, inspection and surveillance activities carried out under these JDP's has increased significantly. The CFCA has worked closely together with Member States and the Commission. All joint activities have been planned and implemented on the basis of joint risk analysis, prior training of national inspectors, harmonised inspections, cross boundary control, inspection and surveillance activities and, to a large extent, by teams of inspectors of mixed nationalities. The level of cooperation has been exemplary and the first signs of enhanced compliance levels have been observed notably in the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea. In 2009, the CFCA has initiated also its activities in the area of the fight against IUU activities and in the area of Capacity Building in order to be ready for the priorities set for these activities in the 2010 Work Programme. \u00a0 Mid\u2013term priorities The main priorities in the mid-term are: \u2022 Supporting Member States and the Commission in applying the IUU Regulation. \u2022 Operational coordination of inspection and control for cod in the North and Baltic seas, bluefin tuna, NAFO and NEAFC Regulatory Area, to be extended to Northern Hake, Swordfish and certain pelagics. \u2022 Developing and strengthening the skills, abilities, processes and resources of enforcement authorities for the purpose of uniform and effective application of the rules of the CFP by Member States. \u00a0 Proposed Draft Budget for 2011 The proposed draft budget of the European Union subsidy for the CFCA in 2011 is of 8.85 million Euros (7.28 million of administrative expenditure and 1.57 of operational expenditure).

The work programme caters for the assistance to Member States and the Commission in the implementation of the regulation to prevent IUU fishing throughout the Community in a uniform manner. Moreover, operational coordination of control, inspection and surveillance activities will continue in the already consolidated Joint Deployment Plans (cod in the Baltic Sea, North Sea and Western Waters, bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean and Eastern Atlantic and NAFO and NEAFC RA). The efforts of the CFCA to enhance the capacities of Member States to apply the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy in a uniform and effective manner will be increased in particular in the areas of training of national fisheries inspectors and pooling of data and information. After many years of work to develop effective measures on international level, within the FAO and RFMO's, and at European level, by the Commission, to which I have personally actively contributed, at the first of January 2010, the Council Regulation establishing the Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing enters into force. For this reason, in my capacity as Chairman of the Administrative Board of the CFCA, it is a great pleasure to announce that the fight against IUU fisheries, as an overriding priority, is at the core front of the CFCA Work Programme 2010, ? said Serge Beslier, Chairman of the CFCA Administrative Board. The European Union is well prepared to fight against Illegal Unregulated and Unreported fishing. As from the start of 2010, the CFCA will closely work together with Member States and the Commission in the application of the regulation against Illegal Unregulated and Unreported fisheries (IUU). This piece of legislation will reassure consumers that the fish they eat has been caught legally and that its consumption does not damage marine environment. For the CFCA, the IUU regulation is its main political priority this year. Before the upcoming reform of the Common Fisheries Policy in 2012, the enhanced effective and uniform application by Member States of the new regulatory framework should mark a clear shift towards a culture of compliance at Community level. The CFCA Work Programme has been elaborated having this objective in mind.\u00a0 The 2010 Work Programme provides for: The support to the implementation of the Regulation to prevent the Illegal unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing that will imply important efforts from the CFCA, Member States and the Commission. The priority is recognised inside the Work Programme through a substantial increase in the budget (multiplied by four) and in the dedicated staff that grows from one to five people. Additional needs will be evaluated during next year. The consolidation of the joint deployment plans operating in fisheries where fleets from several Member States exploit shared stocks, particularly those which are outside a safe biological limit and subject to a Specific Control and Inspection Programme adopted by the Commission or to an International Control Scheme (cod in the North Sea and Western Waters, cod in the Baltic Sea and bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean and the Eastern Atlantic, NAFO and NEAFC R.A). Capacity building assists Member States and the Commission in applying the rules of the Common Fisheries policy in a uniform and effective manner, in particular, through the coordination of training of inspectors and facilitating the pooling of data and information relevant to fisheries control, inspection and surveillance. The activities listed in the annual Work Programme of the CFCA are undertaken on a multiannual basis and will have a short/mid term impact on compliance levels. \"Being on cruising speed one year after its relocation to Vigo, the CFCA is ready to take up its duties in assisting Member States and the Commission in the fight against IUU activities. Indeed, we will work hard to fight against illegal fishing in the framework of the new regulation that authorises Member States to ban illegal catches from the Community market.

Moreover, the first draft for the work programme of 2010 and the preliminary draft budget were discussed at the meeting. \u00abWith this new chairmanship, the start-up phase has finished, the first results are there, for the eyes of everyone to see. It is now time to work hard and further building capacities in the Member States to apply in a uniform and effective manner the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy\u00bb said Serge Beslier, Chairman of the CFCA Administrative Board. \u00abThe new control regulatory framework will be essential in deterring fraud and ensuring sustainable fishing, and the Agency will be a main character in ensuring more uniform and effective enforcement by pooling EU and national fisheries control means, monitoring resources and coordinating enforcement activities.\u00bb With limited resources of its own and substantial pooled national resources, the CFCA has carried out a very intense coordination activity that has resulted, with the final figures amounting to 3636 coordinated inspections, including 731 days of joint control campaigns, 181 coordinated aerial surveillance flights and 2597 coordinated sightings in total. All in all, four joint deployment plans have been executed in relation to the cod stocks in the North Sea and adjacent waters, the Baltic Sea, the bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean and the Eastern Atlantic and the regulated stocks in the NAFO R.A, these two last ones were executed for the first time. The JDP for the NEAFC RA was adopted for the first time and preparations started of the activities to be undertaken to combat IUU fishing in 2009, after the adoption of Council Regulation (EC) NO 1005/2008 of 29 September 2008. Overall, the first evaluation of the results from the implementation of the JDPs show a series of positive elements, even though the methodologies, procedures and performance indicators to properly undertake an annual assessment of the effectiveness of each JDP have not yet been adopted. The JDP concept has enhanced cooperation between Member States, not only at sea and in ports, but also at the managerial level.

Finally, when it comes to effectiveness it can be said that the increased number of inspection means available during the campaigns and the cross-border operations has increased the probability of inspection and included an additional surprise moment when inspecting in areas of dense fishing activity. \u00a0 Please find the complete Annual Report for 2008 here.", "url": "https://www.efca.europa.eu/en/content/pressroom/delivering-compliance-assessment-cfca-annual-report-2008"}, {"id": "EFCA_NEWS_0155", "date": "2008-12-23", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Community Fisheries Control Agency discusses the way forward", "text": "From 8 to 10 of July, representatives of 20 Member States, the European Commission and the CFCA have analysed the work carried out so far, discussed on the best practices and set out guidelines for the future.

Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Joe Borg, will inaugurate the new offices at a ceremony to be attended by Spanish Minister of Environment, Marine and Rural Affairs Elena Espinosa, President of the Galician Government Emilio Perez Touri\u00f1o and many prominent personalities in the field of fisheries. The Community Fisheries Control Agency is a cornerstone of the EU's efforts to ensure sustainability in Europe's fisheries sector. Operational since the beginning of 2007, the Agency organises coordination and cooperation between national control and inspection activities, to ensure that the rules of the EU's common fisheries policy are respected and applied effectively. Commissioner Joe Borg commented: \"The Agency's relocation to Vigo marks its coming of age as a vital link in the chain of control and enforcement under the common fisheries policy. The Agency's Joint Deployment Plans have proven their worth in preventing the overfishing of vulnerable stocks, whether it be cod in the Baltic or bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean. As we prepare for a major overhaul of the control mechanisms of the common fisheries policy, the Commission looks forward to building on its strong working relationship with the Agency, and we will actively support any initiative which would make it even more effective.\" The decision to establish the Agency was taken in 2002 as part of the reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP). Its priorities are to contribute to the recovery of depleted stocks, the fight against illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing activities and the reduction of discards. Its main working method is the operational coordination of pooled national means of control, inspection and surveillance, above all through Joint Deployment Plans focusing in particular on fisheries. In this way, the Agency not only strengthens the monitoring and control of CFP rules, but also helps ensure that they are applied uniformly throughout the EU. The Agency also liaises with the stakeholder-led Regional Advisory Councils to secure input from the fisheries sector and other stakeholders into CFP control policy and to promote a culture of compliance. The activities undertaken by the Agency so far include three major coordination tasks, which were launched in 2007 and have continued into this year: coordination of EU control, inspection and surveillance activities in the regulatory area of the North Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO); a Joint Deployment Plan to combat overfishing and save endangered cod stocks in the North Sea by pooling resources (inspectors, control vessels, aircraft, etc.) from seven Member States thereby providing more effective and uniform control of fishing activities in seven control campaigns over a total of more than 100 campaign days; a joint inspection and surveillance campaign in support of the long-term management plan for cod in the Baltic Sea, which deploys resources pooled by the coastal Member States in six campaigns over a total of more than 80 campaign days. In 2008, the Agency launched a Joint Deployment Plan to protect the vulnerable bluefin tuna stocks in the East Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. The decision to locate the Agency in Spain (Vigo) was taken by the Heads of State and Government at a meeting of the European Council in December 2003. The Agency was still based in Brussels, however, when it launched its first annual work programme in 2007. The Agency currently has 41 staff members from 15 EU Member States.

The Agency, still based in Brussels, started its operations by implementing its first annual work programme. With its consolidation, the Agency has been relocated to its seat, at Vigo. \u00a0 About the Agency The Community Fisheries Control Agency is an essential tool for the effective application of the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy, with a view to ensuring the sustainability of Europe's fisheries sector. Proposed in 2002 as part of the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, its main mission is to coordinate the activities of control and inspection of the Member States and the fight against illegal fishing.", "url": "https://www.efca.europa.eu/en/content/pressroom/agency-will-celebrate-its-relocation-vigo-its-new-premises"}, {"id": "EFCA_NEWS_0160", "date": "2008-04-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "The Community Fisheries Control Agency (CFCA) has adopted five Joint Deployment Plans for the year 2009", "text": "With the adoption of five joint deployment plans for the year 2009, the CFCA has started executing the 2009 work programme. Three joint deployment plans (JDPs) will cover the same fisheries as in 2008, the regulated fisheries in the North Atlantic Fisheries Organisation RA and the cod fisheries in the Baltic Sea, North Sea and adjacent areas. In addition, two new JDPs will cover the cod fisheries in Western Waters and the regulated fisheries in waters beyond national fisheries jurisdiction in the North Eastern Atlantic (NEAFC). \"The pooling of resources and information as well as of expertise through these joint deployment plans is a great contribution towards a level playing field'' said Harm Koster, CFCA Executive Director. The joint deployment plans are the vehicle through which the Agency organises operational coordination between Member States. Member States pool the national human and material means of control and inspection under the JDPs whilst the CFCA coordinates the deployment of these means. In Community waters, two criteria have to be met before the JDPs can be established. The fish stocks concerned must be subject to a long-term recovery plan or a multi-annual management plan. In addition, a specific control and enforcement plan, adopted by the Commission, must be in place. The Executive Director of the CFCA adopted these five joint deployment plans in close cooperation with the Member States concerned and the Commission. In the NAFO and NEAFC RA, the Commission has entrusted the Agency with the inspection activities, trough carrying out JDPs both at sea and at landing, which are delivering the international activities of the EU. During 2008, four JDPs were established in the regulated fisheries in the NAFO RA, the cod fisheries in the Baltic Sea, North Sea and adjacent areas as well as the bluefin tuna fisheries in the Mediterranean and Eastern Atlantic. In total, 2787 inspections took place and 241 infringements were detected. In 2009, with a more ambitious work programme, besides the JDPs for these fisheries, two new JDPs have been adopted. The five joint deployment plans adopted have brokered cooperation between 15 Member States working together in the different areas concerned. In particular, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Poland, Finland, Belgium, and the United Kingdom.", "url": "https://www.efca.europa.eu/en/content/pressroom/community-fisheries-control-agency-cfca-has-adopted-five-joint-deployment-plans"}, {"id": "EFCA_NEWS_0161", "date": "2008-03-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "7th Administrative Board meeting", "text": "7th Administrative Board meeting (13 March) On 13 March the Administrative Board of the Community Fisheries Control Agency (CFCA) will hold its 7th meeting. Among the decisions to be taken are changes in the budget and the work programme to cater for the Joint Deployment Plan (JDP) for the recovery of blue fin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. The blue fin tuna JDP is the main new initiative of the CFCA in 2008. It is a joint community project in which Member States, the Commission and the CFCA are working closely together. It will mainly concern Member States with a strong interest in the fishery: Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal and Spain. The JDP will organise and co-ordinate control, inspection and surveillance of the bluefin tuna fishery activities at sea and on land, using resources that have been pooled from the participating Member States. The JDP activities will be co-ordinated by a Technical Joint Deployment Group (TJDG), which will be set up in Brussels on 1 April 2008 and remain there until the end of the year. The Administrative Board will also discuss options for the 2009 work programme of the Agency. The Executive Director has proposed to continue the joint deployment plans for North Sea cod, Baltic Sea cod, blue fin tuna and the joint inspection and surveillance activities adopted under the North-West Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO), with a possible extension to Western Waters and the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Convention area (NEAFC), which are important fishing areas where there is a need for organizing operational cooperation between Member States concerned. The CFCA should also coordinate control and inspection of imports and landings in Community ports of fishery products originating from IUU fishing activities, organise training for fisheries inspectors and start an evaluation of the effectiveness of the joint deployment plans. \u00a0 All staff visit Vigo (14-18 March) The Community Fisheries Control Agency (CFCA) is moving to its seat in the Vigo, Spain, in July 2008. As a preparation for the relocation, all staff of the new agency and their partners will visit Vigo 14-18 March. During this trip the staff will be received, inter alia, by the Xunta de Galicia and the City of Vigo. \u00a0 Background (14 March) The decision to establish an EU Fisheries Control Agency was taken under the 2002 reform of the Common Fisheries Policy to strengthen monitoring and control of EU fisheries measures and to help ensure that they are applied uniformly throughout the EU. The Agency will liaise with the stakeholder-led Regional Advisory Councils to secure input from the fisheries sector and other stakeholders, and to help promote a culture of compliance with EU conservation and management measures throughout the EU. The core activity of the CFCA is operational coordination of pooled national means of control, inspection and surveillance. The Agency currently has 28 staff members from 12 EU Member States. It will be fully staffed (49 staff members) by the end of 2008. Among the achievements of the newly created agency are three major coordination tasks carried out in 2007: Coordination of EU control, inspection and surveillance activities in the regulatory area of the North Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO), a task that previously was ensured by the European Commission. A Joint Deployment Plan for cod stocks in the North Sea, which started in July 2007 and will continue in 2008. The plan is an innovative and coordinated effort to combat over-fishing and save endangered cod stocks in the North Sea. Resources (inspectors, control vessels, aircraft, etc) were pooled by seven Member States and were deployed where they were most needed, to ensure more effective and uniform control of fishing activities. Joint inspection and surveillance campaigns in relation to the long term management plan for cod in the Baltic Sea, which deploy resources that had been pooled by the coastal Member States. The campaigns will continue in 2008.", "url": "https://www.efca.europa.eu/en/content/pressroom/7th-administrative-board-meeting"}, {"id": "EFCA_NEWS_0162", "date": "2007-07-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Member States cooperate on controls to save cod in the North Sea", "text": "Today, the Community Fisheries Control Agency (CFCA) adopted an operational plan for joint multi-national fishery controls in the North Sea and adjacent areas. This marks the start of an innovative and coordinated effort to combat over-fishing and save endangered cod stocks. This joint deployment plan for the North Sea will pool resources (inspectors, control vessels, aircraft, etc), from seven coastal Member States and use them to ensure more effective and uniform control of fishing activities. The plan, which consists of seven cross border inspection and surveillance campaigns, will run until the end of the year.\u00a0 Similar plans will be put in place in the other EU fishing areas.\u00a0 \"I very much welcome this first joint deployment plan under the aegis of the new Community Fisheries Control Agency. Such plans will ensure that available resources are used in the most efficient and effective way. The Member States involved show a very good example of cooperation both among themselves and with the new fisheries control Agency. Such plans will help increase fishermen's confidence and trust in more uniform fisheries control and inspection throughout the Union\"\u009d, commented Joe Borg, European Commissioner for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs. \"The adoption of the first joint deployment plan is a milestone for the Community Fisheries Control Agency. I am pleased that we have been able to coordinate this complex venture during the first six months of our Agency being in operation; and doubly pleased that the Member States have been so willing and able to contribute to our efforts! This gives rise to hopes that the benefits of the plan will stretch far beyond the seven inspection campaigns, to foster more cooperation overall, and further harmonisation of fisheries controls, thus creating a level playing field for fishermen in all EU waters\"\u009d, commented Harm Koster, Executive Director of the CFCA. The joint deployment plan for the North Sea, Kattegat, Skagerrak and the Eastern Channel is the first of its kind. It coordinates the use of resources pooled by seven EU Member States: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The focus of the plan is the monitoring programme for the recovery of cod stocks, which was established in 2005. The inspections and surveillance activities will concentrate on fishing vessels using gear types that are likely to catch cod either as a targeted fishery or as by-catch. There will also be inspections of transport and marketing of cod. Each of the seven joint campaigns will be steered each time by one of the Member State, supported by the CFCA. The inspection teams will be mixed, and the inspection vessels and surveillance aircraft will be pooled from different Member States. Inspection vessels will be able to enter into the fishing zones of another Member State. They will, however, need the consent of that Member State for access to its territorial waters and should carry at least one inspector from the country concerned. The Member States have been requested to give prior consent for access to territorial waters by all inspections vessels and surveillance aircraft that will be used in the different campaigns. Under the Common Fisheries Policy, each Member State is responsible for ensuring the proper application of fisheries measures in its own waters and on its own territory. In response to the need for a level playing field for EU fishermen, and to foster a culture of compliance with fisheries rules, the Community Fisheries Control Agency was established as part of the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) in 2002. Operational since the beginning of 2007, the Agency aims to organise coordination and cooperation between national control and inspection activities, so that the rules of the CFP are respected and applied effectively. The seat of the Agency is in Vigo, Spain. It is provisionally located in Brussels. \u00a0 Questions and answers: the first Joint Deployment Plan Facts and figures about the Joint Deployment Plan for the North Sea and adjacent waters in 2007 Cod in the North Sea and adjacent waters", "url": "https://www.efca.europa.eu/en/content/pressroom/member-states-cooperate-controls-save-cod-north-sea"}, {"id": "EFCA_NEWS_0163", "date": "2007-05-07", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "CFCA launches joint fisheries control scheme with Baltic Sea states", "text": "EU Member States around the Baltic Sea are embarking on a period of intense co-operation in the area of fisheries control and inspection, co-ordinated by the Community Fisheries Control Agency (CFCA). The CFCA has developed a test joint inspection and surveillance scheme for the Baltic Sea cod stocks, with active participation of all eight Member States in the region, to fine-tune the mechanisms for Member State co-operation. Under this new form for cooperation, patrol vessels will enter into waters under the jurisdiction of other Member States to carry out inspections. The results of the tests will be highly relevant in the development of future Joint Deployment Plans.This is the first time that the CFCA coordinates control and inspection activities with Member States in Community waters. The first test campaign will start on 7 May with Denmark as the lead partner. The campaigns are scheduled to continue until the end of the year. \"I am proud that the Agency has been able to pull together this scheme within the first four months of its existence. The Member States have invested a lot of effort in the development of this intensified co-operation, which aims to protect and rebuild the fragile Baltic cod stocks, ensure a level playing field for all fishermen in the area, and make best use of Member States control resources to work towards a culture of compliance. After each test campaign we will assess its strengths and weaknesses together with Member States to fine-tune the following campaigns. We will have a close dialogue with stakeholders through the Regional Advisory Council of the Baltic Sea, to make sure that their views can be taken into account at an early stage, as we develop the blueprints for future Joint Deployment Plans\", commented Mr Harm Koster, Executive Director of the CFCA. The Joint Inspection and Surveillance Scheme (JISS) is designed to deploy resources pooled by Member States (human resources as well as physical means of control and inspections, such as vessels, airplanes and infrastructure). The test campaigns, which will be carried out to identify the most efficient way of pooling resources and avoid unnecessary disruption of fishing activities, will be managed by a lead partner, helped and advised by an experienced coordinator from the CFCA. So far, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Latvia and Germany have been appointed to take the lead for different campaigns, which will be scheduled to take place at difference locations and times depending on the seasonal variations in the fisheries. The joint inspections will be carefully planned to make best use of the resources and to focus on areas with a high concentration of fishing activity at different times during the season, at sea as well as at the landing sites. Obviously, the detailed planning of the test campaigns will not be disclosed beforehand. The multinational nature of the JISS means that a fishing vessel from one Member State, fishing in waters of a second Member State, can be hailed by an inspection vessel from a third Member State and boarded and inspected by Community inspectors from a fourth. For principal and practical reasons, all control and inspection vessels operating in the waters of a particular Member State will carry at least one inspector from that Member State. The development of a JISS by the CFCA for the Baltic Sea cod stocks was decided in October 2006, when the fishing opportunities for Baltic Sea fish stocks were adopted by the Fisheries Council. The JISS can be seen as a forerunner of the future Joint Deployment Plan for the Baltic Sea cod stocks, which will be developed as soon as a specific control and monitoring plan has been adopted by the Commission.", "url": "https://www.efca.europa.eu/en/content/pressroom/cfca-launches-joint-fisheries-control-scheme-baltic-sea-states"}, {"id": "EFCA_NEWS_0164", "date": "2007-03-14", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Meeting of the Administrative Board in Vigo", "text": "Today, the Administrative Board of the Community Fisheries Control Agency held its 5th meeting in Vigo. The main item on the agenda was the adoption of the proposal for a draft budget for the year 2008, which was accompanied by a staffing plan and a document outlining the options for next year's operational work programme. The operational priorities for 2008 are in principle the same as in 2007: Joint Deployment Plans for the North Sea and adjacent areas and the Baltic Sea; coordination of control and inspections of bluefin tuna fisheries as well as involvement in the execution of the Community Action Plan to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fisheries (IUU). The Agency will also coordinate control and inspections in the regulatory areas of the North-west Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) and the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC). The final budget and work programme will be adopted by the Board in October. The preliminary draft budget for 2008 would be substantially increased compared to the one in 2007, due to the increased activity of the newly operational Agency, and the costs of relocation to Vigo and foreseeable contractual services to the Member States at their request and expense.
