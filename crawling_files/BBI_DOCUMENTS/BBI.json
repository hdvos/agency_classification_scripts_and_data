It has been a difficult year for all; however, when looking back, I realise that the creativity, flexibility and resilience of the entire bio-based sector have been exceptional. It was moving to see in the early stages of the pandemic how beneficiaries of BBI JU projects mobilised to help their communities. Making ventilators and providing bio-based hand sanitisers and food to healthcare workers were only some of the many solidarity actions that BBI JU project partners launched throughout the year, on top of their daily project management. Later on, I was happy to see another high-mobilisation example of the sector when BBI JU received a record number of high-quality project proposals for the 2020 Call. This call builds on many years of work that has resulted, among others, in more than 10 flagship biorefineries operating across Europe. Once more, the bio-based industries showed that not even a pandemic can stop our quest to make Europe greener and more sustainable. This letter would not be complete without congratulating my colleagues from the BBI JU Programme Office for their dedication, resilience and motivation throughout this year. Together, we managed to adapt to a remote working environment in practically no time and deliver fully on our annual work plan. Our first virtual Info Day was an unprecedented success, and our five-weeks-long remote evaluation of the 2020 Call ran smoothly and efficiently. I am very fortunate to work with such an inspiring team, and I am personally thankful to every one of its members. I want to thank all you, our stakeholders, for keeping in touch and for counting on us this year. We promise to continue working with the same dedication to deliver the BBI JU mission and vision. For 2021, I wish health and happiness to you and your close ones. May the new year find us all well, wiser and united in our efforts to create a better planet. Warm wishes\u00a0and happy New Year!

Follow-up actions to the recommendations of a BBI JU study on this topic, as well as success stories from the programme\u00a0were presented at the event triggering a discussion on the remaining challenges. Conclusions of the workshop will provide recommendations on how to enhance the participation of the agricultural sector in the bio-based value chains in the coming years and\u00a0in particular with the support of the Horizon Europe research and innovation programme. \u2018The agricultural sector is central to BBI JU. Farmers are key actors of the bio-based industries because they form the first segment of the bio-based value chains by providing sustainable feedstock to biorefineries. They also help to consolidate local bio-based value chains and develop new business models in rural areas leading to an important economic impact\u00a0 - new jobs, alternative income sources and boosted local economies,\u2019 said Philippe Mengal, BBI JU\u2019s Executive Director at the opening of the workshop. Currently about half of the 142 BBI JU-funded projects are using agricultural feedstock. Out of these, 91% are exploiting waste and by-products, and 7% cultivating crops on marginal lands that are not suitable for agriculture. The workshop highlighted a number of successful business models among which the GreenProtein and FIRST2RUN\u00a0projects funded by BBI JU, as well as other examples ranging from turning the winemaking waste into organic fertiliser in Italy, to extracting smart nutrients from legumes in Latvia. Watch how Coldiretti, the biggest farmers\u2019 association in Italy, has contributed to the First2Run project in a strong collaboration with the project\u2019s coordinator Novamont. The workshop participants identified some challenges to overcome in the future, such as difficulties encountered by farmers to join EU-funded projects. They also stressed the need to extend the participation of farmers in the bio-based value chains beyond the supply of biomass. In particular, the need to raise awareness about opportunities for agricultural primary producers and enhance their role in the bio-based value chains, while considering the local particularities and diversity of rural areas was highlighted. BBI JU\u2019s States Representatives Group organised this workshop in collaboration with the Strategic Working Group on Bioeconomy of the Standing Committee on Agricultural Research (SCAR), an advisory body on European agricultural and wider bioeconomy research.

'The BIC platform can accelerate the green recovery in Europe\u2019s rural and regional areas by supporting regions in realising their Smart Specialisation Strategies'\u00a0says\u00a0Dirk Carrez, BIC Executive Director, announcing the platform\u2019s launch. 'The platform enables the bio-based industry and regions to make contact based on common needs, such as an industry\u2019s objective to valorise a bio-based feedstock and its availability in a specific region. By better aligning industrial and regional bio-based investment priorities, the platform seeks to stimulate new bio-based investments and create new, local value chains,'\u00a0he added. Through its partnership with the CoR and other regional organisations, around fifty European regions currently participate in the platform, representing a broad geographical diversity of regions from the north, south, west and the east of Europe. The platform remains open to additional regions to join in the future. Applauding the initiative,\u00a0Apostolos Tzitzikostas, President of the CoR, emphasised the following: 'BIC's new platform is an essential tool in connecting regions with new industrial partners: a sustainable bioeconomy is the green beating heart of the circular economy, a key building block of the European Green Deal, and the activities have to be anchored firmly at regional and local level to foster innovation and optimise the use of biomass. A sustainable and circular bioeconomy contributes to addressing global challenges like climate change, and land and ecosystem degradation. We remain committed to supporting its successful implementation, also for the health of our communities.' The interactive platform enables the bio-based industry and regions to identify and contact their ideal partner for bio-based projects and investments, based on their mutual needs and priorities. For example, regions can highlight their bio-based investment priorities, including Smart Specialisation Strategies, financial incentives available for bio-based investment, the bio-based feedstocks present in their regions, etc. At the same time, the bio-based industries can specify their investment objectives, target market sectors, bio-based feedstocks to valorise, etc. The new platform also makes strides in advancing the EU\u2019s ambitions on regional and rural development. Its realisation is also just a first step in BIC\u2019s ongoing efforts to increase regions\u2019 bio-based activities and their participation in the European bioeconomy.

How can we prevent such a waste of resources, and ensure food security and sustainability across the continent instead? Since 2014, the BBI JU has been contributing to the goals of the EU\u2019s Farm to Fork Strategy by funding projects that make use of food and crop waste, increase the shelf life of products and promote sustainable farming practices. \u00a0 What is the EU\u2019s Farm to Fork Strategy?\u00a0 The European Commission has underlined the importance of a robust and resilient food system for European citizens. The EU\u2019s Farm to Fork Strategy is a comprehensive approach to how food sustainability is valued. The policy emphasises the need to accelerate the transition to a more sustainable food system that preserves biodiversity and has a neutral or positive environmental impact. The strategy addresses the urgent need to reduce the use of chemical and hazardous pesticides and fertilisers with the aim to reverse biodiversity loss, protect human health, and increase animal welfare. The BBI JU-funded projects contribute to several dimensions of the food loss and waste prevention pillar of the strategy. This pillar aims to reduce food waste at the retailer and consumer levels and improve circularity during food production to avoid losses. \u00a0 Making use of food processing waste Today\u2019s farming and food processing generate large amounts of waste. In Europe, around 90 million tonnes of food and 700 million tonnes of crops are wasted every year. Most BBI JU-funded projects are helping to reduce this waste by turning leftovers from agriculture and other agri-food processes into new food and feed ingredients, bio-based materials and products. Moreover, these projects provide new business opportunities for farmers, and many of them aim to deliver products with nutritional value to the food and feed market. As an example, the AgriMax project built two pilot processing plants in Italy and Spain. The project\u2019s team will demonstrate the technical and commercial feasibility of extracting high-value compounds from agricultural and food processing waste. The two plants will focus on processing waste from cereals, olives, potatoes, and tomatoes. They will transform this waste into food products such as edible coatings, agricultural materials, and biodegradable pots. Another interesting BBI JU-funded initiative is the AQUABIOPRO-FIT project. Every year, a vast quantity of waste from fisheries and fish farms are discarded into the sea. The AQUABIOPRO-FIT project is transforming these unused side-streams into rich nutrients and health supplements to boost the performance of athletes, create anti-anxiety and anti-depression remedies, and improve body PH balance and skin health. Preserving food and the planet with innovative sustainable bio-based packaging Keeping food fresh and healthy is key to reducing food waste. But how can we achieve this without polluting the planet with plastic? Several BBI JU-funded projects are bringing innovative and sustainable bio-based packaging solutions to the market. They aim to increase the shelf life of food products and reduce food loss at the producer and consumer levels while providing a sustainable alternative to fossil-based plastics. An interesting material to look at is polyethylene furanoate (PEF), a fully bio-based polyester that is 100% recyclable and displays improved barrier properties compared to ubiquitous polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a traditional material used for food and drink packaging. The BBI JU-funded PEFerence flagship project will establish a unique, industrial-scale and competitive biorefinery that will produce financially viable PEF for various packaging applications such as beverage bottles, as an alternative to traditional aluminium cans and PET bottles. Another project targeting bio-based smart packaging is BIOSMART. Through technical innovations such as intelligent oxygen, CO2, and amine sensing technology to monitor shelf life, the BIOSMART packaging will help preserve food quality while making it compostable and recyclable. These properties are achieved by incorporating barrier coatings, antimicrobials, and antioxidants to preserve the food. Shifting to plant-based protein alternatives Several BBI JU-funded projects are addressing the need to reduce the EU\u2019s dependency on protein imports and provide affordable and sustainable feed production. As example, the SYLFEED project will produce nutritional and sustainable protein from wood residues for the fish feed market, as an alternative to soybean derivatives. It will use underexploited forest and wood waste and bring a competitive source of proteins for fish manufacturers. The BBI JU-funded GreenProtein project has been using around 4,000 tons of agricultural residues per year, such as sugar beet leaves, to produce high-quality food-grade proteins and other ingredients. One of them, dried RuBisCo powder, is ready to be commercialised and enter the production chain as an alternative to egg white preparations or whey protein. Enabling sustainable farming practices European farmers are at the heart of the green transition. The Farm to Fork strategy calls for a change in modern agricultural practices. \u00a0Several BBI JU-funded projects are helping farmers to become more competitive and access sustainable farming products. In the last few years, more and more bio-based fertilisers and solutions for crop protection have appeared on the market. Tested according to EU regulations, they have proved effective in protecting crops and contributing to the greening of farming. Some BBI JU-funded projects are helping to develop bio-based alternatives to pesticides and fertilisers, which are less harmful to the ecosystem. As an example, the B-FERST project is using agricultural waste and side streams to create a new circular and bio-based value chain. The project is developing eight bio-based fertilisers that will improve the sustainability of arable lands. With the aim to provide a cheaper and safer alternative to chemicals-based insecticides, while offering the same efficiency levels, the PHERA project will develop and commercialise bio-based pheromones for crops to boost the production and reduce the negative impact of chemical pesticides on soil and biodiversity.", "url": "https://www.bbi-europe.eu/news/fighting-food-waste-bbi-ju-funded-projects-support-eu-farm-fork-strategy"}, {"id": "BBI_NEWS_0006", "date": "2020-11-10", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "AFTERBIOCHEM launches the construction of a new flagship biorefinery", "text": "On 10\u00a0December 2020, the French company AFYREN starts the construction of its first-of-its-kind, zero-waste and low-carbon biorefinery as part of the BBI JU-funded AFTERBIOCHEM project. The new plant, located in Carling-Saint-Avold, in the Grand Est region of France, will start working in 2022. The new biorefinery is at the core of the AFTERBIOCHEM project, that has received \u20ac20 million of BBI JU funding to develop the first all-in-one chemical platform for transforming the sugar beet industry\u2019s sidestreams into bio-based molecules and derivatives of industrial interest.\u00a0The new plant will bring the process to an industrial scale with a production of 16,000 tonnes of bio-based organic acids.

The new plant will significantly contribute to the economic development of the French Grand Est region, creating nearly 60 direct jobs and up to 200 indirect jobs in the construction and engineering sectors. Additionally, it will reduce pollution, cutting CO2 emissions by three times compared to traditional production methods for carboxylic acids of fossil origin. The production process will be fully circular and sustainable, thanks to the local supply of biomass, the valorisation of industrial by-products and an optimised production process.

The 22 new projects will receive financial support worth \u20ac106 million and bring the total of BBI JU grants to 123. 218 beneficiaries from 27 EU Member States and associated countries will take part in the projects. By developing new bio-based products and increasing resource efficiency, the project consortia will reinforce the bio-based industries sector. Additionally, they will support the European economy in the upcoming years, as they will increase business opportunities and create jobs in both rural and urban areas. The new BBI JU projects will also contribute to reducing greenhouse emissions, thus showing a significant environmental impact. The newly signed projects cover the four strategic orientations defined by the Strategic and Innovation Research Agenda (SIRA). Announcing the start of these new projects, Philippe Mengal, BBI JU\u2019s Executive Director commented: \u2018This year again I am impressed by the quality and the ambition behind the new projects. We can see new areas of the bio-based industries now covered, demonstrating how vital BBI JU is for the development of the sector in the continent. Moreover, it confirms the crucial role the EU bio-based industries can play in the green recovery of Europe.\u2019 Increasing productivity and reducing waste Most of the Call\u2019s funding will support projects improving the bio-based production line, lowering its costs and thus bringing affordable green products to the customer. The projects will also develop innovative bio-based products and recycling solutions for plastics. Nearly \u20ac20 million of the BBI JU funding will go to the construction of biorefineries producing bio-based chemicals for hygiene products, pharmaceuticals and polymers. This is the goal of the AFTERBIOCHEM flagship project, which aims at increasing the efficiency in the use of biomass and reducing the production costs. \u20ac16 million funding will support three projects working on bio-based pesticides that will increase agricultural productivity while protecting the environment. For instance, the PHERA project will use bio-based pheromones to produce and commercialise pest control mechanisms for crops. Three projects selected for a total of \u20ac11.3 million funding will develop new biodegrading solutions to plastic waste, a major threat to the ecosystem. By doing so, they will decrease the amount of non-biodegradable materials discarded in the environment while creating new jobs in the bio-based sector. The new projects will mean new income opportunities for the waste management sector, among others. An example is the RECOVER project, which will improve the biodegradation of plastics to transform them into bio-based raw materials. The production of bio-based ingredients for high-end markets will be upscaled to an industrial level by two new projects receiving a total of \u20ac9 million. One of them is the ALEHOOP project, which will produce bio-based proteins to offer an alternative to meat proteins. See the full list of projects. Supporting the entire green economy, from research to industry The newly granted projects are divided into different types of actions, ranging from research to a full production line: Three Coordination and Support Action projects receiving a total of \u20ac4.5 million of BBI JU funding will address challenges in the bioeconomy to accelerate the market uptake of bio-based products. 12 Research & Innovation Action projects will receive a total of \u20ac50 million to develop new technologies and fill gaps within value chains. Six Demonstration Action projects receiving a total of \u20ac31.8 million will establish demo-scale production facilities in Europe. One Flagship Action project will receive \u20ac19.9 million to build first-of-their-kinds biorefineries in Europe. The BBI JU projects\u00a0receive\u00a0funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation\u00a0programme.

The report confirms the achievements of the BBI JU-funded projects and the Programme Office. It highlights in particular the high impact of the initiative contributing to the objectives of the European Green Deal while developing and strengthening the bio-based industries sector in Europe. Despite the unprecedented challenges triggered by the pandemic in 2020, BBI JU maintained a high level of service to its community and kept on delivering outstanding results. The yearly survey of BBI JU-funded projects shows that they are creating more bio-based materials and products, as well as more industrial interconnections and bio-based value chains than expected, thus strengthening the sector across Europe. The report also offers an analysis of the 2020 Call for proposals. \u2018I am very pleased with the diversity and quality of the 18 projects resulting from this call, which have brought the BBI JU portfolio to 142 projects advancing the European bioeconomy across sectors and regions,\u2019 BBI JU Executive Director Philippe Mengal stated in the foreword of the report. \u2018In these trying times for Europe, more than ever, BBI JU is in the front line to help deliver a green recovery, and together with our community, we are up for the challenge.\u2019 Positive impacts for Europe The BBI JU project portfolio analysis shows how the ongoing projects contribute to the post-pandemic recovery by bringing socio-economic benefits to European citizens. Over 80% of projects are creating new jobs, mainly in rural and coastal areas, while also increasing the competitiveness of the European bio-based sector and bringing new sustainable and healthier products to the market. When it comes to the expected environmental impact, the report highlights how BBI JU-funded projects contribute to the objectives of the European Green Deal and help meeting the EU\u2019s climate targets. For instance, over 50% of ongoing projects anticipate lower greenhouse gas emissions than their fossil-based counterparts, while more than 60% of them contribute to waste reduction, reuse, and recycling. In addition to their objectives, a significant number of BBI JU-funded projects also safeguard and enhance biodiversity.

Fighting domestic waste and plastics pollution\u00a0 How to limit the dispersion of plastics?\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0Zero Pollution\u00a0Action Plan foresees to\u00a0decrease plastics\u00a0pollution by 30%\u00a0by\u00a02030.\u00a0It is also\u00a0aiming to improve water and soil quality by restoring the ecosystems and clearing waste.\u00a0Currently, only\u00a031.1% of the\u00a027 million tons of plastic waste produced\u00a0each year are recyclable, thus\u00a0causing\u00a0a\u00a0tremendous\u00a0negative impact onto the ecosystem.\u00a0Several\u00a0BBI JU funded projects\u00a0are\u00a0fighting\u00a0the plastic pollution\u00a0with innovative bio industrial\u00a0solutions.\u00a0For instance, the\u00a0ENZYCLE\u00a0project\u00a0is\u00a0researching\u00a0new enzymatic processes to treat and recycle plastic residues that could not be recycled before. The\u00a0project\u2019s team\u00a0will select enzymes that can degrade plastics and microplastics\u00a0and\u00a0apply this\u00a0at\u00a0industrial scale to significantly reduce plastic pollution in wastewater and landfill.\u00a0BBI JU funded projects also contribute to soil restoration and protection. For instance,\u00a0RECOVER\u00a0is developing innovative processes to avoid the dispersion of\u00a0biodegradable\u00a0plastics\u00a0used in agriculture.\u00a0The\u00a0project\u2019s\u00a0research team will provide biotechnological solutions, using microorganisms, novel enzymes, earthworms, and insects to degrade conventional plastic packaging and agricultural film waste.\u00a0 A step towards zero waste\u00a0\u00a0 Vast majority of BBI JU projects use leftovers of other production processes, such as side streams of agriculture, food, pulp\u00a0and\u00a0paper industries, thus\u00a0reducing\u00a0waste.\u00a0In addition, some\u00a0projects\u00a0have\u00a0found ways to give value to household\u00a0waste.\u00a0Each year,\u00a0nine\u00a0thousand\u00a0tons of\u00a0nappies, feminine\u00a0hygiene\u00a0products and diapers are thrown,\u00a0landfilled,\u00a0or incinerated across Europe. To reduce the environmental impact of\u00a0such\u00a0waste, the\u00a0EMBRACED\u00a0project\u00a0built\u00a0a first-of-its-kind biorefinery\u00a0in\u00a0Treviso, Italy\u00a0to transform nappies and diapers into new materials\u00a0such as organic fertilisers and packaging films.\u00a0 Reducing the environmental impact of textile\u00a0 Several BBI JU projects aim at developing sustainable bio-based fibres and textiles for different applications, such as sportswear, carpets, fishing, or others. These fibres are eco-designed and have reduced environmental impacts at both the production and end-of-life phases. As example, the\u00a0GLAUKOS\u00a0project will help the textile industry become more circular by increasing the biodegradation rate of materials, while boosting their durability for a long-term of textile products.\u00a0 \u00a0Protecting\u00a0biodiversity\u00a0\u00a0 Some BBI JU-funded projects are contributing to the EU\u2019s biodiversity goals by providing innovative bio-based alternatives to more harmful traditional pesticides and fertilisers. Giving farmers\u00a0sustainable\u00a0alternatives to\u00a0pesticides for crop protection\u00a0\u00a0 Following the\u00a0Xylella\u00a0fastidiosa\u00a0bacteria crisis that has damaged and destroyed entire olive orchards in Southern Europe, the\u00a0BIOVEXO\u00a0project\u00a0is\u00a0working on\u00a0a range of\u00a0biopesticides that will target\u00a0the bacteria\u00a0whilst\u00a0preserving the ecosystem of the orchards.\u00a0BIOVEXO\u00a0will offer producers to switch to\u00a0sustainable alternatives\u00a0of the traditional pesticides\u00a0for an improved environmental\u00a0footprint.\u00a0\u00a0 Chemical-based pesticides are harming biodiversity across Europe. To respond to this issue, the Phera project is working on bio-based pesticides, derived from insect pheromones, that will help prevent environmental damage and preserve large-scale crops from pest. Moreover, Phera will make the pheromones- based products much more affordable for farmers, thus helping to switch to greener farming. Preserving the health of the Europeans\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0Zero Pollution\u00a0Action Plan\u00a0provides\u00a0measures to protect the health of the\u00a0EU citizens.\u00a0While almost\u00a044% of BBI JU projects produce healthier products,\u00a0than their fossil-based equivalents, some of them focus specifically on\u00a0developing\u00a0safer\u00a0solvents\u00a0and chemicals.\u00a0\u00a0 Solvents and chemicals are\u00a0omnipresent in everyday life, from paints to personal care\u00a0items,\u00a0fertilisers,\u00a0and\u00a0cleaning products.\u00a0With the aim to create healthier products, the\u00a0BBI JU-funded\u00a0RESOLVE\u00a0project will\u00a0replace these\u00a0harmful materials by bio-based\u00a0ones.\u00a0The project\u2019s team\u00a0has already synthesised a safer alternative called Cyrene\u2122 (dihydrolevoglucosenone)\u00a0to\u00a0replace NMP, a solvent\u00a0known\u00a0for its toxic impact on the environment and human health.\u00a0The project partners will\u00a0start the production of\u00a0Cyrene\u2122\u00a0in France.\u00a0\u00a0 The BeonNat project is exploiting marginal land in Germany, Romania and Spain as a biomass source to produce bio-based chemicals.

A key objective of the Bio-based Industries Joint Undertaking (BBI JU) is to set up first-of-their-kind biorefineries in Europe that produce competitive, sustainable bio-based materials at a large scale by deploying new technologies and business models and respecting zero waste and cascading approaches. Bio-based products have lower environmental impact than fossil-based ones, as production processes are based on circular use of renewable resources and emit less greenhouse gases. De-risking investments in bio-based industries and connecting production to the market is therefore essential for creating a competitive and sustainable bioeconomy in Europe where economic prosperity goes hand in hand with the protection of the environment. Since 2014, BBI JU has funded flagship biorefineries in Europe, helping to de-risk investments and develop the sector. These projects involve 117 beneficiaries including some SMEs from all over Europe as lead investors, but also attract companies from all over the world that are now investing in the EU. The BBI JU beneficiaries have in total received \u20ac228 million in BBI JU grants, leveraging \u20ac1.3 billion in private investments to support the design and construction of the biorefineries. BBI JU-funded flagship projects have remarkable socio-economic impacts in European regions, as they are creating 3,500 new direct jobs and 10,000 indirect ones, mainly in rural and coastal areas, thus contributing to the revitalisation of these regions. The BBI JU-funded flagship biorefineries were selected for their high replicability potential: the business models developed by each project can be applied in other bio-based industries, thus spurring innovation and boosting the bio-based economy in Europe. Additionally, they support the transition towards a more resource-efficient and sustainable low-carbon economy: by delivering bio-based products that replace fossil-based ones, they save 600 kT of CO2 emissions per year and avoid depleting fossil resources. Achievements of BBI JU-funded flagship projects So far, two BBI JU-funded flagship projects have been concluded. The First2Run project boosted the local economy of Sardinia, in Italy, where it turned arid, marginal lands into a sustainable business and created new jobs. This was achieved building a biorefinery to convert cardoon seeds from these lands into oil that can be used for bio-based products. The biorefinery built by the EXILVA project in Sarpsborg, Norway, produces bio-based microfibrillated cellulose for a wide range of applications including body care products, pharmaceuticals, adhesives, composites, resins, and agricultural chemicals. The project developed a production process that results in fewer CO2 emissions compared to traditional methods and created employment throughout the entire value chain. Expected impacts of other flagship projects Other flagship projects are ongoing and already delivering positive socio-economic and environmental impacts. As example, the LIGNOFLAG project is building a biorefinery transforming agricultural waste into cellulosic bioethanol. The new plant is located in Podari, Romania, where it is creating 1,200 new green jobs and new business opportunities especially for primary producers. The FARMYNG project is developing the world\u2019s first industrial process to convert agri-food sidestreams with mealworms into proteins for animal feed and organic fertiliser. The project is generating employment in Hauts-de-France, a rural region that is facing depopulation while developing a business model that will be replicated in other parts of Europe. \u00a0 ", "url": "https://www.bbi-europe.eu/news/bbi-ju-flagship-projects-how-new-sustainable-business-models-are-boosting-bio-based-industries"}, {"id": "BBI_NEWS_0025", "date": "2021-09-15", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Winners of the BBI JU photo competition announced", "text": "Five winning images\u00a0of the first\u00a0BBI JU\u00a0photo competition\u00a0were announced this week.\u00a0In total,\u00a032\u00a0BBI JU-funded projects\u00a0have entered\u00a0174\u00a0pictures\u00a0in five categories\u00a0of the competition\u00a0with the aim to highlight the\u00a0impacts of the initiative.\u00a0The winners will\u00a0be\u00a0highlighted in the BBI JU communication material and at the EFIB 2021 conference in Vienna,\u00a0Austria.

The report highlights the achievements of BBI JU projects and the Programme Office, in particular in regards to research & innovation activities, calls for project proposals and grant management, as well as support activities, governance and internal control framework. \u00a0\u2018BBI JU was once more confirmed as a high impact initiative that since its inception has already contributed to the future EU Green Deal,\u2019 Philippe Mengal, BBI JU\u2019s Executive Director, stated in his foreword to the document. \u2018The two main positive impacts of BBI JU so far have been the structuring effect in organising the value chains across sectors and the innovation-driven mobilising effect of all key stakeholders.\u2019 The report gives assurance that the research and innovation activities entrusted to the BBI JU have been carried out to the highest standards. Throughout the year, 101 BBI JU grants showed a significant contribution in terms of socio-economic and environmental impact, while maintaining a strong drive for innovative small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and high involvement of the scientific community. 12 finalised projects have outperformed their KPIs. The analysis of the BBI JU project portfolio confirms that they are reducing the energy consumption, improving the land use and water efficiency, as well as developing more sustainable use of natural and existing unused resources. Already over 80% of BBI JU projects anticipate lower GHG emissions compared to fossil-based counterparts, while a vast majority of them contribute to waste reduction and valorisation, reuse and recycling. BBI JU projects are well-balanced in terms of participation - around 35% of BBI JU\u2019s funding goes to SMEs, 31% to large industries and 30% to research organisations and higher education establishments. Overall, the BBI JU funding has generated a leverage effect of over \u20ac2 for each euro spent.

The new partnership between the EU and the Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC) is expected to build on the success of BBI JU while stepping up its contribution to the EU\u2019s climate targets, in line with the European Green Deal. The European Parliament and Council will now study the proposal before adopting its final version towards the end of the year. \u00a0 The European Commission has adopted today a proposal for the Council Regulation establishing nine joint undertakings under Horizon Europe, the EU\u2019s research and innovation framework programme for the 2021-2027 period. The proposal puts forward CBE JU, the Circular Bio-based Europe Joint Undertaking, as a programme building on the achievements of BBI JU. \u2018This is a great day for the European bioeconomy,\u2019 said Philippe Mengal, the Executive Director of BBI JU. \u2018CBE JU will take the success of BBI JU to the next level. It will continue fostering collaboration between the scientific community and industry, and de-risking investments, while placing the sustainability and biodiversity at the heart of every project\u2019. CBE JU is expected to scale up technologies leading to industrial deployment, thus attracting investments and creating jobs, while reaching towards the goals of the Strategic Innovation Research Agenda 2017 (SIRA). In addition, the partnership should involve a wider range of stakeholders including the primary sector, regional authorities and investors to prevent market failures and unsustainable bio-based processes. To deliver on its objectives, it should only fund projects that are respecting principles of circularity, sustainability and planetary boundaries. \u00a0Consequently, CBE is expected to significantly contribute to the EU\u2019s climate targets for 2030, pave the way for climate neutrality by 2050, and advance circular and sustainable production in line with the European Green Deal. Objectives of CBE JU Bio-based industries are considered to be a key enabler of the green transition towards a resilient and environmentally sustainable EU economy. If the current proposal is adopted, CBE will build on the success of BBI JU to enlarge its scope and address technologic, regulatory and market challenges of these industries. CBE JU will develop and expand the sustainable sourcing and conversion of biomass into bio-based products via multiscale biorefineries across sectors and regions in Europe. The partnership will support circular approaches such as the use of biological waste from agriculture, industry and municipal sectors to produce new bio-based products, goods and materials. One of the main CBE\u2019s targets will be investing in R&I across scientific disciplines that support bioeconomy and stimulating its uptake by the industry, thus helping to deploy bio-based innovation at regional scale with the view to revive rural and marginal regions. Sustainability and biodiversity will be placed at the heart of CBE JU. Part of the research efforts will focus on increasing the sustainability of the bio-based industry\u2019s production processes, and a robust monitoring system will be put in place to measure the environmental and socio-economic impact of CBE projects. CBE JU is also expected to engage further with industry and policy stakeholders to contribute to a more coherent, supportive and stable regulatory framework, to raise awareness about the potential of bio-based industries and facilitate its uptake in Europe. Operation of CBE JU CBE JU is designed as a partnership between the European Union represented by the Commission, and the Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC). According to the proposed regulation, both public and private partners are committed to investing in the joint undertaking up to \u20ac2 billion, divided in two equal parts. A robust governance structure will be put in place to plan and supervise the operations of CBE JU, and keeping the governance structure of BBI JU a Programme Office will ensure the implementation of the initiative CBE JU is part of nine institutionalised partnerships proposed for areas where public-private collaboration is needed to reach the objectives and impacts of Horizon Europe Framework Programme. By joining efforts, European partnerships should help speed up new solutions, particularly those that can decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 in line with the European Green Deal targets, and help achieve the green and digital transitions. Next steps The European Parliament and Council will now study the proposal and engage in consultation with the Economic and Social Committee to finalise it.

By replacing fossil-based materials and products with bio-based ones, using local, sustainably sourced feedstock and developing circular production processes, the BBI JU-funded projects have given an important contribution to the green transition in Europe. A new publication takes stock of BBI JU\u2019s achievements and impacts in the 2014-2020 period. BBI JU Executive Director Philippe Mengal commented: \u2018Since 2014, the BBI JU initiative has contributed to enhancing sustainability, while boosting the local economies across Europe with new investments and jobs. BBI JU funding has mobilised the relevant actors of the sector, from producers and research organisations to small businesses and large companies. The successor of BBI JU, the new Circular Bio-based Europe Joint Undertaking, is expected to take these achievements to the next level and place sustainability at the heart of the initiative.\u2019 What are the main achievements of the BBI JU and BBI-JU funded projects? Investing in green industries: BBI JU\u2019s financial contribution to projects has reached \u20ac822 million, with each invested euro triggering \u20ac2.8 of private investments. Supporting researchers and businesses across Europe: 142 projects and 1,055 beneficiaries from 39 countries have received BBI JU funding. 40% of BBI JU beneficiaries are SMEs and 25% universities and research centres. Together they receive nearly 70% of BBI JU funding. Developing sustainable innovations: 18 finalised projects have already delivered 33 new bio-based value chains, 24 new materials and 17 products with an equal or overall better performance than their fossil-based counterparts. Boosting local economies: Most BBI JU-funded projects have diversified the local economies by creating new skilled jobs and alternative income sources, in particular in rural and coastal areas. The first 14 BBI JU-funded flagship biorefineries will generate more than 3,500 direct and 10,000 indirect jobs. Focusing on sustainability: All feedstock used in BBI JU-funded projects must be sustainably sourced in Europe and not compete with food production. Nearly 100% of it is waste and by-products of the agri-food industry, forestry and aquaculture. In combination with circular production processes, this will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enrich biodiversity across Europe.

This\u00a0paper\u00a0shows the immediate and the mid to long-term impacts of the bio-based industries on the EU's\u00a0green recovery. The sector positively contributes to environmental, economic and social challenges by sustainably processing domestic renewable feedstock from agriculture, forestry and fisheries, as well as residues, bio-waste and recycled carbon emissions, in state-of-the-art biorefineries to provide bio-based solutions for our customers and consumers. The position paper highlights three main areas of contribution: 1. Bio-based industries accelerate the economic recovery With about\u00a0700 billion EUR turnover and 3.6 million people employed, the bio-based industries are helping to alleviate the impact of the crisis by keeping essential services running and maintaining green jobs. BIC members reacted quickly and effectively to assist governments and health authorities to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. This included the provision of much-needed supplies such as food and feed ingredients, (compostable) packaging, hand sanitisers, masks, tissues and energy from renewable feedstock. 2. Bio-based industries are key for realising the EU's Green Deal The advantage of the bioeconomy lies in the fact that through integrated and innovative circular operations food, feed, bio-based products and materials, services and energy can be produced. The bio-based industries help to reduce Europe\u2019s dependency on fossil-based resources, sustain healthy ecosystems and achieve the climate neutrality goal. They also\u00a0help to improve food security, foster circularity, stimulate rural development and maintain green jobs in EU regions. 3. Bio-based industries transform the way sectors and society work Creating bio-based value chains requires new connections and innovations across multiple and diverse sectors. It also requires involving brand owners\u2019 and citizens\u2019 insights to achieve market up-take and acceptance. That is the uniqueness and the challenge of the European bio-based sector.

The study validates the monitoring system based on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) corresponding to BBI JU\u2019s strategic objectives. It also assesses and validates the results and impacts of the BBI JU project portfolio.\u00a0 \u00a0 A broad projects portfolio meeting their goals The study\u2019s independent expert team has evaluated the results of 50 projects, corresponding to more than one third of the whole BBI JU-funded project portfolio. The report particularly underlines the technical results and the environmental impacts of these projects. In particular, DEMO and FLAG-projects are successfully developing innovative processes and new bio-based products which hold vast commercial potential. The results show their gains in energy-efficiency, as well as their positive impacts on health and on the environment. Lastly, the assessment concludes that the developed products can replace fossil-based products. The study also explains the different stages for KPI validation. Based on empirical evidence, the experts have used a validation methodology to verify the KPIs reported by projects that have ended by July 2020. The results of this validation confirm the reported achievements. The study also found that most BBI JU-funded projects reached their objectives. Developing advanced technology for biomass conversion Throughout their implementation, the BBI JU projects have developed an advanced use of biomass. The study confirms a better use of feedstock residues from the agro-food sector and agriculture. Projects have developed technologies for extraction from raw materials with environmental benefits. The study also notes a better extraction of value-added compounds from biomass and improved processing of biomass that converts pre-treated feedstocks into bio-based chemicals. In the frontline for positive environmental impacts The BBI JU-funded projects are helping to preserve the environment in many ways: they have developed processes and products that alleviate the pressure on natural resources and enable the exploitation of waste and by-products. Moreover, the BBI JU projects are proposing new approaches to farming such as developing the potential of marginal lands.\u00a0All in all, the projects contribute to saving energy, using sustainable biological resources and reducing water consumption. Most significantly, many projects are paving the way for decreasing CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions across Europe. BBI JU-funded projects, a booster for sustainability in Europe and beyond What are the expected socio-economic impacts? BBI JU projects involve many international and European partners with different competences within the bio-based sector, such as primary producers (agricultural, forestry, aquatic, etc.), biochemical industries, technology providers and end-users. By triggering investments and creating jobs, these projects bring a socio-economic contribute to regions. The study also reveals that all projects create knowledge and improve the collaboration between universities and companies, thus paving the way for new insights and partnerships. Most importantly, the study emphasises the creation of new value chains that contribute to supplying sustainable biomass feedstock to the existing value chains. This framework provides effective answers to the market demands. Overall, the projects\u2019 outcomes promote competitiveness, investments and jobs in Europe. In this study, the experts analyse the societal impact of the different types of projects. Research and innovation actions, as well as demonstration actions boost competitiveness through specific measures, such as optimisation of the production processes. Flagship projects are also helping industries to de-risk investments, as well as gain the competitiveness and effectiveness by bringing products to the commercial stage and thus keeping investments in Europe. Contribution to EU policies Similarly, the researchers found that the projects contribute differently to EU policies according to their type of actions. Whilst demonstration actions bring new bio-based products close to market, research and innovation actions are providing knowledge, and the coordination and support actions impact the bio-based community by proposing new infrastructures for equipment and knowledge sharing. On the other hand, the flagship projects scale up and deploy technologies creating new value chains for industrial applications and bio-based consumer products.

Enhancing sustainability and circularity: 75% of projects contribute to waste reduction, reuse, and recycling, while half of them reduce energy consumption and improve land use. While the traditional refineries use non-renewable fossil feedstock like oil, BBI JU biorefineries use mostly waste and by-products of different industries, ensuring circularity of resources. Using sustainable sources: 100% of projects process sustainable feedstock that comes from Europe. Socio-economic impacts Boosting employment: 82% of BBI JU projects result in the creation of new skilled jobs, mainly in rural and coastal areas. Fostering collaboration: 80% report increased cooperation between the different actors along the entire value chain, for instance between academia and the industry. Leveraging investments: BBI JU projects mobilise investments from the private sector, thus benefitting SMEs, universities, research centres, and companies from all over Europe. For \u20ac195 million of BBI JU funding to the first nine flagship projects, the industry\u2019s contribution is \u20ac1.2 billion.

It also presents the actions taken by the partnership to support research and innovation across Europe to fulfil the goals of important policy areas such as the EU\u2019s Circular Economy Action Plan, the Farm to Fork Strategy and the Bioeconomy Strategy.\u00a0Read below some of the ways the BBI JU is contributing to the sustainable circular economy. Using sustainable resources The bio-based industries are largely contributing to the shift from fossil-based to a sustainable economy. In line with the European Commission\u2019s objectives to differentiate economic growth from resource use, the BBI JU is funding projects making this transition possible. 91% of BBI JU-funded projects are using raw materials derived from agricultural sidestreams, waste, and by-products, to produce bio-based ingredients, products and materials. Some projects are researching ways to sustainably exploit agricultural waste, while others focus on forest-based feedstock and use wood residues and waste from pulp and paper industries. For instance, the FIRST2RUN flagship project has developed a technology to produce high-quality oils from the underexploited cardoon plant grown on marginal lands in Europe. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions The bio-based industries also contribute to decarbonising the European economy by developing greener production processes. 58% of the BBI JU-funded projects contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and 53% of them are expecting to reduce energy consumption by using local renewable resources and developing efficient production processes. The first 13 BBI JU-funded flagship projects are expected to save about 600 kT of CO2 emissions per year. For example, the AFTER-BIOCHEM project estimates that their carbon footprint is 81% lower compared to fossil-based equivalents already on the market. Developing environmentally friendly bio-based products For the last years, there has been an increasing demand for sustainable, long-lasting designs using recycled materials. To encourage the bio-based industries to address every phase of the product lifecycle, the European Commission proposed introducing legislation for producer responsibility. The ultimate objective is to achieve climate-neutral production processes. The article underlines the importance of prioritising eco-design for new products to truly achieve a green transition in Europe. In this line of action, the BBI JU-funded projects are working on 232 new bio-based materials to be released by 2024. For the finished projects, 71% of these new materials are biodegradable, and 42% are recyclable. For example, some BBI JU-funded projects are developing biodegradable and recyclable bio-based solutions to replace unsustainable packaging. Many projects are expecting 100% use of bio-based materials such as recyclable polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) derived from leftovers of the food industry. In particular, the RefuCoat project is preparing materials containing PHA for packaging with antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. In addition, the CelluWiz project is investigating alternative packaging solutions to plastics that can be recycled along with paper and cardboard waste. Developing healthy and sustainable food systems While developing new sustainable products and materials for agriculture and industry, BBI JU-funded projects also fight soil and water pollution. Several projects are working on bio-based fertilisers and non-toxic pesticides that are helping farmers to embrace sustainable agriculture. As an example, the BIOVEXO project is developing a biopesticide that will address bacterial pathogens affecting olive and almond orchards in Southern Europe. Concerns over the environmental impact of plant protein importation have prompted the European Commission to increase the supply of EU-grown vegetal proteins. The BBI JU is supporting it with the development of bio-based alternatives. For instance, the FARM\u0178NG flagship project will demonstrate and produce industrial-scale sustainable proteins for fish feed and pet food made of mealworms. Taking the BBI JU achievements to the next level The authors* of the article stress the importance of continuing the public-private partnership in the future to support achieving the goals of the European Green Deal. The Circular Bio-based Europe Joint Undertaking (CBE JU), the successor of BBI JU proposed by the European Commission for the 2021-2027 period, is expected to continue advancing sustainable bio-based industries in Europe. Additionally, it will focus on environmental and biodiversity protection while engaging further with public and private stakeholders to promote more coherent and stable regulation. Lastly, this new partnership will continue to benefit local and coastal regions by creating jobs and integrating primary producers in the bio-based value chains.

BBI JU also provides a unique opportunity to scale-up their technologies, access markets and get recognition, while protecting the ownership of their technologies and know-how. SMEs employ two-thirds of the workforce of the non-financial business sector of the EU. Moreover, they are important drivers for innovation and technology development in the still fragmented bio-based industrial sector in Europe. Consequently, SMEs have also played an essential role in the BBI JU projects since the beginning: 471 is the number of SME beneficiaries in BBI JU projects between 2014 and 2018. In fact, this JU shows an SME participation of 41%, well above the target of 20% established in Horizon 2020. As Carlo Pettinelli, Director for Consumer, Environmental and Health Technologies at the European Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, wrote in the foreword of the study, the high participation of SMEs \u2018is strong evidence of how BBI JU creates opportunities for SMEs to scale-up their technologies, get access to the market and find new business opportunities in the bio-based economy. It is also strong evidence of why SMEs are in fact \u201cunavoidable\u201d enablers for the development of the bio-based sector.\u2019 The analysis shows that SMEs have a prominent and varied role in the bio-based industries, providing specific expertise, innovation and technology development, which makes them essential for the projects and the sector. SMEs are enablers for the generation of new products and processes by generating new knowledge, supplying customised technologies and services for testing, data analysis and validation. BBI JU enables securing funds that are crucial to boost success among SMEs in the bio-based industries field. Moreover, what sets BBI JU apart is the creation of unique opportunities for SMEs to participate, cooperate, develop their knowledge and establish cross-sector connections to find new business opportunities in the bioeconomy. The report consists of two parts: Part I presenting the statistical analysis of SMEs participating in BBI JU projects and Part II showcasing stories and relevant results from SMEs beneficiaries. The findings of this analysis will provide input for the preparation of the SME participation strategy in line with the new EU SME strategy in the context of the European Green Deal.

The\u00a0videos highlight the benefits of participation in BBI JU projects for SMEs. The Vice-Chair of the BBI JU Scientific Committee Johanna Buchert stars in a three-minute-long interview with Euronews explaining why BBI JU is key for the development of the bioeconomy in the EU. In Buchert\u2019s words, BBI JU\u2019s goal of structuring the bio-based sector is central because \u2018it is very crucial to invest in research, but it's also very crucial that the industrial end users are within the research. This is where the BBI Joint Undertaking is the key player. The industry has been there creating the research-need agenda and then the research is answering those needs and putting all this together. I think this is the way how we boost industry in Europe.\u2019 Johana Buchert also highlights that investing in bio-based innovations \u2018has a very good impact on the world because our resources are scarce and there are boundaries in the resources so we really need to invest in research and put that into the industrial scale\u2019. When it comes to de-risking the investment and helping to substitute fossil-based products by bio-based counterparts, Buchert emphasises that this is where BBI JU also plays a key role. Additionally, Euronews also published a TV report about MetGen, a Finnish SME that is a beneficiary in five BBI JU projects: BIOFOREVER, BIOrescue, SWEETWOODS, UNRAVEL and WoodZymes. In this piece, MetGen\u2019s CEO Alex Michine underlines the contribution of BBI JU to the success of the company by stating that \u2018the financial support helped our company to grow from the startup phase to a fully commercial SME. But what is even more important is to have access to the wide collaboration network, including industrial players, to understand what consumers really want.\u2019 Moreover, the laboratories of the company are shown, as well as some of the sustainable bioproducts they produce.

With a total budget of \u20ac 115 million, the 2018 Call is the fifth in a total of seven for the period between 2017 and 2020 and is built around 4 strategic orientations: Feedstock, Process, Products, and Market uptake. The current Call moves away from a strict biomass feedstock \u2018push\u2019 based on historic value chains, towards a demand for biomass that enables processing in order to respond adequately to a \u2018pull\u2019 from the end markets. A total of 21 topics are included in the 2018 Call with 11 Research and Innovation Action (RIA) topics, 3 Coordination and Support Actions (CSA) and 7 Innovation Actions (5 DEMOs and 2 Flagships) while novel eligibility criteria have also been introduced. BBI JU\u2019s current project portfolio is well-balanced between the type of actions and across the value chains having achieved an excellent SME participation of 38% of beneficiaries. Similar to previous Calls, the one of 2018 also respects the Horizon 2020 principles of openness, transparency and excellence. On the occasion of the 2018 Call\u2019s opening Philippe Mengal, BBI JU Executive Director commented: \u2018\u2019All of us in BBI JU, together with our founding partners the European Commission and the Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC) are proud to see the development and the geographical spread of the projects covering all corners of our continent. Every Call is a step closer towards the creation of EU\u2019s bio-based sector and it is exciting to see sectors such as the primary one to start developing such a strong interest and presence on the field.

BBI JU is a public-private partnership (PPP) between the European Commission (EC) and the Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC), the industry-led private not-for-profit organisation representing the private sectors across the bio-based industries. The model of the public-private partnership has been successful as a new approach to supporting research and innovation and de-risking investment in Europe. The BBI JU became a reality in 2014 and represents the largest industrial and economic cooperation endeavour financially ever undertaken in Europe in the area of industrial biotechnologies. It is considered to be one of the most forward-looking initiatives under Horizon 2020 and demonstrates the circular economy in action. The BBI JU will be the catalyst for this strategy to mobilise actors across Europe including large industry, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), all types of research organisations, networks and universities.

The BBI JU Synergy Label is awarded to BBI JU proposals that were deemed to be of high quality but did not receive funding due to budget limits. This certificate should enhance the recognition of the organisations participating in the proposals and facilitate the search by the consortia for alternative source of funding provided by EU organisations, EU Member States and regions or other possible funding organisations. The first BBI Synergy Label awardees are all the Demonstration Action and Flagship proposals included in the reserve list of BBI JU Call 2018. In order to ensure that the recognition of the proposals awarded with the BBI Synergy Label is fully maximised, BBI JU aims at working with different funding organisations. The first example of this effort was\u00a0showcased today during the dedicated R&I Days session, where BBI JU and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the aim of maximising the opportunities of taking up investments in the bioeconomy sector. The MoU will apply in those economies where both organisations have a legal mandate to operate.\u00a0 In the framework of this joint collaboration, the EBRD will be able to review those proposals that meet the screening requirements but do not get access to BBI JU funding, in order to assess the feasibility of their development in conjunction with EBRD financing. Furthermore, on a proposal-by-proposal basis and provided that certain requirements are met, the EBRD will analyse the possibility of proposals to access specific EBRD programmes such as those supporting small and medium businesses and/or higher-risk investments.

Yet, despite exceeding expectations, there is still a lot of potential to be tapped for Europe\u2019s bio-based industries. It is why the Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking (BBI JU) is gathering policy makers, researchers, industry leaders and SMEs as well as farmers and primary producers at their Stakeholder Forum, 7 December at the Square \u2013 Brussels Meeting Centre: to discuss what has been achieved so far and showcase the added value for the European Union, but also to look forward, identify the remaining challenges, and plan for the future. The Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking (BBI JU) was created in 2014 within the EU\u2019s Bioeconomy Strategy and Horizon 2020 framework as a \u20ac 3.7 billion public-private partnership aimed at creating a competitive and sustainable bio-based industry sector in Europe, with \u20ac 975 million coming from the EU and the remaining \u20ac 2.7 billion coming from industry. In 2017, halfway through the programme, an independent evaluation by the European Commission confirms that the BBI JU is on the right track, not just fulfilling the predefined KPIs but achieving high levels of effectiveness, implementation and transparency, an impressive 36% SME participation rate and a 97% satisfaction rate from participating coordinators. This is corroborated by the latest figures produced by Europe\u2019s bio-based industries: not only has the BBI JU target of 5 operational biorefineries by 2020 already been exceeded, on top of that the sector has seen an 11% growth in 2016, and the investment planned by Bio-based Industries Consortium members has risen from \u20ac2 billion in 2014 to \u20ac 5 billion in 2017. \u201cIt is a remarkable evolution\u201d, comments Philippe Mengal, Executive Director of the BBI JU, \u201cfurther illustrated by the fact that we are currently noticing a growing interest from banks and private investors, even from outside the EU. Most of all, it is proof that, through the 65 projects we are funding in 30 countries, the BBI JU is creating unique opportunities for public and private organisations to cooperate, develop their knowledge and establish cross-sector connections to find new ways of valorising Europe\u2019s biomass potential. Effectively, the figures show that BBI JU is successful in organising, structuring as well as shaping new value chains, de-risking private investment and reaching the critical mass needed to create value for Europe and its citizens.\u201d Looking at the future, the BBI JU aims at continuing its structuring and mobilising efforts, creating new markets for bio-based products and enabling the development of a circular and sustainable bio-based European economy, without challenging food production and respecting biodiversity and land use. Challenges include maintaining continuity and stability, key to fully de-risking investment; a higher level of self-sufficiency in terms of biomass supply; and a longer-term commitment of industry, policy makers, thought leaders, brand owners and retailers, needed to fully embed the infrastructure a bio-based economy requires. It is a systemic change which will take time. But, for bio-based industries to make a real and tangible impact on people\u2019s everyday lives, the biggest of challenge of all is perhaps a shift in conscience: to increase public awareness, and instil the idea of bio-based into the hearts and minds of consumers. \u201cThe potential impact of bio-based is clear for everyone to see\u201d, explains Philippe Mengal. \u201cPeople just need to know about it. I always like to make the comparison with the Stone Age: The Stone Age did not end because there were no more stones, but because there was something better. With bio-based industries, it is exactly the same: we are building a bio-based industry that is better for Europe and its citizens, accelerating the shift towards the post-petroleum era.\u201d \u00a0", "url": "https://www.bbi-europe.eu/news/bio-based-industries-europe-building-double-digit-growth"}, {"id": "BBI_NEWS_0057", "date": "2019-09-18", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Ronja Holopainen wins the BBI JU EUCYS 2019 prize!", "text": "The young scientist Ronja Holopainen (19 years-old, Finland) is the winner of the EUCYS Bioeconomy Prize sponsored by the Bio-based Industries Joint Undertaking (BBI JU).

The name of the winner was announced during the final ceremony hosted in Sofia, Bulgaria, on 17 September, where the BBI JU Head of Programme Eleni Zika presented the award. BBI JU has been sponsoring the EUCYS Bioeconmy Prize since 2016. EcoMe is a reusable, ecological and affordable menstrual pad aimed for developing regions. The path to the final product has been an interdisciplinary one. In the first place, Ronja conducted a survey in three Asian countries (Mongolia, Azerbaijan and China) on the preferences towards menstruation of the local girls and women. These results were used to establish the limitations and preferences of women in developing countries, which Ronja used to design the bioproduct. An average woman uses over 11,000 disposable menstrual hygiene products during her lifetime.\u00a0 On the contrary, the bio-based menstrual pad created by Ronja is completely reusable. It is made of silicone and sea sponge and affordable for women in developing countries. The sea sponge has been deliberately selected because of its proprieties of absorbance, drying time and cleansing. In this way, this Finnish student wants to create a global impact on both ecology and women healthcare. On top of that, Ronja has developed EdMe, a smartphone app with scientific knowledge about puberty, menstruation, contraception and other aspects of sexual health and rights.

Now, thanks to new bio-based technologies, its value for producers can be increased by up to 50 times! Far from science fiction, this is just one example of the potential of bio-based industries. By creating new biochemicals and bioplastics out of biomass, they could generate extensive advantages for the European economy in general, agriculture in particular, its citizens as well as environment. Millions of jobs already created, and billions of euros invested: that is what the bio-based industries are all about. Furthermore, it is proof that the Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking, a partnership between the European Union & the private sector, is effectively acting as a catalyst for sustainable bio-based industries in Europe. In Europe every year, millions of tonnes of sugar beet pulp are only re-used as low-value products like animal feed and fertilizer, or are processed into green gas. However, thanks to new cutting-edge extraction techniques, this pulp can now be transformed into high-value components used in sports equipment, automotive parts or even in the aviation industry, increasing its current worth by up to 50 times! This is not a distant dream, but the concept of the very real PULP2VALUE project: 1 of 65 highly innovative projects funded by the \u20ac3.7 billion-worth Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking, aimed at a more sustainable, environmentally friendly growth. At a time when demands for greener products and a more circular economy are ever growing, bio-based industries in many ways hold the key to our European future. Not only will they massively contribute to decarbonisation and the reduction of our fossil-based dependence through a better and more efficient use of local natural resources; in doing so, they also hold a vast economic potential. In 2014, the bio-based industries already employed 3.3 million people in Europe, a number set to grow even further with the expected creation of an extra 400,000 skilled jobs by 2020 \u2013 80% of which will be in rural areas! On top of that, the exploitation of by-products and crops like thistles, dandelions and flax will allow farmers across Europe to diversify and grow their income, as well as boost the development of local economies. \u201cAs confirmed in the independent interim evaluation report produced by an independent group of experts for the European Commission, the BBI JU is successful in bringing together actors from different countries and different sectors, combining knowledge and joining forces to attract consistent private investment\u201d, Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking Executive Director Philippe Mengal declares. \u201cBy the end of 2016 already, every euro invested by the EU was leveraging \u20ac2.6 of private investment: proof that the BBI JU is actively boosting European economy.\u201d The BBI JU was created with the aim of acting as a catalyst for the development of a bio-based European economy. Central to this is the biorefinery \u2013 scaling up novel bio-based processes to treat all kinds of organic waste and side-streams & transforming them into high value products and ingredients. In order to fulfil its mission, it is crucial for the BBI JU to keep promoting research and innovation across whole value chains, overcoming fragmentation and bringing together key stakeholders to further de-risk investment, ultimately establishing and organising new value chains and allowing for the creation of innovative and new sustainable business models. \u201cWe are key to shaping the bio-based sector as a business community which provides the basis for a strong bio-based economy in Europe.\u00a0 At our Stakeholder Forum in The Square Brussels Meeting Centre on 7 December, we will bring that community together to share best practices, look towards the next phase in the initiative and witness the work of the projects already begun.\u201d, Philippe Mengal concludes. \u201cIt is only by joining public and private forces that we will be able to turn Europe not just into a pioneer but the worldwide leading player in all things bio-based, allowing us to conquer a global market share\u2026 On the way to creating sustainable competitiveness for Europe, and value for its citizens.\"", "url": "https://www.bbi-europe.eu/news/bio-based-industries-european-growth-our-nature"}, {"id": "BBI_NEWS_0062", "date": "2019-09-12", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "BBI JU Stakeholder Forum 2019 - Register now!", "text": " We are pleased to inform you that\u00a0registration for the next\u00a0BBI JU Stakeholder Forum\u00a0is open! \u00a0 The #BBISF19 will take place on\u00a04 December 2019 in Brussels.

This is a public-private partnership, based in Brussels, set up to implement a joint technological initiative to support the bioindustries sector in Europe. Bioindustries are organised into value chains and are involved in one or more steps of the process, from the supply of biomass to its transformation into high-added-value products and its commercialisation. The members of this association are the European Commission and the bioindustry sector, represented by the Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC). These members have pledged to contribute 3,700 million euros in both private investments and as funding for research and innovation projects using public and private resources. For this, during the period 2014-2020, there will be an annual call for proposals in which consortia formed by companies, research centres, and other associations will present their projects in an open and transparent competition. The annual work plan is proposed by the industry in agreement with the European Commission, according to the priorities identified in its research and innovation agenda (SIRA). It is undoubtedly a unique opportunity for the European bioindustry sector to grow and gain support, helping it overcome many of its current challenges and positioning it as a world leader.

The last one is the first BBI JU flagship biorefinery in France, which will produce animal feed from mealworms on an industrial scale. Announcing the start of these new projects, Philippe Mengal, BBI JU\u2019s Executive Director commented: \u2018All of us in BBI JU, together with our founding partners the European Commission and the Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC), are excited to see these 18 new projects starting. Once again, these consortia bring together primary production and processing industries, consumer brands, SMEs, research and technology centres and universities, demonstrating BBI JU\u2019s ability to connect previously unconnected actors so they can successfully scale up and commercialise bio-based products. Today, as we celebrate 100 projects in our portfolio, we can be very proud of the fact that our projects continue to address key gaps in the deployment of the bio-based industries and are delivering concrete results, bringing the bio-based products closer to EU citizens.\u2019 The BBI JU projects are funded under the European Commission\u2019s Horizon 2020 programme and bring together researchers from several European centres of excellence \u2013 companies, research institutes or universities \u2013 to develop new technologies and products, and bring them to maturity or even commercial level. The bio-based sector can work more coherently through measures that bring in feedstock suppliers as partners in the value chains, develop biorefinery technologies and processes, raise business-to-business demand, and promote customer awareness about innovative bio-based products and applications.

The project is giving added-value to the mushroom compost that was usually underutilised. Every year the European Union produces more than 1 million tonnes of mushrooms. But there is a downside to this production: every tonne of mushrooms needs three tonnes of compost that is underutilised or thrown away after the harvest. The BBI JU BIOrescue project is focussing on solving this challenge that affects the logistics and the economic performance of mushroom growers. Mushroom compost is a valuable biomass that can be transformed into many bio-based products. The aim of the BIOrescue project is \u2018to use the compost and create much higher value applications that are incredibly useful for society\u2019, in the words of the chief executive of Monaghan Biosciences, MBio. The BBI JU-funded project has already successfully demonstrated the production of bio-based pesticides. Besides, Spain\u2019s National Renewable Energy Centre, CENER, is leading the research to develop bio-based fertilisers and bio-based nano-carriers for drugs. The biopesticides can \u2018attack specific species of diseases, whereas with traditional insecticides you eliminate a large part of the insects that are in the field\u2019, CENER biologist Irantzu Alegr\u00eda says. --- Watch the Euronews video report\u00a0here.

The majority of BBI JU\u2019s projects reported a contribution to the SDG 12 \u2018Responsible Consumption & Production\u2019, SDG 13 \u2018Climate Action\u2019, and SDG 9 \u2018Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure\u2019. A high number of projects also mentioned their contribution to the SDG 8 \u2018Decent Work & Economic Growth\u2019, and SDG 3 \u2018Good Health & Well-Being\u2019. The European Union\u2019s sustainable development strategy includes the 17 SDGs defined by the UN as the targets to reach by the end of 2030. This study shows how the BBI JU granted projects contribute to the SDGs mainly by promoting sustainable industrialisation and sustainable economic growth. Other key contributions are the replacement of fossil-based products and improving the opportunities to feed the world under challenging climatic conditions. The report also reflects how the BBI JU projects create new jobs in rural areas while preserving the biodiversity and the beauty of nature. This study details the contribution of different types of BBI JU actions to the relevant SDGs. The flagship biorefinery projects are contributing to a large extent to promoting sustainable agriculture and energy consumption. At the same time, flagship projects are combating desertification, land degradation and the loss of biodiversity in areas where biorefineries are located. For instance, the\u00a0LIGNOFLAG\u00a0flagship project is contributing to the SDG 13 \u2018Climate Action\u2019 by producing bio-based ethanol that is expected to reduce the CO2 emissions up to 95%, compared to its fossil-based equivalents. When it comes to BBI JU Demonstration Actions, an illustrative example is the contribution of the\u00a0Dendromass4Europe\u00a0project to SDG 12 \u2018Responsible Consumption and Production\u2019. The project is developing an effective and sustainable way of using natural resources for the packaging industry while adding value to forestry resources without burning or mulching them.

The BBI JU\u00a0widening participation strategy intends to increase the participation of member states, associated countries, regions and stakeholders in the initiative to leverage the full EU bio-based potential. The study\u00a0\u201cBioeconomy development in EU Regions\u201d published by the European Commission (DG RTD), demonstrates the direct link between the high participation of a certain country in the BBI JU and the presence of clusters. Clusters are closer to territories and can make the necessary link between the regions and the bioeconomy / the BBI JU initiative. Moreover, clusters are instrumental to leverage the participation of SMEs in the Bioeconomy. The\u00a0SCAR BSW\u00a0aims at facilitating informal exchanges between MSs on regional, national and European activities; at implementing strategies and on encouraging research and innovation (e.g. needs, hurdles, challenges, organisational matters etc.) in the broad area of the Bioeconomy. BSW\u2019s ambition is to be the central platform in Europe overseeing different initiatives at national and European level and to translate this into conclusions on actions. The specific\u00a0objective\u00a0of the workshop was\u00a0to stimulate interest in creating regional bioeconomy clusters in regions and countries which are less active in the bioeconomy and bio-based sectors via an exchange of knowledge and experiences in developing such clusters. The\u00a0final aim\u00a0of the workshop was\u00a0to foster support for the bioeconomy in general and for increased participation in the BBI JU Initiative of underrepresented countries, including SMEs. The workshop brought together 83 experts and representatives of bioeconomy related clusters, SRG delegates, SCAR BSW members, BIOEAST2 members and policy makers at national and regional level to discuss the key elements for cluster development and their role in supporting the bioeconomy. Participants included a relevant participation of representatives from countries which are currently less active.

The SIRA identifies the activities needed to speed up the development of sustainable and competitive bio-based industries in Europe. SIRA reflects BIC\u2019s ambition to transform Europe in to a world leading bioeconomy. The updated SIRA addresses the technological and innovation challenges facing the bio-based industries, takes a \u2018multi-value-chain\u2019 approach and integrates new feedstocks such as aquatic-based sources, bio-waste (including from food processing) and CO2. It also considers the aims of BIC\u2019s newest members, as well as technology and market developments since the first Agenda was adopted in 2013. The SIRA identifies the research and innovation actions needed to deliver tangible and increasingly ambitious environmental, social and economic benefits by 2020 and 2030. Bio-based value chains are at the heart of the SIRA, which is founded on four key pillars: Fostering a supply of sustainable biomass feedstock for both existing and new value chains Optimising efficient processing for integrated biorefineries through research, development and innovation (R&D&I) Developing innovative bio-based products for identified market applications Creating and accelerating market uptake of bio-based products and applications John Bell, Director for Bioeconomy, DG Research & Innovation, European Commission said, \u201cThe latest SIRA is designed to attract new industrial sectors and stimulate closer collaboration between different industries. It envisages the creation of novel value chains, making it easier for the Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking (BBI JU) to fully support the development of a circular bioeconomy, while enabling Europe to achieve its climate goals and the objectives of the Juncker Plan \u2013 to boost investment, sustainable growth and job creation.\u201d Mat Quaedvlieg, Vice President Strategic Business Projects at Sappi, and Chair of the BIC and BBI JU Governing Boards said, \u201cSince the start of the BBI JU, new value chains have emerged using feedstocks from the food processing sector, the aquatic - based sector, and even bio - waste and CO2. More and more industrial sectors are collaborating on BBI JU projects, seizing the opportunity to create value from waste and side streams.

During the final ceremony of the EUCYS held in Brussels on September, 19, his project \u2018ACETOBACTER SPP. BACTERIA PRODUCING BIOPOLYMERS SIMULTANEOUSLY\u2019 was selected by an international jury as an outstanding example of bio-based research developing a new generation of biopolymers for a more sustainable future. Modestas expressed his delight at being selected by the judges for the novel concpet behind his project and in his scientfic approach to conducting the experiments. Bio-based polymers, or biopolymers, can replace fossil oil-based plastics. The production route, based on the synchronous production of cellulose and a biopolymer called PHB (polyhydroxybutyrate), that he developed can play a role in enhancing product efficiency while offering opportunities to reduce its carbon footprint and environmental impact. The jury report refers Gudauskas\u2019 research, which aims to obtain bacteria capable of synthesizing both cellulose and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) by transforming cellulose producting Acetobacteraceae bacteria, as a very promising idea. The 18-year old student transferred genes originated from another bacteria species (Ralstonia eutropha) responsible for PHB biosynthesis, thus creating a bacteria able to produce both biopolymers simultaneously. Jurors were impressed by the way the experiments were implemented. The project was chosen out of a total of 91 submissions from 38 countries across Europe including contributions from Russia, Belarus, South Korea, the USA, Canada, and Israel.

The Bioeconomy prize in the food area will be sponsored by the Food and Drink Association.\u00a0 The winning Bioeconomy non-food project\u00a0should reflect three key principals of the bio-based economy in using raw material of a biological origin, for example whole or parts of plants, trees, algae, marine organisms, micro-organisms, animal in a way which is: sustainable renewable innovative The winning project will also meet a fourth criteria based on the effectiveness of its overall communicability to the scientific community and the general public. The winning project should promote scientific studies, while raising environmental awareness, and promote the bioeconomy. The\u00a0prize will be awarded by BBI who will provide a paid 4-day trip to Brussels for the winning project to include travel to/from and accommodation in Brussels\u00a0and to participate in a tailor-made experience related to the science behind the BBI programme. The prize awarded will comprise:\u00a0\u00a0 a visit and introduction to the Bio-based Industries Joint Undertaking programme office\u00a0 a visit to some of the key public institutions shaping European bio-based policy, including the European Parliament\u2019s visitor centre and a look behind the scenes at the European Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for research and innovation three one-day visits to the bio-based biorefineries and laboratory facilities based in: Gent (Belgium) Reims Pomacle Bazancourt (France) Biotech Pilot Plant in Delft (The Netherlands) the possibility to visit local tourist sites in the relevant locations, where the itinerary permits.\u00a0\u00a0 During each one-day excursion, a range of age-appropriate supervised activities will be organised, along with an opportunity to meet and talk to the scientists working there about their research and a career in science. There may also be an opportunity to visit a few tourist attractions during the stay. The prize will be awarded to the winning project (up to a maximum of three participants) and one teacher/lecturer\u00a0(who has made a significant & demonstrable contribution to the wining project), to be nominated by winners to accompany them.

This fourth call for proposals is expected to further enhance the EU\u2019s deployment of its industrial, research and renewable resources\u2019 potential. Philippe Mengal, BBI JU\u2019s Executive Director commented: \u2018\u2019BBI JU has set the cornerstones for the development of a competitive and sustainable EU bio-based sector and the 2017 Call is another step towards that. We are proud to see here today an overwhelming number of potential applicants, as well as policy-makers and stakeholders\u2019\u2019.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 This Call attracts interest from a diverse range of actors, investors and organisations that see real opportunities to create value from waste, side streams, innovative new biomass like aquatic and bio-waste, and CO2. Most importantly they see the potential to capitalise on expert technical know-how here in the EU. The 2017 Call moves towards solutions for current and strategic problems in Europe in feedstock supplies, optimised processing for integrated biorefineries, innovative bio-based products for identified market applications and market uptake of these applications at commercial level. Dirk Carrez, Executive Director of the Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC), the private partner in the BBI Joint Undertaking, stated: \u2018\u2019We observe a significant mobilisation of private investment in Europe due to BBI JU projects. Not only are we managing to keep innovation and investments in Europe, but we even attract such projects from outside the EU. Our common efforts have sent out a strong signal and we can clearly see the positive response\u2019\u2019. Primary production and processing industries, consumer brands, SMEs, research and technology centres and universities used the opportunity to build networks, demonstrating BBI JU\u2019s ability of bring together previously unconnected actors. John Bell, Director for Bioeconomy with the Directorate-General for Research and Innovation at the European Commission, commented: \u2018\u2019Since its first Call in 2014, BBI JU has proved its key role in bringing together previously fragmented sectors to ensure fruitful collaborations along the entire bio-based value chain. Building on the 2016 priorities, the new topics of the 2017 Call will cover all types of actions ensuring that results are translated into concrete added value for our citizens. I am confident that with our common efforts we will bring the EU\u2019s research and innovation priorities to the forefront with new products, new services, new markets, and new horizons for the bio-based industries in Europe.\u2019\u2019 The deadline for submission of proposals to the BBI JU 2017 Call is 7 September 2017, 17:00 CET.

Speaking as Chair of the Agri-Food Chain Coalition (AFCC), Alexander D\u00f6ring, Secretary General of the European Feed Manufacturers' Federation (FEFAC) said, \"Policy makers cannot ignore the EU agri-food sector's need to stay at the forefront of technological innovation, in order to provide solutions for the agricultural and food security challenges ahead. Regulatory measures should encourage investment. We need to bring new products to market, and ensure that there are fewer regulatory hurdles to doing so. We must strive to remain competitive on the global market.\" During the debate on \u2018Smart Regulation & Innovation for EU Agriculture\u2019 the AFCC and the Bio-based Industries Joint Undertaking (BBI JU) demonstrated the value of innovation to help improve food security, drive resource efficient and sustainable agriculture, as well as transition towards a bio-based economy. At the same time industry representatives pointed to heavy administrative burdens, costly compliance procedures and dysfunctional regulatory systems as the main disincentives for investment in the EU, and therefore obstacles to EU innovation. \u201cAs the global population rises, satisfying the demand for healthy food and optimal nutrition is one of the biggest challenges facing the world. Technological innovation is a vital part of the solution. Agricultural technologies, in particular, have the potential to make farming more productive and more sustainable,\u201d said MEP Anthea McIntyre who hosted the event. \u201cAgricultural and food industry side streams are commonly used as feed or fertilisers. The Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking aims to explore significant opportunities for further valorisation of such resources into new applications and markets through open calls for proposals,\u201d said Philippe Mengal, Executive Director of BBI JU. \u201cThe BBI JU will also contribute tools for the realisation of a sustainable circular economy and ensure that biomass is mobilised in a sustainable way to avoid land conflicts with food production,\u201d he added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Members of the AFCC and BBI JU are convinced that workable regulatory systems and science-based policymaking are the best guarantees for growth, investment, and innovation in the EU agricultural sector, allowing us to have a productive, sustainable, and resilient agricultural base.

The studies highlight that while the EU Agencies represent less than 0.8% of the EU\u2019s annual budget their contribution has widespread impact at citizen, industry and policy level. The first study analyses the cost-effectiveness of the seven EU Agencies operating to support the Internal Market, and how they reduce the overall costs to taxpayers. The second study focuses on the contribution of 44 Agencies and Joint Undertakings to the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Juncker Commission Agenda. The studies will be discussed today and tomorrow during the first EU Agencies Forum at the European Parliament. Vice-President of the European Parliament, Mairead McGuinness and Kristalina Georgieva, Vice-President of the European Commission, are speakers at the event. Ant\u00f3nio Campinos, Executive Director of the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) which is currently Chair of the EU Agencies Network, said: \u201cThe EU Agencies are the familiar face of the EU for many Europeans, delivering essential services on the ground for a relatively small proportion of the overall EU budget - less than 0.8%, to be exact. In other terms, they cost \u20ac1.23 euros per EU citizen. The cost-benefit ratio is hence very positive, and as the EU Parliament study has shown, agencies save national administrations many millions every year, by delivering synergies and preventing duplication of efforts in each Member State.\" Agencies are cost effective and save money Overall, the 2015 budget of the EU Agencies represents less than 0.8% of the EU\u2019s annual budget (about \u20ac1.2 billion), while creating significant efficiencies and delivering value for EU citizens across a wide range of policy areas, according to a report by Deloitte. A second report commissioned by the European Parliament estimates that it would cost Member States up to \u20ac200 million a year to assume the tasks currently done by just seven of the 45 agencies. Agencies are close to EU citizens and businesses As well as supporting the top political priorities of the European Union, EU Agencies play an important role in many other aspects of the everyday life of citizens: in disease prevention and control, security and defence, education and knowledge, stability of the financial systems, and in the fields of digital connectivity or transport, among others. In 32 cities across 24 Member States, EU Agencies work to improve the EU industry and citizens\u2019 lives in many ways. For example: - Frontex, the European Border and Coastguard Agency, currently deploys some 1 200 officers at EU\u2019s external borders and has helped to rescue more than 89 000 people at sea so far this year; - The European Asylum Support Office currently deploys over 300 staff in around 20 locations in Italy and Greece. They are working to support the implementation of the EU Relocation Programme and EU-TR Statement. EASO has an important role in better managing the Common European Asylum System; - In 2015, Europol, the EU\u2019s law enforcement agency, supported more than 40,000 investigations against terrorism and serious crime; - The EU\u2019s Intellectual Property Office\u2019s study on the economic contribution of Intellectual Property Rights shows that IPR intensive industries in the EU now support directly or indirectly 38% of jobs and 42% of the EU\u2019s GDP; - Since 2010, the European Institute of Innovation & Technology (EIT) has created Europe\u2019s largest innovation community, helped set up 32 innovation hubs across Europe, and supported the creation of more than 200 innovative start-ups and entrepreneurship training for 2,000 students and graduates; - From 2014-2020 the Bio-based Industries Joint Undertaking is administering \u20ac3.7bn investments in bio-based innovation and will be funding more than 200 cooperative projects through cross-industry clusters; - The EMCDDA (EU drugs agency in Lisbon), monitors over 560 new psychoactive substances through an EU Early Warning System. Where required, it assesses the risks of these substances to public health in Europe; - The European Medicines Agency has recommended over 1000 new medicines for the treatment of patients. In addition to monitoring approved medicines, it also addresses the challenges holding back the development of new medicines, including new antibiotics. The two studies on EU Agencies and Joint-Undertakings The first study on \u201cThe Cost of Non-Agencies with Relevance to the Internal Market\u201d was requested by the Budget Committee of the European Parliament and prepared by the Centre for Strategy & Evaluation Services (link). It shows that the Agencies reduce the overall costs to taxpayers. This report is a snapshot covering just seven agencies: - The European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO); - The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA); - The European Medicines Agency (EMA); - The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA); - The European Banking Authority (EBA); - The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA); - The European Insurance & Occupational Pensions (EIOPA). The report shows that it is significantly more cost effective to perform a task once at EU level than to replicate it 28 times at national level. The second study on \u201cHow do EU Agencies and Bodies contribute to the Europe 2020 strategy and to the Juncker Commission Agenda?\u201d was commissioned by the EU Agencies Network from the consultants Deloitte. It looks at how the EU agencies and bodies contribute to the Europe 2020 strategy and the Juncker Agenda. The EU Agencies Network The 45 decentralised Agencies and Joint Undertakings of the EU closely interact and cooperate within the EU Agencies Network, a pan-European network, set up by the Heads of EU Agencies, as a collective voice for the Agencies to coordinate, exchange information and agree common positions of shared interest.

Yet compared to investment in largescale biorefineries and the deployment of bio-based production in North America, Brazil or China, Europe lags behind.\u00a0 These nations have extensive biomass resources and are benefitting from R&D-investment programmes and strong political impetus for the bioeconomy. Europe has the potential to compete, but only if public and private enterprises, working across sectors, establish commercial value chains. This way Europe can be leaders in certain bio-based industries and value chains. The BBI JU programme is designed to allow applicants to exploit possible synergies with national and regional bioeconomy funding and financing. Regions can encourage industrial investment through coherent smart specialisation strategies that leverage structural funds. These large-scale and long-term private investments will attract more industry. The joint undertaking is the catalyst for the European Union and bio-based industries to align their strategies. The BBI funds research into technologies at different levels of maturity.\u00a0 In some cases, it aims to bridge the gap where technologies are underdeveloped or sufficiently efficient to deploy commercially. We also support demonstration and flagship projects for mature technology where large-scale value needs to be demonstrated. As a pan-European programme, the BBI JU is inclusive, engaging with member states and associated countries, regions and areas with strong potential for developing bio-based industries. The objective now is to widen their involvement the programme to realise the EU's full potential.\u00a0 As European regions and cities increasingly see the benefits of a local bioeconomy, they will become increasingly important. The 2017 scientific priorities were set by the Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC) and the European Commission in collaboration with BBI JU. This followed wide consultation targeting bio-based industries, universities, Research and Technology Offices, European Technology Platforms and European industry associations as well as inputs from BBI JU's advisory bodies. These priorities place an emphasis on new functionalities and on better realising the expected impacts. These impacts include increasing awareness, acceptance and increased societal confidence in bio-based products and industries, improving end-consumers engagement in the bioeconomy. The bio-based industry is underpinned by nature. Biomass is the best way to transform, reuse and recycle carbon dioxide. Nevertheless, the path to 2020 demands accelerating development of new, sustainable value chains, including biomass feedstock supply, efficient processing that move towards acceptance and application of bio-based products in end-markets. Biomass feedstock suppliers urgently need to be integrated at the start of the supply chain to sustain demand from bio-refining processes.\u00a0 Furthermore we need to invest in building the partnerships and infrastructure that integrates bio-based industries across sectors. This will stimulate partnerships with end-markets creating a 'market pull' for bio-based products. This way, European citizens will feel the benefits of the bio-based economy to the environment and society.

The PPPs, all partnerships between the European Union, industries and (in some cases) Member States, are presenting their activities and successes in the European Parliament during the European Innovation Summit. The results demonstrate the added value of the PPP model and explain why two new PPPs have been set up more recently in the fields of bio-based products and rail. A number of PPPs (also known as Joint Undertakings or JUs), were set up in 2007-2008 to drive innovation in key industrial sectors, namely aviation (Clean Sky and SESAR), electronic components & systems (ENIAC and ARTEMIS, which subsequently merged to create ECSEL), health (IMI), and fuel cells and hydrogen for transport & energy solutions (FCH). Since their launch, these pioneering partnerships have more than demonstrated their ability to deliver results that are both scientifically excellent and have practical applications in areas that are vital to Europe\u2019s competitiveness. Now, the PPPs are starting to demonstrate clear socio-economic benefits. In the aviation world, Clean Sky is delivering the large demonstrators resulting in significant pollution and noise level reductions. In some cases, these technologies \u2013 for instance, new engines, structures, aerodynamics, on-board energy systems and avionics \u2013 are already being integrated into products. For its part, SESAR is delivering a catalogue of solutions to modernise European air traffic management, ensuring the sustainability of European air travel and aviation. A first set of solutions is already in the pipeline for Europe-wide deployment. In the longer term, deployment of SESAR solutions is expected to result in a system capable of handling up to 100% more traffic with increased safety, while reducing departure delays by 30% and CO2 emissions by 10%. When it comes to electronic components and systems, ECSEL\u2019s forerunners, ARTEMIS and ENIAC, are delivering results with a significant impact. For example, one award-winning project developed a best-in-class leadership technology to reduce energy losses by up to 40% in energy generation, distribution and utilisation by manufacturing power electronics devices on silicon wafers thinner than paper. This technology leveraged a private investment of \u20ac250 million in Dresden. According to industry data, the FCH JU has sparked investments across the fuel cells and hydrogen industry, resulting in significant leverage: almost 60% out of 150 organisations sampled have increased their research and development expenditures/budgets thanks to the FCH JU. In the health sector, IMI projects are delivering tools to speed up drug development, particularly in challenging areas such as brain disorders, diabetes, and antimicrobial resistance. They are also helping to reduce the use of animals in medical research and establishing new research resources, networks and infrastructures. IMI is catalysing unprecedented levels of collaboration between the private and public sectors. By definition, all PPPs are leveraging significant levels of research funding from industry and, in some cases, Member States. They have also proven to be an asset for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which account for a large number of JU project participants. Building on the successes of these older initiatives are two new PPPs set up in 2014. BBI JU (which is also involved in the European Innovation Summit) is working in the bio-based industries and materials sector. Its expected socio-economic impacts include reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, the creation of jobs (primarily in rural areas) and new, profitable uses for waste and industrial streams. In the rail sector, Shift2Rail brings together key stakeholders in the rail sector with the goal of doubling the capacity of the European rail system and increasing its reliability and service quality by 50%, whilst halving lifecycle costs. Some challenges facing Europe and the world today are simply too great for any single company, organisation or country to succeed alone. Europe\u2019s PPPs excel at bringing together partners from universities, large industry, SMEs, and other stakeholder groups to create innovation-driven research communities focused on addressing these challenges. The results presented at the European Innovation Summit show that the PPP model is successful and can deliver significant socio-economic impacts.

The project MACRO CASCADE has received a \u20ac4,2 million funding from the Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking (BBI JU) under the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the grant agreement No 720755. The main objective of the project is to prove the concept of the cascading marine macroalgal biorefinery. This is a production platform that covers the whole technological value chain for processing sustainable cultivated macroalgae biomass \u2013 also known as seaweed - to highly processed value added products such as health promoting feed and food supplements (with documented effect on immune system on both animals and humans), prebiotics, antibiotic agents, anionic polymers, and chemicals for paint, cosmetic and detergent formulations. Sustainable, large-scale cultivation of seaweed is under-exploited in Europe. Directed efforts in utilising the same biomass for multiple value added streams can lead to products within food, feed, nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals. The waste streams can be utilised as fertilizer and biofuel products. The project brings together specialists along the entire seaweed value chain, from seaweed cultivation up to product testing, to establish and evaluate macroalgal biorefining on a lab, pilot, and conceptual scale for feasibility, bioeconomy impact, and sustainable full utilization of the biomass. The consortium consists of 13 partners from seven countries in Europe. These include major industry companies Novozymes (Denmark) and Cargill Nordic A/S (Belgium), pioneering companies within seaweed cultivation (Ocean Rainforest, Faroe Islands; Hortimare, Norway) and policy landscaping of macroalgae production (eCoast, Belgium), innovative protein feed producer Fermentation Experts in Denmark, and established research organisations such as The Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN) and Wageningen Research, also of the Netherlands, the Danish Technological University, Silkeborg Regions Hospital (Denmark), MATIS in Iceland, and Lund University in Sweden.

The BBI JU presented the potential for the bio-based industries in a range of everyday bio-based products. From dandelion tyres to dresses made from milk fibres, bio-degradable compostable shopping bags to high performance bio-ethanol, BBI JU proved that greener production methods and processes offer real progress towards the reality of a bio-based economy. During the event, BBI JU showcased some novel products which demonstrate advances being made in Europe in developing and scaling up the technologies needed to transform Europe\u2019s bio-based sector. Philippe Mengal, Executive Director of the BBI JU, stated: \u201cWe have already now with us and hopefully even more in the future everyday life products, \u2018greener\u2019 products that all EU citizens can use in their daily life! In BBI JU we are proud to work towards building a strong and competitive bio-based sector in Europe.\u201d BBI JU was accompanied at the event by four of its projects which are a great example of putting new technologies into practice for the first time in Europe. Flagship projects like BIOSKOH, EXILVA and FIRST2RUN, together with demonstration project PULP2VALUE exhibited their products and explained their specific added-value to all the participants. With a total of 36 ongoing projects since its first Call in 2014, the BBI JU has established itself as the catalyst for the development of bio-based industries. Reaching out to industry innovators in an inclusive way, the new projects do not only improve cooperation between different economic sectors but also pave the way for additional benefits to both EU public and industrial sectors. Contributing to the topic of the conference, 'The role of regions in the European Bioeconomy', the BBI JU and its projects show the bioeconomy strategy in action, and demonstrates how sustainable regional development can be combined with industry smart regional bioeconomy strategies. With innovation and education at the heart of its 'walking exhibition', the projects are a clear example of the novel ideas and processes BBI JU aspires to establish in Europe. Having recently added 23 new projects to its portfolio over the summer, BBI JU is helping to bring about the shift to a strong European bioeconomy. Public-private funding through the BBI JU is made available to projects developing innovative research methods and importantly on disseminating them. 3 out of the 23 new projects fall under Coordination and Support Actions (CSAs) and will elaborate \u201cdidactic\u201d and awareness-raising actions. John Bell, Director for Bioeconomy with the Directorate-General for Research and Innovation at the European Commission, commented: 'We are excited to see the launch of projects that support Coordination and Support Actions. This means that their research activities and industrial processes will be communicated and explained, bringing the potential of the sector closer to the end users, the EU citizens. The EU does not only innovate but makes sure that our citizens are at the center of it:\u2019. With strong industry commitment and support for the BBI JU, represented by the Bio-Based Industries Consortium (BIC), the growing BBI JU project portfolio represents the step changes being made in the way large industry invests in the European bioeconomy. Dirk Carrez, Executive Director of the Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC), the private partner in the BBI Joint Undertaking, stated: \u201cThe start of the 23 additional projects signals an important step for the development of the bio-based industries. It is the first time that we witness the creation of projects operating across different value chains which proves the great potential of the European bio-based industries working successfully across vastly different and mostly unconnected different sectors including agriculture, forestry, chemical industry and waste management.\u201d", "url": "https://www.bbi-europe.eu/news/bbi-ju-showcases-novel-bio-based-products-bratislava-bioeconomy-conference"}, {"id": "BBI_NEWS_0118", "date": "2016-04-01", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "New Flagship topic added to updated Annual Work Plan", "text": "The Annual Work Plan (AWP) and associated budget has been updated and BBI JU\u2019s Governing Board has agreed to add an additional flagship topic under the 2016 Call for proposals, bringing forward unallocated funds from BBI JU\u2019s 2015 budget.

The package is set to tackle some of the EU\u2019s major societal challenges and boost growth and jobs through strategic public-private partnerships, especially through the new one on Bio-Based Industries (BBI). Other public-private partnerships are: Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Clean Sky 2 Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Electronic Components & Systems (ECSEL) The BBI will create new jobs, especially in rural regions, and offer Europeans new and sustainable products sourced and produced locally. Making the economy more sustainable by using renewable resources in a smart and efficient manner will benefit society as a whole. Bio-based industries will increase the competitiveness of the European economy through re-industrialisation and sustainable growth. New value chains will be created between often unconnected sectors, ranging from primary production and processing industries to consumer brands. The development of new bio-based products and markets based on smart and efficient use of resources will diversify industries\u2019 revenue streams. The BBI should therefore enable European companies to be more competitive in the global bioeconomy race with the US, China and Brazil. The BBI is expected to bridge European research knowledge with commercial scale bio-based products, making full use of European scientific and technological knowledge. The BBI should benefit all Member States where regions can play an important role through their Smart Specialisation Strategies. Now that EU governments have given their green light, the BBI will be officially established on the day of publication of the Regulation in the Official Journal of the European Union, i.e. early- mid-June. The BBI\u2019s first Call for Proposals will be launched on 9 July together with the other Innovation Investment Package initiatives. The BBI will fund projects aimed at: Building new value chains based on the development of sustainable biomass collection and supply systems with increased productivity and improved utilisation of biomass feedstock (incl. co- and by-products); Unlocking the utilisation and valorisation of waste and lignocellulosic biomass; Bringing existing value chains to new levels, through optimised uses of feedstock and industrial side-streams while offering innovative added value products to the market, thus creating a market pull and reinforcing the competitiveness of EU agriculture and forest based industries. Bringing technology to maturity through research and innovation, by upgrading and building demonstration and flagship biorefineries that will process the biomass into a range of innovative bio-based products. About the Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking The Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking is a \u20ac3.7 billion Public-Private Partnership (PPP) between the EU and the Bio-based Industries Consortium (BIC).

Research and innovation are critical to create new, better paid and more durable jobs and sustainable economic growth, to improve quality of life and to boost Europe's global competitiveness. In certain well defined areas, formal partnerships with the private sector and/or with Member States is the most effective way of meeting the objectives of the new EU research and innovation programme Horizon 2020 in terms of major societal challenges and industrial leadership. That is why a series of partnerships under Horizon 2020 with industry and with Member States are being established. What are these partnerships? The public-private partnerships take the form of Joint Technology Initiatives (JTIs). They represent the joining of forces between the EU and industry and provide vital funding for large-scale, longer-term and high risk/reward research. They set out commitments, including financial commitments, over a seven year period from both the EU and from the industry partners. They each have clear objectives which need to be achieved by the Partnerships. JTIs bring together companies, universities, research laboratories, innovative SMEs and other groups and organisations around major research and innovation challenges. They establish their own strategic research and innovation agendas and fund projects selected through open and competitive calls for project proposals. The JTIs are established under Article 187 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and managed by dedicated entities called Joint Undertakings. Six of these JTIs will be initially established under Horizon 2020 as well as a seventh public-private partnership (SESAR) in a different form. Alongside these, four Joint Programmes with EU Member States will be established. These are set up under Article 185 of the TFEU and help EU Member States to integrate and coordinate their own national research programmes to ensure better use of resources. What are the benefits for Europe? Partnerships in research and innovation are powerful and much needed tools to deliver on the objectives of Horizon 2020 for a number of reasons. They address strategic technologies that will underpin growth and jobs in key sectors of a knowledge-based European economy. They make funding more efficient by pooling financial, human and infrastructure resources and they aid in getting innovative technologies faster to the market. They also help make Europe a more attractive location for international companies to invest and innovate. The partnerships contribute to meeting many EU objectives including 3% of GDP invested in R&D and 20% of GDP coming from manufacturing by 2020. The evaluations of the current JTIs show that they attract a high level of industrial participation including that of SMEs, they develop long-term commitments and strategies in research and innovation as well as interdisciplinary approaches to address complex problems. What will these partnerships focus on? Most of the investment will come through six JTIs. In line with the priorities of Horizon 2020, they will address some of the most pressing economic, societal and environmental challenges that Europe and the world are facing. More information about these initiatives can be found in dedicated fact sheets: Clean Sky 2 (CS2): to develop cleaner, quieter aircraft with significantly less CO2 emissions (factsheet) Innovative Medicines 2 (IMI2): to develop next generation vaccines, medicines and treatments, such as new antibiotics (factsheet) Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 (FCH2): to expand the use of clean and efficient technologies in transport, industry and energy (factsheet) Bio-based Industries (BBI): to use renewable natural resources and innovative technologies for greener everyday products (factsheet) Electronics (ECSEL): to boost Europe\u2019s electronics manufacturing capabilities (factsheet and MEMO/13/673) Shift2Rail: to get more passengers and freight onto Europe's railways (MEMO/13/1143) Besides these JTIs, the Parliament also adopted the Commission's proposal to extend the SESAR (Single European Sky ATM Research) project. This is the technical pillar of the Single European Sky initiative, which aims to modernise Air Traffic Management in Europe. The four joint programmes with Member States and their aims are: European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership 2 (EDCTP2): to reduce the social and economic burden of poverty related diseases; The European Metrology Programme for Research and Innovation (EMPIR): to provide new measurement technologies; Eurostars 2: to stimulate growth and job creation by supporting innovative SMEs; Active and Assisted Living Research and Development Programme: to improve the quality of life for the elderly and to increase the sustainability of care systems. Who can participate in these Partnerships? The Joint Technology Initiatives will all run competitive calls which are open to the participation of companies, SMEs, universities, research organisations and others, and where the best projects will be selected for funding through peer review. There are also opportunities for interested organisations to become new members of the Partnerships during the implementation. What will be the budgets of these partnerships? In total, the Innovation Investment Package and related proposals represent an investment of more than \u20ac22 billion into Europe's future. Over the next seven years, the EU's contribution of less than \u20ac9 billion will mobilise more than \u20ac9 billion from the private sector and about \u20ac4 billion from Member States. The six JTIs are expected to mobilise a total investment exceeding \u20ac17 billion, of which the EU budget contribution will be up to \u20ac6.7 billion. How will industry make financial commitments to the Partnerships? The industry partners will make financial contributions in a number of ways depending on the specific nature of the Partnership. Specifically; by contributing to the budgets of the calls for proposals; by financing the activities of the JTI either through funding all or part of its own costs in participating in the projects selected for funding and by financing additional activities outside the calls. In all cases, the partners will also contribute half of the costs of running the Joint Undertaking which will manage the Partnership. Are these partnerships a new idea, will they work? Most of the partnerships were started and proved successful under the 7th research framework programme (2007-2013). The legislative proposals adopted today by the EP are necessary to re-establish the existing initiatives with new objectives and budgets under Horizon 2020 and to set up new ones. All of the current partnerships have been the subject of independent evaluations and the recommendations from these evaluations have been used to improve the new partnerships. How much has the EU spent on existing JTIs? Under the 7th research framework programme, JTIs represented a total EU contribution of \u20ac3.1 billion, matched by an industry investment of \u20ac4.7 billion. From the beginning of activities until February 2014, they account for 663 funded projects in total which had 5081 participants. In general, JTIs have proven to be successful in attracting a high level of industrial participation in their activities, including SMEs who represent about 20% of the participants. What have the current JTIs achieved? JTIs have only been fully operational for a limited time, but they are already having a positive impact. This shows that they can deliver on turning challenges into opportunities. For example, the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen JTI has put in place a significant project portfolio of strategic importance and already introduced some early applications such as forklifts, small back-up power units and new types of hydrogen-powered buses to the market. Technologies developed or under development by the Clean Sky JTI, such as new types of aircraft wing, are estimated to be able to reduce aviation CO2 emissions by more than 20%. The Innovative Medicines Initiative JTI has scored a number of achievements such as discoveries that bring new hope to diabetes sufferers. And research by the ENIAC and ARTEMIS JTIs, which are being merged into the new ECSEL JTI, has resulted, for instance, in drastically higher efficiency of electric vehicles and much greater reliability of electronic systems used in transportation. More information about the successes of the current initiatives can be found in dedicated factsheets. What is new under Horizon 2020? New JTIs are based on the new objectives under Horizon 2020 and build on the successful experience under FP7. The new JTIs represent a higher level of ambition with increased budgets and more challenging objectives in order to increase their impact. They incorporate major simplifications resulting from Horizon 2020 and through the use of simpler financial rules. The industry commitments to the JTIs are significantly higher than in FP7 and include additional activities that will be solely financed by the industry partners, in particular to help ensure the effective deployment of the new technologies. When will the new Partnerships start? The proposals will now need to be formally adopted by the Council of the EU. Five of the seven Joint Undertakings are planning to launch their first calls in July 2014.
